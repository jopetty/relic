{"custom_id":"request-5","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t27\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by looking at the grammar and the string. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single terminal symbol. \n\nThe string I'm checking is \"t27\". Hmm, I notice that each character in the string is a single terminal symbol. So, for the grammar to generate this string, each of these symbols must be directly derivable from a non-terminal symbol. \n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the grammar, I see that the non-terminals are all in uppercase, while the terminals are in lowercase and seem to be 't' followed by numbers. Each production either leads to two terminals or two non-terminals. But for a string with three terminals like \"t27\", the derivation must happen in such a way that each terminal is reached directly or through intermediate steps.\n\nWait, actually, no. In context-free grammars, each production can generate exactly one symbol at a time, right? But wait, no. Each production produces exactly one symbol, which can be a single terminal or a non-terminal. So, for the string to be generated, the entire string must be a sequence of symbols obtained by replacing each non-terminal step by step, possibly through multiple derivations.\n\nWait, but each production is like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So to get a string like \"t27\", which is three terminals, the derivation would have to be a leftmost derivation starting with the start symbol S, and each step replacing non-terminals with pairs of non-terminals or terminals until you get to three terminals.\n\nWait, but the grammar's start symbol S seems to produce two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. So the first step would replace S with NT6 NT58. Then, each of those non-terminals would need to be expanded into terminal symbols or more non-terminals. So for the string \"t27\" to be generated, somewhere along the line, NT6 would have to produce \"t2\" and NT58 would have to produce \"7\", or vice versa, but wait, the string is three letters: t, 2, 7. Wait, no, the string is \"t27\" \u2014 t, 2, 7.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, I need to see if any non-terminals directly produce \"t27\" or if they can be broken down into \"t2\" and \"7\" or something like that. Wait, but all the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, to get \"t27\", which is three terminals, the process would have to be that at some point, a non-terminal expands into two more non-terminals, and then those two each expand into terminals.\n\nSo, let's look at the productions to see if any non-terminal directly produces \"t27\". Looking through the productions, I don't see a rule where any NT directly produces \"t27\". So I need to see if a NT can produce other non-terminals that can in turn produce the required terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t27\" can be obtained by combining the expansions of two non-terminals. Let's look at where \"t27\" might come from. Maybe looking for where NT produce something that leads to \"t27\". Alternatively, perhaps NT9 or NT79 can produce \"t27\" directly.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, let's see which NTs can produce \"t2\". From the list, some NTs produce \"t\" plus something else. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that several NTs have productions involving 't' followed by a number. For example, NT94 \u2192 t77, which is a terminal, same with NT73 \u2192 t25, NT9 \u2192 t26, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can work backwards. Let me see which NTs can directly produce \"t27\", but I don't see any NT with a production ending in \"t27\". So maybe it's impossible because the productions don't have any NTs that can go directly to \"t27\" or to something that can combine to make it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"t27\" can be generated by combining the production of NT58, which is in the first step of the S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Let me see what NT58 produces. Looking at NT58: production is NT9 \u2192 t26, and NT95 \u2192 t67, but wait, the production for NT58 is NT84 NT9, and NT84 is NT34 NT93, and NT34 is NT58 NT65. Wait, this seems recursive and might not resolve into \"t27\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check all possible derivations. Starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58, each of those needs to be expanded into terminals or non-terminals. Let me see what NT6 and NT58 expand into.\n\nLooking at NT6: S \u2192 NT73 NT62. Wait, no, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. But then NT73 and NT62 need to be expanded. NT73 \u2192 t25, so that's a terminal, so NT73 can become t25. NT62 is part of NT84, and NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. Then NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, which seems to create more non-terminals. This might not be the right path.\n\nLooking at NT58: production is NT84 NT9. NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93, and NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84. This seems like a loop and could lead us down an infinite recursion without reaching a terminal. So perhaps NT58 and NT6 can't expand into anything useful that ends with \"t27\".\n\nWait, but maybe looking for a different path. Let me think about other NTs. For example, NT27 \u2192 t4. Wait, that's 't' followed by 4, not 27. Hmm, maybe NT2 \u2192 t70 or t4? Wait, looking up the productions:\n\nYes, NT28 \u2192 t38 t93, but that's 't38' and 't93', which are longer. NT2 \u2192 t70 or t9, depending on the expansion.\n\nWait, maybe it's impossible because none of the NTs directly produce \"t27\" and all the productions that eventually produce terminals seem to only produce single terminals, not combinations like \"t27\". Since each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, you can't get three terminals at once without having the NTs producing more non-terminals.\n\nSo, for \"t27\" to be generated, there must be a sequence of expansions where a NT produces two other NTs, each of which eventually produce a terminal, but when combined, make \"t27\". But given the productions, I don't see any path where a NT can directly or indirectly produce \"t27\" as a combination of two terminals, because all the right-hand sides of the NTs are either non-terminals or single terminals. So, the string \"t27\" has three terminals, so that would require at least two productions that split a non-terminal into two terminals, but I don't see any NT that can be split into \"t2\" and \"7\" or any combination that results in \"t27\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, but the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which allows productions where a single NT is replaced by two NTs or terminals. But each expansion step can only replace one NT at a time, usually the leftmost. So to get three terminals, you'd need a certain number of replacements:\n\n- Start with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nThen, each of those could potentially be expanded:\n\n- NT6 might expand to something that eventually becomes \"t2\" and something else.\n- NT58 might expand to something that eventually becomes \"7\" and something else.\n\nBut looking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 \u2192 t25, which is a single terminal. NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT93. Now, NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65. Then NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84. Again, this seems like an infinite loop.\n\nSame with NT58: it keeps expanding into more non-terminals without reaching a terminal. So it's impossible for either of these to become a terminal. So the leftmost expansion will keep giving more non-terminals, leading to an infinite recursion without ever reaching a terminal. Therefore, the grammar can't generate a string composed of \"t27\", because the only way to get a terminal is through specific NTs that directly produce a single terminal, and in this case, the path after S leads to non-terminals that can't be further reduced to \"t27\".\n\nAnother angle: Maybe looking for NTs that can produce \"t2\" and \"7\" respectively. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t26, which is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-8","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t95` is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember has rules where each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like there are a lot of non-terminals (NT prefixes) and a few terminals which are 't' followed by numbers. Each rule is like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S can produce two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. So the string must start with whatever NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nNow, the target string is just one terminal, 't95'. But S produces two symbols, so the string must be the concatenation of the two symbols from NT6 and NT58. Therefore, the string `t95` would have to be t95 = NT6 Expansion + NT58 Expansion.\n\nSo, both NT6 and NT58 must somehow expand to 't' followed by a number that, when concatenated, forms 't95'. For example, if NT6 produces 't9' and NT58 produces 't5', then together it's 't9t5', but that's not 't95'. Alternatively, maybe NT6 produces 't95' on its own, but wait, looking at the rules, it seems that 't95' is not directly a terminal. Checking the rules, I see that NT69 is 't67' and NT59 is 't96', but I don't see an NT95 rule. Hmm, but there's another rule for NT95: it can be NT9 NT69, which would be 't26' (from NT9 \u2192 't26') and 't67' (from NT69). So NT95 would expand to 't26t67'. But that's not 't95'.\n\nWait, but in the string we're targeting, it's just 't95'. So let's think differently. Maybe NT58 can produce 't5' and NT6 can produce 't9', but I don't see any 't9' or 't5' terminals. Looking at the rules, I see that NT9 \u2192 't26', which is 't' followed by 26\u2014but wait, the string is 't95', which is 't' followed by 95. Looking at the rules, I see NT95 is involved, but it's a non-terminal that branches into others. Wait, looking at NT95, it's defined as NT9 NT69, which is 26 and 67, making 2667, not 95. Similarly, other rules don't directly produce 't95'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT95 rules. Looking at the rules, I see NT95: it's NT19 NT69 and NT95: NT9 NT69, and another NT95: NT56 NT95, and also NT95: NT85 NT66. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Wait, let's check each definition:\n\nNT95 rules:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT19 NT69\n- NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69\n- NT95 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n- NT95 \u2192 NT85 NT66\n\nSo none of these directly produce a terminal. So to get 't95', we must have a way for some of these non-terminals to produce 't95' as a string. Looking again, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait a minute, the rule S \u2192 NT6 NT58 suggests that S produces two symbols. So to get a string of length 1 (just 't95'), that's impossible because S produces two symbols, so the string must be at least length 2, unless one of the non-terminals can somehow produce the entire string. But that's not possible because the terminals are each single characters, and S produces two. So 't95' is length 3. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, the string is `t95`, which is three characters. So each of the two symbols from NT6 and NT58 must produce a string such that their concatenation is t95. So, for example, if NT6 produces 't9' and NT58 produces 't5', that would give 't9t5' which is 't9t5' but that's four characters. Wait, but perhaps NT6 could produce 't95' on its own, but since NT6 can't, because the only rule for NT6 is \u2192 NT73 NT62, which would produce two symbols. So let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step by trying to find a parse tree for 't95'.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo t95 would have to be NT6 Expansion followed by NT58 Expansion. Both must be terminal strings.\n\nLet me look at NT6 and NT58 separately.\n\nStarting with NT6: S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nNT6: the rule is NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nSo NT6 must expand to NT73 NT62.\n\nNow, let's expand each of these:\n\nNT73: The rule is NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nSo NT73 expands to NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8: The rule is NT8 \u2192 NT12.\n\nSo NT8 \u2192 NT12.\n\nNT12: The rules are NT12 \u2192 't12' which is a terminal. So NT12 \u2192 't12'. So NT8 \u2192 't12'.\n\nSimilarly, NT62: Let's see the rule for NT62 is \u2192 NT73 NT67.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some rules. Let me check again.\n\nYes, NT62: its rule is NT62 \u2192 NT73 NT67.\n\nSo expanding NT62: NT73 is NT8 NT9 (from before), and NT67 is another rule.\n\nLooking at NT67: The rule for NT67 is \u2192 NT53 NT79.\n\nSo NT67 \u2192 NT53 NT79.\n\nNow, NT53: Its rule is \u2192 't53' terminal, 't53'.\n\nNT79: The rule is \u2192 NT67 NT46.\n\nThus, NT79 \u2192 NT67 NT46.\n\nBut NT67 is again \u2192 NT53 NT79, which is circular. This seems to lead to a loop because NT53 is terminal and NT79 is another non-terminal that refers back. So this might not terminate properly, indicating that this path doesn't produce a terminal string. Therefore, NT62 might not be able to produce a terminal string if NT67 can't, which it can't because it loops. So maybe NT6 can't produce any terminal string, which would mean that the whole S can't produce 't95'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me try to find a way for NT6 to expand into a terminal string.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT12.\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12' (so it's a terminal).\n\nSo NT73 \u2192 't12 NT9'.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, NT73 is NT8 NT9, so when NT73 expands, it's 't12' from NT8 and NT9 is 't26'.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26' because the rule is NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, and NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67, and so on. Wait, no, that's too deep. Let's correct this.\n\nWait, NT9 has rules, but the direct expansion is if it's a terminal. Looking at all the NT9 entries, none of them have a rule where NT9 is just a terminal. Instead, all have NT9 \u2192 something else, so NT9 is a non-terminal and can't produce a single terminal. That\u2019s a problem. So if NT9 is a non-terminal, then when NT73 expands, it's 't12' (from NT8) followed by whatever NT9 produces. But since NT9 can't be a terminal, it will produce multiple symbols, making the string longer than just 't12 t26' or something.\n\nWait, no, in my earlier analysis, I thought that NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, which leads further. So that suggests that NT9 doesn't produce a single terminal, so NT73 \u2192 't12' followed by NT9's expansion, which is longer.

{"custom_id":"request-16","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t7 t13\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, that might sound a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in that form, with all the rules on the left-hand side being non-terminals and the right-hand side being pairs of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is \"t7 t13\". So, I'm looking for a derivation that starts from the start symbol S and ends with this string. Let me see what the start symbol is. The first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. That seems like the start symbol because it's the top-level production.\n\nSo the initial step is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. From there, each of these non-terminals (NT6 and NT58) will need to be expanded until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So NT6 can be replaced by NT73 and NT62. I'll need to see if NT73 and NT62 lead to terminals.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. Neither is a terminal yet. So each of these will need further expansion. Let's take NT8. Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see a production for NT8. Hmm, does that mean it's either a terminal or a non-terminal? Wait, in the given productions, NT8 is a production rule. Let me check. Yes, I see NT8 \u2192 NT12, so it's a non-terminal. Wait, no, wait. NT8 isn't on the left of any production except possibly NT8 \u2192 NT12? Let me check the list.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I don't see NT8 being on the left of any production. So if there's no production for NT8, that means it can't be further expanded and must be a terminal. So NT8 is a terminal symbol. So NT8 is 't8'?\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules. Scanning the list, yes, NT8 isn't on the left of any production except maybe somewhere else. Wait, looking carefully, I don't see a production for NT8 as a left-hand side. So NT8 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, for NT9, I look through the rules and see NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, so NT9 isn't a terminal because it's defined by other non-terminals. Hmm, so I might have made a mistake. Let me go step by step.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT12? Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT12. Wait, let me check. I see NT8 isn't a production, so maybe I was wrong before. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. So NT8 isn't on the left, so it must be a terminal. Wait, maybe in the list I need to check for a production where NT8 is the left-hand side.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nWait, I don't see any production where NT8 is the left-hand side. The production NT8 \u2192 NT12 is not there. So, does that mean NT8 is a terminal symbol? So NT8 is a terminal, perhaps 't8'?\n\nSimilarly, NT9 is a production rule: NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. So to expand NT9, I need to expand NT68 and NT40.\n\nNT68 is a production: NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67. So NT63 and NT67.\n\nLooking at NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22.\n\nNT94 is a terminal because there's a production: NT94 \u2192 't77'.\n\nWait, no, looking again. Let me check the list.\n\nWait, some rules end with 't' followed by a number, like NT94 \u2192 't77'.\n\nSo, NT94 is a terminal symbol 't77', yes.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 't87' as per one of the productions.\n\nSo, NT94 is 't77', NT22 is 't87'.\n\nSo that gives NT63 \u2192 't77' 't87', which is \"t77 t87\", which isn't matching our target, which is \"t7 t13\". Hmm, so maybe that path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's try expanding NT73 again.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. Both are non-terminals.\n\nGiven that NT8 is a terminal 't8', but wait, no, because earlier I thought NT8 isn't a production, so maybe it's a terminal.\n\nWait, I need to clarify: if a non-terminal doesn't have a production, is it considered a terminal? Or does every non-terminal have at least one production? In Chomsky normal form, every non-terminal must have at least one production, right? So maybe I mislooked. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the list of productions:\n\nWait, for NT8, I don't see any line where NT8 is the left-hand side. So that would mean NT8 is a non-terminal with no productions, which is not possible. So perhaps I mislooked earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake, and NT8 has a production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up earlier. Wait, here's the production: NT67 \u2192 't53'.\n\nWait, looking back, let me check for NT8.\n\nWait, no, in the given list, there's no line where NT8 is the left-hand side. So that must mean that NT8 is a terminal. So NT8 is 't8'. That's my mistake earlier; I thought NT8 was a production, but it's not. So NT8 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT9:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40.\n\nSo expanding NT68 and NT40.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22.\n\nSo NT63 \u2192 't77' (NT94 \u2192 't77') and NT22 \u2192 't87'.\n\nSo NT63 becomes 't77 t87'.\n\nAnd NT40 is a production: NT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17.\n\nSo NT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17.\n\nBut wait, we need to check what NT69 and NT17 are.\n\nNT69 \u2192 't13' (as per some rule, looking back, yes: NT69 \u2192 't67', wait no, wait:\n\nWait, looking back, I think I see NT69 \u2192 't13'.

Let me start by looking at the grammar to see if I can break it down or find any relevant rules.\n\nFirst, the top-level rule is S -> NT6 NT58. So, the starting symbol S must produce NT6 and NT58. Both of these are non-terminals that will eventually be expanded into terminal symbols (the 't' followed by numbers here).\n\nLooking at NT6, the production is NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So, NT6 must first produce NT73 and NT62. Let me check each of these.\n\nNT73 has a production NT73 -> NT8 NT9. So, NT73 becomes NT8 followed by NT9. Similarly, NT62 is NT62 -> NT84 NT9.

Let me check the rules for NT2.\n\nLooking back, NT2 has the production rules:\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't9'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n\nSo, NT2 can produce 't7'. So, that's one possibility for 't7'.\n\nFor 't3', maybe it comes from another NT. Looking for NTs that produce 't3':\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't3'. Wait, is there a rule I'm missing? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the NT rules, I see NT9 -> 't26', but that's 't26', not 't3'. Hmm. Did I miss any?\n\nWait, looking at NT2, its rules are 't70', 't6', 't9', 't7'. So no, NT2 doesn't produce 't3'. So for 't3', maybe it's another NT.\n\nLooking through all NTs, perhaps there's an NT that expands to 't3' via a chain.\n\nWait, let's think: For the string `t7 t3 t98`.\n\nThat's three tokens, each from a terminal production. So, S -> NT6 NT58. Each NT6 and NT58 must expand into one or more terminals, and their combined expansions must form `t7 t3 t98`.\n\nLet me consider how each of these can happen.\n\nFirst, NT6 is defined as NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9.\n\nSo, NT73 expands to NT8 and NT9. Then, each of these can go further.\n\nNT8 has a production NT8 -> 't12', but that's t12, not t3. So perhaps NT8 is a dead end for t3.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another path. Maybe NT6 doesn't come from the initial production. Wait, no, the initial production is S->NT6 NT58. So, both NT6 and NT58 must be expanded.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for where 't98' comes from.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT84 -> 't46' or 't84' can produce 't84' or 't46'?\n\nWait, NT84 has a production rule: NT84 -> 't40' or 't34'. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing the correct path.\n\nWait, the 't98' token might come from NT85, because looking at NT85, it has rules NT85-> NT95 NT56, or NT85->NT87 NT55. Hmm, that's not directly helpful. Wait, another NT that might produce t98 is NT73, perhaps.\n\nWait, NT73 is in one of the rules for NT46: NT46-> 't87', and no, that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to find sequences that produce 't7 t3 t98'.\n\nWait, for 't3', perhaps it's from NT69? Let me check NT69 rules: NT69 ->'t67' or 't19' or 't6'?\n\nWait, looking again: NT69 is defined as NT69 -> 't67' or 't19' or 't6' or 't94'.\n\nNo, none of those give 't3'. So perhaps 't3' comes from another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps NT34 or another, but looking for a direct production.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't3', except maybe through a chain. Let me check NT36: NT36->'t79' or 't2' or 't34'.\n\nHmm, 't2' comes from NT36, which then can go to 't34'. So maybe NT36 can eventually lead to 't2', but that's 't2' not 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm going the wrong way. Let me try to see if the string `t7 t3 t98` can be built from any combination of NT6 and NT58.\n\nEach of NT6 and NT58 expands into some subterms. NT6 is NT73 NT62.\n\nSo, combining NT6 and NT58, the expansion would be NT73 NT62 NT58's expansion. Wait, not exactly, because each NT is expanded into its productions.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to build a parse tree or see if any of the NTs can produce these t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find whether there's any way to get t7, t3, t98.\n\nSince I can't seem to find any NT that expands to t3 directly, perhaps this string is not generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking at the NT2 rule, it can produce 't7'. So maybe 't7' comes from NT2. For 't3', perhaps another NT needs to produce it, but none of the NTs have a direct rule for 't3'. Therefore, the string `t7 t3 t98` cannot be generated because there's no NT that produces 't3'.\n\nSo, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. It looks like the grammar consists of non-terminals (S, NT74, NT63, etc.) and terminals (t followed by a number). Each rule is in the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except for the base cases where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is \"t82 t26 t64\". Since the string has three tokens separated by spaces, I suspect the derivation will involve two productions in the grammar, because each production usually adds one token (or two, but in this case, each rule expansion adds one non-terminal on each side, but in Chomsky normal form, each rule is two non-terminals). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a sequence of three terminals. Since the grammar starts with S, and each production splits a non-terminal into two others, perhaps each step adds one more part. But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to work backward from the string.\n\nLet's reverse the process:\n\nStart with the string \"t82 t26 t64\". Each token is a terminal, so they might correspond to the right-hand sides of some productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some NTs directly correspond to terminals.

I'm presented with a context-free grammar (CFG) given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string `t7 t27 t95 t84` that I need to check whether it's generated by this grammar. The output should be either 'Yes' or 'No'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. The start symbol is S, and S directly produces NT6 and NT58, as per the production S -> NT6 NT58. So, every string generated by this grammar will start with a combination of NT6 and NT58, followed by other non-terminals until eventually everything is resolved into terminals like 't7', 't27', etc.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I see that it's provided in a way where each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That's Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nThe string to check is `t7 t27 t95 t84`. Since it's a sequence of terminals, I need to see if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nTo approach this, I can use the method of working backwards from the string. Each token in the string can be seen as a terminal, so I can check each token to see if it's present in the immediate right-hand sides (RHS) of the productions. If a terminal appears, it serves as a leaf node in the parse tree, and its production must be a \u2192 terminal, which for this grammar would be the productions where a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals are directly linked to terminals:\n\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT94 -> 't14' and 't1'\n- NT73 -> 't25' and 't8'\nWait, let me check each production carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice:\n\n- NT73 -> 't8' (from NT84 -> t46 is a non-terminal?

Hmm, let me process this step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make things a bit simpler because I don't have to deal with epsilon productions or other forms.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of NT followed by numbers and sometimes 't' followed by numbers. Wait, those 't' symbols are terminals, right? So each of those NT productions eventually leads down to a terminal string until the symbols on the left become terminals.\n\nNow, the string given is `t27 t25 t12 t79`. I need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. So I should probably start by trying to parse this string using the grammar, reversing the process, since usually we do leftmost derivations or top-down parsing. Alternatively, building a bottom-up parse tree might help, but maybe I'll try to map the string to the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me list the NT rules again to see which ones lead to 't' symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9'\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT79 \u2192 't16'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT66 \u2192 't96'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- NT38 \u2192 't68'\n- NT22 \u2192 't87'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87' (Wait, this duplicates NT46's production for 't87')\n- NT39 \u2192 't58'\n- NT2 \u2192 't44'\n- NT8 \u2192 't12' [Oh, so NT8 produces 't12']\n- NT74 \u2192 't77'\n- NT84 \u2192 't40'\n- NT93 \u2192 't95'\n- NT85 \u2192 't76' [Wait, earlier I saw NT85 has two productions: one to 't76' and another to 't58']\n- NT77 \u2192 Well, but in the grammar above, I don't see an NT77.

Let me check the list.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the list, after NT93 comes NT77: but I don't see it. Instead, after NT76, there's NT85. So maybe NT77 is not a terminal but perhaps a non-terminal. Wait, but in the string, we have 't77' as one of the tokens. Wait, but the grammar doesn't list an NT77 producing 't77'. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe I missed it.\n\nLet me check the grammar again: the initial NT2\u2192't9', NT94\u2192't77', NT73\u2192't25', NT79\u2192't16', NT63\u2192't36', NT15\u2192't94', NT69\u2192't67', NT46\u2192't28', NT66\u2192't96', NT79\u2192't27', NT27\u2192't4', NT38\u2192't68', NT22\u2192't87', NT9\u2192't26', NT46\u2192't87', NT39\u2192't58', NT2\u2192't44', NT8\u2192't12', NT74\u2192't77', NT84\u2192't40', NT93\u2192't95', NT85\u2192't76', NT73\u2192... and so on.\n\nWait, so NT77 is actually missing? Or is that a typo? Or maybe I should double-check if I have all the NTs listed correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, maybe I missed NT77. Let me count the number of NTs:\n\nNT2, NT94, NT73, NT79, NT63, NT15, NT69, NT46, NT66, NT27, NT38, NT22, NT9, NT39, NT85, NT78, NT83, NT89, NT68, NT46 again, NT44... Hmm, maybe I missed some. Perhaps NT77 is not a terminal but another NT that produces 't77'. Alternatively, maybe it's not present, which would affect the string if that's needed.\n\nWait, but in the string given, one of the tokens is 't77'. If the grammar doesn't have an NT that produces 't77', then 't77' cannot appear in any string generated by the grammar, right? So if 't77' is in the string but there's no rule for that NT, then the string cannot be generated, which would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but the problem is the provided grammar is given, and perhaps I need to check. Let me look through each production again to see if any NT leads to 't77'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT77 is not present in the list of NTs. The grammar doesn't include an NT77 entry. The closest is NT73 \u2192 't25', but no 't77'. So perhaps there's no NT that produces 't77'. Therefore, if the string has 't77', it can't be generated.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, looking more carefully:\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nThen, for NT77, it's not listed. Let me re-examine all the entries:\n\nLooking through the NT list:\n\n- NT2, NT94, NT73, NT79, NT63, NT15, NT69, NT46, NT66, NT27, NT38, NT22, NT9, NT39, NT85, NT78, NT83, NT89, NT68, NT36, NT56, NT59, NT52, NT37, NT95, NT73, etc.\n\nBut I don't see an NT77 in the list, which is required to produce 't77'. So if the string contains 't77', then it's impossible because there's no production rule for NT77, and thus 't77' cannot be derived.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Maybe it's an error in the problem statement.

{"custom_id":"request-64","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string `t9 t28 t49 t95 t12` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see if I can work backwards from the string or forwards and see if it's possible to derive the string. The string given is `t9 t28 t49 t95 t12`, which is a sequence of terminals. \n\nI think the strategy here is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation will replace a single non-terminal with two others. So, for a string of length 5, starting from the start symbol S, we'll need to take 2^(5) -1 = 31 steps, but that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n1. `t9`: I check the grammar to see which non-terminal can produce `t9`. Scanning through the productions, I see that several non-terminals end with `t9`, like NT2, NT9, etc. But looking back, in the initial part of the grammar, there's a rule NT2-> 't9'. So, NT2 can produce t9.\n\n2. `t28`: Similarly, I look for non-terminals that produce t28. In the grammar, I see NT28-> 't28'? Wait, no, looking again, I think there's a rule NT28-> 't44'... Hmm, no. Wait, the initial part: looking for NT that produce t28. Wait, let me scan the productions. Ah, here: NT2-> 't70' isn't t28. Wait, in the later parts: `NT87 -> NT98`, but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check the grammar again. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT27 -> 't4', NT38-> 't68', NT22-> 't87', NT9-> 't26', NT46-> 't87', NT39-> 't63', NT2-> 't44', and other NTs lead to terminals like 't9', 't28', etc. \n\nWait, wait. I think I need to reconstruct possible derivations.\n\nStarting from S: S is NT6->NT73 or NT58. Let me see:\n\nS-> NT6 NT58\n\nFrom S, derive two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58.\n\nNT6 can produce 't73' or possibly more steps. NT6->NT73 NT62. So NT6 could eventually produce t73 or more.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t9, not t73. So perhaps the initial production is S-> NT58 NT6.\n\nLooking at NT58: from the grammar, NT58 can go to NT84 NT9 or NT6 NT19. So let's see:\n\nIf S-> NT58 NT6, then NT58 produces, say, NT84 NT9, and NT6 could produce something else.\n\nWait, but let's try to trace the string `t9 t28 t49 t95 t12`. Each token needs to come from a non-terminal, which in turn can produce that token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a result of a derivation where each step expands a non-terminal into two others until all are terminals.\n\nLet me try to model this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t9, t28, t49, t95, t12.\n\nEach of these must be generated by some non-terminal expansion.\n\nLooking at each:\n\n- t9 can come from NT2-> 't9', as per the initial rules.\n\n- t28 could come from NT28-> 't28'? Wait, but in the grammar, NT28 is defined as NT44 NT14. Looking it up: NT28-> NT44 NT14. Not directly 't28'. So to get t28, a non-terminal must produce it, so I need to look for any NT that directly produces t28. Let's check the grammar.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT44-> 't83', NT74-> 't77', etc. Wait, no, looking through all the rules, oh wait, I don't see any NT directly producing 't28' except maybe in one of the rules. Let me scan again:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT2-> 't70', but not t28. Wait, maybe I missed it. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking at NT2: `NT22 -> 't87'`, `NT2-> NT74`, etc. Wait, perhaps I should look through all the NTs to see if any produce 't28'. \n\nLooking through the grammar: \n\nI see NT27->'t4', NT38->'t68', NT22->'t87', NT9->'t26', etc. Wait, but is there any NT that directly has 't28'? Maybe NT55->'t95', no. Wait, I'm looking for any NT that in the grammar has a production with a terminal 't28'.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- NT5-> ... ? No, wait, in the grammar, I might have to check each NT:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLooking for 't28' as a terminal:\n\nI see in NT44-> 't83', so no. NT87-> 't98'\u2014no. NT22-> 't87'. NT78-> 't63' and 't73'. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps looking at NT87 is defined as NT98. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take a different approach: since the grammar is in CNF, each rule is two non-terminals. So to produce a string of 5 tokens, the derivation would involve about 5 steps of expanding non-terminals until all terminals are reached. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar doesn't allow certain terminals to appear multiple times or in certain orders.\n\nWait, perhaps the string t9 t28 t49 t95 t12 contains certain sequences that are impossible given the grammar. For example, looking for how t9 can be followed by t28.\n\nLet's think: starting from S, which is NT58 and NT6. If the first part is NT58->'t9', but actually, S-> NT58 NT6, and for the string to start with t9, either NT58 must produce t9 or NT6 must. Wait, S produces NT6 NT58, so the first two non-terminals are NT6 and NT58. So the first token would be derived from NT6 or NT58.\n\nWait, no. Each production of a non-terminal could produce two non-terminals. So the string is built by expanding each non-terminal in turn.\n\nWait, perhaps it would be better to model the possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string cannot be generated because certain sequences cannot be derived.\n\nWait, let's look at the string:\n\nt9: can come from NT2-> 't9'.\n\nt28: where can that come from?

{"custom_id":"request-65","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the string \"t64 t12 t25 t12 t87\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of production rules that rewrite terminals and non-terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe given grammar has several non-terminals and production rules, but looking at the provided string, it seems composed solely of terminals. So, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. \n\nThe string is: t64 t12 t25 t12 t87. So, we have five tokens, each representing a terminal. Let's list them and see which non-terminals they might come from.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the non-terminals are S, NT74, NT63, NT95, NT19, NT65, NT14, NT50, NT78, NT56, NT95 again (so duplicated), NT9, NT40, NT34, NT6, NT36, NT74 again, NT84, NT78 again, NT58, NT28, NT2, NT85, NT68, NT39, NT85 again, NT73, NT52, NT37, NT95 again, NT52 again, NT2 coming again, and a bunch of non-terminals that map to terminals.\n\nSo, from the provided string, the terminals are:\nt64, t12, t25, t12, t87.\n\nI need to see how each of these corresponds to non-terminals in the grammar. Let's map them:\n\nFrom the list:\n- t64 is in NT63 because NT63 -> t36 (wait, no, wait. Looking back, I see NT63 -> NT94 NT22, but that's a production rule, and in the mappings, I see \"NT63 -> NT94 NT22\". Wait, but the provided string has \"t64\" which must come from a production rule. Looking at the mappings, NT36 is t64 because \"NT36 -> NT79 NT2\" and under mappings, I see \"NT36 -> 't64'\". So t64 is the terminal from NT36.\n\nWait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Each non-terminal has productions, and some may map directly to terminals. For example, looking at the mappings, NT34 maps to 't36', which is NT34 -> t36. Similarly, NT94 maps to 't77', NT73 maps to 't25', etc.\n\nWait, the mappings are given, so each \"NTx\" and \"t\" are connected. For example, in the list, \"NT94 -> 't77'\", so when NT94 is processed, it becomes 't77'. So, for each terminal, I can find which non-terminal it comes from.\n\nLet me list each terminal and the non-terminal that produces it:\n\n- t64: From NT36 because \"NT36 -> 't64'\"\n- t12: Looking at the mappings, none directly say 't12', but wait, looking back at the input string, \"t12\" is in the string. Wait, looking at the mappings, I see \"NT28 -> 't49'\" and \"NT2 -> 't70'\", \"NT8 -> 't12'\", etc. So, \"t12\" comes from NT8.\n\nWait, in the mappings, \"NT8 -> 't12'\"? Yes, looking at the list: \"NT8 -> 't12'\". So, t12 is from NT8.\n\nSimilarly, t25 comes from NT73, since \"NT73 -> 't25'\". \n\nt87 is a bit tricky. Looking at the mappings, \"NT84 -> 't46'\", \"NT95 -> 't56'\", etc. Wait, how about looking for 't87' directly. In the mappings, I don't see a direct one, but perhaps it's generated through a non-terminal that produces it. Wait, in the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't87'?\n\nLooking at the mappings: I see \"NT85 -> 't76'\", \"NT39 -> 't26'\", \"NT73 -> 't8'\". Hmm, perhaps that's not it. Wait, looking for 't87' in the mappings, it's not directly present. Wait, maybe it's derived from a non-terminal that can produce it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each production rule and see if any NT can produce these.\n\nWait, another approach is to try to parse the string backward, starting from the leftmost non-terminal. Maybe I should start by breaking down each terminal into their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string is:\n\nt64 t12 t25 t12 t87 \u2192 this means we have:\n\n64 \u2192 from NT36\n12 \u2192 from NT8\n25 \u2192 from NT73\n12 \u2192 from NT8\n87 \u2192 need to find which NT produces 't87'.\n\nLooking back at the mappings, I don't see a direct NT that produces t87. Wait, did I miss something?\n\nChecking the mappings again: looking for any NT that directly maps to 't87'. Hmm, none. So how is t87 generated? Maybe it's generated from a non-terminal that can split into other non-terminals, which eventually lead to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong end. Let's think about the structure of the grammar. Since the string is in CNF, it's made up of production rules where each step either breaks a non-terminal into two or into a terminal.\n\nSo, the string is five terminals, which suggests that the derivation starts with the starting symbol S, which must be broken down into a series of steps resulting in these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is the start symbol. The production rules for S: S -> NT6 NT58. Because the grammar is presented with S on the left, and the right side is two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the first step is S => NT6 NT58.\n\nEach of these non-terminals, NT6 and NT58, need to be broken down further.\n\nLooking at NT6: production rules. From the mappings, \"NT6 -> NT73 NT62\". So NT6 becomes NT73 and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT58: production rules, \"NT58 -> NT84 NT9\". So NT58 becomes NT84 and NT9.\n\nSo, breaking down S, the initial expansion is:\n\nnt6 nt58 \u2192 nt73 nt62 nt84 nt9.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals (nt73, nt62, nt84, nt9) must be further expanded.\n\nBreaking them down:\n\nNT73 \u2192 from the mappings: \"NT73 -> 't25'\". So T25 is a terminal.\n\nNT62 \u2192 \"NT62 -> 't84'\". Wait, no, looking at the mappings, \"NT62 -> 't84'\". Wait, no, in the given mappings, \"NT62 -> 't84'\". So NT62 becomes terminal t84.\n\nWait, but according to our string, we have t25, t12, t25, t12, t87.\n\nWait, nt73 is t25, which fits the third character. So the second part is nt62 \u2192 t84, but the string has t12, so the third character is t25, which is nt73, and the second is nt62 which would give t84, but the string has t12 as the second character. This doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, let's re-express the string in the order it's given:\n\nThe string is t64 t12 t25 t12 t87, which breaks down as:\n\n1. t64 \u2192 NT36\n2. t12 \u2192 NT8\n3. t25 \u2192 NT73\n4. t12 \u2192 NT8\n5. t87 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the way I approached the initial breakdown is wrong. Maybe I should look for a way the non-terminals can be connected to produce the given terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent approach.\n\nAnother thought: the string must be generated in steps, each time replacing a non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but wait, in CNF, it's always two non-terminals or a terminal).\n\nWait, no, in CNF, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT79 appears in two places with different values: 't16' and 't27'. That might complicate things, but perhaps those are two separate productions for NT79, each producing different terminals. So NT79 can produce 't16' or 't27'.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 has two RHS: 't67' and 't13', so it can produce either.\n\nNow, let's process the string from the end, maybe using a top-down approach starting from S.\n\nThe string is six tokens, so I need a derivation that ends up with exactly six non-terminals, each expanding to a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps using a bottom-up approach, starting from the rightmost symbols and moving left.\n\nAlternatively, I might look for a way to match the string starting from S.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe given grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58. So S produces NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nSo to generate the entire string, we need to derive a sequence that starts with NT6 and ends with NT58.\n\nWait, no: S -> NT6 NT58, so both NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals. So we have to see if NT6 and NT58 can produce such sequences, but how?\n\nWait, the given string is 't74 t74 t67 t63 t49 t49', which is six terminals. So perhaps the grammar can generate this by expanding S in such a way.\n\nLet me try to find what production from S can lead to t74 t74 t67 t63 t49 t49.\n\nWait, no: S -> NT6 NT58, so both NT6 and NT58 need to be expanded to produce the entire string.

{"custom_id":"request-91","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this task to determine whether the string `t79 t55 t4 t77 t16 t12` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Alright, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is quite extensive with all these non-terminals leading to terminals. The terminals are words ending with 't' and some numbers. The string we're checking has six tokens: `t79`, `t55`, `t4`, `t77`, `t16`, `t12`. All of these are terminals, which means they must be derived by the lowest level of the grammar, where non-terminals are replaced by these terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That means each step either combines two non-terminals into one or replaces a non-terminal with a single terminal.\n\nThe string is a sequence of six terminals, so each word must be generated from individual non-terminals that are expanded into the respective 't' words. Let's list the tokens and their corresponding 't' parts:\n\n1. t79\n2. t55\n3. t4\n4. t77\n5. t16\n6. t12\n\nI'll start by checking if each of these 't' parts exists as a terminal in the grammar. Scanning through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- t79 is listed as a terminal (NT79 -> 't79').\n- t55 is a terminal (NT55 -> 't55'), though I should note that there's an alternative production for NT55? Wait, no, looking back: Wait, the grammar has NT55 -> 't55' and another production NT55 -> 't55'. Wait, wait, in the grammar, for NT55, the production is `NT55 -> 't55'`, and in the list of productions, I see NT55 -> 't55' as well as another entry for NT55? No, actually, looking through the list, I think NT55 is only directly leading to a terminal. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, for example, I see NT55 -> 't55' but also possibly another production? Wait, looking through each line:\n\nLooking through all the lines, most seem to be non-terminal productions. I think I see NT55 -> 't55' once, and another production for NT55. Wait, no, let me check line by line.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT79 -> 't79', NT55 -> 't55', NT94 -> 't14', NT73 -> 't25', NT79 -> 't27', NT94 -> 't14', etc. Wait, perhaps I missed some. Let me list all the terminal productions as per the grammar:\n\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT95 -> 't94'\n- Wait, no, NT95 has productions like NT95 -> NT9 NT69, etc. The terminal ones are:\n\nLooking further:\n\n- NT79 -> 't79' (wait, is that a terminal? Because I see NT79 -> NT63 NT93 elsewhere, but is there a production for NT79 as a terminal?)\n\nYes, looking again, I see this line: `NT79 -> 't79'`. Similarly, NT55 -> 't55', and others. So for each 't' part in the string, I need to check if that exists as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. t79: Yes, NT79 -> t79\n2. t55: Yes, NT55 -> t55\n3. t4: Hmm, looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a production for NT4 or any non-terminal that leads directly to t4. Let's check the provided grammar. Looking through each line, I see NT4 isn't mentioned as a non-terminal. The productions are all for specific non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar list, I see lines like:\n\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\nBut wait, looking for t4, is there an NT that leads to t4? I don't see any. So t4 might not be a terminal in the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the provided list, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT95 -> 't94'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT36 -> 't64'\n- NT56 -> 't72'\n- NT69 -> 't13'\n- NT87 -> 't98'\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n- NT38 -> 't68'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT39 -> 't58'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT84 -> 't40'\n- NT39 -> 't63'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> 't84'\n- NT85 -> 't76'\n- NT93 -> 't95'\n- NT85 -> 't58'\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n- NT79 -> 't67'\n- NT84 -> 't55'\n- NT74 -> 't8'\n- NT36 -> 't79'\n- NT17 -> 't96'\n- NT65 -> 't82'\n- NT93 -> 't39'\n- NT38 -> 't74'\n- etc.\n\nWait, so I see that NT27 -> 't4'. Yes, that's there. So t4 is derived from NT27.\n\nSo each of the 't' tokens in the string is either a direct terminal or a non-terminal that can be expanded to that terminal. Now, the next step is to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string has six tokens, so considering the grammar's productions, we'd need a series of steps that can combine non-terminals into these terminals, each step expanding non-terminals into their components until all terminals are reached.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, we can approach this by checking if each 't' token corresponds correctly, and whether the way they appear can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by identifying which non-terminals each token (or possible combination) could come from.\n\nThe start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the first token, t79. From the grammar, NT79 is a terminal, so it must come from the production S -> NT6 NT58, but wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the start symbol S produces NT6 NT58 according to the first line: `S -> NT6 NT58`. So S is S = NT6 NT58. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to produce the respective token or sub-strings.\n\nLet's attempt to build a parse tree from the bottom up or top down, but perhaps a better approach for me is to see how each token can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me list the order of tokens again: t79 t55 t4 t77 t16 t12.\n\nNow, each token must be generated by a non-terminal. Let's map which non-terminals can generate these:\n\n- t79: NT79 \u2192 't79'\n- t55: NT55 \u2192 't55'\n- t4: NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- t77: NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- t16: NT79 \u2192 't16'? Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT79 leading to 't16'. Wait, perhaps I missed that.\n\nWait, the grammar for NT79 is `NT79 -> 't79'` earlier, but later, I see `NT79 -> NT63 NT93`. Wait, that's not a terminal. Hmm, but in the list of terminal productions, NT79 can be 't79' or via another production. Wait, no, in the grammar, perhaps NT79 has multiple productions: both NT79 -> 't77' and NT79 -> 't79'? Wait, looking back.\n\nAh! I think I may have made a mistake. Let me go through all the NT entries to see the production rules.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT79 -> 't77'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, I don't see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-105","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string `t96 t40 t13 t70 t70 t26 t94` is generated by the provided grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT74, etc.) is rewritten into combinations of two other non-terminals or other terminals. My task is to parse the string backward, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if it can derive the string through these rules.\n\nThe string provided is: `t96 t40 t13 t70 t70 t26 t94`. Let me note that in the grammar, several non-terminals directly correspond to terminals (like NT94 -> 't77', NT73 -> 't25', etc.). So, whenever I see a token in the string that matches a non-terminal's production, I can replace it using its production rules.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step, trying to find a derivation.\n\nStarting from the leftmost token: t96. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't96'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT62 -> 't84' and NT36 -> 't64'. Also, NT68 -> 't63'. Hmm, actually, 't96' isn't directly a terminal for any of these. Wait, checking the rules again, I notice that NT96 isn't a non-terminal; perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT78 -> 't78', which doesn't help here. Oh, wait, there's NT66 -> 't67' and NT56 -> 't72', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at all the production rules and see which ones produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at all the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't16'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n- NT15 -> 't94'\n- NT69 -> 't67'\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n- NT2 -> 't70', 't6', 't9'... Wait, actually, in the rules, each NT has a pattern of producing either non-terminals or specific terminals. For example, looking at NT2's rules, I see lines like:\n  - NT2 -> NT9, NT44\n  - NT2 -> 't70'\n  - NT2 -> 't6'\n  - NT2 -> 't44'\n  - NT2 -> 't44'\n  - NT2 -> 't83'\n  - NT2 -> 't6'\n  - NT2 -> 't44'\n  - NT2 -> 't44'\n  - NT2 -> 't83'\nWait, no, actually the structure is that each line is a rule, so for NT2, the rules are:\n- NT2 -> NT9 NT44\n- NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't83'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\nSo, NT2 can produce various terminals like 't70', 't6', 't44' etc., as well as combinations of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a reverse mapping: for each terminal, which non-terminals could produce it.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this as a bottom-up parser, trying to match the string from the end.\n\nWait, let me list the string tokens again: t96, t40, t13, t70, t70, t26, t94.\n\nI think I should start by finding possible non-terminals that can derive these tokens. Let's go token by token.\n\nStarting with the last token: t94.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't94'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't94' (looking at the rules, one of NT2's productions is 't94')\n- Also, looking at the rules, maybe others? Let's check:\n\nLooking at NT9 -> NT68 NT40. NT40 has a production to 't16', but no.\n\nWait, perhaps the main point is that NT2 can produce 't94'. So, the last token can be derived by NT2 -> 't94'.\n\nSo, we replace the last token with NT2. Now, the remaining string to derive is: t96 t40 t13 t70 t70 t26, and the current non-terminal is NT2.\n\nNow, the string is: t96, t40, t13, t70, t70, t26, NT2.\n\nWe need to derive the substring before NT2, i.e., t96 t40 t13 t70 t70 t26, up to NT2.\n\nBut wait, each rule in the grammar is two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc. So, perhaps it's better to approach this by working backward, trying to find which non-terminals could derive the given sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps working forward: starting from S and see if we can reach the string. But that might be more complex.\n\nLet me try to see what production the last non-terminal could have. So, the current non-terminal is NT2, which has:\n\n- NT2 -> NT9 NT44\n- NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- etc.\n\nBut in our case, the last token derived is 't94', so NT2 must be derived by NT2 -> 't94' (the 10th production for NT2 is 't94').\n\nSo, moving backward, we have:\n\n[...] -> NT2 -> 't94'\n\nNow, the string before that is t96 t40 t13 t70 t70 t26.\n\nSo, the next step is to see which non-terminal can produce 't26' and see if it fits.\n\nLooking for 't26' in the grammar:\n\nWhich non-terminal can produce 't26'? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't26' according to one of the rules (NT9 -> 't26')\nWait, checking all rules for NT9:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT9 has several productions, and one is NT9 -> 't26'. So yes, NT9 can produce 't26'.\n\nSo, 't26' can be derived by NT9 -> 't26'.\n\nThus, replacing 't26' with NT9.\n\nNow, the string to derive is: t96 t40 t13 t70 t70, with the current non-terminals being NT9.\n\nSo, we have [...] -> NT2 -> 't94' [subproblem] NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me reorganize.\n\nWait, the initial string is `t96 t40 t13 t70 t70 t26 t94`.\n\nWe first replace the last token (t94) with NT2, so we have:\n\n`t96 t40 t13 t70 t70 t26 -> NT2`.\n\nNow, the next step is to substitute the NT2 into the rule that can derive it. Since NT2 can produce 't94', but here the string before is up to 't26', so we need to look at the rule that goes from NT2 to 't26' combined with other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try a different approach: working backward from S, seeing if I can expand it step by step to get the target string.\n\nThe S production is S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, S can split into NT6 and NT58. Then, each of these can expand further.\n\nThis might get lengthy, but let's try.\n\nFirst, S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 has production: NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nNT58 can produce various things.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. All productions are from a non-terminal to two non-terminals, except for the terminal productions where a non-terminal becomes a single terminal. So, the starting symbol is S, which is defined as NT63 NT62. Each of those NTs can be further broken down into other NTs, which eventually resolve to terminals starting with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe target string is `t13 t4 t36 t3 t12 t16 t96`. I need to see if this string can be derived from S by applying the productions.\n\nLet's look at the string and see which terminals are present. The string has t13, t4, t36, t3, t12, t16, t96. Each of these corresponds to specific NTs, as per the NT productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, each terminal is associated with a particular NT:\n- t13 corresponds to NT69.\n- t4 corresponds to NT2 (since NT2 -> 't4').\n- t36 corresponds to NT94 via NT63 which is from NT95 and NT62. Wait, let me check: looking at the grammar, t36 is NT62, and NT62 is involved in NT36 production: NT36 -> NT79 NT2. And t36 in the string corresponds to NT36.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each 't' to its NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- t13: NT94 (because NT94 -> 't14', no, wait NT94 is 't14'? Wait NT94 -> 't14'? Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT94: \"NT94 -> 't14'\". So 't14' comes from NT94. Similarly, t79 is from NT79? Wait, no, actually, each terminal is generated by a specific NT.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\nLooking through each terminal production:\n- NT69 -> 't13' (since NT69's production is mapped to t13)\n- NT2 -> 't4'\n- NT94 -> 't14' (Wait no, looking back at the provided grammar: for example, NT94 is \"NT94 -> 't77'\", no, wait the grammar seems mixed up.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So each non-terminal can only produce two other symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal. That might help in parsing.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it can derive through the grammar starting from S and ending with this string. Let me list the productions first to see the structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that S -> NT6 NT58. So S generates two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. So each of these will need to be expanded until we get to terminals.\n\nLet me list out the relevant productions for each terminal in the string.\n\nThe string is: t4 t72 t82 t8 t87 t92 t96 t13.\n\nI'll go through each terminal and see if there's a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nStarting with t4. Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT where production ends with t4. Scanning through, I see NT87 -> t98, NT95 -> t14, etc. Wait, but I need to find which non-terminals produce a given terminal. Let me reverse-engineer it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to work from the string backward, seeing how each terminal can be generated, and then see if we can connect back to S.\n\nBut maybe an alternative approach is to try to build a parse tree for the given string.\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S must split into NT6 and NT58. Each of these will need to generate a part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\nNT62 -> NT97 ... or NT84?\nWait, from the given grammar, NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nSo let's consider NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t4. Let's see if any of the non-terminals produce t4.\n\nLooking through the productions, does any NT produce t4? Let me check each production.\n\nHmm, looking through the list, I don't see a production that directly produces t4. So maybe t4 is part of a non-terminal that expands into something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each non-terminal's productions to see if they produce any of the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me create a list of all non-terminals and their possible productions, focusing on those that might produce the string's terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's note the terminals and their possible sources.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66, which can yield t67 and t66 (t66 is from NT66, which is 't66' as per the last entry under NT66: NT66 -> 't66' and also 't67'. Wait, no, some lines might not be directly producing a terminal. Wait, wait, looking again:\n\nThe grammar entries are sometimes a bit confusing. Let me parse them.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT68 -> NT63 NT67: Then NT67 is 't53', and NT63 is 't36'. So if NT68 is split into NT63 and NT67, it can generate 't36 t53'.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', etc. Wait, each line seems to have an NT on the left followed by two possible productions, but sometimes it's a bit unclear. Wait, maybe each line is showing two alternatives for the same NT.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is written in a way where each NT has two productions. For example:\n\nThe line \"NT68 -> NT63 NT67\" might mean NT68 can produce two non-terminals, but then the next line under NT68 might be another production. Or maybe each NT has two productions, and each production is written as two possibilities. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the grammar is presented as a list of productions. For example, the first line is S->NT6 NT58. The second line is NT74->NT9 NT66. So each line is a production for a particular NT on the left, splitting into two non-terminals on the right.\n\nBut some lines under that might be further productions. Wait, looking again, it seems that each NT has two production rules. For example, NT68 has two productions: one splitting into NT63 NT67, and another into NT28 NT73. Wait, no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the lines are structured as left-hand side NT followed by two alternative productions. So each NT has two possible splits.\n\nWait, maybe each line under an NT represents a split, so NT68 has two productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n\nand\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT73\n\nBut actually, no, each line only shows one production. Wait, maybe each NT has only one production, and the list shows the possible alternative productions for that NT. Or perhaps it's a typo, and each NT has two productions.\n\nWait, I might need to clarify this. Let me check the structure.\n\nIn the context of Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nSo looking at the given grammar lines, each line is of the form A \u2192 B C, except sometimes when it's a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, the first line is S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nThen next line is NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66.\n\nThen NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22.\n\nWait, but some lines end with 't', like NT68 -> 't73'. Hmm, perhaps that means NT68 can produce a terminal. So NT68 can either split into NT63 and NT67 or produce t73.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT is defined by two possible productions. So, for NT, each line under it is a possible production, which can either split into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, let's try to parse one NT. Let's take NT2:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', 't36', 't6', 't44', etc.\n\nSo NT2 has multiple productions, each of which is either splitting into two non-terminals or generating a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps for each NT, all the lines under it represent the possible productions, either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC.\n\nSo for NT2:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9' (so A can produce t9)\nNT2 \u2192 't70'\nNT2 \u2192 't36'\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\nNT2 \u2192 't44'\nNT2 \u2192 't83'\nNT2 \u2192 't70'\nNT2 \u2192 't22'\nNT2 \u2192 't74'\nNT2 \u2192 't97'\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each NT in CNF can only have two productions. Perhaps the lines under each NT represent the possible options, so for example, NT2 has several terminal symbols as productions, meaning it can directly generate them. So NT2 can produce t9, t70, t36, t6, t44, t83, etc., or perhaps split into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps in this grammar, the NTs that are terminalinals do have multiple single productions, while the others have two productions. This is a bit confusing, but perhaps I can proceed.\n\nThe main challenge is that the string provided consists of t4, t72, t82, t8, t87, t92, t96, t13.\n\nOur target string is t4 t72 t82 t8 t87 t92 t96 t13.\n\nFirst, let's see which non-terminals can generate these terms.\n\nFor example, let's see which NT can produce t4.\n\nLooking through the NTs, I see that NT85 has a production NT85 \u2192 't76' and others. But I'm not seeing a direct term for t4. Wait, perhaps t4 is part of a non-terminal that splits into another NT and produces a t4.\n\nLooking at NT2: it's one of the possible non-terminals that can generate t4? Wait, in NT2's productions, there's a 't6', 't70', etc., but I see 't4'? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking under NT2:\n\nThe productions are: NT2 \u2192 t9, t70, t36, t6, t44, t83, t70, t22, t74, t97.\n\nWait, I don't see t4 here.

{"custom_id":"request-126","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine whether the given string `t26 t76 t67 t70 t94 t6 t4 t92` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form for context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that all the rules are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZZ or NTX \u2192 some terminal. So that seems to fit CNF. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t26 t76 t67 t70 t94 t6 t4 t92`. My task is to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar. \n\nTo approach this, I think about how a context-free grammar can generate a string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree with each internal node being a non-terminal, and each leaf a terminal. \n\nSo the process is to try to construct a parse tree for the string, applying the grammar's rules in a bottom-up manner or top-down using a method like recursive descent. \n\nBut manually doing this for a string with eight tokens might be time-consuming, but let's try. \n\nI start by looking at the leftmost terminals and see if I can find a production in the grammar that can derive it step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with `t26`. Looking at the grammar rules, I find a rule that ends with `t26` on the left side: NT9 \u2192 't26'. So that's a way to start.\n\nSimilarly, I can look at other terminals. I see that `t76` appears as a terminal for the rule NT85 \u2192 't76'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT95 NT66\nBut also, NT85 has another production? Let me check the list again. \n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see lines like NT85 -> NT95 NT66, and also others like NT50 -> NT93 NT6, etc. \n\nWait, I think I might have missed some rules, but the user provided a lot of rules. \n\nI think it's better to make a list of all the NT production rules and their possible decompositions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree step by step.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the entire string can be broken down into the grammar's production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is 8 tokens, which would require 7 splits (for a binary tree). Each split would correspond to a non-terminal that can be replaced by two other non-terminals, which then may themselves split further until we reach terminals.\n\nBut maybe let's see.\n\nThe initial string is: t26 t76 t67 t70 t94 t6 t4 t92.\n\nI can write this as [t26, t76, t67, t70, t94, t6, t4, t92].\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me think about possible starting points.\n\nI see that t26 is produced by NT9: NT9 \u2192 't26'.\n\nt76 is produced by NT85: NT85 \u2192 't76'.\n\nt67 is produced by NT84: NT84 \u2192 't67'.\n\nt70 is produced by NT2: NT2 \u2192 't70'.\n\nt94 comes from NT94, which can be either 't14' or 't94' if it's another production. Looking at the grammar, I see NT94 has two productions: one is \u2192 't14', and another is? Let me check the list again:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT94, I see:\n\nNT94 \u2192 't77'\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nYes, so NT94 produces either t77 or t14.\n\nSimilarly, t63 is produced by NT63, which can be 't36' or another non-terminal? Wait, I need to check each rule.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start from the entire string and try to see if the top-level non-terminals can correspond to the string. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the top-down approach, starting from the start symbol, S, and see if we can derive the string.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, the first step would be that the string starts with NT6 and NT58. So, S would produce NT6 and NT58, each of which then can be further expanded.\n\nBut wait, the string is made up of terminals, so each of the NT symbols in the parse tree will need to be expanded through production rules into sequences of terminals and NT symbols.\n\nLooking at NT6, from the grammar: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then, NT73 and NT62 can be further expanded. Let me follow this:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62,\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9,\nNT62 \u2192 NT84 NT9.\n\nSo substituting NT73 and NT62 in NT6's production:\n\nNT6 \u2192 (NT8 NT9) (NT84 NT9).\n\nSo S \u2192 NT6 NT58 becomes S \u2192 (NT8 NT9 NT84 NT9) NT58.\n\nThen NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So now, S \u2192 NT8 NT9 NT84 NT9 NT84 NT9.\n\nWait, that might not be correct because NT58's production could vary. Let me check all possible productions for NT58.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, I see NT58 has multiple productions. For example:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9,\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9,\nWait, no, perhaps I need to check each rule. Let me list the rules for NT58:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9,\nNT58 \u2192 NT95 NT69,\nNT58 \u2192 NT19 NT28,\nNT58 \u2192 NT95 NT69,\nAnd others. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in listing all.\n\nWait, let me go through the provided rules step by step.\n\nLooking for NT58:\n\nLine by line:\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT67 NT73,\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT92,\n\n... etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, actually, better to collect all the rules for each non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps instead of that, I can note that S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and both NT6 and NT58 need to be expanded.\n\nExpanding NT6 as before:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62,\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9,\nNT62 \u2192 NT84 NT9.\n\nSo NT6 becomes NT8 NT9 NT84 NT9.\n\nThen, NT58: Let's look at NT58's production rules.\n\nFrom the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't46' (from NT95 \u2192 't46'), but no. Wait, no. Wait, the rules for NT58 aren't listed, so perhaps I should collect all NT58 productions.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I don't immediately see NT58, but perhaps I need to collect them.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules, each starting with something like 'NTX -> ...', so I can list all the rules.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT74\u2192 NT9 NT66\nNT63\u2192 NT94 NT22\nNT95\u2192 NT9 NT69\nNT19\u2192 NT37 NT69\nNT65\u2192 NT38 NT84\nNT14\u2192 NT59 NT15\nNT50\u2192 NT93 NT6\nNT78\u2192 NT67 NT73\nNT56\u2192 NT9 NT19\nNT95\u2192 NT27 NT66\nNT9\u2192 NT68 NT40\nNT40\u2192 NT69 NT17\nNT34\u2192 NT58 NT65\nNT6\u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT36\u2192 NT79 NT2\nNT40\u2192 NT74 NT56\nNT84\u2192 NT34 NT93\nNT78\u2192 NT28 NT73\nNT58\u2192 NT84 NT9\nNT28\u2192 NT38 NT93\nNT2\u2192 NT44 NT14\nNT85\u2192 NT95 NT50\nNT68\u2192 NT63 NT67\nNT39\u2192 NT78 NT46\nNT85\u2192 NT87 NT55\nNT73\u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT78\u2192 NT52 NT80\nNT50\u2192 NT85 NT66"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-144","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t53 t6 t68 t46 t6 t96 t83 t13 t12` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals. So, I need to work backwards: start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The only production for S is S -> NT6 NT58. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT6 and NT58.\n\nBreaking that down, the string is t53 t6 t68 t46 t6 t96 t83 t13 t12. Wait, S starts with NT6 and NT58. NT6 and NT58 should correspond to the first two parts of the string. Let me see the productions for NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- NT58 -> NT84 NT9\n\nSo after expanding S, the first part is NT6, which goes to NT73 NT62. Similarly, NT58 goes to NT84 NT9. So the string should start with NT73, NT62, NT84, NT9.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t53, which is a terminal. So let me check which non-terminals derive to t53.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT69 -> 't67', NT79 -> 't67', NT74 -> 't77', NT55 -> 't92', etc. Wait, I'm looking for a production where the right-hand side is 't53'.\n\nLooking through the list, I notice NT73 has a rule NT73 -> 't53'. Yes, so NT73 can derive to t53. Similarly, looking at NT62, when does it produce a terminal? NT62 -> 't84' and NT97. So, t62 is derived from NT62 -> 't84', but the first token in the string after t53 is t6, which isn't t84. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the order wrong.\n\nWait, the string is t53 t6 t68 t46 t6 t96 t83 t13 t12. So after t53 comes t6, then t68, etc.\n\nSo, starting from S:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58, which is the first step.\n\nNow, NT6 -> NT73 NT62, so the first part is NT73, and the second part is NT62. So t53 is from NT73, which is correct as per NT73 -> 't53'.\n\nThen, NT62: does that derive to 't6'? Looking at the productions, NT62 -> 't84' and 't97'. Hmm, no 't6' there. What about NT62? Wait, perhaps I need to go further and see if NT62 can derive to something else, which then can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Let me try to parse the string as a series of steps.\n\nWait, in CNF, each expansion replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the string is built by replacing non-terminals, eventually producing terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each non-terminal in the process must eventually expand into a terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should look at the string as a sequence of terminals, starting from the first.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that when expanding NT6 and NT58, each expansion would produce two non-terminals, so we might need to look for how each non-terminal in the initial expansion can produce each part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform a matching approach: check if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the possible derivations from S.\n\nLet me try breaking the string into possible chunks based on the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t53 t6 t68 t46 t6 t96 t83 t13 t12.\n\nWe know the first two symbols are 't53' and 't6', but from S, S -> NT6 NT58, so the first production is to NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see if the string can be generated by expanding S and seeing if each expansion can match the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a recursive approach, trying to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, the parse trees will be binary, and each production corresponds to a split of the string into left and right parts.\n\nSo, the idea is to try to parse the string from the start, using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to reverse the process: start from the string and see if each non-terminal in the grammar can be reduced to the symbols in the string.\n\nIn other words, from the end of the string, try to match each terminal with the right-hand sides of the productions until we reach the start.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nThe string is: t53 t6 t68 t46 t6 t96 t83 t13 t12.\n\nWe'll start from the beginning. Let me list the symbols in order as a list: ['t53', 't6', 't68', 't46', 't6', 't96', 't83', 't13', 't12'].\n\nStarting from S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, we need to split the string into two parts, corresponding to NT6 and NT58.\n\nThe first part is the string generated by NT6, and the second part by NT58.\n\nSo, the question is, can the first k symbols be generated by NT6, and the remaining (9 - k) symbols by NT58.\n\nBut without knowing k, we'd need to try all possible splits. However, for a bottom-up approach, perhaps we can start from the end and work our way back.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think recursively. Each production can be matched by splitting the string into left and right parts. So, let's try that.\n\nStarting with the entire string, can we match any production at the top-level, which in this case is S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, S expands into NT6 and NT58. Thus, the string must be NT6's expansion followed by NT58's expansion.\n\nSo, the question is: can we split the string into two parts at some position k, such that the first k symbols can be derived from NT6 and the next (9 - k) symbols from NT58.\n\nLet me see what the possible splits are.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t53. From the grammar, which non-terminals produce t53?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT73 -> 't53'\n\nSo, NT73 can derive t53.\n\nSo, to derive t53, NT73 is the non-terminal that produces it.\n\nNow, considering NT73's production. Wait, NT73 is only on the left-hand side of the production: NT73 -> 't53'. So, NT73 can only produce t53, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, in the first step, the first symbol is t53, which can only be from NT73, and thus, our initial assumption is that the first part is NT6 -> ... which needs to derive into t53 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but S is expanding into NT6 and NT58. So, the first symbol comes from NT6's expansion. So, the first token, t53, must come from the first part, which is NT6's expansion.\n\nSo, let's see: NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nSo, the first expansion of NT6 is into two non-terminals: NT73 and NT62.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT73, which produces t53, and then NT62 must produce the next symbol.\n\nWait, but after t53, the next symbol is t6. So, the second token would be from NT62's expansion.\n\nBut wait, NT62 can derive into two things: NT62 -> 't84' or NT62 -> 't97'. So, t6 is neither of these, which suggests that this path is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's try again.\n\nWait, maybe splitting S into NT6 and NT58, the first part is NT6, which expands into NT73 and NT62. So, the string after expanding S is NT73 NT62 NT58.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S -> NT6 NT58, so when expanding S, the string starts with NT6 and ends with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-166","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down and try to understand what I need to do.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a weird format. It looks like all the productions are in the form of A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals except for some cases where a terminal (t followed by a number) appears on the right side. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t98 t3 t49 t46 t77 t25 t64 t39 t83 t46. \n\nI remember that CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So all the left-hand sides (LHS) should be single non-terminals, and all right-hand sides (RHS) should have exactly two non-terminals. Let me check a few productions to confirm. \n\nLooking at the grammar, most are in the form NTxy -> NTaz NTbt, so that fits. However, some productions have terminals on the RHS, like S -> NT6 NT58. But wait, in CNF, non-terminals should be on the RHS, but terminals are fine in the final string. So maybe that's okay as long as during parsing, we can substitute until we get all terminals.\n\nNow, the provided grammar also has some productions where non-terminals become terminals, like S -> NT6 NT58, then those non-terminals (NT6, NT58) have productions that eventually lead to terminals. But I'm a bit confused because the problem gives a string that's all terminals, so I need to build the derivation starting from S and see if it can produce that string.\n\nWait, but I'm not supposed to perform full derivation; just determine if the string can be generated. Maybe there's a more efficient way, like checking lengths and using the concept of the string being a certain length.\n\nIn CNF, the maximum length of a string derived from a non-terminal at depth n is 2^n. So for the string in question, which has 10 tokens (so length 10), let's see the depth.\n\nStarting from S. S can produce two non-terminals, say A and B. Each of these can produce two more non-terminals, so at depth 2, we have four non-terminals. At depth 3, eight, and so on. For a string of length n, the required depth is log2(n), but since n=10 isn't a power of 2, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, but the grammar in CNF can generate any string where the length of the string is \u2264 2^(depth), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Maybe I should instead check each production step to see if the string can be matched.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string into parts and see if each step matches a production rule.\n\nThe string is: t98 t3 t49 t46 t77 t25 t64 t39 t83 t46.\n\nLet me denote each token as a separate element, so the sequence is [t98, t3, t49, t46, t77, t25, t64, t39, t83, t46]. \n\nStarting with S, which according to the grammar, produces NT6 and NT58. So the first two tokens should match NT6 and NT58. \n\nLooking through the grammar, NT6 is a non-terminal that eventually becomes t6. Wait, but in the given string, the first token is t98. That doesn't match t6. So maybe S -> NT6 NT58 is not the right path here because t98 isn't t6. But wait, NT6 has a production that eventually becomes t63 -> 't36', t63 -> 't67', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions for NT6. Looking at the grammar, NT6 appears here: NT6 -> NT73 NT62. NT73 and NT62 have productions that lead to terminals. For example, NT73 can produce 't25', NT62 can produce 't97', so combining these, NT6 can generate t25 t97, which would be t25 t97 as a two-token string. But in our case, the first token is t98, which isn't t25 or t97. So perhaps S -> NT58 and NT66? Wait, no, S is only NT6 and NT58, no. Wait, S -> NT6 NT58. So the first two tokens should be NT6 and NT58, but our string starts with t98, which would not be generated by NT6 or NT58.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, NT58 has a production NT58 -> 't46' directly. Because in the provided rules: NT58 -> 't46'. So NT58 directly becomes t46. So maybe the first two tokens could be NT58 and something else, but according to the grammar, S is NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string starts with t98, which isn't t46, so perhaps the production from S is not applicable here. Maybe the string can't be derived from S because the first token t98 doesn't match any production.\n\nWait, but looking back, do any of the non-terminals produce t98? Let me check the grammar. Scanning through the rules, I see NT87 -> 't98', so NT87 can produce t98. But in S's productions, I don't see any S directly leading to t98. So perhaps the string can't be generated because the first token can't be matched by any production from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than what can be produced from S, considering the maximum length given the depth in the grammar. Since S is a single non-terminal, each step doubles the number of symbols, so at depth 1: 2^1=2 symbols. At depth 2: 4 symbols. Depth 3: 8. Depth 4:16. Our string is length 10, which is more than 8 but less than 16. So theoretically, it's possible, but perhaps in practice, the derivation doesn't match the given string.\n\nWait, but if starting from S, the first two symbols must be NT6 and NT58. Our string starts with t98, which must come from some NT. So unless there's a production that creates t98 from a non-terminal derived from NTsomething, but looking through the grammar, I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly becomes t98. The only way t98 can be generated is if some non-terminal on the RHS of a production becomes t98.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, are there any productions that result in t98? Looking through the list again, I see NT87 -> 't98'. So if a non-terminal NT87 is on the RHS of a production, it can generate t98.\n\nSo maybe the string starts with a production that involves NT87 somewhere. But S itself is NT6 and NT58, so the first two symbols must come from these non-terminals. So if our string starts with t98, perhaps the first symbol t98 comes from NT87, but where would NT87 come from? If S produces a non-terminal NT87, but according to the grammar, that's not the case. S only produces NT6 and NT58.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me try to see if the given string can be split into the productions.\n\nThe string is 10 tokens: t98, t3, t49, t46, t77, t25, t64, t39, t83, t46.\n\nIf we start from S, the first two symbols must be NT6 and NT58. So the first two tokens should be the results of NT6 and NT58. \n\nLooking at NT58's production: NT58 can produce 't46' directly. So if the second token in the string is t46, that would be a match. Let's check the string: the second token is t3. That doesn't match t46, so that would imply that the second symbol is coming from some other production, but according to the grammar, the second symbol must come from NT58, which directly is t46. So the second token t3 doesn't match that, which suggests that this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S has another production I'm missing, but no\u2014the grammar only has one production for S: S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nSo that means the first symbol must come from NT6 and the second from NT58. In our case, first is t98 (from NT6?), but NT6's only production leads to t73 and t62, and then those non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-167","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string I'm looking at is `t76 t70 t53 t44 t79 t36 t25 t16 t64 t76`. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with Chomsky normal form grammars, each production rule starts from a non-terminal and produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, I need to see if this string can be derived step by step using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's all terminals except for the non-terminals. Each terminal is a specific character followed by two digits, like 't76'. The first thing I notice is that each 't' part corresponds to a production where a non-terminal is associated with that 't' and two numbers, like 't76' comes from 'NT79' in some production.\n\nLet me go through each 't' in the string and see which NT it comes from:\n\n1. `t76`: Looking at the productions, I see NT79 -> t79 t75. So, `t76` doesn't directly correspond. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check the list again. Oh, wait, I see in the productions, NT79 has some rules. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should work backwards, starting from the overall structure. The grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58. So the entire string must be built from NT6 and NT58 expanded into terminals. So, the string is the result of expanding NT6 and NT58 into terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, it's ten 't's, each with two digits. Since each NT expands into two terminals, S produces two NTs, each eventually expanding into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, the string has 10 terminal symbols, so possibly each NT expands into five terminals. But wait, let me count: the string is `t76 t70 t53 t44 t79 t36 t25 t16 t64 t76`. That's ten terminals, which is 5 pairs. So each NT would expand into five terminals, which seems possible.\n\nLet me start by trying to map each 'txx' to their NT production. For example, 't76' is from NT79 because looking at the rules, NT79 -> t79 t75. Wait, that gives two 't's, so I guess it's paired with another NT.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Maybe I should track the NTs being expanded and see how the string is built.\n\nLet me try to list out all the 't's with their numbers:\n\nt76 (NT76?) Wait, looking at the productions, I see that some NTs produce 't's. For example, NT46 -> t87, so 't87' is from NT46. But in the given string, I don't see 't87', but I do see 't76', 't70', etc.\n\nLet me go through each term:\n\n1. t76: Looking for NT that produces t76 as a terminal. Looking at the rules, I don't see any NT directly leading to t76 except possibly NT56? Wait, NT56->t72. Hmm, not matching. NT59->t67. No. Maybe NT38->t68, but no. Wait, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me look for where 't76' appears. Looking at the rules, I see that NT95->t95 t6, so 't95' and '6'. Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each 'txx' in the productions. For example, NT76 isn't a production because in the rules, the left-hand sides are NT74, NT63, etc., except some have '-> t' something. \n\nLet me list all the NTs that have terminal productions:\n\n- NT74 -> t77\n- NT39 -> t3\n- NT94 -> t14\n- NT73 -> t25\n- NT50 -> t96\n- NT59 -> t67\n- NT27 -> t4\n- NT38 -> t68\n- NT22 -> t87\n- NT9 -> t26\n- NT46 -> t87\n- NT39 -> t58 (duplicate)\n- NT2 -> t9, t6, t70, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to see that each NT can only produce two terminals or another NT and another NT. So, the entire string must be a result of expanding S into two NTs, which in turn expand further, each step replacing a single NT with two NTs, until all are terminals.\n\nSo, the string has ten 't's, which suggests that each NT expands into a series of terminals. Since each expansion replaces one NT with two, the number of NTs increases until we reach the terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in each step, each NT is replaced by two symbols, which can be NTs or terminals. So, starting with S (which is two NTs: NT6 and NT58), the first expansion is two NTs. Then each of those can split into two, so four after two steps, etc. The total number of symbols in the string would be 2^k where k is the number of splits, starting from 2.\n\nWait, but our string is 10 terms, so 10 is not a power of 2, which is confusing because each expansion would produce an even number of symbols. For example: S -> NT6 NT58 (2). Then each of those would lead to more, so maybe 4, then 8, etc.? But 10 is not a power of 2, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe the string is not a direct expansion but includes multiple layers. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to see if all the 't's in the string have corresponding non-terminals that can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct the parse tree. Let's try to see if each step makes sense.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT6 NT58. So, NT6 and NT58 must each be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT6: From the rules, NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nSo, NT6 becomes NT73 and NT62. Then, each of those needs to be expanded.\n\nNT73: NT73->t8 NT9.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT73->t8 NT9? Wait, no, in the rules: NT73->t8 NT9? Wait, looking back, I see NT73 is in several rules, but in the specific string given, I have 't76 t70 t53...' etc. Wait, perhaps that's not matching.\n\nWait, no, in the given rules, NT73 has some productions. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT73->t8 NT9? Let me check the given rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT73 -> t8 NT9? Wait, no, in the provided list, NT73 is written as:\n\nLooking at the string of rules, I don't see NT73; instead, from S I go to NT6 and NT58. NT6 is:\n\n- NT6->NT73 NT62\n- NT6->NT74 NT63\n\nWait, no, looking again, the rules for NT6 are:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- NT6 -> NT74 NT63\n- etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I have t76 and t70, so maybe NT76 is somewhere. But looking through the rules, I don't see NT76; then again, maybe the string has t76, but the NTs don't directly generate that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me start tracking each NT step by step.\n\nFirst, S expands to NT6 and NT58. Let's take NT6 first.\n\nNT6 can expand into NT73 and NT62.\n\nNow, NT73 can expand into ... From the rules, looking back:\n\nI don't see NT73 having a production in the given rules except perhaps the ones that lead to 't' strings. Wait, I don't see NT73-> anything in the given rules. Let's check again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, the NTs are listed as:\n\nNT74, NT63, NT95, NT19, NT65, NT14, NT50, NT78, NT56, NT95 again, NT9, NT40, NT34, NT6, NT36, NT56 again, NT59, NT52, NT37, NT39, etc.\n\nWait, I don't see NT73 being"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string I need to check.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It starts with S -> NT6 NT58. So the start symbol S must expand into two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. Each of these, I assume, can further expand into other non-terminals or terminals. The right-hand sides of these rules don't have any terminals except in some of the productions. Wait, actually, some rules do end up producing terminals after several expansions. For example, NT9 -> NT68 NT40, but I see that NT68 and NT40 eventually resolve to 't6' and 't44' respectively. So, I need to see if the string can be constructed by expanding S using these rules and replacing each non-terminal with the corresponding terminal as per the rules.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. The string is: t14 t68 t13 t94 t26 t16 t55 t36 t79 t72 t27. So it's a bunch of t<numbers>, where each t<xy> represents a terminal symbol. I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nStarting from S, the first step is to expand S into NT6 NT58. So, each of these non-terminals (NT6 and NT58) must be expanded further until we reach the terminals.\n\nLooking at NT58, the production is NT58 -> NT84 NT9. Then, NT84 goes to NT34 NT93, and NT34 to NT58 NT65. Wait, but NT58 is appearing again, which seems like a loop. Maybe I should check if I'm tracking correctly. Let's see another approach: perhaps I should build the parse tree for the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to traverse the string step by step, trying to match the non-terminals and their expansions. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t14. Which production results in t14? Looking at the grammar, I see NT22 -> t87 and NT73 -> t25, but is there a production for t14? Yes, there's NT2 -> 't70', but that's not 14. Wait, let me check the rewrite rules again.\n\nWait, the rules have several NT<XX> and NT<XX> -> ... where sometimes a rule results in t<YY>. For example, NT69 -> 't67' and so on. So, I need to look for non-terminals that can expand into each of the t-strings in the string.\n\nLet me list all the t-strings and see which non-terminals they come from:\n\n- t14: Where does t14 come from? Looking through the rules, I see NT2 -> 't70', but I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t14. Wait, maybe it's from a rule that eventually reduces. For example, NT27 -> 't4', but that's not 14. Alternatively, perhaps a longer path. Let's check each token to see if there's a matching non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe some non-terminals derive to t14. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT62 -> 't84'\n- NT80 -> 't22'\n- NT94 -> 't14' (Yes! There's a rule: NT94 -> 't14')\nSo t14 is produced directly by NT94.\n\nBut let's look at each token in the string and see which non-terminals they come from:\n\n1. t14: derived from NT94\n2. t68: Let's see, is there a non-terminal that produces t68? Looking at the rules, NT66 -> 't96' and NT2 -> 't6', but not directly. Wait, maybe NT38 -> 't68'. Let's check: Yes, the production NT38 -> 't68' exists. So t68 comes from NT38.\n\n3. t13: Looking for a non-terminal that produces t13. Not directly, but perhaps via production NT69 -> 't67' and NT79 -> 't67'. Wait, no. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe NT65 -> 't72' and NT9 -> 't26'. Hmm, maybe NT22 -> t87? Not matching. Wait, looking for t13. Maybe NT95 -> 't13'? Let's check. Yes, the production NT95 -> 't13' exists. So t13 comes from NT95.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The production for NT95 is: NT95 -> NT9 NT69, right? So to get t13, it's the result of NT95 -> 't13'? Wait no, looking back, I see that NT95 -> 't13' exists. Wait, looking at the rules, yes: one rule says NT95 -> 't13'. So t13 is directly from NT95.\n\nSo, token 3: t13 comes from NT95.\n\nNext token: t94. Looking for a non-terminal that produces t94. There's NT2 -> 't70' which isn't 94. Wait, looking at the rules: Wait, NT94 -> 't14', which is where the first token comes from, but is there a rule that generates t94? Let me check the rules again. Oh, yes, look: NT94 is directly produced by NT95 -> NT95 -> 't13', which isn't 94. Wait, no, I think I got confused. Let me list all the terminals and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nTerminals in the string:\n\n- t14: from NT94\n- t68: from NT38\n- t13: from NT95\n- t94: Wait, perhaps NT94 is itself. Wait, but in the string, it's t94. Looking for a non-terminal that produces t94. Oh, I see: NT29 may produce it, but I don't see that. Wait, wait, perhaps NT93 -> 't93', but no, in the string, it's t94.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT95 -> 't13', but I don't see any rule that produces t94 except itself.

{"custom_id":"request-190","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t44 t13 t53 t72 t97 t58 t83 t25 t97 t83 t12`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules on the left of the arrow have two non-terminals on the right except for the terminal symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which is two non-terminals. So, the grammar seems to be in proper CNF.\n\nThe task is to determine if the string can be derived by the grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals, each separated by a space. Each token here is a terminal symbol. The string length is 11 tokens, which might correspond to a parse tree with a certain structure.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to attempt a bottom-up parsing using the given grammar or a top-down approach with recursive descent. However, given the complexity, maybe a more manual approach would be better. Since the string is only 11 tokens, it's manageable.\n\nFirst, I need to map the string tokens to the terminals in the grammar. Each token should be a terminal in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, I see productions where terminals are on both sides, like NT9 -> 't77', so each rule ends when a terminal is reached.\n\nFor example, NT9 can produce 't77' directly. So, when looking at the string, if a token starts with 't', it's a terminal, and the number determines which rule it corresponds to. For example, 't44' corresponds to NT46 because looking at the grammar, NT46 \u2192 't28'.\n\nWait, let me clarify that. The grammar has several NT rules that directly produce terminals. Each terminal production is unique to a specific NT, right? For example:\n\nNT94 -> 't14'\nNT73 -> 't25'\nNT79 -> 't16'\nNT63 -> 't36'\nNT15 -> 't94'\nNT69 -> 't67'\nNT46 -> 't28'\nNT66 -> 't96'\nNT79 -> 't27'\nNT94 -> 't14'\nNT2 -> 't70', etc.\n\nBut wait, some NTs have multiple production rules. For example, NT69 has several production rules:\n\nNT69 -> NT46 NT17\nand also NT66 -> 't96'\n\nWait no, NT69 is only in one production. Wait, looking back, I think I might have miscounted. Let me go step by step.\n\nWait, the grammar is extensive, and each NT has multiple rules. NT69 has two production rules: NT69 -> NT46 NT17 and NT66 -> 't96'. Wait, no, actually looking back, I think I need to parse each line.\n\nWait, each line starts with an NT on the left, and then the right side. For example, the first line is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Then, each NT is defined by multiple rules, e.g., NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66, etc. However, some NTS have only one production, like NT79: NT79 \u2192 't27' which is one production rule. But other NTS, like NT66: NT66 \u2192 't96' and also another rule?\n\nWait, looking again, I see that some NTS are defined by single rules, others have multiple. For example:\n\nNT77 is used in several places, but I need to focus on the string tokens.\n\nThe given string is `t44 t13 t53 t72 t97 t58 t83 t25 t97 t83 t12`.\n\nSo, each token is 't' followed by a two-digit number, except maybe for two-digit numbers? Wait, no, actually each token is exactly 't' followed by two digits, like 't44', 't13', etc.\n\nSo, each token is a specific terminal, and I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe plan is to start with the string as a sequence of terminals and try to find a way to generate it by the grammar. Since we're going bottom-up, I can try to match the string tokens to the grammar rules by checking if any production can reduce to the string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree from the bottom up, starting from the string and trying to match the productions. Alternatively, I could try to see if the string can be generated by considering the derivation steps.\n\nLet me see if each token appears as a terminal in the grammar. For example, 't44' is produced by NT46 -> 't44'? Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't28' and another NT for 't44'? Let me check all terminal rules.\n\nWait, going through each line:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't14'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT79 \u2192 't16'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT66 \u2192 't96'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT94 \u2192 't14' (same as above)\n- NT2 \u2192 't70'\n- NT94 \u2192 't14'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT66 \u2192 't96'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT94 \u2192 't14'\n- NT2 \u2192 't70'\n- NT36 \u2192 't64'\n- NT56 \u2192 't72'\n- NT69 \u2192 't13'\n- NT87 \u2192 't98'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- NT38 \u2192 't68'\n- NT22 \u2192 't87'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87'\n- NT39 \u2192 't58'\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\nWait, is 't53' a terminal in the grammar? Looking through the terminal rules, I don't see 't53' as a terminal. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check each line.\n\nWait, looking through all the lines, for example, I don't see any terminal production for 't53'. So, 't53' may not be a terminal and might be part of a non-terminal that can derive into something that includes it. But that complicates things because then we need to see if the string can be embedded within a derivation that includes 't53' indirectly.\n\nWait, but the string is `t44 t13 t53 t72 t97 t58 t83 t25 t97 t83 t12`. That means the parser sees 't53' as a terminal, but looking at the grammar, is there any NT that can produce 't53'? Looking through all the lines, I don't see any NT ending with 't53'. So maybe 't53' is a problem because it's not directly a terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me double-check. For example, looking for 't53' in all the NT production rules, there's nothing. So 't53' would have to be derived from some non-terminal NT rule. But in that case, the string would require that 't53' is part of a larger derivation, which would imply that in the parse tree, this 't53' terminal would have to be a child of a higher NT that can produce a non-terminal in the correct way. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake here because if 't53' isn't a terminal, then the string cannot be generated, but that's not necessarily the case. Maybe 't53' is part of an intermediate step in the derivation. Let me look again at the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't14'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT79 \u2192 't16'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT66 \u2192 't96'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT94 \u2192 't14'\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and how it can generate strings.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with the start symbol S, which is defined as NT6 NT58. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT6 and NT58. Then, I need to see what these symbols can become.\n\nLooking at NT6: It can be expanded into NT73 NT62 or 't73' 't62'. NT58 can be NT84 NT9 or 't84' 't9'. Both NT73 and NT84 have productions that lead to 't's. \n\nWait, let me check the productions step by step. Starting from S: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Let's break this down. NT6 can produce 't73' or NT73 and NT62. NT73's production is either 't73' or 't8' and NT9. Similarly, NT73\u2192't77' because I see NT73 \u2192 't77' somewhere in the rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, NT73 appears multiple times, but one of its productions is NT73 \u2192 't77'. So, NT73 could be a terminal or go further. So, if I take NT6 \u2192 't73', then NT58 \u2192 't84' and NT9. Let's see what NT9 does. NT9 \u2192 't26' or NT68 and NT40.\n\nHmm, proceeding, let me try to break down the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t82 t83 t82 t98 t97 t27 t53 t39 t55 t3.\n\nI need to match this string from the start symbol S, expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.

So if NT6 is 't73', but the string starts with t82, so that's a mismatch. Therefore, NT6 must expand to NT73 NT62, and then NT73 must produce 't82' somehow. Wait, does NT73 have a production that results in 't82'? Looking back, I don't see NT73 \u2192 't82' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT73's productions again. The grammar for NT73 includes NT73 \u2192 't77', and also there's NT78 \u2192 't73' somewhere.

Chomsky Normal Form means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly one non-terminal or a terminal on the right. The grammar starts with S, and each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the given string and try to see if I can break it down using the grammar rules. The string is: t26 t4 t72 t63 t87 t97 t28 t76 t22 t84 t9 t6.\n\nI notice that some parts of the string are terminals, which are specific words like 't26', 't4', etc. Others might be non-terminals, represented by rules in the grammar. I should check which non-terminals can produce each segment of the string.\n\nLet me go step by step, starting from the beginning of the string.\n\n1. The string starts with 't26'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't26'. So, NT9 can produce 't26'. So, the first symbol is matched by NT9.\n\nNow, the next part should somehow derive from NT9. Let's look at the grammar for NT9.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\nNT9 -> NT68 NT40\nAlso, looking at NT9's rules again, perhaps it's only one rule. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the full list, NT9 is only in one rule: NT9 -> NT68 NT40. Or wait, wait, let me parse the full list:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some are for NT94, NT95, etc. Let me see NT9 rules. Wait, looking through the list, the rules where NT9 is on the left:\n\nYes, here:\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT40. So, NT9 can only produce NT68 and NT40.\n\nSo, the first part is 't26' which is NT9, and the next must be NT9's expansion, which is NT68 and NT40.\n\nSo, the first two symbols would be 't26' (NT9) followed by whatever NT68 and NT40 generate.\n\nWait, but the string is 't26 t4 t72 ...', so after 't26' comes 't4'. Let's see:\n\nAfter NT9, the next part is 't4'. Let's see what sequences could produce 't4' after NT68 and NT40.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me structure this as a parsing process. I'll try to break down the string step by step, checking each possible production.\n\nSo, the string is: t26 t4 t72 t63 t87 t97 t28 t76 t22 t84 t9 t6\n\nFirst symbol: t26. That comes from NT9. So NT9 is applied, which produces NT68 and NT40.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t4. So, looking at NT68 and NT40:\n\nNT68: Let me check, looking for NT68's production. Wait, in the list, I don't see a direct production for NT68, but perhaps via its rules. Wait, the grammar is in CNF, so each non-terminal has productions that are pairs.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the productions for each NT where possible.\n\nLet me list possible productions for each NT that appear in the string.\n\nFirst, t26 is NT9 \u2192 t26. So, after NT9 is used, we have NT68 and NT40.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't4'. So, looking at NT68 and NT40:\n\nNT68's production: I need to find which NT has a production that leads to 't4'. Looking through the grammar, 't4' appears as part of NT68's production? Let me check.\n\nWait, 't4' is given by NT38 \u2192 't68'? Or maybe I'm mixing variables. Wait, the grammar rules look a bit confusing because the right-hand sides are combinations of NTs and terminals, but some are terminals like 't26', 't4', etc. So, for example, NT95 is sometimes equal to 't14', 't77', etc.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to reverse engineer this. Each time a production rule is applied, it can produce a combination of non-terminals or some terminal. So, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if it can derive the string.\n\nBut given the string, perhaps a top-down approach is better, trying to match the string symbol by symbol using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, considering the string, which has 12 terminals, perhaps the derivation requires 12 steps from S, each time expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nWait, another approach is to look at the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down into the non-terminal productions.\n\nLet's break the string into tokens: t26, t4, t72, t63, t87, t97, t28, t76, t22, t84, t9, t6.\n\nEach token is either a terminal or derived from a non-terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S. S is initially 'S'. From the first production, S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nWait, no: the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, S can be written as NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, no: Look again. The production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, S can only produce NT6 and NT58 together.\n\nSo, starting with S, the first two symbols must be NT6 and NT58. But wait, that's not the case in the string; the first symbol is t26, which is NT9, not NT6.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Because S's first production is NT6 and NT58, but the string starts with t26, which is NT9.\n\nWait, that can't be. So, either the string cannot be generated by the grammar, or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the productions. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking back: The first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, S produces NT6 followed by NT58. But wait, NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals, so each can be expanded further. But the string starts with t26, which is NT9.\n\nThis suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first step from S must be NT6 followed by NT58, and t26 isn't NT6. Alternatively, perhaps S has other productions, but looking at the grammar, it doesn't seem so. The first production is the only one for S.\n\nWait, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT6 followed by NT58. So, S can start with NT6, which expands into some sequence, but the initial part of the string would start with the production of NT6.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t26, which is NT9, so that would imply that the first production in S is not the one used here.\n\nWait, unless my understanding is wrong. Maybe NT6 and NT58 produce something else. Let me check NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking for NT6: Let's see if NT6 has any production. From the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT97, etc. So NT6 is a non-terminal that expands into two other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 has a production: NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9, which then can expand further.\n\nSo, for the string to start with t26 (NT9), that seems incompatible because the first production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which would start with NT6, leading to symbols derived from NT6, not NT9.\n\nUnless the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT1, but in the given grammar, the only production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the only way S can produce the string is if the first part is NT6 leading to t26.\n\nBut that seems impossible because NT6's productions are non-terminals, and none of the terminals at the start would be t26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S's only production S \u2192 NT6 NT58 somehow directly gives t26, but that's not possible as the productions are for non-terminals, which have to expand into other symbols or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking that S's first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Let me look at the grammar again.\n\nThe grammar is given as:\nS -> NT6 NT58\nOther productions are for NTs.\n\nSo, the only production for S is to split into NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. All non-terminals are on the left side of the arrows, and each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT63 NT58. So, every string derived from this grammar will start with the concatenation of the two expansions of NT63 and NT58.\n\nLet me write down the initial expansions to see how the string is built. Starting with S \u2192 NT63 NT58.\n\nNow, each of NT63 and NT58 can expand further. Let's look at NT63 and NT58:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nSo, the initial step gives us NT63 NT58 \u2192 NT94 NT22 NT84 NT9.\n\nNext, I need to expand each of these NTs as much as possible until all are terminals. Let's take each NT one by one.\n\nNT94: Looking at the rules, NT94 \u2192 't77'. So that's a terminal, so it's done.\n\nNT22: NT22 \u2192 't87'. That's also a terminal.\n\nNow, looking at NT84: NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93.\n\nSo, NT84 becomes NT34 NT93.\n\nNow, expand NT34: NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65.\n\nSo now, NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9 (as before).\n\nWait, this seems like a recursion.

Maybe I can track the string being built by each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the given string: `t46 t70 t6 t22 t8 t95 t8 t82 t14 t76 t27 t8 t7`.\n\nI notice that some of the terminals are terminals in the grammar, while others are not. For example, 't70' corresponds to NT2 \u2192 't70' (from the rules, looking back at the provided list, yes, NT2 \u2192 't70'. So 't70' is a terminal that comes from NT2.\n\nSimilarly, 't6' is from NT6 \u2192 't73' and NT73 \u2192 't25', but that's not a terminal. Wait, no, wait. Looking back:\n\nFrom the rules, NT22 \u2192 't87', NT27 \u2192 't4', NT34 \u2192 't36', NT36 \u2192 't64', NT38 \u2192 't68', and so on. So I need to see which parts of the string can be broken down into the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create a parse tree by grouping the terminals according to the grammar. Let's try to go step by step.\n\nThe string is: t46 t70 t6 t22 t8 t95 t8 t82 t14 t76 t27 t8 t7.\n\nLet me break it into parts, perhaps starting from the start symbol.\n\nS \u2192 NT63 NT58.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT63 followed by NT58.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22, so the first part is NT94 NT22.\n\nLooking in the string, the first two terminals are t46 and t70. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the string is: t46, t70, t6, t22, ... So t46 is the first, then t70. Let me see if t46 and t70 can correspond to NT94 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT94: NT94 \u2192 't94' (from the rules: NT94 \u2192 't14'). Wait, no, looking back, in the rules provided, I see that NT94 \u2192 't14' is the correct expansion, right?\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of rules. Let me check: There's a line 'NT94 -> 't77''. Another line 'NT2 -> 't9' etc.\n\nWait, looking carefully, the rules:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- ...\n\nSo, NT94 \u2192 't77'. So 't77' is a terminal derived from NT94.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 't87'.\n\nSo, in the string, after S \u2192 NT63 NT58, which then becomes NT94 NT22 NT84 NT9, so the initial part is 't77 t87 ...'\n\nBut in our string, the first two are 't46' and 't70'. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not assume S \u2192 NT63 NT58 as the first expansion, but rather check if the string can be formed by starting with S and expanding step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given string does not start with 't77 t87', which suggests that it's not generated by the grammar. So, perhaps the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but before jumping to conclusions, perhaps I should check if any of the other symbols can be expanded differently. For example, maybe the initial S can be expanded into a different sequence.\n\nWait, the grammar is given, and all S's are replaced by NT63 NT58, so the string must start with the expansion of NT63 followed by NT58. Therefore, the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the terminals resulting from expanding NT63 and NT58.\n\nLooking back, NT63 expands to NT94 NT22. So NT94 \u2192 't77' and NT22 \u2192 't87'. Thus, the first two symbols in the generated string must be 't77 t87'.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't46 t70', which does not match. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22\n   From the rules, yes, NT94 \u2192 't77' and NT22 \u2192 't87'.\n   \nTherefore, the initial part must be 't77 t87', but in the given string, it's 't46 t70'. So unless 't46' is something else, which perhaps it's generated by another NT.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the string is broken down in a different way. Perhaps the initial expansion of S isn't directly as I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the start symbol works. In CNF, the start symbol S can be expanded into NT63 NT58, which in turn expand into terminals or other NTs. So the generated string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT63 and NT58.\n\nBut in the given string, the first two terminals are 't46' and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Chomsky normal form means each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, actually, CNF can also have two non-terminals, so each production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's a series of productions where each rule starts with a non-terminal and is either replacing with two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which means S is replaced by two non-terminals. Then each of those NTs are replaced further until we hit terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t6 t46 t63 t39 t96 t74 t53 t76 t4 t76 t46 t64 t67 t92`. So, I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar starting from S.\n\nOne approach is to try to reverse-engineer the string. Starting from the string, see if it can be parsed according to the grammar, essentially using a bottom-up approach or looking for productions that match the substring.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree from the top-down starting from S and see if I can reach the string. But since the string is quite long, building the parse tree might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother method is to check if each part of the string can be derived from the non-terminals. Maybe I can look for known production chains in the grammar and see if the string can be broken into parts matching those.\n\nLet me first list out all the productions and their terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NTs directly produce terminals, like NT6 \u2192 't6', NT46 \u2192 't46', etc. So, each of these could be a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if each token in the string can be produced by some NT rule.\n\nLet me go through each token:\n\n1. t6: Yes, NT6 \u2192 t6\n2. t46: Yes, NT46 \u2192 t46\n3. t63: Yes, NT63 \u2192 t63\n4. t39: Yes, NT39 \u2192 t39\n5. t96: Yes, NT96 \u2192 t96\n6. t74: Yes, NT74 \u2192 t74\n7. t53: Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT53 as a terminal. The productions for NT53 aren't present. So, t53 isn't directly produced by any NT rule. Hmm, that might be a red flag. Let me check again. Did I miss any?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't53', I see in NT78 \u2192 NT53 NT73, so NT78 becomes NT53 (which isn't a terminal) and NT73. But is NT73 a terminal? Let me check. NT73 \u2192 't25' because the production is NT73 \u2192 t25. So, if NT73 can produce t25, then perhaps NT53 can be linked further. Wait, but in the given grammar, NT53 isn't a terminal, so unless there's a production like NT53 \u2192 something else, it's not a terminal. So, unless there's a rule for NT53 \u2192 t53, it can't be a terminal. Since I don't see that, t53 is part of a non-terminal NT53, which can't be directly parsed. So that would mean that the string can't be parsed beyond that point, but wait, is that the case?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look through all the NTs again to see if any have t53 as a terminal. Scanning the list, I don't see any NT that directly produce t53. Therefore, t53 must be part of a non-terminal NT53, which requires that the string can be split further to produce NT53 and something else. But in the string, t53 is followed by t76, so let's see if that works.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let's approach it differently. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each must be matched by a production. So, if any token in the string can't be matched by a terminal, then the string isn't valid.\n\nLooking at the string each token is followed by another, so each must correspond to a non-terminal that can produce that terminal, or perhaps it's better to see the top-down approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use memoization to track possible derivations.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the entire string being built starting from S.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so perhaps I can split it into parts that match sub-strings which can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look at each part of the string and see if it can be matched by applying the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be generated by the given grammar step by step.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nSo, the string must start with the two parts generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nLet's see what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t6\n\nNT58 \u2192 t84? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT58 \u2192 t84. So, S produces t6 followed by NT84.\n\nWait, NT84 \u2192 t40? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through, NT84 \u2192 t84.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT6, but wait, I might have misread.\n\nLooking back, the productions:\n\nLooking for NT58, I see NT58 \u2192 t84. So, NT58 \u2192 t84.\n\nTherefore, S \u2192 NT6 \u2192 t6, and NT58 \u2192 t84.\n\nSo S's production is t6 followed by t84.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t6, then t46, etc. So, in the string, after t6 comes t46, which is part of NT46, so that might not directly follow S's initial production, which is t6 followed by t84. So maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nWhich means S can produce NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nThen, NT6 \u2192 t6, as we saw.\n\nNT58 \u2192 t84, as per the rule.\n\nSo, S \u2192 t6 t84.\n\nBut the given string starts with t6, but then the next token is t46, not t84. So that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something. Maybe the string can be broken down in a different way or perhaps the grammar can derive the string through a different route.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me try to represent the grammar more clearly.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, the entire string must be a concatenation of two parts: one derived from NT6 and another from NT58.\n\nGiven that, the string is `t6 t46 t63 t39 t96 t74 t53 t76 t4 t76 t46 t64 t67 t92`.\n\nSo, the first part must be the derivation of NT6, which is t6, and the second part must be the derivation of NT58.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT58 \u2192 t84, but the given string's second part starts with t46, which is NT46 \u2192 t46.\n\nBut that doesn't align with NT58 being t84. Hmm, maybe there's a different production for NT58 that I'm missing. Let me check again the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\nLooking for NT58, indeed the only rule is NT58 \u2192 t84, so that's the end.\n\nSo, that means the string can only consist of t6 followed by t84, but the entire string provided is much longer and includes t46 and others, which suggests that perhaps my initial analysis is incorrect or perhaps the string is not derived from S, which is supposed to produce t6 t84.\n\nSo, that would mean that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it doesn't match the initial production.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nBut perhaps S can also be derived in another way if there are other productions, but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-243","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me recall what I know about CNF and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, CNF means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production produces either two non-terminals or a single terminal. This structure should help in parsing the string because it affects the possible ways the string can be derived.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58. So the entire string should start with two non-terminals that eventually produce t68 and t87, respectively, according to the rules.\n\nLooking at the string: `t68 t87 t22 t40 t9 t46 t3 t76 t4 t94 t46 t8 t22 t27`\n\nBreaking it down, the first two symbols are 't68' and 't87', which correspond to the first two parts of S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, NT6 should produce 't68' and NT58 should produce 't87'.\n\nLet me check the grammar for NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6: its productions include rules that eventually lead to terminals. The rules for NT6 include NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. Wait, maybe I should trace the derivation step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nSo, NT6 and NT58 must derive to certain strings. Let's focus on NT6 first.\n\nNT6's rules:\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 (from S production, but S's production is fixed)\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently. Each non-terminal can be expanded until it reaches terminals.\n\nSince the string starts with 't68', that would have to come from NT6, and the next 't87' from NT58. So, the string is t68 t87 followed by a sequence that presumably starts with NT6's and NT58's expansions.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, which must be the result of expanding all the non-terminals in the derivation down to terminals.\n\nWait, let's get back. The string starts with t68 t87. So, the first non-terminal must expand to t68, and the second to t87.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9's rule has NT95 as a child, which in turn has various paths. Also, NT6 has a production to NT73 NT62. Let's see:\n\nNT6:\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nThen, looking at NT73:\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 has:\nNT8 \u2192 NT12\n\nWait, but in the string, after t68 comes t87, which is a single terminal. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps I should build a parse tree or at least try to see if each terminal in the string can be matched as per the grammar.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation must be such that each production adds exactly one non-terminal, leading to the string length being n = 2^k, where k is the number of steps. But the given string has 14 symbols, which is 2^something? 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, so it's between. Wait, no, the string length is 14, which isn't a power of 2, which might indicate that the string isn't in the language, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's allowed because some steps might lead to multiple non-terminals at the same time.\n\nWait, in CNF, each step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals can increase until eventually, they all are terminals. The string has 14 symbols. Let me count the number of non-terminals in each step.\n\nWait, another approach: the string's length can be written as the product of the number of steps. Since each step can produce two, the number of symbols produced is a sum of powers of 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of symbols in the string must be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of variables in the derivation. But 14 is 15-1, which is 2^4 -1 =15, but 14 is not 15. So perhaps that means it's not a valid derivation.\n\nWait, let me think. Starting with S, which is two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. Each of these must expand into a string of terminal symbols and other non-terminals. The entire string is a concatenation of these.\n\nBut perhaps the key issue is whether each terminal can be derived from the correct non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols, t68 and t87. So, NT6 should derive to t68, and NT58 should derive to t87.\n\nLet me check the grammar for NT6:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT8 \u2192 NT12\nNT12 \u2192 NT36 NT93\nNT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2\nNT79 \u2192 NT27 NT67\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t68, we have t87. How does t87 come into play? Because the first symbol after t68 is t87, which is the result of NT58.\n\nWait, now I'm a bit confused because NT58 is the second part, so it's supposed to produce t87. So perhaps the string should start with t68 followed by the expansion of NT58, which should start with t87.\n\nSo let me see what NT58's derivation is. The grammar for NT58 includes various rules. For example, NT58 \u2192 NT95 NT55. Wait, no, the given grammar is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, NT95 \u2192 rules, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the full grammar, I see that NT58 has the production NT58 \u2192 NT95 NT66. Let me check what NT95 does:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69, which then can split into NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, and so on.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIf NT58 \u2192 NT95 NT66, then NT95 would derive to (some string) and NT66 would also derive to a string.\n\nLooking at NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69, and NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, which directly gives us 't68' and 't40' as two terminals. Similarly, NT69 \u2192 NT84 NT93, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the entire NT58's derivation would eventually result in a string that starts with 't87'.\n\nBut looking at the string, after t68 comes t87, then t22, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a bug in my initial thought. Let me reorient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's symbols can be matched step by step in the derivation.\n\nBut this might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps the string is not in the language because the last three symbols are t27, which is generated by NT27 \u2192 't4', but wait, in the given grammar, NT27 \u2192 't4' but in the string, we have t27, which is 't27', but wait, no, in the given grammar for NT27, it's:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't4'\nBut in the string, after several steps, the last three symbols are t22 t27.\n\nWait, in the string, I have ... t22 t27. So, the last two symbols are t22 and t27.\n\nBut in the grammar, let's look for t27:\n\nNT27 productions include 't4', which is a terminal. Also, NT22 \u2192 't87'. Wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, looking for how 't27' is generated.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT27 \u2192 't4' is one of its productions. But in the string, the last symbol is t27, which is 't27' according to the user. Wait, no:\n\nLooking at the provided string: ... t22 t27.\n\nBut the grammar has NT27 \u2192 't4', which would produce t4, not t27.

{"custom_id":"request-267","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string `t8 t12 t64 t12 t87 t16 t9 t96 t3 t92 t74 t67 t58 t39 t95` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which is useful because it has specific rules that make parsing easier. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, all non-terminals on the left side have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for some that have a terminal. Wait, no\u2014actually, some right-hand sides are terminals. For example, the production NT2 \u2192 't9' is a single terminal. That means each of these right-hand sides represents a single step in the derivation of the string.\n\nThe string given has 15 tokens separated by spaces, so the parsing tree must have a depth of 15. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production introduces exactly one non-terminal or a terminal. But wait, in the given grammar, not all productions are of the form A \u2192 a. Some are of the form A \u2192 BC, while others are terminal symbols like a.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. The grammar provided has rules like S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which is A \u2192 BC (where A is S, B is NT6, C is NT58). But there are also rules where non-terminals are connected to terminals, like NT2 \u2192 't9' or 't74'. So each terminal in the string corresponds to a single production step where a non-terminal is replaced by that terminal. The longer sequences of non-terminals would require multiple productions.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can model it as a series of steps where each non-terminal in the grammar is expanded by one production, each step reducing the number of non-terminals by one and possibly introducing terminals.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals. Each transition from one terminal to the next would require a corresponding production in the grammar. Let me think about how the derivation would proceed.\n\nStarting with the entire string as a sequence, the leftmost non-terminal in the first production would split into the first two terminals, then each subsequent production would split into the next two, and so on. The entire string must be a full derivation where each step aligns perfectly with the grammar.\n\nWait, but the grammar is given as a set of productions. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals (except for the base cases where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal). So for the string to be generated, the derivation must have a leftmost derivation where each split correctly matches the rules.\n\nSo, for instance, the first production would take S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Then, each of those non-terminals (NT6 and NT58) would need to be split into their respective productions, and so on, until the entire string is built.\n\nAlternatively, using a recursive descent approach, I can check each terminal in the string against the grammar to see if each step follows a valid production.\n\nBut this might get complicated with so many non-terminals and rules. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of symbols and see if they fit the structure.\n\nWait, in a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, each production introduces exactly two symbols (either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in this case, most productions are A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, a terminal). \n\nBut when considering the entire string, it's a sequence of terminals. The total number of terminals is 15. Since each production introduces one terminal, the number of productions needed would be 15, but since each production in CNF usually introduces two non-terminals, it's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no\u2014each production in CNF can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So to derive a string of length n, the number of steps is n. Because each step replaces one non-terminal with either a terminal or two non-terminals. So for a string of length 15, we need 15 productions.\n\nBut in the given grammar, the non-terminals have different ways to produce terminals. For example, NT2 can produce 't9', 't74', 't6', 't2', 't70', etc.\n\nLooking at the string: the first terminal is 't8', so we need to find a production of a non-terminal that results in 't8'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't12', NT12 may not be in the grammar\u2014wait, the grammar provided doesn't have NT12. So perhaps NTX \u2192 't8'?\n\nWait, the grammar provided has some NT rules that produce terminals. Let me see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12' (assuming based on the provided rules, like NT84 \u2192 't46'), but I need to check the entire list.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9'\n- NT40 \u2192 't17', 't83'\n- NT28 \u2192 't38'\n- NT6 \u2192 't73'\n- NT36 \u2192 't79'\n- NT56 \u2192 't72'\n- NT66 \u2192 't96'\n- NT94 \u2192 't14', 't77'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT79 \u2192 't16', 't27'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT95 \u2192 't27', 't66', 't96', 't94', 't67'\n- NT34 \u2192 't36'\n- NT58 \u2192 't46'\n- NT84 \u2192 't40', 't93'\n- NT85 \u2192 't76', 't95', 't58', 't87'\n- NT74 \u2192 't77', 't8'\n- NT50 \u2192 't95', 't66'\n- NT95 \u2192 't14', 't77'\n- NT2 \u2192 't70', 't6'\n\nWait, but some of these might produce terms like 't8'. Let's check:\n\nNT74 \u2192 't77', 't8' \u2014 so NT74 can produce 't8' when NT74 \u2192 't8'.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT74's production is written as NT74 \u2192 NT84 NT67, but I'm looking at the provided grammar which seems to have some duplicates. Wait, maybe I misread the initial grammar.\n\nActually, the initial grammar provided is listed with each production, and in some cases, the same rule is repeated multiple times. For example, NT95 is defined multiple times. So that might complicate things a bit, but perhaps that's intentional.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial grammar has a section where NT95 is defined multiple times:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69\n- NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66\n- NT95 \u2192 NT95 NT6\n\nWait, that can't be right because the third rule for NT95 is a recursive rule (NT95 \u2192 NT95 NT6), which would make the grammar have an infinite recursion unless it's correctly handled. But perhaps that's part of the given grammar, and I need to consider all these possibilities.\n\nBut processing the string would require choosing the correct productions that lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nSo, starting from the beginning:\n\nThe first terminal is 't8'. To get 't8', we need a non-terminal that can produce 't8'. Looking through the grammar, NT74 \u2192 't8' because one of its productions is NT74 \u2192 't8'. So that's the starting point.

{"custom_id":"request-270","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, but I need to figure out how to approach this without getting stuck.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, with B and C being non-terminals or terminals, and the start symbol S on the left. Each production has exactly two symbols on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal directly. This structure simplifies the application of the pumping lemma and other analyses, but in this case, I just need to derive or parse the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the non-terminals (like S, NT74, etc.) all have productions that derive two non-terminals. The terminals here are 't' followed by numbers. For example, in one rule, NT73 \u2192 't8' 't70'. So each production either leads to two terminals or two more non-terminals that eventually produce terminals.\n\nThe string I have to evaluate is: `t94 t22 t13 t67 t16 t76 t3 t64 t72 t22 t96 t94 t94 t72 t28`.\n\nThis is essentially a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe first step is to note that S \u2192 NT63 NT58. So the string must start with the rightmost or leftmost symbols of these two non-terminals. Wait, in CFGs, the order is leftmost or rightmost, but since it's CNF, which is leftmost typically, the derivation is applied starting from the start symbol.\n\nBut let's think in terms of terminals: the entire string is a concatenation of terminals. So the derivation process should start from S and break down into the two parts: NT63 and NT58, each of which must produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nSo the first step is to split the given string into two parts, because S \u2192 NT63 NT58, and each of these non-terminals will produce the left and right parts of the string respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 15 symbols long. So we'll split it into two parts around the middle. Specifically, NT63 should produce the first k symbols, and NT58 should produce the last 15 - k symbols for some k.\n\nWait, but how do we decide where to split? Because both NT63 and NT65 have multiple productions, each leading to different branches. So perhaps the best approach is to build a parse tree and see if the entire string can be constructed.\n\nAlternatively, since each production reduces the complexity, perhaps a top-down approach would be useful, starting with S and seeing if any of its productions can match the string.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so let's see if we can match the productions step by step.\n\nLet's look at S: S \u2192 NT63 NT58.\n\nSo the entire string can be broken into [NT63 derivation] [NT58 derivation]. Therefore, both NT63 and NT58 must derive sequences of terminals that, when concatenated, form the given string.\n\nSo let's take the string and split it into two parts. The question is, how to split them?\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to find the split point where both NT63 and NT58 can produce their respective partial strings.\n\nBut without knowing the exact split, perhaps it's better to try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, another approach is to use BFS or generate all possible intermediate steps, applying the productions and seeing if we can reach the entire string.\n\nBut given that the string is long, maybe a better approach is to look at each production and see how 't' tokens are generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't8' 't70'\n- NT74 \u2192 't9' 't77'\n- NT79 \u2192 't16' 't67' (Wait, looking back: NT79 \u2192 't16' 't67' isn't correct. Wait, actually, let me check the grammar rules again. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through, I see several rules where NT73 \u2192 't8' 't70', NT74 \u2192 't9' 't77', NT56 \u2192 't72' 't92' (Wait, no, not 't72' 't92'; actually, in the grammar, NT56 \u2192 't72' 't92'\u2014wait no, looking at the provided rules:\n\nWait, for example, NT95 \u2192 't14' 't78' for one production, NT34 \u2192 't36' 't58', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list of each non-terminal and their possible productions:\n\nNT63: \u2192 NT94 NT22, NT95 NT15, NT94 NT67, etc. Wait, no, the actual rules are:\n\nWait, looking again:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22\n- NT63 \u2192 NT95 NT15\n- And others.\n\nBut in the grammar, there are multiple rules. So, perhaps the best way is to note all possible 't' outputs and see how the string can be broken down.\n\nWait, let's list all the rules where a non-terminal directly produces a 't' symbol. The rules that produce a 't' are:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't8' 't70'\n- NT74 \u2192 't9' 't77'\n- NT78 \u2192 't67' 't73'\n- NT75 \u2192 ... wait, looking at the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, the terminals are:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't8' 't70'\n- NT74 \u2192 't9' 't77'\n- NT67 \u2192 't53' 't79' (Wait, but NT67 is a non-terminal; perhaps more accurately, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, for example:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't53' 't79' (Wait, no, in the grammar provided, I don't think any of the non-terminals directly produce a 't' except as in the earlier parts.

{"custom_id":"request-282","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of several productions starting with S and other non-terminals (NTs) that eventually lead to terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if the string `t87 t94 t77 t94 t83 t44 t76 t92 t82 t58 t44 t83 t7 t7 t79 t74` can be derived from this grammar.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is part of the terminals in the grammar. Let me list out the non-terminals and see how they can produce 't' terms.\n\nLooking at the productions, many non-terminals directly produce two 't' terms. For example:\n- NT2 \u2192 't9'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- And others like NT19, NT55, etc., all seem to produce two 't's.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT58. So S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Now, I need to see if NT6 and NT58 can produce the corresponding 't's in the string.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first part is t87 t94 t77 t94... Let me see the initial production.\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, these two non-terminals must derive into the start of the string. Let's assume NT6 \u2192 something that can produce the first few parts.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 (from one production) or others. But that seems deep. Alternatively, checking if NT6 can directly produce any 't's. Looking through the list, I don't see NT6 directly producing a terminal; it's all NTTs, so I'll need to go deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each 't' is a terminal, and each production of a non-terminal must split into two non-terminals until they reach 't's. So, maybe the string can be broken down as a series of 't's, each generated by a production that eventually reaches 't's.\n\nLet me parse the string from left to right.\n\nThe string starts with t87, so perhaps it's generated by some non-terminal that can produce t87. Looking at the productions, I see NT2 \u2192 't9' and NT94 \u2192 't14', but I'm looking for t87. Wait, actually, I don't see a production for NT87, except in some cases where NT87 might be part of a production.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT79 \u2192 't27', NT87 \u2192 't98' (no, that's only one 't'), but some other productions might have t87. Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the string is `t87 t94 t77 t94 t83 t44 t76 t92 t82 t58 t44 t83 t7 t7 t79 t74`.\n\nSo the first symbol is t87. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces 't87'. From the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't87'. So perhaps it's derived through a production chain.\n\nWait, maybe looking back, in the productions, some non-terminals produce two terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 't9'. So each 't' in the string must be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nI think the approach is to split the string into pairs of 't's because each step in the grammar produces a pair. So each step starts with a non-terminal that splits into two non-terminals, each of which eventually become 't's.\n\nWait, looking at S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So NT6 and NT58 must each be able to produce the initial parts of the string. But I'm not sure about the exact mappings.\n\nLet me consider the string as a series of steps. Each production step increases the depth, so the string's length is 15 symbols, which is an odd number. Since the grammar starts with S, which splits into two symbols each time, the number of symbols in a derivation is always 2^n, so 15 is not a power of 2. Wait, 15 is not a power of 2, which would be 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. 15 is between 8 and 16. Hmm, that might be a problem because each production of a non-terminal replaces it with two symbols, so the total number of symbols should be 2^n.\n\nWait, that's a key point. The grammar has productions that replace a non-terminal with two symbols, so each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols. Starting from S (1 symbol), then after one step, 2 symbols, then 4, 8, 16, etc. So the string length must be a power of 2. But 15 is not, so this suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me confirm because I might be missing something.\n\nFor instance, if each production can only split into two symbols, the number of symbols in any string derived from S must be a power of 2. 2^4 is 16, which is one more than 15. But our string is length 15, so it's not a power of 2. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I'm making a mistake here. Suppose S generates NT6 and NT58, each of which then generate other non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT6 might generate something that leads to a number of 't's, say 4, if it's split as 2 each step. Similarly, NT58 would also have to generate 4 't's each step. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals can directly produce two 't's at deeper levels.\n\nWait, another approach is to compute the number of 't's in the string. The string has 15 't's.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, all of which seem to be two-symbol non-terminals turning into other non-terminals and eventually terminating into terminal symbols labeled with 't' followed by some number.\n\nFirst, I should note that the strings of terminals in the grammar all seem to correspond to specific characters (t followed by numbers) and they are each unique in the production rules. So, each production leads directly to a specific terminal, and that means the string in question must be a sequence of these terminals, each produced by replacing a non-terminal step by step until everything is terminal.\n\nThe given string has 16 elements, which is 16 'tX' terms. So, the derivation must have 16 steps, each corresponding to a terminal in the string. The order is important because the production rules have to generate the terminals in the exact order they appear in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can list all the production rules in terms of their replacement:\n\n- S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n- NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66\n- NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22\n- NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69\n- NT19 \u2192 NT37 NT69\n- NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84\n- NT14 \u2192 NT59 NT15\n- NT50 \u2192 NT93 NT6\n- NT78 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n- NT56 \u2192 NT9 NT19\n- NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66  [Wait, this is the same as NT95\u2192NT9 NT69, but perhaps a typo in the list. Let me check the original input. Oh no, in the original list, nt95\u2192 nt27 nt66 is present, but another nt95\u2192 nt9 nt69 was also present. Hmm, that could complicate things because that would mean the same symbol could produce two different sequences. So I need to be careful here.\n\nSo first, the starting symbol is S, which must produce NT6 and NT58. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Now, both NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals but are we sure? Wait, in the grammar, S is the start symbol, but S is a two-symbol non-terminal: NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. So in the given grammar, all rules are of the form NT x \u2192 NT y NT z or NT x \u2192 'tY'. So, each non-terminal is replaced by two others until it becomes a terminal.\n\nSo for the string in question, each 'tX' must correspond directly to a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t13. So we need to see where t13 comes from. Looking at the grammar, the only rule that produces 't13' is NT79 \u2192 t16 wait, no. Wait, let me scan the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 t14\n- NT36 \u2192 t64\n- NT56 \u2192 t72\n- NT69 \u2192 t13\n- NT87 \u2192 t98\n- NT27 \u2192 t4\n- NT38 \u2192 t68\n- NT22 \u2192 t87\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT46 \u2192 t87\n- NT39 \u2192 t58\n- NT2 \u2192 various t's\n- NT8 \u2192 t12\n- NT74 \u2192 t77\n- NT84 \u2192 t40\n- NT39 \u2192 t26\n- NT27 \u2192 t7 etc.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. There's a NT69 \u2192 t13. So that's where 't13' comes from. So the string starts with 't13', which would be the result of NT69 being replaced by t13.\n\nSo let's map each token:\n\n1. t13: NT69\n2. t58: NT46 (because NT46 \u2192 t87, wait no, looking for t58.

Wait, wait, looking again, the string is `t28 t67 t79 t70 t97 t7 t55 t7 t95 t87 t39 t77 t13 t83 t25 t87 t39`. Hmm, there's a typo, probably a repetition at the end, but I'll assume it's correct as given.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Preprocess the string and create a table where each cell represents a substring. The table has rows and columns equal to the length of the string.\n2. For each cell (i, j), check if the substring starting at i, ending at j (inclusive) can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nBut since this grammar might have non-terminals that can derive to terminals, and the string consists only of terminals (t followed by numbers), I can try to map each tX in the string to the corresponding non-symbol in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, there are rules that produce terminals like NT2 \u2192 't9', NT34 \u2192 't36', and so on. So each non-terminal can be expanded into a terminal or a combination.\n\nBut for the given string, each token is a single terminal of the form 'tNN', so I can check if each of these can be derived from the left-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since each rule right-hand side either has two terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, and since each token is a single terminal, the grammar must correspond to a series of reductions where non-terminals are expanded into single terminals.\n\nWait, that might not be the case. Because some rules have two non-terminals on the right, but since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need the entire string to be generated by starting from S and expanding into the terminals.\n\nLet me see. The start symbol is S, which in the first rule is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S expands into two non-terminals.

Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all the production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nI notice that the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT58. Both NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals. I see that NT6 is broken down into NT73 and NT62. NT62 is NT63, and so on, until some of these non-terminals are directly replaced by terminals like 't25', 't64', etc. \n\nLet me list out the production rules for easier navigation. \n\nLooking at the grammar, several non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT94 \u2192 't77', NT73 \u2192 't25', NT69 \u2192 't13', and so on. This list includes many 't' terms which are terminals, which means they don't split further\u2014they're leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string starts with 't25' and ends with 't25'. Since both start and end with 't25', that suggests that the grammar might produce a string that starts and ends with this, though I'm not sure yet.\n\nI need to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. One approach is to work backwards: see if the grammar can derive this string through a series of expansions.\n\nAnother way is to analyze each token in the string and see if there's a non-terminal that can produce each of these terms or a combination leading to them. \n\nLooking at the string: \n\nt25, t64, t79, t95, t96, t63, t87, t79, t97, t92, t92, t72, t16, t40, t7, t4, t25.\n\nEach of these terminals must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. So, for each token, I need to check if there's a production rule that directly results in that token or if it's part of a composite that can lead to it.\n\nWait, but some of the terminals are produced by non-terminals that then split into other non-terminals. For example, NT69 \u2192 't13', but other NTs produce other non-terminals that in turn might split further. But wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each non-terminal's production could be either a terminal or a combination, but the overall string must be a series of terminals expanding from the root.\n\nI need to see if each token in the string can be generated through a path from the start symbol S. \n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 \u2192 (let's see NT73 and NT62) \n\nNT73 \u2192 't25' (since NT73 \u2192 't25'). So the first token matches.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT63. So after NT73, the next non-terminal is NT62, which goes to NT63. So the second token is 't64', and NT63 \u2192 't64'. So the third token is 't64' as well. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify.\n\nWait, the string is t25 t64 t79... So the second token is t64. So let's see:\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 is 't25', which matches the first token. Now, NT62 becomes NT63, and then NT63 must produce 't64'. But looking back in the grammar, NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22. Wait, but NT94 \u2192 't77' and NT22 \u2192 't87'. So that would be 't77 t87', which is not 't64'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the NT62 production: Does NT62 expand further? Looking back, I think in the grammar, NT62 is actually NT63, which is NT94 NT22. NT94 is 't77', NT22 is 't87'. So NT62 would produce 't77 t87', making the string start with t25 t77 t87... But in the given string, after t25 comes t64, so that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking up NT62. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\n\nNT62 -> NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22 \u2192 't77' 't87'\n\nSo, the first three tokens would be t25, t77, t87, but the string is t25 t64... So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nLooking for NT6, it's NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 is 't25'. \n\nNT62 is NT63, which is NT94 NT22. \n\nNT94 is 't77' and NT22 is 't87'. So NT62 becomes 't77 t87'.\n\nSo the expansion would be S \u2192 NT6 NT58 \u2192 't25' 'something'. So the first token is 't25', and then we need to expand 'something'. \n\nWait, maybe the second part NT58? Let me check. NT58's production is in the grammar: NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9.\n\nNT84 is NT34 NT93, and NT34 is NT58 NT65. So that seems to loop. Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is longer than the non-terminals can produce. Maybe the given string can't be generated from the grammar because of terminals not matching.\n\nWait, let's see step by step.\n\nThe string is t25 t64 t79 t95 t96 t63 t87 t79 t97 t92 t92 t72 t16 t40 t7 t4 t25.\n\nSo, the first token is t25. Let's see if any non-terminal directly produces t25.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT73 \u2192 't25'. So T1 is NT73.\n\nNow, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Let's see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nAfter expanding, we have NT73 as the first non-terminal, which produces t25. Then, the second part is NT62.\n\nAs I thought, NT62 \u2192 NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22 \u2192 't77' 't87'. But the second token is t64, not t77. \n\nSo that's a discrepancy. Therefore, maybe the string cannot be generated because the second token is t64, which cannot be produced directly from NT62.\n\nWait, unless there's another path. Let's re-examine. Perhaps I missed a production rule.\n\nWait, maybe NT62 isn't supposed to go to NT63. Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar: NT62 is under NT73 \u2192 NT73, and NT62 is NT63.\n\nLooking at NT63: NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22. NT94 is 't77', NT22 is 't87'. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the first two tokens would be 't25', 't77', then 't87', but the string starts with 't25', 't64'... which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps the string is not possible to derive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can have a different expansion. Let's see.\n\nS can produce NT6 and NT58. Maybe NT58 is leading to something else.\n\nLooking at NT58: NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. \n\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65.\n\nWait, that seems to loop. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT62.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22 \u2192 't77' 't87' again. \n\nAnd NT40, let's see its production: NT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17.\n\nNT69 \u2192 't13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-327","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string I'm supposed to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58. That means the start symbol S directly produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. Each of these non-terminals can themselves be broken down into other NTs, which eventually derive terminal symbols (like 't12', 't34', etc.) or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Each of these 't' symbols probably corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. My goal is to trace a derivation path from S to the given string, using the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me first list out all the NTs and their associated terminal symbols from the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> 't73' (from NT6 -> NT73 NT62, which splits, but wait, let me check the actual productions. Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT6 -> NT73 NT62, but then in NT73 -> 't8', so NT6's production would involve both NT73 and NT62. Hmm, perhaps it's better to see each production and see which NTs derive which terminals.\n\nBut actually, from the given grammar, each NT (like NT6, NT62, etc.) seems to have one production that leads directly to a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT6-> 't73'\n- NT62-> 't97'\n- NT4-> 't98'\n- NT15-> 't94'\n- NT2-> 't6' and others like t70, t44, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I notice that each NT appears only in one production, and each has exactly one terminal symbol as a direct production. For example, NT68 -> NT63 NT67, but wait, NT63->NT94 NT22, which then NT94 -> 't14', and NT22->'t87'. So NT63's derivation would be 't14 t87', but in the grammar provided, NT6 has NT73 NT62, which are both terminals directly.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I think I might have misunderstood the structure.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly one non-terminal on the right, except for the start symbol S which can produce two terminals. Wait, actually, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production either as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, let me list out the production rules to check if they fit CNF. Each production seems to have either non-terminals on both sides or terminals on the right. Wait, for instance, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 \u2013 this is a production with two non-terminals, which fits CNF. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't9' has a terminal. So all production rules either generate terminals or split into two non-terminals. That seems to fit CNF.\n\nNow, the given string is: t12 t14 t58 t39 t84 t63 t53 t96 t6 t76 t63 t53 t68 t14 t3 t53 t64 t22.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. One approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be matched.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parse reduces the number of non-terminals by one, replacing two non-terminals with a terminal or splitting into two non-terminals. The string has 19 tokens, so the derivation must have 18 steps, because each step increases the number of terminals by one.\n\nAlternatively, the depth of the parse tree would be such that the number of tokens is matched, but that might be complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the start symbol S and see if each production can generate the string. However, the start symbol S in the grammar is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S generates two non-terminals. Let me see what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, let's trace the possible terminals generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 appears in several productions. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Let's see the productions for NT73 and NT62. NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. NT8 is somewhere, but checking the production rules, I don't see NT8 defined.

The string is a sequence of terminals, so each must be matched by a production that directly produces that terminal or is part of a chain that reduces to it.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t12, t14, t58, t39, t84, t63, t53, t96, t6, t76, t63, t53, t68, t14, t3, t53, t64, t22.\n\nI can try to match each terminal starting from the beginning.\n\nLet's start with t12. Looking through the productions, NT28 \u2192 't28' and NT84 \u2192 't40'. Also, NT38 \u2192 't68', and NT2 \u2192 't6', 't70', 't44', 't6' (multiple times). Wait, in the grammar, there's a production NT2 \u2192 't6' or 't70' or 't44'. So t12 is not directly produced by any of these.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the string has t12, but looking through the productions, NT2 can produce 't6', 't70', or 't44', none of which are 't12'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something? Or perhaps I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT2 \u2192 't6', 't70', 't44', 't9'. Are there any other NT symbols that produce 't12'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly expands to 't12'. Therefore, the presence of t12 suggests that there must be a non-terminal NT2 that somehow produces t12, but according to the productions, NT2 can only produce those specific terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the productions. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the list, for NT2, the productions are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\nNT2 \u2192 't70'\nNT2 \u2192 't44'\nNT2 \u2192 't6' again, and 't'6 (duplicate), perhaps a typo? Or maybe I'm missing other productions.\n\nWait, the provided grammar ends with:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9', then some other NT2 productions. Wait, I might have miscounted. Let me scan the list correctly.\n\nWait, near the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\nNT36 \u2192 't64'\nNT56 \u2192 't72'\nNT69 \u2192 't13'\nNT87 \u2192 't98'\nNT27 \u2192 't4'\nNT38 \u2192 't68'\nNT22 \u2192 't87'\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\nNT46 \u2192 't87'\nNT39 \u2192 't58'\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\nNT34 \u2192 't36'\nNT58 \u2192 't46'\nNT44 \u2192 't83'\nNT55 \u2192 't92'\nNT39 \u2192 't63'\nNT9 \u2192 't3'\nNT62 \u2192 't84'\nNT80 \u2192 't22'\nNT38 \u2192 't49'\nNT2 \u2192 't44'\nNT8 \u2192 't12'\n\nAh, I see. Earlier, I thought that NT2 \u2192 't12' doesn't exist, but near the bottom, I see NT2 \u2192 't12' in the production list: NT2 \u2192 't12'.

{"custom_id":"request-348","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if this string is generated by the given grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string I need to check is `t76 t72 t13 t94 t9 t96 t7 t49 t8 t39 t26 t44 t77 t74 t55 t44 t7 t63 t53`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. In CNF, S must produce NT6 NT58. So, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Each of these is a non-terminal, which will eventually resolve to a terminal string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't76'. Let me check if 't76' is a terminal. Scanning the terminals in the grammar, I see 't77', 't72', 't13', etc. 't76' isn't listed, which might be an issue. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check. Oh, no, 't76' is not present in the list of terminals. The grammar terminals are things like 't77', 't72', 't13', 't94', etc. So 't76' isn't a terminal. Hmm, that's a red flag. Because in the CNF, all non-terminals eventually produce terminals, so I must get a sequence that only has terminals.\n\nWait, the string has 't76' as the first token. But looking at the grammar, I don't see a production that results in 't76'. The only terminals are things like 't77', 't72', 't13', 't94', etc. So, if the grammar doesn't produce 't76', then the string can't be generated by it. That might mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me go through the grammar to confirm if 't76' is a terminal. Scanning through, the terminals are mentioned under the NT production rules, but the actual terminals are those that end up being terminal symbols, not other non-terminals. The grammar seems to have several NTs that expand into terminals like 't77', 't72', etc. But 't76' is not among them.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT85 \u2192 't76'. Or wait, let me check: the grammar has NT85 \u2192 't76' as one of the productions. Wait, is that the case? Looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar, yes, there's a line: NT85 \u2192 't76'. So, NT85 can produce 't76'.\n\nBut in the initial expansion, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, I need to see if NT6 and NT58 can produce sequences that would lead to the string given.\n\nWait, maybe I went too fast. Let me start analyzing the string step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't' terms: t76, t72, t13, t94, t9, t96, t7, t49, t8, t39, t26, t44, t77, t74, t55, t44, t7, t63, t53.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So, each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two others, until we reach terminals. The end string is the sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given string, every symbol is a 't' followed by a number, but the grammar has rules that produce 't' numbers as terminals. So, each of these 'tX' in the string must be a direct result of some NT production that has that terminal.\n\nWait a second, let me clarify. Each 'tX' is generated by a production in the grammar that takes a non-terminal and produces two terminals? Wait, no, in CNF, each production produces two non-terminals. So, a non-terminal can only produce two other non-terminals at each step. The only way a terminal appears is when a non-terminal is replaced by a production that includes that terminal as one of the two symbols.\n\nFor example, if a rule is NT5 \u2192 a b, where a and b are terminals, then NT5 can produce \"ab\". But in our case, the NTs only terminate if they produce a terminal symbol as one of the two, but in the grammar, it's not the case. Let me check: do any of the NTs produce a terminal and another NT?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that all the productions on the left-hand side are non-terminals, and the right-hand side are pairs of non-terminals. So, none of the NTs produce a terminal on their own. Wait, that can't be right. Because then how do we get a terminal in the string? Because if every production is of non-terminals, then the only way to get a terminal is if one of the production steps has a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me see the grammar again. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Now, NT6 produces NT73 NT62, and NT58 produces NT84 NT9. So, that's two non-terminals. Then, each of those non-terminals must produce more until we get to terminals.\n\nSo, the process is such that eventually, each non-terminal must derive a string of terminals. For that to happen, somewhere along the way, an NT must produce a terminal paired with another terminal or an NT that eventually produces a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that some NTs do produce terminals. For example, looking at the top-level grammar:\n\nNT85 \u2192 't76', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT77: looking through the rules, I don't see any NT77, but NT94 \u2192 't77', etc. So, for instance, NT94 can produce 't77'. So, any NT that can eventually derive a terminal will have at least one terminal in its expansion.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is 't76', which is directly produced by NT85. So, that would require that one of the non-terminals derived from S must produce NT85 as one of the two symbols, and then NT85 must produce 't76' and another symbol.\n\nBut in the string, after 't76' comes 't72', which is another terminal. So, looking at the grammar, is there any NT that can produce 't72' alongside something else?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT72: Wait, no. NT72 is not present as a terminal; it's an NT that produces something else. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list of rules, there's a rule NT72 \u2192 NT97 NT66. So, NT72 can't produce a terminal on its own; it must produce two NTs. So, for a production to result in a terminal followed by another terminal, like 't76 t72', that would mean that one NT produces 't76' and the other produces something that can derive 't72'. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps 't76' is produced by NT85, and then the other NT in the pair that S produces is NT58. So, S \u2192 NT6 (something) and NT58. If S's expansion includes NT85 and another NT that can produce 't72', then the string would have 't76 t72' as two consecutive symbols.\n\nBut how does that happen? Let me think about the steps. So, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Now, NT6 is replaced by NT73 NT62. So, now we have NT73 NT62 NT58. Then, each of these NTs needs to be expanded.\n\nWait, NT63 is something else, but I'm getting confused. Let's approach this differently. Instead of trying to do a full derivation tree, let me check what each symbol in the string can come from.\n\nThe first symbol is 't76', which must come from a production where one of the two symbols on the right-hand side is NT85, because NT85 \u2192 't76'. So, in the derivation, one of the two NTs must be NT85, and it must expand to 't76' and something else. But wait, in the initial step, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, S splits into NT6 and NT58. So, in this step, both NT6 and NT58 must eventually expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, but NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then, both NT73 and NT62 need to be expanded. Similarly, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9.\n\nSo, NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93, and then each of those is expanded further. But wait, does NT34 produce a terminal? Looking at the grammar, yes, NT34 \u2192 't36'.

{"custom_id":"request-342","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF is a specific form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLet me look at the grammar provided. It's a list of production rules, each starting with a non-terminal (like S, NT74, etc.) on the left and terminals or non-terminals on the right. Each production seems to follow the CNF structure because the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t4 t9 t22 t28 t76 t6 t74 t55 t94 t6 t28 t83 t68 t64 t83 t25 t40 t36 t77`. So, the string is a sequence of terminals: t4, t9, t22, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be generated by applying the given grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I should note the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be two non-terminals or a terminal. That structure implies that each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This is crucial because it affects how the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol S, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, to start generating, we have to expand S into NT6 and NT58. Now, each of NT6 and NT58 will be non-terminals that we need to expand further until we get to terminals.\n\nLet's build a derivation step by step. Starting with S, the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nNow, each of NT6 and NT58 can be replaced by their respective productions. Let's look at the rules for NT6 and NT58.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So, NT6 expands into two non-terminals. Similarly, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So, their first expansion is into other non-terminals.\n\nThis means our current string after two steps is:\n\nNT73 NT62 NT84 NT9\n\nEach of these NTs can be expanded further. Let's take each one:\n\nNT73: Looking at the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. So, expanding NT73 gives NT8 and NT9.\n\nNT62: The rule is NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT84. So, NT62 becomes NT97 and NT84.\n\nNT84: The rule is NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. So, NT84 expands into NT34 and NT93.\n\nNT9: The rule is NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. So, NT9 becomes NT68 and NT40.\n\nPutting these together, our expansion is now:\n\nNT8 NT9 NT97 NT84 NT34 NT93 NT68 NT40\n\nEach of these is a non-terminal, so we continue expanding each:\n\nNT8: NT8 \u2192 t12. Since one of the rules is NT8 \u2192 't12'. So, NT8 becomes t12.\n\nNT9: Expanding NT9 gives NT68 and NT40. So:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n\nNT67 \u2192 Not sure, let me check. Oh, no, looking back, NT67 is a terminal? Wait, in the grammar, NT67 is a terminal with value 't64'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT67: NT67 \u2192 't64' because in the rules, NT67 \u2192 't64'.\n\nWait, let me list all the NTs and their rules to keep track.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each NT and their production rules because that's a common approach for CFGs. Let me try to write them out.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 t12\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40 (duplicate)\n\nWait, looking through, some NTs might be in the list multiple times, but for brevity, I can note each NT and their rules once.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to recognize that each NT is a non-terminal, and each expansion is determined by its production rules. However, since each production in CNF is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the derivation will involve a series of splits into two parts until we get all terminals.\n\nGiven the string, let's think about how the terminals would be generated. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two options: either a terminal or another non-terminal. For the string provided, all elements are terminals, so eventually, we'll have to have all the leaves in the derivation being terminals.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the string provided matches exactly. Let's look at the target string:\n\nThe string is: t4 t9 t22 t28 t76 t6 t74 t55 t94 t6 t28 t83 t68 t64 t83 t25 t40 t36 t77\n\nWait, that's 19 tokens, which would mean 19 symbols generated. Since each non-terminal expansion adds one more symbol (from one to two), the number of symbols increases exponentially. But maybe the string is part of a larger sentence, but for this problem, we just have to check if it's generated by this specific set of rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to reconstruct the parse tree starting from the string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nLet me think of the string as a list of symbols:\n\nt4, t9, t22, t28, t76, t6, t74, t55, t94, t6, t28, t83, t68, t64, t83, t25, t40, t36, t77\n\nWe need to see if this can be built up by applying the rules.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the start symbol S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the first two non-terminals generated are NT6 and NT58. Let's see if the string starts with the t's corresponding to their expansions.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t4, which is a terminal. So, either NT6 or NT58 must produce a terminal as the first symbol. Wait, looking at their productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 and NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40.\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT6's rule is NT73 NT62, which are non-terminals, so the first token from NT6 must come from further expansions, unless one of the rules produces a terminal. Wait, hold on: in the given grammar, are any of the NTs directly producing a terminal?\n\nWait, let me list out each NT and see if any of them directly produce a terminal or another production that can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 : both non-terminals.\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9 : both non-terminals.\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 : both non-terminals.\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40 : both non-terminals.\nNT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93 : both non-terminals.\nNT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17 : both non-terminals.\nNT69 \u2192 NT84 NT9 : both non-terminals.\n\nWait, I can see that some NTs produce other non-terminals, but in the provided grammar, some NTs have rules that, when expanded further, eventually turn into terminals.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm missing some NTs. Let me go through each rule again to make sure I've listed them all:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 t12\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT68 NT93\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT95 NT6\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT77\n\nWait, is NT74 a separate non-terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-371","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine if the string `t58 t14 t95 t16 t46 t49 t96 t98 t40 t95 t36 t95 t55 t64 t70 t4 t79 t67 t8 t58` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is structured such that every production starts with a non-terminal (like S, NT74, etc.) and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which directly expands into NT6 NT58. So the first step is to see how the string starts and see if it could be generated from S.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t58`. Let me check the productions to see where `t58` can come from. Scanning through the rules, I see `NT58 -> NT84 NT9`, and `NT58 -> NT84 NT9`. Wait, I also see `NT58 -> NT95 NT6`. Wait, no, actually looking again, there's a rule `NT58 -> NT84 NT9` and another `NT58 -> NT84 NT9`. Hmm, no, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n- NT58 -> NT84 NT9\n- NT58 -> NT95 NT6\n\nWait, actually, checking the list again, I see:\n\nLooking for `t58`, which occurs in NT58's productions. NT58 can produce NT84 NT9 and NT95 NT6. So from NT58, we'd get two symbols. The string starts with t58, which is a terminal, so I need to see which NT production ends with t58.\n\nLooking deeper, in the grammar, I see NT44 -> NT83 NT55, NT46 -> t28, etc. Hmm, not directly. Let me check if any of the NT productions end with t58.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT19 -> NT37 NT69\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\nNT34 -> NT58 NT65 \u2192 So NT34 produces t58 and NT65. Then, if NT34 appears, we get t58 followed by whatever NT65 produces.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t58, so maybe the initial production is from NT34. Or perhaps another path. Let's think.\n\nAnother approach: Let's parse the string step by step. The string is a sequence of symbols, and each non-terminal can produce two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So we can try to see if the string can be built by the grammar.\n\nLet me write the string as tokens for clarity:\nt58, t14, t95, t16, t46, t49, t96, t98, t40, t95, t36, t95, t55, t64, t70, t4, t79, t67, t8, t58.\n\nWait, but the string is `t58 t14 t95 t16 t46 t49 t96 t98 t40 t95 t36 t95 t55 t64 t70 t4 t79 t67 t8 t58`. So, 20 tokens. Hmm.\n\nWe start with S, which is NT6 NT58. So S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNow, the string starts with t58, so NT58 must be the first symbol. Let's see what NT58 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT58 has two rules:\nNT58 \u2192 NT95 NT6\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nSo, NT58 can break into either NT95 and NT6, or NT84 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, after t58 comes t14, t95, etc. Wait, no, it's t58, then t14, but NT58's production would produce two symbols: for example, if it's NT95 NT6, then t58, followed by NT95 which is a non-terminal, then NT6, which is another non-terminal. But wait, in the string, after t58 comes t14, which is a terminal. So perhaps the production for NT58 is in the form of NT95 NT6 or NT84 NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think differently. The string starts with t58, which must come from a production of a non-terminal. So maybe NT58 can produce t58 as the terminal, but looking at the grammar, NT58's productions don't directly produce t58. Hmm, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, let's check all the NT productions for t58. Looking through the rules, I see NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65. So NT34 produces t58 when NT65 can be further expanded. So if we have NT34, it would produce t58 followed by whatever NT65 produces.\n\nBut S starts as NT6 NT58. So perhaps S is NT6 and NT58.\n\nIf NT58 produces, say, NT95 NT6, then the first symbols are t58, followed by NT95, which could then expand into t16, etc.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the structure of the string. Let's try to see how the string can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t58, t14, t95, t16, t46, t49, t96, t98, t40, t95, t36, t95, t55, t64, t70, t4, t79, t67, t8, t58.\n\nSince the start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, we must have NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t58, so the first non-terminal must expand to t58, which would be NT58.\n\nSo first step: NT58 \u2192 T58.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT58 can either produce NT95 NT6 or NT84 NT9. None of these directly produce t58, so perhaps we're missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT58 has two rules: NT58 \u2192 NT95 NT6 (which is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so NT58 is the second part) and NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So in this case, the first part of S is NT6, so perhaps in the first expansion, S can produce NT6 NT58, where NT58 is expanded into one of its components.\n\nBut in the string, after t58 comes t14. So after the first t58, we have t14. So let's see what the production for NT58 can generate.\n\nIf NT58 \u2192 NT95 NT6, then we'd have NT95 and NT6. NT95 can expand, but the next token is t14. Let's look for where t14 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t14 comes from NT14 \u2192 NT59 NT15.\n\nWait, NT14 is a non-terminal that expands into NT59 and NT15, which are both non-terminals. Those then expand further.\n\nBut perhaps that's too deep. Let's go step by step.\n\nLet's assume S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which are both non-terminals. So S would become NT73 NT62 NT58.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t58, which would have to come from NT58, but NT58 doesn't directly produce a terminal. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production for S is into NT6 NT58, so after S, the first expansion is into NT6 and NT58. If NT6 is NT73 NT62, then NT6 leads to NT73 and NT62, which would produce non-terminals that expand further. But the first token in the string is t58, so maybe NT58 must directly produce t58, but in the grammar, NT58 can't do that because its rules are:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT95 NT6 (so two non-terminals)\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9 (also two non-terminals)\n\nSo it seems that NT58 can only produce two non-terminals, starting with either NT95 or NT84, followed by NT6 or NT9, respectively.

{"custom_id":"request-391","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is `t12 t70 t26 t44 t83 t12 t46 t7 t3 t97 t40 t44 t96 t4 t92 t22 t63 t25 t97 t49 t44`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar consists of. It looks like the non-terminals are mostly starting with 'NT' followed by numbers, except for 'S', 'NT74', etc. The right-hand sides of these non-terminals are combinations of other non-terminals or strings ending with 't' followed by digits, which seem to represent terminal symbols.\n\nThe process to determine if the string is generated by the grammar would involve simulating a derivation starting from the start symbol S and seeing if we can reach the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nI should start by breaking down the given string into its components, which are the 't' followed by numbers: t12, t70, t26, etc. Each of these is a terminal symbol, so they must be the result of productions from non-terminals directly to these terminals.\n\nI notice that the non-terminals in the grammar include S, NT74, NT63, NT95, etc. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT6 NT58. So S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo my first step is to see how the string starts. The string begins with t12. Looking into the grammar, I see that NT27 \u2192 t4, and NT23 \u2192 t94, but wait, there's also NT2 \u2192 't70', NT3 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't44', NT5 \u2192 't62', NT6 \u2192 't73', etc. Wait, the string starts with t12. Scanning through the grammar, I don't see any production that directly derives t12. Let me check all the rule ends.\n\nLooking at all the RT3 productions:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t83\n\n- NT55 \u2192 t92\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n\n- NT62 \u2192 t84\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t49\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t44\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t12\n\nWait, looking for t12. There's a production NT2 \u2192 t70, and NT8 \u2192 t12. So the first token in the string is t12, which comes from NT8.\n\nSo the first step would be S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Then NT6 \u2192 't73', and NT58 \u2192 't46'. Wait, no, looking for NT58 production.\n\nIn the grammar, NT58 appears in two places: \n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9, and\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t46.\n\nSo NT58 can produce either a terminal or more non-terminals. Since the string starts with t12, which is NT8 \u2192 t12, maybe NT58 is producing t46? Because t46 is another component in the string (t46 is the 14th token). Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, the string is t12 t70 t26 t44 t83 t12 t46 ... So the first token is t12, which is from NT8. But how do we get t12 from NT58? Unless NT58 can produce NT8, which then produces t12.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT8 \u2192 t12. So if NT58 produces NT8, then NT58 can derive t12. So perhaps NT58 \u2192 NT8 NT9, but then NT8 must be able to produce t12.\n\nSo let's see. Let's consider S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Then NT6 produces t73. So S \u2192 t73 NT58. Then NT58 can produce either t46 or NT8 NT9. Let's choose t46, but wait, the first token is t12, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT58 produces NT8, leading to t12, but that would require the string to have more tokens after that. Let's see: t12, then t70, t26, etc.\n\nWait, the string is: t12 (NT8) \u2192 then t70 (NT2 \u2192 t70). So after NT8, perhaps NT58 is producing NT2. But looking at NT58's productions, it only can produce NT84, NT9, or t46. There's no rule for NT58 \u2192 NT2.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because the second token is t70, which comes from NT2 \u2192 t70. So if S produces NT6 (t73) and NT58, and NT58 needs to produce t12, but that would mean the second token is next. But after t73 comes t12, which is the second token in the string. But wait, the string is t12, t70, etc. So the first part is t73 (NT6), then NT58 produces t12, but in the string, after t73, the next is t12. That would be correct if S \u2192 NT6 NT58, NT6 produces t73, and NT58 produces t12. So the first two tokens would be t73 t12, but the given string starts with t12 t70. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, that means perhaps I made a mistake. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S can't generate t70 first. So the initial t70 must come directly from another production, maybe NT2 \u2192 t70, but S can't produce t70 unless S is directly producing a terminal, but S is non-terminal, so S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and production must be a combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express the string: the string is t12 followed by t70, then t26, etc. So maybe S is not the one producing t12. Wait, but S is the start symbol, so every string derived from S must start with S's productions.\n\nGiven that, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the first two symbols must come from NT6 and NT58. If NT6 is producing t73, then the first token is t73, but the given string starts with t12. Therefore, the string cannot be derived from this grammar because the first step from S would produce t73 (from NT6) and then whatever comes from NT58, but t12 is the first token, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT6 can produce a terminal before NT58. But in CNF, S \u2192 A B means S is replaced by A then B, but both A and B need to produce terminals. So if A can produce a terminal and B can produce a terminal, then yes. So let's look.\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58. So NT6 must produce a terminal, and NT58 must produce a terminal to start the string. So looking for NT6 productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t73 or another non-terminal. Indeed, NT6 \u2192 t73. So that's a single terminal. So NT6 can produce t73, and NT58 can produce a terminal. So S \u2192 t73 NT58. Then NT58 must produce a terminal. Looking at NT58's productions: either t46 or NT8 NT9.\n\nIf NT58 \u2192 t46, then the string would start with t73 t46. But given string starts with t12 t70. So t73 is not in the string. Thus, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if NT58 \u2192 NT8 NT9, then NT8 needs to produce t12, and NT9 needs to produce something. So S \u2192 t73 NT58 \u2192 t73 NT8 NT9. Then, NT8 \u2192 t12, NT9 \u2192 t26 (from NT9 \u2192 t26). So the string would start with t73 t12 t26... But the given string starts with t12 t70, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the initial assumption is incorrect. So the string cannot be generated because the first two tokens can't be derived from S's production. Thus, the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe S can produce a terminal symbol, but that's not the case here since S is non-terminal and must produce two non-terminals because of CNF.\n\nNo, in CNF, S can only produce AB where A and B are non-terminals. So S cannot produce any terminal directly.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and then the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar has several terminals and non-terminals. The top-level production is S -> NT6 NT58. So, the string must start with NT6 followed by NT58. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t63, so I need to see what each NT rule translates to.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT6 -> 't67' (from NT68 and then NT77? Wait, no, let me check. Wait, NT6 is in the rules as `NT6 -> NT73 NT62`. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, let me list out all the NT productions:\n\nNT6: NT73 NT62, which then resolves to 't67' and 't84' maybe? Or perhaps I should look for what each NT eventually resolves to.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see each NT\u2019s expansion until it reaches terminals or can't go further. Alternatively, maybe I can use these productions to create a parsing table or use a top-down approach to see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut since the string is a sequence of terminals, the grammar must derive this sequence step by step. So starting from S, which is NT6 NT58. So let's break it down.\n\nThe string starts with `t63`, so perhaps NT6 is t63? Wait, no, let me check each NT production. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62 (from earlier)\n- NT73 -> NT8 NT9\n- NT8 -> 't12'\n- So NT73 would be 't12' and whatever NT9 resolves to.\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n\nWait, let me trace that. NT73 -> NT8 NT9. NT8 is 't12' and NT9 is 't26', so NT73 is 't12 t26'. Similarly, NT62 -> NT84 NT67, which breaks down further.\n\nWait, this might take too long. Maybe a better approach is to simulate the parse.\n\nThe string is `t63 t68 ...`, so maybe NT58 is involved. Let's see what NT58 resolves to.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT58 -> 't46' because of `NT58 -> NT84 NT9` and then NT84 is 't40' and NT9 is 't26', but wait, no, earlier in the rules: NT58 is actually `NT58 -> NT84 NT9`, but NT84 is 't40' as per `NT84 -> NT34 NT93` which seems to go into more non-terminals, so maybe my initial thought is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a more direct way. Maybe I should see each NT and their possible terminal outputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look through the string and see which parts correspond to each NT.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated. Let me think: since the string starts with t63, which is likely from NT6. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 is 't67' (from NT73) followed by 'something' (from NT62).

{"custom_id":"request-409","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is provided, along with the string to evaluate. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, etc. Each production rule has two non-terminals or exactly one terminal, but in the case of a string generated entirely of terminals, we can think of the start symbol S as deriving a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice it consists of multiple non-terminals, and each production is either two non-terminals or sometimes a terminal followed by a non-terminal or a combination. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production must be A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. But sometimes, people extend it to allow two terminals, but in this case, the given grammar seems to have rules like NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which are two non-terminals, and some rules that have a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, which is okay because NT58 is a non-terminal and NT65 is a non-terminal as well. Wait, no, if all rules are of the form two non-terminals, then perhaps the grammar is in CNF. Hmm, I might need to double-check.\n\nWait, in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if any production has more than two non-terminals on the right, that's a problem. Looking at the grammar, all the production rules seem to be two non-terminals or one terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 is two non-terminals. NT2 \u2192 't9' is a terminal. So yes, this grammar is indeed in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t25 t79 t87 t83 t74 t14 t74 t68 t95 t9 t40 t79 t70 t96 t77 t26 t68 t68 t70 t70 t87 t27`.\n\nThis string consists of a sequence of terminals, each being 't' followed by a number. So we need to see if there's a derivation in the grammar that starts from S and ends in this string. \n\nTo do this, I can use a top-down approach or a bottom-up approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps a dynamic programming approach or a recursive descent parser could be used, but since I'm not implementing that, I'll try to find a way to expand the start symbol S step by step, trying to reach the given string.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to analyze the productions for each terminal in the string and see if each one can be derived from some non-terminal, working backwards. This is akin to trace-back through the productions.\n\nLet me first note the order of the string:\n\n1. t25\n2. t79\n3. t87\n4. t83\n5. t74\n6. t14\n7. t74\n8. t68\n9. t95\n10. t9\n11. t40\n12. t79\n13. t70\n14. t96\n15. t77\n16. t26\n17. t68\n18. t68\n19. t70\n20. t70\n21. t87\n22. t27\n\nSo 22 symbols in total.\n\nLet me start by checking each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce it. Then, I'll try to see if the sequence makes sense given the grammar.\n\n1. t25: Looking at the grammar, NT73 \u2192 't73' isn't present. Wait, actually, in the grammar, there's NT73 \u2192 't77'? No, let me check.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar includes rules where NT6 \u2192 't73'? No, let me look carefully.\n\nActually, I see lines like:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't25'\n\nYes, line NT73 \u2192 't25' is present. So t25 can be derived from NT73. So the initial step is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which would then need to derive into the string starting with t25.\n\nWait, so S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first part of the derivation would be S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and then NT6 and NT58 will each produce some sequence of terminals. Let me see what's the first terminal in the string: t25 is produced by NT73, so perhaps NT6 or NT58 leads to NT73. Wait, no, because NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals that need to produce the sequence starting with t25. So perhaps NT6 or NT58 can expand into t25 followed by something else.\n\nWait, let me see each non-terminal's production that can lead to t25.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the rules that produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal or just a terminal are as follows:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't25'\n\nAdditionally, any rules where the right-hand side starts with a terminal and followed by a non-terminal, like NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Wait, that's NT73 followed by NT62, which are both non-terminals. If NT73 produces 't25', then NT6 could be NT73 NT62. But then NT73 is producing a terminal, so NT6 would become 't25' followed by whatever NT62 produces.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t25, so perhaps NT6 can expand into 't25' followed by something else. But looking at NT6\u2019s rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the rules for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nIs there any rule that makes NT6 produce a terminal directly? It doesn't seem so. So NT6 only expands into two non-terminals. Similarly for other non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which would expand as 't25' (from NT73) followed by whatever NT62 produces. Then NT62's production needs to expand into the next part of the string after t25.\n\nLooking at the string, after t25 comes t79. So after 't25', 't79' is next.\n\nSo if NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, then NT73 is 't25', and NT62 needs to derive into 't79' followed by the remaining string. Let's see what NT62 can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT62's rules are:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT73 NT67\n\nNT62 \u2192 't97'\n\nWait, yes, line NT62 \u2192 't97' is present. So NT62 can produce 't97' directly. But in the string, after 't25' comes 't79', not 't97', so that can't be it. Alternatively, if NT62 can expand into two non-terminals, as in NT62 \u2192 NT73 NT67, then that could lead to 't25' followed by 't79' if NT67 can produce the necessary symbols.\n\nWait, so let me think step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. The first symbol is t25, which comes from NT73 \u2192 't25', so the second non-terminal in NT6's expansion must produce the rest of the string starting after t25.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing because the string is the concatenation of the terminals derived. Maybe I should approach this by trying to build parse trees from the start symbol and see if I can match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive approach, assuming each symbol in the string comes from a specific non-terminal. For example, the first symbol t25 comes from NT73. So perhaps NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and NT62 is 't97'. But that doesn't match the second symbol t79. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps NT6 doesn't produce 't25' directly. Or maybe I made a mistake in associating NT73 to t25.

{"custom_id":"request-403","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production either has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. The start symbol is S, and the goal is to derive the given string through a series of replacements.\n\nThe string to check is: `t70 t58 t56 t14 t13 t36 t67 t55 t67 t87 t70 t70 t12 t68 t79 t12 t46 t22 t16 t95 t84 t6`. Wait, no, the string is `t70 t58 t96 t14 t13 t36 t77 t55 t67 t87 t70 t70 t12 t68 t79 t12 t46 t22 t16 t95 t84 t6`. Hmm, let me make sure I get that right.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens: t70, t58, t96, t14, t13, t36, t77, t55, t67, t87, t70, t70, t12, t68, t79, t12, t46, t22, t16, t95, t84, t6.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are things like S, NT74, NT63, etc. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. The terminals in the grammar are those ending with t, like t70, t58, etc.\n\nSo, the given string is a series of terminals. To see if it's generated by the grammar, I need to check if there's a way to expand S into this string through the productions.\n\nI'll start by building a parse tree starting from S and see if I can match the string. But given the length, maybe a bottom-up approach is better, like checking if the string can be reduced step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down approach, expanding S and seeing if any expansion can produce the string. But since the string is pretty long, this might take a while.\n\nAnother method is to see if all the tokens in the string appear as leaves in the parse tree. Looking at the grammar, the terminals are all the 't' followed by a number. Each has a specific production:\n\nFor example, t70 \u2192 NT2, t58 \u2192 NT44, etc. So, in the parse tree, each 't' symbol comes from a specific non-terminal production.\n\nLet me list the production for each terminal in the string:\n\n- t70 \u2192 NT2 (produced from NT2 rule: NT2 \u2192 't9', but wait, looking back, in the grammar, there's a production for NT2 \u2192 't70'. Wait, let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several entries where NT2 \u2192 't70', 't9', etc. For example, line: NT2 \u2192 't70', NT2 \u2192 't9'. So, t70 is produced by NT2.\n\nSimilarly, let me list each token and find their corresponding NT2's production:\n\nt70 \u2192 NT2 (from several rules as long as there's a rule NT2 \u2192 't70')\n\nt58 \u2192 NT44 \u2192 check grammar: looking through the rules, NT44's production is either 't83' or 't46' or maybe others? Wait, no, in the grammar, there's a production for NT44 \u2192 't83' and another for NT44 \u2192 't46' (line: NT84 \u2192 t46? Wait no, looking again.\n\nWait the grammar entries: looking for NT2, NT44, etc.\n\nNT44 has a production: line says NT44 \u2192 't83' (looking for NT44 production). Also, other non-terminals: NT46 is produced by t87, etc.\n\nWait, better to look for each terminal in the string and see which non-terminal they come from.\n\nSo:\n\nt70 \u2192 NT2 (since there's a rule NT2 \u2192 't70')\n\nt58 \u2192 NT2? Wait, let me see. Wait, in the grammar, NT2's productions are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't70', NT2 \u2192 't9' (from line NT2 \u2192 't70', and elsewhere NT2 \u2192 't9')\n\nWait, no, looking again: in the grammar, NT2's productions are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't70'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\n\nSo t70 and t9 are both produced by NT2.\n\nt58: let's find which NT produces t58. Looking through the grammar rules, looking for a production where the right-hand side is t58.\n\nI see:\n\nLine: NT38 \u2192 t68\n\nLine: NT55 \u2192 t92\n\nWait, I'm looking for a production where the RHS is t58.\n\nLooking line: NT46 \u2192 t87 (Wait, no, line 19 is NT46 \u2192 't87'.)\n\nWait, let me scan all the rules to find which produce terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't70'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't46'\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some.

{"custom_id":"request-423","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Okay, first, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol which can have just one part.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT6 and NT58. So any string generated by this grammar should start with whatever NT6 and NT58 produce. Wait, but looking at the string, the very first token is 't46'. Hmm, so maybe the initial production of S leads to two non-terminals, and each of those needs to eventually produce the sequence.\n\nNow, looking at the right-hand sides of the grammar rules, each production for a non-terminal leads to two other non-terminals. That means every step in the derivation will result in more non-terminals until they become terminals. Each time, the number of symbols either increases or decreases. But wait, in this grammar, all non-terminals seem to eventually produce two terminals. So each rule for NT leads to two terminals when fully resolved.\n\nThe string we need to check is: `t46 t83 t72 t53 t96 t68 t36 t27 t7 t7 t77 t22 t55 t13 t77 t28 t28 t7 t79 t4 t40 t79 t4`.\n\nI notice that all the symbols are 't' followed by numbers, which seems to be the terminals. So each of these must be derived from the non-terminals through the productions.\n\nSince each production leads to two non-terminals except some that directly go to 't'? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar again. Actually, looking at the rules, most seem to go to two non-terminals until they reach a 't...'. For example, NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT62, both non-terminals. But others like NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, again non-terminals. Wait, but then looking deeper, some of the NTs lead to a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, does any NT directly produce a terminal?\n\nLooking through the list, I see for example, NT94 \u2192 't77' and NT73 \u2192 't25'. Similarly, NT95 \u2192 't14', NT79 \u2192 't27', NT63 \u2192 't36', NT56 \u2192 't72', NT87 \u2192 't98', NT27 \u2192 't4', NT38 \u2192 't68', NT22 \u2192 't87', NT9 \u2192 't26', NT84 \u2192 't46', NT2 \u2192 't70', NT85 \u2192 't95', etc. Wait, wait, some lines have the non-terminals producing to a 't' followed by a number. So for example, the line says: NT69 \u2192 't67'. So that's a terminal. Similarly, NT34 \u2192 't36' and others.\n\nSo in other words, the non-terminals can produce a pair of non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals. Wait, but looking at the grammar, most rules have two non-terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 't25' is wrong because the right-hand side is 't25', which is a terminal. Oh wait, perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, no. In NT73 \u2192 't25', 't25' is a terminal symbol. So maybe that production can directly generate a terminal. But looking at other productions, such as NT73 \u2192 't25', but in other productions, non-terminals go to two non-terminals. So each step produces more tokens.\n\nWait, but here's the confusion: Each production in the grammar is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT, except some productions may produce a terminal and a non-terminal. So for example, NT38 \u2192 't68' would produce a terminal and a non-terminal. But wait, no, wait: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production must have two non-terminals on the right. So I think I might be misunderstanding the grammar structure.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial grammar rules are written as something like S -> NT6 NT58. That means S produces NT6 followed by NT58. Each of these NTs can produce further non-terminals or terminals?\n\nWait, no. Because in Chomsky Normal Form, the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So each production in the grammar I have should produce two non-terminals, and each of those must eventually produce tokens. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me look at the grammar again.\n\nWait, the user presented the grammar with rules like S -> NT6 NT58, which are in the form NT \u2192 NT NT, which is correct for CNF. Then, looking further, some lines have the non-terminals producing a string that starts with a 't', like NT69 \u2192 't67' which would mean that NT69 produces a terminal 't67' immediately. But in CNF, all productions must have non-terminals on the right-hand side. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar representation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't...' is a terminal, but it's a single token, so NT \u2192 'tX' would mean that NT can produce two terminals, one is 'tX' and the other is... Wait, but CNF allows for productions of a single non-terminal to two terminals. So for example, A \u2192 a b, where a and b are terminals. But in the given grammar, it's written as NT9 \u2192 't68' NT40, which I'm not sure. Wait, the line is: NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69. But others like NT69 \u2192 't67' would imply it's producing a terminal followed by another non-terminal?\n\nI think this is a confusion between the way the user presented the grammar. Maybe the user intended that NTs can produce any number of terminal and non-terminal combinations, but in CNF, that's not allowed because all productions are in the form NT \u2192 NT NT, NT \u2192 NT t, or NT \u2192 t t, but in standard CNF, it's only NT \u2192 NT NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the grammar is in a slightly different form than standard CNF. Alternatively, perhaps the production NT95 \u2192 't9 NT6' would mean it produces 't9' and NT6, but NT6 \u2192 't73' or something else. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the given string step by step, breaking it down into the possible symbols from the grammar. Since the grammar is given in CNF, it's a binary tree structure, and each node needs to expand into two symbols at a time until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string is:\n\nt46 t83 t72 t53 t96 t68 t36 t27 t7 t7 t77 t22 t55 t13 t77 t28 t28 t7 t79 t4 t40 t79 t4\n\nThis string has 23 tokens, which is a lot. Wait, in a CNF grammar, each production generates two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Or perhaps, wait, perhaps every rule that terminates directly produces two terminals. For example, the line NT34 \u2192 't36 nt65': maybe that's a typo and should be NT34 \u2192 't36' or something else? Alternatively, maybe the way it's written in the rules is that it can produce a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to try to map out the string as a series of derivations, expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach it as constructing the parse tree for the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree, with the root being the start symbol S.\n\nThe given string is the sequence of terminal tokens. So in the parse tree, each interior node must expand into two non-terminals, which in turn expand until they produce the terminals in the string.\n\nBut considering the number of tokens is 23, which is a bit difficult because 2^n = 23 is not a power of two, but 2^4=16, 2^5=32, so 23 is somewhere between, which suggests that the parse tree depth is 4 or 5, but 23 is not a possible number since each step in the tree must produce exactly two symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-430","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal (left-hand side) expands into two non-terminals (right-hand side). Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or terminals like a specific 't' followed by a number. \n\nThe given string is: t46 t74 t82 t44 t63 t25 t95 t95 t9 t28 t12 t8 t13 t36 t7 t12 t55 t12 t9 t8 t64 t72 t95. \n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these production rules step by step. \n\nLet me start by listing all the production rules to see which ones produce terminals. The user provided a list of productions, each as S \u2192 NT6 NT58, etc., followed by many NTs leading to further splits until some have terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, it seems many NTs eventually resolve to specific 't' followed by a number. For example, NT94 \u2192 't77', NT73 \u2192 't25', and so on.\n\nSo, the approach is to reconstruct the parse tree starting from S, breaking down each symbol into its components, and checking if the string matches the leaves of the tree.\n\nWait, but with the grammar, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so each production increases the length of the string by one. But since the given string is a sequence of terminals, we need to see if it can be built by expanding S through these rules until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me see the initial production: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, initially, the string starts with the two terminal strings from NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6 and NT58. Hmm, from the list:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n- NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nSo, NT6 breaks down into NT73 and NT62, which further break down. Let's see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62? Wait, no: looking back, NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62? Wait, no, according to the list, NT62 is: \n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62? No, wait, let me check.\n\nWait, NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62? No, in the given list, I see:\n\nLooking through, I found NT62: \n\nNT62 \u2192 NT84 NT95\n\nAh, so NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT95.\n\nWait, let me verify. Let me list all NTs and their productions:\n\nLooking at the list, after S, the next is NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66, etc. But for NT62, the production is:\n\nLooking through the list: \n\nYes, here is NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT95\n\nSo, NT62 splits into NT84 and NT95. Similarly, NT6 is NT73 NT62.\n\nSo starting from S \u2192 NT6 NT58:\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nThen, each of these gets expanded:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nSo, now the string is [NT73, NT84, NT62, NT9]. Wait, no, the order is NT6, then NT58, so the initial expansion is:\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT6 NT58,\n\nwhich becomes [NT73, NT62, NT58's parts? Wait, no, wait: S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and then each non-terminal is expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model each level of expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to try to parse the string top-down, starting from S, and see if each step matches the production rules.\n\nLet's see the string: t46 t74 t82 t44 t63 t25 t95 t95 t9 t28 t12 t8 t13 t36 t7 t12 t55 t12 t9 t8 t64 t72 t95.\n\nThis is a list of 23 terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step of expansion increases the length by 1, starting from 1 (for a single non-terminal). But in this case, the top-level production for S is two non-terminals, so the starting length is 2.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map each terminal to its corresponding production rule and see if the sequence can be constructed step by step.\n\nLet me create a map of terminal symbol to their production:\n\nLooking through the productions, each terminal is of the form 'tX', so I can list each 'tX' and see which non-terminal produces it.\n\nFor example:\n\nt46 \u2192 NT65 (because NT65 \u2192 't82'?)\nWait, looking back: \n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT that produce 't46'. Let's check each NT:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't46', but in the list:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list. Let me scan for NTs that produce 't46':\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT46: 't46' appears in two places. One is NT46 \u2192 't28' and another is NT46 \u2192 't46'? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the list:\n\nLooking for NT46:\n\nLine: NT46 \u2192 't46' appears here: Wait, no, in the user's list, I see:\n\nThe user lists:\n\nLine: NT46 \u2192 't28' line: 'NT46 -> 't28''.\n\nAnd then: 'NT46 -> 't87''.\n\nSo, NT46 can produce t28 or t87.\n\nBut t46 is another terminal. Wait, did I miss it?\n\nWait, maybe I missed a line. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the user-provided production list:\n\n...\n\nNT74 ->...\n\nNT56 ->...\n\nNT46 -> 't28'\n\nThen:\n\nNT56->... and NT73...\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a production for t46. Or maybe it's from another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine all the lines to see where 't46' comes from.\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\nLooking for 't46' in the list:\n\n- NT46 appears in two places:\n\nLine: NT46 -> 't28'\n\nLine: NT46 -> 't87'\n\nSo, it seems NT46 produces t28 or t87, not t46. Hmm, did I miss any?\n\nWait, maybe I need to scan more carefully.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT46 appears twice, with t28 and t87.\n\nI don't see any production for 't46' in the list provided. So wait, does that mean that 't46' is not present in the grammar, or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check again. The list is long, so I might have skipped over it.\n\nLooking again:\n\nAfter NT76: NT80 \u2192 't22'\n\nThen NT39: NT78 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT27: 't4'\n\nNT38: 't68'\n\nNT2: 't6'\n\nNT84: \u2192 etc.\n\nWait, after NT62: NT6 \u2192 't73' and 't62'\n\nWait, no, looking for 't46', I think I might have misread. Let me go back.\n\nLooking through the lines again:\n\n- NT2: 't70', 't6', 't44', etc.\n\n- NT36: 't36'\n\nWait, this is the line: NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67. Then NT63 \u2192 't36'\n\nSo NT63 \u2192 't36'\n\nThen NT34: 't36'\n\nWait, no, looking for 't46'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me look at the line:\n\nHere's the line: NT46 \u2192 't28' and 't87'\n\nThat's it. So 't46' may not be in the grammar. Wait, but the string to parse includes 't46' as the first symbol, so that can't be right. How can that be?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial parsing.

{"custom_id":"request-444","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by recalling that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That simplifies things a bit because the grammar is a binary tree structure, and every step in the derivation is a combination of two symbols into one.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t8 t96 t40 t64 t39 t44 t96 t27 t63 t6 t92 t25 t46 t96 t25 t12 t22 t14 t12 t72 t79 t94 t25 t6.\n\nFirst, I should note that the start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So whatever the string is, it must start with the expansion of S, which is two parts: the first part derived from NT6 and the second from NT58.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts. The first part should be the derivation of NT6, and the second part the derivation of NT58. But wait, how do I split the string? The string is a sequence of terms separated by spaces, so each term is a single character. The grammar productions generate strings where each production adds two terms. So the entire string must have an even number of terms. Let me count the terms:\n\nCounting each 't' separated by spaces: t8, t96, t40, t64, t39, t44, t96, t27, t63, t6, t92, t25, t46, t96, t25, t12, t22, t14, t12, t72, t79, t94, t25, t6. That's 24 terms. 24 is even, so it's possible. So the first 12 terms are NT6, and the last 12 terms are NT58.\n\nWait, no, in the Chomsky Normal Form, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the entire string is the combination of NT6 and NT58. So the full derivation would start with S \u2192 A B, then A generates a string, and B generates another string, and together they form the final string.\n\nSo for the string to be valid, the first half (12 terms) must be derived from NT6, and the second half (12 terms) from NT58.\n\nLet me first look at NT58. From the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So the first step for NT58 is to break into NT84 and NT9. Each of these may further break down.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. So NT84 splits into NT34 and NT93.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65. Wait, but NT34 is being split into NT58 and NT65, which were part of the initial split? Hmm. Let me think step by step.\n\nPerhaps it's better to build the parse tree step by step, starting from the string and seeing if it can be reduced to S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to see if the string can be split into two parts, each of which can be generated by NT6 and NT58 respectively.\n\nStarting with NT58: its productions eventually lead to terminals, so let's see what NT58 can generate. From the grammar:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9 \u2192 NT34 NT93 NT9\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\nWait, that seems like it could loop. Let me see: NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, and NT58 is already expanding, so maybe this leads to a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps NT58 can be expanded further.\n\nLet me try to see the possible terminals derived from NT58.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT58:\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9 \u2192 NT34 NT93 NT9\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n\nSo this seems recursive. Let's see the terminal rules for NT34:\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65. Now NT65, from the grammar:\nNT65 \u2192 NT38 NT82\nNT38 \u2192 NT68 NT40\nNT38 \u2192 NT27 NT66 (Wait, looking again: NT38 has two productions. Let's check.)\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT38 has:\nNT38 \u2192 NT68 NT40 and NT38 \u2192 NT27 NT66. So NT38 can be split into different pairs.\n\nLooking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 t4, as per the rules. So NT27 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSimilarly, NT38 can eventually lead to 't68' (from NT68 \u2192 't63' and then perhaps NT63 etc.), but that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see which terminals are in the string and see if the grammar can generate them.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt8, t96, t40, t64, t39, t44, t96, t27, t63, t6, t92, t25, t46, t96, t25, t12, t22, t14, t12, t72, t79, t94, t25, t6.\n\nI notice that several parts are 't79', 't67', etc., but in the split, I need to see how each part can be formed.\n\nWait, maybe I can try to see the possible expansions for NT58. NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9, and NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. Then NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, which I think can loop, but perhaps the terminals from NT58 would involve more steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the terminal symbols in the string and see if they match the possible productions. But this might take a while.\n\nAnother approach is to start from S and see if I can derive the string. Starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo the string must start with NT6 generating some part, followed by NT58 generating another part, together forming the entire string.\n\nLet me check what NT6 can generate. From the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT8 \u2192 t12\nNT9 \u2192 t26\nSo that's one way: NT73 \u2192 NT8 t26. So NT73 would generate t12 t26.\n\nThen NT673 would derive to t12 t26. So NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62. Let's look at NT62:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT97 NT620? Wait, looking at the grammar rules.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT62 \u2192 NT97 and NT620... Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

{"custom_id":"request-449","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string given is: t95 t55 t82 t94 t22 t79 t77 t12 t68 t55 t16 t27 t96 t26 t25 t7 t6 t25 t70 t12 t36 t53 t77 t64.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a single terminal symbol. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit this structure since each rule either ends with a terminal or produces two non-terminals. Also, I notice that some rules have a single terminal on the right side, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. To do this, I think I should parse the string step by step, trying to match each token with a production, maybe starting from the largest possible steps down to the terminals.\n\nThe initial production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the string must start with the symbols generated by NT6 and NT58. Each of these non-terminals will need to produce the corresponding substrings.\n\nLet me list out the string again for clarity:\n\nt95 t55 t82 t94 t22 t79 t77 t12 t68 t55 t16 t27 t96 t26 t25 t7 t6 t25 t70 t12 t36 t53 t77 t64.\n\nI know that from the start S, the first step is to produce NT6 NT58. Each of these non-terminals might produce sequences of terminals that form parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, t95 is the first token. So, I should check if any of the NT6 or NT58 produce sequences that can start with t95.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT95 has several productions. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69, and NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66. Also, NT95 \u2192 NT85 NT6, and NT95 \u2192 NT95 NT6.\n\nWait, but NT95 itself isn't directly NT6 or NT58, but perhaps through a chain. Maybe I should see which non-terminals lead to t95.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the productions:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66 \u2192 possibly producing t27 and t66? Wait, but NT27's production is NT4 \u2192 't4', which isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, NT66 \u2192 't96' and also might produce other things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal to its productions and see how they can generate the given string.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can perform a top-down parsing using the given productions, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the string and see if a reverse top-down approach can be used, but perhaps top-down is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to match the string step by step. Let's attempt that.\n\nThe string starts with t95, which is a terminal. So, does any non-terminal produce t95? Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't95' directly? Wait, in the grammar, I see NT95 has productions, but none listed as directly producing 't95'. Wait, checking:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, in the grammar, I see NT95 \u2192 't94' 't14', which might not help. Wait, perhaps I need to check all the NT95 rules.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar entries:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69\n- NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66\n- NT95 \u2192 NT85 NT6\n- NT95 \u2192 NT95 NT6\n\nWait, none of these seem to produce a terminal directly like 't95'. So perhaps t95 is produced indirectly.\n\nWait, but looking further down, I see that NT27 \u2192 't4' and NT38 \u2192 't68', etc. But maybe I need to see a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string doesn't exactly match, so maybe 'No' is the answer, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The first symbol is t95, so perhaps it's generated by NT95.\n\nBut from the grammar, NT95 has a production \u2192 NT27 NT66. Let me see what NT27 and NT66 produce.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT63 NT67. So NT27 produces NT63 and NT67. Then, NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22, and NT67 \u2192 NT53 NT77.\n\nWait, this might get too long. Alternatively, let me see if any production directly ends with 't95'. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any production that produces 't95' directly except perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the grammar rules for NT95.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT95 NT6 \u2192 that's recursive, so perhaps not useful.\n\nWait, maybe NT95 can produce through other means. Alternatively, perhaps t95 is produced by NT27 and NT66. Let me see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't4' directly, as per the rule:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT27 \u2192 't4' directly? Wait, no, in the list provided, I see:\n\nWait, no, looking through the list, I have:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9'\n- NT94 \u2192 't14'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar for NT27 is:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't4' directly. So NT27 can produce 't4', and NT66 can produce 't96' directly because NT66 \u2192 't96'.\n\nSo, if NT95 produces NT27 NT66, that would produce 't4' 't96'. But the first token is 't95', which doesn't match. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, so perhaps NT95 doesn't directly produce 't95', and the first token 't95' can't be derived from any of the NT rules. Or maybe I'm missing a production.\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules again, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't95'. So that's a red flag. If the string starts with 't95', and there's no production that directly or indirectly generates 't95' as the first symbol, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I misread the grammar. Looking through the list again:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT95 NT6 \u2192 that's a recursive production, but it doesn't help because it just loops.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a direct production for t95. Let's list all the NTs and their right-hand sides:\n\n- S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n- NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66\n- NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22\n- NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69, NT27 NT66, NT85 NT6, NT95 NT6\n- NT19 \u2192 NT37 NT69\n- NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84\n- NT14 \u2192 NT59 NT15\n- NT50 \u2192 NT93 NT6\n- NT78 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n- NT56 \u2192 NT9 NT19, NT84 NT9\n- NT95 \u2192 NT85 NT6\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n- NT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17, NT74 NT56\n- NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n- NT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2\n- NT40 \u2192 NT74 NT56, NT84 NT9\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list them properly.\n\nWait, no, the main point is, none of the NT95 productions directly produce 't95'; instead, the first production starts with 't95' as part of a larger structure. So, if the string starts with 't95', it would require a non-terminal that produces it, which doesn't seem to exist.\n\nSo, if the first token is '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-471","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems all the production rules are either two non-terminals on the right or directly produce a terminal. So that's good because it means the grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t7 t40 t53 t83 t79 t53 t44 t25 t83 t94 t77 t79 t74 t94 t7 t67 t94 t94 t64 t77 t16 t22 t8 t49 t3`.\n\nMy task is to determine if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S using the given productions. The start symbol here is S, which according to the first production is NT6 followed by NT58. But wait, NT6 and NT58 themselves are non-terminals that can be broken down further.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 is the first production. So S expands directly into NT6 and NT58, each of which are non-terminals. Let me check the productions for NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nWait, that's another non-terminal, so S needs to expand step by step. I might have to build a parse tree from the start symbol down to the terminals. Alternatively, I can reverse-engineer the string and see if it can be derived by matching each segment through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try applying the productions to see if the string can be generated. But with so many possible non-terminals, it's a bit complex. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be built by starting from S and applying the productions in a way that matches each terminal in the string.\n\nAnother thought: since each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals, each step either consumes one terminal or splits into two non-terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, the parse tree must expand such that all non-terminals eventually produce terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet me outline the steps to parse the string:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n2. So, the first two symbols must be the results of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, the string should be split into two parts: the first part generated by NT6 and the second by NT58.\n\nLooking at the string: t7 t40 t53 t83 t79 t53 t44 t25 t83 t94 t77 t79 t74 t94 t7 t67 t94 t94 t64 t77 t16 t22 t8 t49 t3.\n\nThat's 25 symbols. So the string needs to be split into two parts: the first part is generated by NT6 and consumes some symbols, and the second part is generated by NT58 and consumes the remaining symbols.\n\nWait, no. NT6 and NT58 generate their respective parts, but since the string is a single sequence, each part must generate a sequence of terminals. So the total sequence is the concatenation of the terminal sequences generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo I need to parse the whole string as NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the entire string must be NT6 NT58. So the first part (NT6) generates the first part of the string, and the second part (NT58) generates the second part.\n\nSo let's split the given string into two parts and see if each can be generated by NT6 and NT58 respectively.\n\nBut wait, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the whole string is divided into two sections: NT6 and NT58.\n\nBut the entire string is t7 followed by more t's. So the first NT6 must generate a substring from the start, and the second NT58 must generate the remaining symbol after that.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts. Suppose the string is T = A B, where A is generated by NT6 and B by NT58.\n\nI'll need to try different splits and see if any split allows both A and B to be generated by their respective non-terminals.\n\nBut considering the size of the string, this might take a while. Alternatively, I can look for the terminal that NT6 can produce as its first symbols and see if it matches the beginning of the string.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nSo NT6 must split into NT73 and NT62. Each of these can further split, so this could go deep. Let's see what NT73 and NT62 produce.\n\nNT73's productions:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 is an internal non-terminal that splits into NT8 and NT9.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nSo NT8 is a terminal. So from NT73, we get t12 and then NT9.\n\nNT9's productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40.\n\nSo NT9 splits into NT68 and NT40.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67.\n\nSo NT68 splits into NT63 and NT67.\n\nNT63's productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT95 NT66 or NT63 \u2192 NT94 t63? Wait, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is of the form X \u2192 a or X \u2192 YZ. So for NT63, looking at the productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT95 NT66 is one production, and NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22 is another.\n\nWait, the initial string starts with t7. Wait, let me check the grammar again. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has several production entries. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, which in turn go to NT8 (which is t12) and NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t7, which is the first symbol. So I must find a way that one of these productions starts with t7.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the provided grammar, some production rules are terminal productions. For example:\n\nNT94 \u2192 't77'\n\nSo perhaps NT94 can generate t77.\n\nWait, but then how does the parsing proceed? Let me go step by step.\n\nI need to build the parsing steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the parse tree for the string and see if it's possible.\n\nLet me try:\n\nThe string starts with t7. So the parsed symbols must start with t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t7 is generated by NT94: NT94 \u2192 t77?\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nI see NT94 \u2192 t77 (line 27), and NT94 also \u2192 t14 (line 91), etc.\n\nWait, line 91: NT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t7. So how does t7 get generated?\n\nLooking at the productions for each NT in the grammar, I see that some NTs directly produce a single terminal.\n\nFor instance:\n\nNT69 \u2192 t67\n\nNT46 \u2192 t87\n\nNT2 \u2192 t9 (line 28), t6 (line 2), t7 (line 108: NT2 \u2192 t70?), Wait, looking at the provided grammar (the very long list):\n\nLine 28: NT2 \u2192 t70\n\nLine 2: NT2 \u2192 t6\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the grammar correctly.

{"custom_id":"request-470","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me see. The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should remember what CNF entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So every production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That\u2019s important because it affects how strings are generated\u2014their length relates directly to the number of production steps, each possibly adding two symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the rules seem to follow this. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S is replaced by two non-terminals, which are NT6 and NT58. Each of these non-terminals likely has their own productions, and so on, recursively until terminals are reached.\n\nNow, the string provided is: t72 t94 t39 t79 t14 t26 t36 t68 t55 t97 t94 t13 t83 t83 t58 t76 t72 t9 t72 t8 t63 t94 t4 t28 t55\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the string is a series of 't's followed by numbers, it's essentially a sequence of terminals. Each of these terminals must correspond to terminal symbols in the grammar. So the first step is to check if all the terms in the string are present as terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are 't' followed by various numbers. Let me list them:\n\nFrom the grammar, terminals are:\nt72, t94, t39, t79, t14, t26, t36, t68, t55, t97, t13, t83, t83, t58, t76, t72, t9, t72, t8, t63, t94, t4, t28, t55\n\nSo the string breaks down into these. For example, the string starts with t72, which is a terminal. The next is t94, which is also a terminal. Similarly, all the terms in the string are terminals, so they can be part of the generated string if they appear in the grammar.\n\nNext, I need to think about how the string can be formed. Since it's a CFG, it's generated through a series of substitutions according to the rules. Each non-terminal expands into terminals and possibly other non-terminals.\n\nGiven the structure, the length of the string should reflect the number of steps in the derivation. Since each step in CNF production either adds one terminal (if a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal) or keeps the length the same (if a non-terminal is replaced by two terminals), but in two steps, a single terminal can appear. Wait, actually, each production either produces two symbols (non-terminals) or a single terminal. So each step in the derivation can increase the number of symbols by one because replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals (which may eventually become terminals) can lead to more terminals, but the total number can vary.\n\nWait, but actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So for each non-terminal, each production replaces it with two non-terminals or a terminal. So in a derivation, starting from S, which is non-terminal, each step can increase the number of symbols. The length of the string will be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which for a CFG in CNF is 2^k, where k is the number of times a non-terminal was replaced by two non-terminals. But that might not be exactly accurate because it's possible to have different numbers based on the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the structure of the given string. Let's count the number of terminals. The string given is: \n\n32 terminals? Let me count:\n\nt72 (1), t94(2), t39(3), t79(4), t14(5), t26(6), t36(7), t68(8), t55(9), t97(10), t94(11), t13(12), t83(13), t83(14), t58(15), t76(16), t72(17), t9(18), t72(19), t8(20), t63(21), t94(22), t4(23), t28(24), t55(25)\n\nWait, that's 25 terms. Hmm, so the string has 25 symbols. Now, given that the grammar is in CNF, each production step either produces one terminal or two. So the number of symbols in the string relates to the number of productions. Let's think about the derivation.\n\nThe start symbol is S. So to get a string of length n, the number of productions must be such that starting from S, after a certain number of steps, we get the string. For a string of length m, the number of nodes in the parse tree is m, and the number of internal nodes (each corresponding to a production) is m-1. But since each production can split a non-terminal into either one terminal or two non-terminals, the derivation can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the leftmost derivation. Let's see an example.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 (length 2). So after one production, the string starts as NT6 NT58. Now, each of these can be terminals or non-terminals. NT6 \u2192 t73 t62. But that's two terminals. So S \u2192 t73 t62 t58. That's three symbols. So the number of symbols can vary depending on the depth of the derivation.\n\nBut in any case, the length of the string could be variable, but the structure should follow the productions.\n\nNow, looking at the given string, it's a single linear sequence. So we need to see if this can be generated through a series of splits where each non-terminal expands into the required number of symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if there's a path that starts from S and generates the string step by step. But since the string is 25 symbols, and each step could split a non-terminal into two, eventually, the string length would be 2^(n) depending on how many splits occur, but that might not necessarily be the case because some parts could be terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe we can model this as a parse tree and check if the given string can be a leftmost derivation. But that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the symbols and see if they can fit into the productions.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t72, t94, t39, t79, t14, t26, t36, t68, t55, etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, let's see: NT72 is a non-terminal. Looking at the productions, NT72 \u2192 t77. Hmm, but in the string, the first symbol is t72. Wait, so perhaps NT72 must expand to t72, but according to the grammar, NT72 \u2192 t77. That can't be right. Wait, wait, I need to check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there a production for NT72?\n\nSearching through the productions, I see lines like:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\nNT72 \u2192 ... Hmm, I don't see NT72 in the list. Wait, actually, in the productions given, I see NT72 isn't listed. Wait, let's check all the productions:\n\nLooking at lines:\n\nNT72: Not listed. Hmm, wait, looking through the list:\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the list again.\n\n productions provided:\n\nLooking for NT72: \n\nNo, in the list, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nLooking through the NTx productions: NT72 is not listed.

But the string starts with t72.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, any symbol that's a terminal is either 't' followed by a number, or something? Let me think.\n\nWait, in the grammar, every line is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So NT72 must be a non-terminal unless it's listed as a terminal. But looking through the list, all the symbols are either non-terminals (NTx) or terminals which start with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, I don't see a production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-483","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t77 t98 t63 t16 t16 t16 t94 t28 t3 t44 t7 t74 t58 t22 t3 t97 t25 t27 t94 t74 t39 t72 t72 t68 t25 t7`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or non-terminal splitting into two others. That should make parsing easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just thinking through it, I'll take a different approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT58. Both of these are non-terminals, so the string can only consist of these generated expansions. Each of these then splits into other non-terminals, and eventually, the non-terminals turn into terminals (tokens like 't77', 't98', etc.) or more non-terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with 't77' which is produced by NT79. Checking the grammar: does NT79 produce 't77'? Looking at the rules, the only rule for NT79 is NT79 -> NT78 NT46, and those both seem to produce other non-terminals or maybe specific terminals? Wait, looking at the end of the grammar, I see NT2 -> 't70', but that's under the start symbol's rule. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, the right-hand sides of the rules are non-terminals and terminals. So for example, NT19 -> NT37 NT69, and NT37 -> NT39 NT15, etc. So to generate a string, non-terminals must eventually expand to terminals.\n\nSo the approach is to work from the string backwards, using the reverse approach, trying to find a derivation path from the string back to the start symbol. Each token in the string is a terminal, so we need to see if each part can be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is of the form A->BC, maybe I can parse the string by grouping the terminals into possible pairs that form each step.\n\nLet me list the tokens again to see if I can group them in a way that fits the grammar:\n\nt77, t98, t63, t16, t16, t16, t94, t28, t3, t44, t7, t74, t58, t22, t3, t97, t25, t27, t94, t74, t39, t72, t72, t68, t25, t7.\n\nStarting with 't77' which is NT79 -> t77. So the first part must be a leftmost derivation starting with NT79.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT79: it only has one production, which is NT79 -> NT78 NT46. So that's not helping because it's the only way to get 't77', but NT79 needs to expand into non-terminals, which then further expand, possibly down to terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the production is NT79 -> NT78 NT46. So in the leftmost expansion, the string would start with NT78 followed by NT46, but NT78 and NT46 would each produce more non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, but the first token in the string is 't77', which is produced directly by NT79. So that would mean that NT79 must directly produce 't77' in the leftmost expansion, but according to the grammar, NT79 only expands to NT78 NT46. That can't be. So that suggests that the first token can't be 't77' because NT79 can't produce 't77' directly. But that's in the rules: the only way to get 't77' is through NT79 -> t77? Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see that NT94 -> 't77', NT73 -> 't25', NT79 -> 't16', NT69 -> 't67', etc. So in the rules provided, NT79 -> 't16', which might be a typo because in the given grammar, the line is \"NT79 -> NT78 NT46\", not a terminal. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, none of the rules end with a terminal directly, except for the ones that are written as, for example, NT2 -> 't70', which is a terminal. So each rule either goes to a terminal or two non-terminals. So in that case, the production for NT79 is NT79 -> NT78 NT46, which would mean it can't produce 't77' directly. So that would mean 't77' must come from a different rule, perhaps another non-terminal that expands into 't77'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, for example, NT94 -> 't77', so NT94 can produce 't77'. So in the string, the first token is 't77'. So to derive this, perhaps the string starts with 't77' from NT94. So then, we need to see if the rest of the string can be derived from the right part of NT94.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what does NT94 produce? The rules show NT94 -> 't14'. Wait, no, let me check: in the rules, I see NT94 -> 't14', but wait, is that correct? Let me scan the rules:\n\nLine by line:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- So NT94 can produce 't77' directly.\n\nBut if the string starts with 't77', then the derivation would start with NT94 -> t77. Then, the rest of the string must be generated from the right-hand side of NT94's production, but wait, in the grammar as given, NT94's production is only a terminal, so no further expansion is needed. So that would mean the entire string must be just 't77', which it isn't. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The grammar rules list each production as either a terminal or two non-terminals. So for NT94, we have NT94 -> 't77', meaning that NT94 can directly produce 't77' as a terminal. Therefore, if the string starts with 't77', that could correspond to NT94 -> t77. But in the string, after 't77', the next token is 't98', which can't be produced by NT94 anymore because the derivation is done. So that suggests that perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. The start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT58. So the entire string must be a derivation starting with S, so the first symbol must come from NT6 or NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't77', so either NT6 or NT58 must produce 't77' somehow. Let's check what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT6, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nAnd NT73 -> 't25' and NT62 -> NT63 NT67.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because NT73 is a non-terminal, so NT73 can't produce 't25' unless there's a rule for NT73 -> 't25'.\n\nLooking at the rules, yes, I see NT73 -> 't25'.\n\nSo, if NT6 -> NT73 NT62, and NT62 -> NT63 NT67, then after expanding NT6, the string starts with 't25' (from NT73) followed by whatever NT62 produces.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string starts with 't77', so perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe NT62 can produce 't77' somehow.\n\nLooking at NT62's production: NT62 -> NT63 NT67.\n\nThen NT63 can be broken down into NT94 NT22, and NT15 -> 't94'.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-482","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t53 t95 t25 t22 t49 t9 t84 t25 t64 t92 t26 t8 t16 t87 t46 t27 t84 t7 t36 t55 t16 t16 t58 t74 t27 t64`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has each production rule on the left side with exactly two non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal. The grammar here starts with S, and it's defined as S -> NT6 NT58. That means the start symbol produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. \n\nSince the string starts with `t53`, I should check which non-terminals produce terminals. Looking through the productions, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT2, NT74, and others, but most produce other non-terminals. \n\nI think I need to perform a parsing process, perhaps using a top-down approach like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent method. Since the string is relatively long (32 tokens), doing it manually might be time-consuming, but I can try to break it down step by step. \n\nAlternatively, I can look for possible ways to derive the string by starting with the top-level production and seeing if it can generate the entire string. The top-level production is S -> NT6 NT58, which means the entire string should be a sequence of symbols derived from these two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t53`. So, maybe NT6 or NT58 can produce `t53`. Checking NT58: I see that NT58 -> NT84 NT9. Both NT84 and NT9 are non-terminals, but NT84 can produce t46, and NT9 can produce t26. Wait, so NT58 would produce t46 t26, but the first part of the string is `t53 t95...`, which doesn't match that.\n\nMaybe I should check NT6. NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 would take the form of NT73 NT62. Now, looking at NT73 and NT62... Wait, NT73 can produce t8 or t25, and NT62 can produce t97 or t84. Let's see the string: the first token is `t53`, which doesn't match t8 or t25, nor does it match t97 or t84. So that wouldn't work. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol S isn't the top, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for sequences of terminals that can be linked together through the grammar rules. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for how the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the rules. Let's see, the first part is `t53 t95 t25`. Let me see where `t53` comes from. Looking through the productions, I see NT95 can produce NT85 NT6, but also NT93. NT95 can produce t95, so maybe NT95 is a part.\n\nWait, in the productions, NT95 -> NT93 NT6 OR NT27 NT66. So NT95 can produce NT93 NT6 or NT27 NT66. So perhaps the `t95` is from NT95, but how?\n\nWait, the string starts with `t53`, which isn't a direct terminal, except looking at some entries: NT95 -> 't77' or 't14' as per the productions. Wait, looking back: in the productions, there's a line NT95 -> 't77' but that's under the non-terminals. Wait, let me re-examine the productions carefully.\n\nI see that some entries are 't' followed by a number, which are the terminals. For example, NT79 -> 't27'. So each of these represents a terminal symbol. So the string is a list of terminal symbols.\n\nSo, for instance, NT79 can produce 't27', NT77 can produce 't77'?\n\nWait, in the grammar given, I see entries like:\n\nNT95 -> 't95' (no, wait: looking back, does any non-terminal produce 't77'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, there are entries like NT94 -> 't77', NT77 is a production?\n\nWait, in the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT94 -> 't77'\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\n\nNT50 -> 't93'\n\nWait, but also:\n\nNT95 -> 't27' \n\nWait, no, actually, looking again at the productions listed, there's a line:\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\n\nAnother line:\n\nNT50 -> 't93'\n\nBut for NT95, let me check:\n\nYes, there's \"NT95 -> NT27 NT66\" which becomes 't27' and 't66' when NT27 and NT66 produce terminals. Wait, do they? Let's check:\n\nLooking for 't' symbols in the productions:\n\n- NT79 -> 't16', 't73', etc. Let me see if any of the non-terminals directly produce 't77' or 't95' etc.\n\nLooking at the productions, I find:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n\n- NT95 -> 't27'\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n\n- NT50 -> 't93'\n\nBut looking at others, like NT2 -> 't9', 't44', etc. Wait, but in the given grammar, it's under the 'NT' as non-terminals and 't' as terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's list out all the direct terminal productions:\n\nFrom the productions:\n\nNT74 -> 't77'\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\n\nNT50 -> 't93'\n\nNT94 -> 't13' from NT69\n\nWait, wait, looking for which NT directly produce 't...':\n\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nNT2 -> 't9', 't44', 't6', 't70', 't64', 't16', 't87', 't46', 't27', 't6', 't74', 't25', 't92', 't36', 't58', 't62', 't84', 't22', 't77', 't56', 't77', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the NT productions that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9', 't44', 't6', 't70', 't64', 't16', 't87', 't46', 't27', 't6', 't74', 't25', 't92', 't36', 't58', 't62', 't84', 't22', 't77'\n\nWait, but I see lines like NT73 -> 't25', so NT73 is a terminal that produces 't25'.\n\nSimilarly, NT94 -> 't14'\n\nWait, let me make a list of NTs that have rules leading directly to terminals:\n\n1. NT73 -> 't25'\n2. NT74 -> 't77'\n3. NT2 -> 't9', 't44', 't6', 't70', 't64', 't16', 't87', 't46', 't27', 't6' (Wait, but some are from other rules)\nWait, no. The rules like NT2 -> 't9' mean that NT2 directly produces the terminal 't9'. Similarly, NT73 -> 't25' means NT73 directly produces 't25'.\n\nSo I think the direct productions that result in terminals are:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9', 't44', 't6', 't70', 't64', 't16', 't87', 't46', 't27', 't6' (Wait, 't6' is a terminal? Or is that a rule?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the productions are all rules for non-terminals. For example, NT2 has the rule -> 't9' and others, which means NT2 directly produces 't9'. So if in the grammar, an NT is on the left, and on the right, there's a mix of NTs and terminals, then that's a production where some symbols are terminals and others are non-terminals.\n\nBut to produce a terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-503","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to check is `t82 t4 t53 t67 t27 t77 t84 t77 t26 t13 t67 t58 t7 t9 t67 t95 t13 t87 t7 t82`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that each production in the grammar works in a top-down manner, breaking down the start symbol S into smaller parts. The given string is a sequence of terminal symbols (the t...), so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from S by applying the production rules.\n\nLooking at the top-level production, S is defined as NT63 and NT66. So, the first part should start with NT63 or NT66. Let's see what each of these produces.\n\nFrom the rules, NT63 produces NT94 and NT22. Also, NT66 produces NT93 and NT6. So the first symbol in the string should be either nt63, which can lead to NT94, NT22, or nt66, leading to NT93,NT6. Wait, but looking at the string, the first token is t82. Let me check which non-terminals can produce t82.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice NT82 -> NT96. Then, what does NT96 produce? Looking further, NT96 isn't a terminal, it's a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules, the strings have nt... as non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, the rhs is in terms of other non-terminals and terminals marked with 't...'. So each rule is a non-terminal on the left, and on the rhs, you can have combinations.\n\nWait, the initial production is S -> NT63 NT66. So S can produce two non-terminals, NT63 and NT66. So the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT63 or NT66.\n\nLet's see NT63: its productions are NT94 and NT22. So NT63 -> NT94 NT22. Then, what do these produce?\n\nNT94 is a non-terminal that produces 't77', as per NT94 -> 't77'. So NT94 is a terminal string 't77'.\n\nNT22 is a non-terminal that produces 't87'. So the expansion of NT63 would result in 't77 t87'.\n\nBut the first token in the string is 't82', not 't77'. So that suggests that S starts with NT63, which would produce 't77 t87', but the string starts with 't82', so that's a mismatch. Let me check the other alternative.\n\nS can also be NT66, which expands to NT93 and NT6. Let's see what NT93 and NT6 produce.\n\nNT93 is a non-terminal that produces 't95' and 't53' (from looking at the rules, wait: no, perhaps I misread. Let me check. NT93: Let me look through the rules. Wait, searching for NT93 in the production list, I find NT93 -> NT78 NT37. Wait, no, looking at the rules, actually, looking for NT93, perhaps I didn't cover all. Maybe I need to check all NT93's rules.\n\nLooking through the list, I see that NT93 is not listed, but perhaps I have to find if any non-terminal leads to t82. Alternatively, perhaps I should build an analysis tree where each non-terminal at each step produces the appropriate symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string from the end, but that might take a long time.\n\nWait, another approach: since the string is a series of terminals, each must be derived from the productions. So perhaps I can check each occurrence of a t... and see which NT can produce it.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt82, t4, t53, t67, t27, t77, t84, t77, t26, t13, t67, t58, t7, t9, t67, t95, t13, t87, t7, t82.\n\nThere are 20 tokens, which suggests that during expansion, we had multiple splits and merges, but the key is that each token must come from some production's rhs.\n\nSo, starting with 't82' as the first symbol: Since t82 is a terminal, we can backtrack to see which non-terminal can produce it. Looking through the rules, the production NT78 -> 't53' is present, but that doesn't produce t82. Wait, perhaps I need to find which NT has a production where t82 is part of the rhs.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nIs there a production where a non-terminal expands into 't82'? Let's look.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I need to find any NT such that NT -> ... including 't82' in the rhs.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT82 -> 't12'? Wait, no.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules again, I see:\n\n- NT79 -> 't67'\n\n- NT78 -> 't16', but also NT78 is on the rhs elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps none of the NTs directly produce 't82', except for a production where 't82' is part of the rhs.\n\nWait, looking through:\n\nIs there any production for a non-terminal that includes 't82'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, perhaps NT36: NT36 -> NT79 NT2. NT79 is a non-terminal that, according to one of the rules, produces 't67'. NT2 -> 't44' or a 't...' perhaps? Wait, looking at NT2's rules, it's defined as NT2 -> 't9' via a production rule. Alternatively, NT2 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused. Let me check each rule again step by step.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nThe string starts with 't82'. What production could start with 't82'? Let me look through all the rules.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT82 doesn't appear as the lhs of any rule. So 't82' cannot be directly produced. But maybe it's part of a rhs of another production.\n\nWait, for example, NT29 -> 't82'? But I don't see any production with NT29. Let me check NT76: NT76 -> NT74 NT56. Wait, is there a production for NT74?\n\nWait, looking through:\n\n- NT15 -> 't94'\n\n- NT36 -> NT79 NT2\n\n- NT40 -> NT95 NT17\n\nWait, perhaps a production like NT36 -> 't68' something? No, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the string itself. Let's try to parse it step by step, starting from the start symbol S, trying to match each token.\n\nLet me consider that each production in the grammar can only expand into a pair of non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion step will replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals. But since we're to see if the given string is derived from S, we might have to see if the string can be built from the top-down expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a sequence of NTs that match the productions.\n\nThis might take some time, but perhaps I can work through the string systematically.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t82\n2. t4\n3. t53\n4. t67\n5. t27\n6. t77\n7. t84\n8. t77\n9. t26\n10. t13\n11. t67\n12. t58\n13. t7\n14. t9\n15. t67\n16. t95\n17. t13\n18. t87\n19. t7\n20. t82\n\nPerhaps I should attempt to derive the string from the start symbol S.\n\nSince S -> NT63 NT66, the string should start with the expansion of either NT63 or NT66.

The grammar and string are provided, and I have to figure out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because all the rules on the left-hand side (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand side (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, as per the first rule: S -> NT6 NT58. So the string must start with NT6 and NT58, and decompose further until all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t16. I need to check if t16 is a terminal. Looking through the rules, under NT, I see:\n\n- NT79 -> 't16'\n\nSo t16 is a terminal. Now, looking at the productions, the NT's that produce t are:\n- NT62 -> t97\n- NT79 -> t16\n- NT69 -> t67\n- NT73 -> t8\n- NT84 -> t46\n- NT46 -> t87\n- NT69 -> t13\n- NT27 -> t4\n- NT38 -> t68\n- NT9 -> t26\n- NT46 -> t87\n- NT39 -> t26\n- NT2 -> t6\n- NT8 -> t12\n- NT74 -> t8\n- NT84 -> t40\n- NT44 -> t83\n- NT55 -> t92\n- NT39 -> t26\n- NT85 -> t76\n- NT93 -> t95\n- NT85 -> t58\n- NT67 -> t53\n- NT79 -> t67\n- NT84 -> t55\n- NT74 -> t8\n- NT36 -> t79\n- NT17 -> t96\n- NT65 -> t82\n- NT93 -> t39\n- NT38 -> t74\n- NT2 -> t44\n- NT8 -> t12\n\nI notice that t16 is produced only by NT79. So, in the string, the first token t16 must come from NT79. Therefore, the two symbols before t16 in the generated string should be the symbols that produce NT79. Wait, no, in the generated string, each symbol is a production step. Let me clarify: in the string, each 't' is a single terminal symbol. So, the string represents a series of terminals, each of which must correspond to a single production in the grammar.\n\nWait, no, in the string, the order is the sequence of terminals, so each token in the string must correspond to a terminal in some production. Let me think about it differently: the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so it must have been generated by expanding the non-terminals step by step until all are terminals.\n\nGiven that S is the start symbol, I'll need to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start by checking the first few tokens. The string starts with t16, which comes from NT79. So the first split in the string is t16, which is NT79, and the rest of the string should be built from the remaining symbols, but I think I need to consider the entire string as a single derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree or looking for possible productions that can derive the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I can reverse the process: instead of starting from S and expanding, I can attempt to reduce the string to S by using the grammar's productions in reverse.\n\nThat is, each terminal can be matched against the terminals produced by a production, and non-terminals can be replaced with their definitions.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt16 t6 t55 t12 t68 t83 t92 t49 t22 t67 t25 t44 t8 t64 t58 t72 t9 t25 t39 t76 t98 t74 t39 t49 t49 t96 t16\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost non-terminal will be expanded first. However, since the string is a sequence of terminals, perhaps I can work from the start symbol S and see if the string can be generated by applying the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a top-down approach: start from S and generate the string step by step.\n\nBut perhaps the reverse approach is more manageable: try to reduce the string to S by using reverse productions.\n\nEach production in the grammar can be reversed as follows:\n\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62 (from S->NT6 NT58, but S is the start, so perhaps not directly helpful)\nWait, maybe better to list all production rules as NTX -> a, or NTX -> NTY NTZ.\n\nAlternatively, for each production of the form NTX -> a, the reverse is a -> NTX.\n\nFor productions of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, the reverse is NTY NTZ -> NTX. But that's more complex than simple replacement.\n\nHmm. Let me list all the productions and their possible reverse.\n\nFirst, for terminals, each terminal corresponds to exactly one production rule as NT -> terminal. So, in reverse, each terminal can be reduced to the specific NT that produces it.\n\nFor example:\n\nt16 -> NT79\n\nt6 -> NT84\n\nt55 -> NT55\n\nt12 -> NT8\n\nt68 -> NT17\n\nt83 -> NT44\n\nt92 -> NT55\n\nt49 -> NT27\n\nt22 -> NT38\n\nt67 -> NT67\n\nt25 -> NT39\n\nt44 -> NT8 (since NT17 -> t96, that's another production, but wait: NT44 -> t83, so t83 reduces to NT44.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the productions with their reverse.\n\nTerminals and their corresponding NT:\n\n- t16 \u2192 NT79\n\n- t6 \u2192 NT84\n\n- t55 \u2192 NT55\n\n- t12 \u2192 NT8\n\n- t68 \u2192 NT17\n\n- t83 \u2192 NT44\n\n- t92 \u2192 NT55? Let's check:\n\nLooking back, the production rules for NT55: I'm not sure; let me recheck. The productions after NT55: \n\nI think I might have missed some rules in the original question.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have one. The string given is a series of tokens separated by spaces, so I'll treat each 't' followed by a number as a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I should note that the grammar consists of several non-terminals (NTx) and terminals (t followed by numbers). The start symbol is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. This means that any derivation starting from S will produce two parts: the first part from NT6 and the second from NT58, and those two parts are concatenated.\n\nLooking at the remaining productions, I can see that many of the NTx rules ultimately derive into terminal symbols through various steps. Each NTx seems to produce two other NTy symbols until we reach a point where they produce a terminal. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and then NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT8 \u2192 t12, NT9 \u2192 t3.

For example, NT46 and NT34 both derive to NT58, which in turn goes to NT74 (t77) and NT9 (t3), among others. \n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals might produce the same sequence. For example, NT46 \u2192 t28 or t87, and NT34 can lead to t36, but looking further, I might need to see if these can form the sequence.\n\nI should try to build the string starting from S and see if it can derive to the given string.

Wait, looking back, no rule for NT97. Hmm, did I miss that? Oh, in the given grammar, NT97 isn't present. Let me check the rules provided.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. So NT73 is NT8 NT9, which are both terminals. NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT84.

{"custom_id":"request-522","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll walk through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know. Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) are defined by a set of production rules that expand non-terminal symbols into sequences of terminals and non-terminals. The grammar provided is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where terminals (like t followed by a number) are produced.\n\nThe given string is: `t58 t95 t4 t92 t25 t14 t97 t25 t67 t6 t27 t98 t94 t64 t68 t77 t28 t79 t28 t40 t95 t46 t46 t6 t28 t84 t16 t83`. That's a sequence of terminals, so my task is to see if this string can be derived from the starting symbol S using the given production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has one production rule: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first two symbols of any string generated by this grammar must correspond to the productions of NT6 and NT58. Since the input string starts with `t58`, I'll need to see if that matches the production for NT58.\n\nLet me check the production rules for NT58. Scanning through the provided rules, I find NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So, NT58 must be replaced by NT84 and NT9. Now, I'll break this down further.\n\nNext, I look at NT84. Its productions are: NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93 and NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT55. Wait, no, looking back, I see NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93 and NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT55. So, NT84 can split into two different paths. Let me check if either of these paths leads me closer to the given string.\n\nSince our target is to have `t58`, then the first production for NT58 is NT84 NT9. So, after S \u2192 NT6 NT58, the first part is NT6, which should produce `t58`, and the second part is NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9, which should produce `t95`. Wait, let me confirm the productions for NT58 again. Oh, maybe I misread earlier. Let me check the rules again.\n\nActually, looking back, the rule for NT58 is NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So, after expanding S \u2192 NT6 NT58, we have NT6 \u2192 t58, and NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9, which should produce `t95`. Wait, but in the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So, after S \u2192 NT6 NT58, the first part is `t58`, and the second part is NT58 which must derive to `t95`.\n\nNow, let's process NT58's expansion. So, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. Each of these non-terminals must expand further. Let's see what NT84 and NT9 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT84 has two productions: NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93 and NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT55. Hmm, I'm not sure how to handle that yet. Also, looking at NT9, its productions are NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. So, NT9 becomes NT68 and NT40.\n\nSo, for the initial S \u2192 NT6 NT58, NT6 is `t58`, and NT58 is NT84 NT9. Now, NT9 is NT68 NT40. So that's `t68` and `t40`. So far, the string starts with `t58 t68 t40`. But the input starts with `t58 t95`, so that indicates a problem because NT9 should produce `t95`, but according to the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, which would produce `t68` then `t40`.\n\nWait, that means the initial part of the string doesn't match. The input has `t58 t95`, but according to the grammar, when NT58 expands, it goes through NT9 which is `t68 t40`, not `t95`. That suggests that either I'm misreading the rules or there's a confusion.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT58 again. The rule is NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So when we expand NT58, we get NT84 and NT9. Now, looking at NT9, the rules are NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. So NT9 expands to NT68 and NT40, which are terminals in this case. So NT9 \u2192 NT68 \u2192 t68, then NT40 \u2192 t40. So NT9 produces t68 t40, not t95.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the input starts with `t58 t95`. So according to the grammar, after S \u2192 NT6 NT58, we get `t58` and then NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So the second part is NT84 NT9. But according to the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, which is t68 then t40. So the second part of the string would be t68 t40.\n\nBut the input has t58 t95, so that's inconsistent. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the second symbol after t58 is t95, but the grammar would require it to be t68 or t40.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me make a tree.\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nNT6 \u2192 t58\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nNow, NT9 \u2192 t68 t40. So the second part after t58 is t68 t40, making the string start with t58 t68 t40. But the input has t58 t95, which is impossible because NT9 doesn't produce t95. Therefore, I think the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the NT9 can somehow produce t95 through a different path. Let me check the NT9 rules again.\n\nLooking back, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. Those are the only productions for NT9. No, there's no way that NT9 becomes 't95'. So, in the given grammar, the second symbol in the string after t58 must be the result of expansion from NT58, which is NT84 NT9. Since NT9 produces t68 and t40, the second part of the string must start with t68 t40, but the input has t95, which isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the given string can't be generated by this grammar. So my answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right, and the start symbol is S.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It has a bunch of production rules, starting with S -> NT6 NT58. Since S is the start symbol, this string starts with NT6 and NT58. The main string to evaluate starts with t28, so I'm not sure right away how that connects, but let's proceed.\n\nI notice that the grammar's non-terminals eventually map to terminals, which are the t's followed by numbers. Each production seems to have non-terminals that eventually lead to a terminal. For example, NT6 -> NT73 NT62, and then NT73 -> t8, NT62 -> t84. So, the derivation process would be replacing each non-terminal step by step until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven the string: t28 t70 t92 t7 t44 t14 t95 t63 t36 t79 t64 t95 t82 t72 t12 t9 t28 t49 t16 t16 t77 t28 t4 t55 t7 t7 t25 t95 t46.\n\nI'll need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string should be 2^n for n steps, but that might be easier said than done. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be derived by following the production rules starting from S.\n\nLooking at the string's structure, the first symbol is t28. Let's see what produces t28.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT2 -> t28 and NT28 -> t89 etc. Wait, let me check. Actually, in the given grammar, NT28 has rules like NT28 -> NT38 NT93 and other similar productions. Wait, in the production rules, I see NT28 -> NT38 NT93, and each of those might produce more.\n\nWait, no, looking through the list, I see NT2 is a rule, but the actual NT28. Let me check the productions: scrolling through, I don't immediately see NT28's production. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, I see NT28 -> NT38 NT93, from earlier. So, NT28 can produce NT38 and NT93, which themselves can produce more terminals. For instance, NT38 -> t68, and NT93 -> t95? Or wait, the production rules might have more steps. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT38 -> t68. Because I see NT38 -> t68 directly. So, NT38 would produce t68. So, if NT28 -> NT38 NT93, then that could be t68 and the result of NT93.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, ND93. Let me see: looking for NT93 in the productions, I see NT93 -> t55? Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, the rules are:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT95 -> NT95 NT66 (twice), but that doesn't help. Wait, checking for NT93, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT93. Wait, maybe it's an error, but perhaps I need to look through all the rules.\n\nWait, actually, earlier in the list, I see NT74 -> NT77 NT28, and NT84 -> NT40 NT93, but also, at some point, NT73 -> t8, NT62 -> t84, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to traverse the given string from left to right, looking for possible non-terminals that could have been used to derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing process, using the grammar, starting from the entire string and trying to split it according to the productions.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t28 t70 t92 t7 t44 t14 t95 t63 t36 t79 t64 t95 t82 t72 t12 t9 t28 t49 t16 t16 t77 t28 t4 t55 t7 t7 t25 t95 t46.\n\nThis is a long string, 30 symbols long. Let me see, 30 isn't a power of 2, which in a fully balanced derivation would be the case, but maybe it's been split in a way that's not perfectly balanced. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, but maybe the grammar allows for some steps that create more symbols.\n\nBut perhaps I can try to break it down. The string starts with t28, which comes from NT28. So perhaps the first part is derived from NT28.\n\nNT28 can produce NT38 NT93. Let's see if that can produce t28.\n\nNT38 produces t68, or maybe not? Wait, I see ND38 has a production to t68, so NT38 -> t68. So if NT28 -> NT38 NT93, then the first two symbols would be t68 and whatever NT93 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with t28, so that doesn't match. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, I see NT28 -> NT38 NT93. So the two symbols generated would be whatever NT38 produces and then whatever NT93 produces. But the first symbol is t28, so how does that fit?\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the production that starts with NT2. Wait, no, the string starts with t28, so perhaps it's coming from NT28.\n\nWait, but there might be a way that NT28 derives t28 through multiple steps. Alternatively, maybe the derivation starts from S, but perhaps we can ignore that for a moment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string step by step, from left to right, finding possible substrings that match the non-terminals.\n\nLet me list out the string again: positions 1-30.\n\n1: t28\n2: t70\n3: t92\n4: t7\n5: t44\n6: t14\n7: t95\n8: t63\n9: t36\n10: t79\n11: t64\n12: t95\n13: t82\n14: t72\n15: t12\n16: t9\n17: t28\n18: t49\n19: t16\n20: t16\n21: t77\n22: t28\n23: t4\n24: t55\n25: t7\n26: t7\n27: t25\n28: t95\n29: t46\n\nWait, maybe the string doesn't end with the expected symbols. For example, the last symbols I don't immediately know where they lead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire string and try to parse it using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nBut parsing a string with 30 symbols would be tedious without writing a program. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for specific patterns. For example, the initial part is t28 t70 t92 t7..., which might correspond to NT28 producing those symbols.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT28 -> NT38 NT93, and if NT38 is t68 and NT93 is ? Let's see.\n\nLooking for NT93 in the production rules: I don't see NT93 having a production. Wait, checking the list: Let me go through the productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nWait, I see NT93 -> t55 once. Wait, let me check. Oh, I think earlier I might have misread the productions. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see NT93 directly, but maybe I can find it indirectly. Alternatively, perhaps it's an error and NT93 isn't actually a non-terminal in this case. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the derivation starts with S, which branches into NT6 and NT58. Let's see what comes after.\n\nThe string starts with t28, but S's first production is NT6 and NT58.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a standard form that makes it easier to analyze. Each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and, except for the start symbol, exactly two terminals on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t92 t3 t84 t55 t4 t63 t27 t27 t92 t28 t58 t14 t14 t22 t79 t7 t96 t9 t14 t7 t46 t67 t67 t8 t14 t68 t55 t95 t16`.\n\nFirst, I should look for the start symbol in the string. The start symbol is S, so the string should start with S. But the string starts with `t92`, which is a terminal. So I need to see what the production rules for S can do.\n\nLooking at the grammar's productions, S is `NT6 NT58`. So S directly produces the concatenation of NT6 and NT58. That means the first part of the string should correspond to NT6 and the second part to NT58. Wait, but NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals, so I need to break down the string into parts that match their respective productions.\n\nWait, but the given string consists of a bunch of `tXXX` terms, which are terminals. Each `t` term corresponds to a production rule. For example, if NT94 has a production `t14`, then whenever NT94 appears, it can be replaced by `t14`.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string is long, so I'll break it into tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t92\n2. t3\n3. t84\n4. t55\n5. t4\n6. t63\n7. t27\n8. t27\n9. t92\n10. t28\n11. t58\n12. t14\n13. t14\n14. t22\n15. t79\n16. t7\n17. t96\n18. t9\n19. t14\n20. t7\n21. t46\n22. t67\n23. t67\n24. t8\n25. t14\n26. t68\n27. t55\n28. t95\n29. t16\n\nNow, let's see if this string can be derived from the given grammar. Starting with S, which produces NT6 NT58. So the first step is NT6 and NT58. Let's handle each part separately.\n\nStarting with NT6. Looking at the rules, NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62.\n\nNow, NT73: looking at the grammar, NT73 can produce two things: one with NT8 NT9 and another is NT8 NT9 again, but wait, looking back, I see NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. So NT73 is replaced by NT8 NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT62: let's check the production for NT62. Looking through the rules, NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT93.\n\nSo now, NT6 becomes NT73 NT62 \u2192 NT8 NT9 NT84 NT93.\n\nThen, let's look at NT58: according to the rules, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9.\n\nSo now, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 becomes NT8 NT9 NT84 NT93 NT84 NT9.\n\nWait, let me be precise: S \u2192 NT6 NT58 \u2192 (NT73 NT62) (NT84 NT9) \u2192 (NT8 NT9 NT84 NT93) (NT84 NT9) \u2192 NT8 NT9 NT84 NT93 NT84 NT9.\n\nSo the entire string would then need to be built from this sequence. Wait, but the string starts with t92, so let's see what each of these parts correspond to in the grammar.\n\nWait, no. I'm confusing myself. Let me backtrack.\n\nEach NT symbol eventually produces some sequence of terminals. So starting from S, the string will be the concatenation of the strings from NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo the string should be equal to the concatenation of:\n\n1. The string generated by NT6\n2. The string generated by NT58\n\nSo let me first find what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8 is S's production? Wait, NT8 is not a symbol; looking through the grammar, I don't see NT8 being defined. Wait, let me check all the non-terminals to see if I missed any.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT6 is defined as NT73 NT62.\n\nLooking for NT73: in the rules, it's NT8 NT9.\n\nWait, looking back: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nWait, is NT8 a terminal? Let me see the list of non-terminals. Let's collect all non-terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the non-terminals are all starting with NT followed by two digits, except some are three digits? Wait no, looking at the grammar, all left-hand sides are two digits, e.g., S->NT6 NT58, NT6->NT73 NT62, etc. So NT6, NT58, etc. are all two-digit non-terminals. So each production is of the form NTxx -> NTyy NTzz.\n\nSo for example, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNow, if NT8 is a non-terminal, it must have some production. Let me check if I listed all the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nI have NT6, NT74, NT63, NT95, NT19, NT65, NT14, NT50, NT78, NT56, NT95, NT9, NT40, NT34, NT6, NT36, NT74, NT84, NT78, NT58, NT28, NT2, NT85, NT68, NT39, NT85, NT73, NT78, NT52, NT37, NT95, NT78, NT52, NT87, NT2, NT8, NT74, NT84, NT69, NT79, NT63, NT15, NT69, NT46, NT67, NT67, NT8, NT14, NT68, NT55, NT95, NT16, NT2, NT36, NT56, NT95, NT27, NT7, NT94, NT46, NT67, NT67, NT8, NT14, NT68, NT55, NT95, NT16.\n\nWait, but some have three digits in their replacement, like NT69 \u2192 t67, so they must produce a terminal string.\n\nWait, for example, NT69 has a production NT69 \u2192 t67.\n\nSo, in NT6's production, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which becomes NT8 NT9 NT84 NT93 after expanding NT73.\n\nBut then, each NT8, NT9, etc., must have their own expansions.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the NT6 and NT58 expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down into the required sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the rules to see if the string can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nBut starting from the string, let's see if it can be broken down step by step.\n\nThe string is: t92 t3 t84 t55 t4 t63 t27 t27 t92 t28 t58 t14 t14 t22 t79 t7 t96 t9 t14 t7 t46 t67 t67 t8 t14 t68 t55 t95 t16\n\nThe length is 29 tokens. Maybe try to see if the first part matches NT6's production.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, the string must start with NT6's production and end with NT58's production.\n\nSo let's look at the first part: can the initial tokens form the string from NT6's production?\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals must produce some string. So let's see what the first few tokens are.\n\nThe first token is t92.

{"custom_id":"request-565","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. \n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, I think it's two symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. But wait, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a single non-terminal producing a single terminal. Wait, no, let me double-check: CNF requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each RHS has exactly two non-terminals or two terminals (the latter case being a, which is a single terminal).\n\nBut looking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions have two non-terminals on the RHS. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which is two non-terminals. So every production is of the form A \u2192 BC. But in the string, I have a sequence of terminals, each as 't' followed by a number. So each \"tX\" is a terminal, right?\n\nThe string is: t83 t28 t70 t46 t25 t74 t3 t16 t95 t40 t12 t22 t70 t96 t94 t9 t6 t58 t6 t58 t67 t53 t4 t44 t3 t28 t96 t95 t4 t76.\n\nWait, each part is separated by a single space, each being \"t\" followed by a number, so the string is a sequence of 32 terminals. But how does this sequence relate to the grammar?\n\nIn CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the RHS. Wait, no, no\u2014wait, in CNF, each production can have either one or two non-terminals on the RHS? Or is it only two non-terminals or a terminal?\n\nWait, no, the standard Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is when each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each production has two symbols on the RHS\u2014either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal? Wait, no, A production can have either two non-terminals (A\u2192BC) or a single terminal (A\u2192a). But then in that case, the derivation can produce sequences where the length increases exponentially. So, each step the number of non-terminals doubles.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the string is entirely terminals, so the entire derivation must replace all non-terminals until only terminals remain. Let's think about the string's structure.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S is replaced by two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. Each of those can be non-terminals that then split into other non-terminals or terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, each as \"t\" plus a number.\n\nBut how do we get a string that's 32 terminals? Let's consider how many productions we might need. Since each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, the number of symbols on the stack increases by one each time. So starting from S, which is one non-terminal, the first step has two, which if both are non-terminals, becomes four, then eight, etc. So the number of symbols at each step is 2^k, where k is the number of steps. To reach a string of 32 terminals, since 2^5 = 32, it would take 5 steps. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case because some non-terminals might produce a terminal immediately, so the steps might vary.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of symbols is not necessarily a power of two. Let's think: if each non-terminal on the stack can be replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal, the total number of symbols after each replacement depends on the choices. For example, if we have S \u2192 NT6 NT58 (two non-terminals), then each of those could be replaced by two non-terminals, leading to four, or if one or both produce a terminal, the count could be lower.\n\nBut in this specific problem, the entire string is made up of terminals, so the derivation must replace all non-terminals until only terminals remain. So each non-terminal in the derivation must eventually be replaced by a terminal. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production of a non-terminal is two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait a second, but in the grammar provided, most of the productions are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, meaning each non-terminal produces two non-terminals. So for example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, etc. So every non-terminal in this grammar produces two non-terminals on the RHS, except for those productions where A \u2192 a is present. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or I might have missed some that produce terminals. Wait, checking through the list, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal. All have two non-terminals on the RHS. So this grammar is actually in CNF, and also, in this case, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, so every non-terminal must be split into two non-terminals.\n\nIf that's the case, then each step increases the number of non-terminals by the number of productions that produce two non-terminals. But without any terminals being produced, the number of symbols can't decrease to terminals. Wait, but that's impossible because the string consists solely of terminals. So, since every production here only produces non-terminals (no single-terminal productions), it's actually impossible to derive a string of terminals only, because every replacement keeps the number of non-terminals as two. Wait, let's see:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58 (2 non-terminals). Each of these will produce two more non-terminals, so the next step would have 4 non-terminals. Then 8, then 16, etc. But since no non-terminals produce terminals, the entire string can't be made of terminals. So the string, which is all terminals, must not be derivable from S, which only produces non-terminals. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe grammar provided is in Chomsky Normal Form, where every production rule replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. Since there are no production rules that generate terminal symbols directly (no A \u2192 a), the derived strings can only consist of non-terminals. The given string is entirely composed of terminals, which is impossible under this grammar.

Let me start by understanding the structure and the production rules of the grammar.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a start symbol 'S' and several non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) and terminals (t followed by numbers and 't'). The production rules all seem to be in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which act as leaves in the derivation tree. That's typical for CNF.\n\nThe given string is: `t96 t87 t63 t74 t12 t83 t26 t49 t92 t96 t67 t46 t94 t74 t98 t98 t28 t94 t22 t25 t98 t16 t94 t4 t16 t68 t97 t8 t14 t40 t16`.\n\nWow, that's quite long with 31 elements (each separated by a space).

NT36 \u2192 NT64 NT56 (Wait, in the user's list, it's 'NT36 -> 't64' ' but I think it's typo in my mind. Wait, the user provided NT36 as 't64' but I should check again. Wait, looking back: The user's original list says NT36-> 't79' and NT66-> 't96', etc. Wait, actually, the user provided the replacements as:\n\nLooking again, I think it's possible that each production may end with a terminal or a non-terminal string.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. Or, if the right-hand side can include terminals, but in CNF, it's two non-terminals. However, in this case, it seems that some of the productions are actually terminal strings, which might be a mistake. For example, 'NT2 -> 't9' ' suggests that NT2 is a terminal, which contradicts because NT2 is a non-terminal. So I think that's a mistake, and the user intended that NT2 \u2192 some NT's. Similarly, other NTs may have terminal strings, but they should not. Alternatively, perhaps some productions are written as a single terminal, which would mean that in the context-free grammar, it's allowed to have a single terminal in the production. But in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. So that suggests that perhaps in the provided grammar, some productions have terminals as RHS, but that's incorrect for CNF. So maybe the user made a typo, or perhaps those are the actual productions.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The user provided the grammar as:\n\nFor example:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nNT74 -> NT9 NT66\n\n...\n\nNT2 -> 't9'\n\nSo this seems to suggest that NT2 is a terminal. But in CNF, a grammar can have terminals on the right-hand side, but only in productions where the RHS is a single terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, the productions must have either one terminal or two non-terminals, but that's not standard. Actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So that could be possible if some terminals are allowed in the productions as single terminals. So in that case, some non-terminals can have productions that produce a single terminal.\n\nGiven that, the user's grammar includes a mix of productions with two non-terminals and some with a single terminal. So that's permissible for CNF, I think.\n\nTherefore, the grammar has a mix of two non-terminals and a single terminal as the RHS, but in this case, looking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t9 is a single terminal, which would allow the derivation of a terminal in that position. So having such productions is acceptable in CNF.\n\nSo, to proceed, I need to parse the given string using this grammar.\n\nThe first step is to note that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols (t followed by numbers). So, the parsing should consist of replacing non-terminals in the start symbol's production until only terminals are left.\n\nGiven that, let's start by considering the structure:\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, S is split into NT6 and NT58. Each of these is a non-terminal that needs to be expanded into the string.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is: t96, t87, t63, t74, t12, t83, t26, t49, t92, t96, t67, t46, t94, t74, t98, t98, t28, t94, t22, t25, t98, t16, t94, t4, t16, t68, t97, t8, t14, t40, t16.\n\nThat's 30 terminal symbols. Each non-terminal expansion must end in a sequence that produces exactly these terminals.\n\nLet's see how to approach this. Since the grammar is highly recursive, perhaps we can work backward from the string, looking for possible substrings that match the terminals and non-terminals' productions.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a top-down"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to check each step of the derivation process to see if it can generate this string.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure, so that's good.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that it's heavily overloaded with non-terminals, and many of them have productions that eventually resolve to terminals (denoted by 't' followed by a number). Some non-terminals don't seem to directly produce terminals, so they likely lead deeper into the structure.\n\nThe string to check is: `t64 t68 t94 t16 t87 t4 t12 t53 t84 t4 t58 t70 t53 t63 t16 t77 t46 t84 t72 t36 t46 t76 t25 t7 t13 t82 t4 t63 t95 t40 t7`.\n\nI need to break this down into individual tokens and see if they can be derived from the start symbol S, following the production rules.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which per the grammar is `S -> NT6 NT58`. So the first two symbols in the string would need to be generated from NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6's production: `NT6 -> NT73 NT62`. Then NT73 and NT62.\n\nNT73 has a production `NT73 -> NT8 NT9`, and NT62 -> NT84 NT97. Wait, looking again, NT62 is actually `NT62 -> NT84 NT97`? Or is it another option? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see `NT62 -> NT97 NT84`. Yeah, that's correct. So NT62 becomes NT97 and NT84. NT97 isn't directly a terminal; it has `NT97 -> NT63 NT67`, which then would split into more non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this by parsing the string from the beginning, looking for possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string starts with t64, which comes from NT36 -> t64. But wait, in the grammar, NT36's production is `NT36 -> NT79 NT2`. And NT79 has `NT79 -> NT67 NT7`. So maybe that's a path.\n\nWait, let me think: starting from S, let's see.\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNow, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8 has a production `NT8 -> NT74 NT7` or another production? Looking at the grammar, yes: NT8 -> t3 and t7, or another option `NT8 -> NT74 NT7`. Wait, in the grammar, NT8 is not directly a terminal but has production `NT8 -> t3` and another `NT8 -> t7`. So perhaps NT8 can be t3 or t7.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, each line is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or sometimes a terminal. For example, `NT19 -> NT37 NT69` and `NT94 -> 't77'`.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread. Looking back, some NT rules produce a terminal and a non-terminal. For example:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't16'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n- NT15 -> 't94'\n- NT69 -> 't67'\n- NT46 -> 't28'\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT36 -> 't64'\n- NT56 -> 't72'\n- NT69 -> 't13'\n- NT87 -> 't98'\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n- NT38 -> 't68'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT39 -> 't58'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT34 -> 't36'\n- NT58 -> 't46'\n- NT44 -> 't83'\n- NT55 -> 't92'\n- NT39 -> 't63'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> 't84'\n- NT80 -> 't22'\n- NT38 -> 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT8 -> 't12'\n- NT74 -> 't77'\n- NT84 -> 't40'\n- NT39 -> 't26'\n- NT27 -> 't7'\n- NT62 -> 't97'\n- NT85 -> 't76'\n- NT93 -> 't95'\n- NT85 -> 't58'\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n- NT79 -> 't67'\n- NT84 -> 't55'\n- NT74 -> 't8'\n- NT56 -> 't82'\n- NT93 -> 't39'\n- NT38 -> 't74'.\n\nWow, that's a lot. So many non-terminals have terminal productions. So, for example, NT94 directly produces 't77', and similarly for others.\n\nSo, the string is a series of terminals. To generate it, the non-terminals must expand to these terminals through the productions.\n\nNow, the string starts with t64, t68, etc. Let's see where these come from.\n\nLooking for 't64', that comes from NT36 -> t64. But looking at NT36's production: `NT36 -> NT79 NT2`. Wait, wait, no, looking again, the grammar lines are:\n\nFor example, under NTx, there are rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking for any NTx that produce 't64'. Looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> t64 (from line: NT36 -> 't64')? Wait no, wait, in the grammar, I can see:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nLooking for NTxxx -> 't64'. I see:\n\nYes, there is: NT36 -> 't64'. So that's one place where a terminal is produced.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't68', which is in the string after t64 and t68. That's near the beginning.\n\nLooking for 't68' as a terminal: checking the grammar.\n\nYes, there's NT38 -> 't68' and NT34 -> 't36' (no, 't36' not relevant). Wait, 't68' is produced by NT38.\n\nSo, the second token is t68, which must come from NT38. Checking the grammar for NT38: It has production NT38 -> 't68' and also NT38 -> NT46 NT84.\n\nSo, the options are either directly 't68' or as a combination of other non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the tokens are in order, so we need to see which path can generate this.\n\nMoving on to the third token: t94. That's produced by NT94 -> 't77'? Wait no, looking for 't94' as a terminal.\n\nWait, 't94' is produced by NT95 -> 't94'?\n\nWait, looking through the terminal productions:\n\nYes, NT95 -> t94.\n\nWait, no, looking at the list, some have 't...'. Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't94' as a terminal:\n\nYes, in the grammar, there's NT95 -> 't94'.\n\nSo, t94 comes from NT95.\n\nContinuing, the fourth token is t16, which comes from NT79 -> 't16', as per the grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check. In the grammar, NT79's production is `NT79 -> NT67 NT73`? Or is it another option?\n\nWait, in the grammar lines, some NTx have multiple productions, and sometimes a terminal. For example, looking for 't16':\n\nYes, there's NT79 -> 't16'.\n\nWait, does NT79 have direct production 't16', or not?

{"custom_id":"request-610","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string clearly.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can have terminals. Looking at the start symbols here, I see S is the only one on the left, and it has two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. So, S -> NT6 NT58. Each of these NT symbols (like NT6, NT58, etc.) are non-terminals, and they seem to eventually lead to terminal strings composed of 't's followed by numbers, except for two exceptions: NT94 becomes 't77', and other NTs have their own terminal rules, some ending with a single letter.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: `t44 t8 t67 t97 t46 t77 t3 t3 t14 t92 t28 t84 t3 t28 t83 t16 t46 t9 t72 t40 t98 t16 t39 t82 t82 t94 t63 t64 t16 t27 t26 t9`.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if each 't' part corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal will expand into two other non-terminals, recursively, until we get to the terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of terminals, the production must derive exactly this string starting from S. So, the plan is to reverse the derivation process, starting from the string and trying to split it into the right order of expansions.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step:\n\n1. The start is S, which must produce NT6 NT58. So the string should be the concatenation of these two non-terminals' expansions.\n\n2. Let's look at the string length. The string has 36 't' parts, which is 36 symbols. Each non-terminal in the grammar either produces two non-terminals (thus requiring more splits), or it's a terminal. Since in CNF, all productions are of the form A->BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, during parsing, each non-terminal can be replaced by two others, which will themselves be replaced by their expansions.\n\n3. Wait a minute, but the string length is 36, which is equal to 2 times 18. Maybe the derivation starts by expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, it might help to represent the string as a series of non-terminals and see if they can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward approach is to check if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list some key points:\n\n- Each non-terminal can be replaced by two other non-terminals.\n- Each non-terminal has a specific definition, which can be a mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nEach of these NTs will have their own rules. Let's outline a few:\n\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- NT62 -> NT84 NT97\n- NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n- NT93 -> NT95 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62 (Wait, no, I think that's a different one. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a tree of possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can check if each part of the string can be derived in some order.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if the entire string reduces to S by splitting it into the right parts.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production replaces a non-terminal with two parts. So, to build the string, the initial expansion is S, which becomes NT6 and NT58. So, the string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, let's split the entire string into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT6, and the second part is the expansion of NT58.\n\nLooking at the given string:\n\nString: t44 t8 t67 t97 t46 t77 t3 t3 t14 t92 t28 t84 t3 t28 t83 t16 t46 t9 t72 t40 t98 t16 t39 t82 t82 t94 t63 t64 t16 t27 t26 t9\n\nI need to divide this into two parts: Part1 (for NT6) and Part2 (for NT58).\n\nWhat's the first step? The start symbol S is NT6 followed by NT58. So the first symbol of the string should be the first part of NT6's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT6: NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nSo NT6 expands into two non-terminals: NT73 and NT62.\n\nNow, looking at the initial symbols of the string: t44. Let's see if t44 is the beginning of NT73 or NT62.\n\nLooking at NT73's rules: NT73 can expand into several things, like NT8 NT9, or NT56 NT84, etc. Or wait, I might be mixing them up.\n\nWait, from the grammar, I need to check where 't44' comes from. Since 't44' is a terminal, so I need to find which non-terminal expands into a string that starts with 't44'. Looking through the grammar, for example:\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17-> 't96'\n\nWait, no. Let me look for 't44' as a terminal in the grammar. Scanning through the provided productions:\n\nYes, I see NT42 has a rule, but wait, the provided list is long, but looking through the given productions:\n\nLooking for 't44' as a terminal: Oh, wait, maybe one of the NTs expand into 't44' plus something else. Let's check the production:\n\nLooking again: I see:\n\nNT84 -> NT34 NT93\n\nNT39 -> NT78 NT46\n\nNT39 also is present in other rules. Wait, is NT34 followed by NT58?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better if I note down which non-terminals expand into which terminal strings.\n\nAlternatively, let me see: the given grammar shows several NTs leading to a terminal. For example, NT19 -> NT37 NT69, but I don't see that leading to a terminal directly. Wait, no, NT2 -> 't9' is a rule, for example. So, NT2 can be 't9', but I don't see NT44 as a terminal, but perhaps NT44 expands to a terminal. Wait, NT84 -> NT34 NT93, and NT34 -> NT58 NT65, etc. So maybe it's a long derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which non-terminals produce 't44'.\n\nLooking back at the provided grammar, in the list of non-terminals and their terminal expansions, I see:\n\nHere are the rules that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT7-> t7 (I think)\nWait, no, I need to check the given productions. Let me scan through the provided list:\n\nLooking at the end of each line, e.g.,\n\nNT68 -> NT63 NT67\n\nBut I'm being instructed to look for any non-terminal that when expanded can lead to a terminal as part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note down the NTs that expand into a single terminal.\n\nLooking through all lines, in the end:\n\nLooking for any NT -> (terminal):\n\nHmm, for example, looking at:\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66\n\nWait, no. Wait, the provided list seems to have only a few rules where a non-terminal expands into a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the end:\n\nLooking at the end of each row, for example:\n\nAt the end of the provided list, each line ends like NT85->t76 or something. Wait, no, the provided list doesn't end with anything. So perhaps the rules provided are such that not all NTs have direct terminal expansions. Therefore, the given string must be built up by concatenating several such generated strings.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a better way is to write down all the rules that contain a terminal.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I notice that several NTs expand into terminals:\n\nWait, scanning through the given production rules:\n\n- NT28-> NT38 NT93\n\nBut at the end of the list, I see:\n\nLooking for anything that ends with t:\n\nLooking through the provided list:\n\nI see that NT73-> 't25' ?\n\nWait, looking for any rule with a terminal:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nWait, line by line, looking for any rule that leads directly to a terminal.\n\nAh!

Let's start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, so I'll need to see if S can derive the given string.\n\nLooking at the string: `t97 t98 t12 t84 t74 t74 t40 t67 t40 t55 t7 t84 t72 t55 t77 t28 t3 t72 t7 t94 t70 t14 t49 t3 t13 t97 t72 t83 t6 t26 t72`.\n\nThis is a sequence of terminals. So, I need to trace back how this string can be derived from S.\n\nThe grammar has several productions that can directly produce terminals. For example, `NT2 -> 't9'`, `NT6 -> 't73'`, etc. But many of the non-terminals produce other non-terminals. Since it's in CNF, the derivation would have a structure where each step production splits one non-terminal into two non-terminals until we get all terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the string and see if it can be split into terms that match the grammar's productions, working backwards.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string: 19. Since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, the length of the derived string is 2^n where n is the number of splits. But here, we have 19 tokens, which is not a power of two, so perhaps the parser used a mixture of productions or maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the string:\n\nt97, t98, t12, t84, t74, t74, t40, t67, t40, t55, t7, t84, t72, t55, t77, t28, t3, t72, t7, t94, t70, t14, t49, t3, t13, t97, t72, t83, t6, t26, t72.\n\nWait, actually, the string has 33 tokens. Hmm, that complicates things because the number of steps might not be a straightforward power of two. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol S starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the string must start with NT6 and NT58. Let me check the string:\n\nThe first token is t97. Let me see if any non-terminal produces 't97'. Looking at the productions, I notice that NT73 \u2192 't77' and NT84 \u2192 't46', etc., but I don't see a production for NT73 or NT84 that results in 't97'. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, the string's first token is t97. In the grammar, I see that NT97 is one of the non-terminals, and according to the productions, NT97 \u2192 NTsomething? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT97 \u2192 anything. Wait, actually, no. All the productions are of NT productions into other NTs or terminals. So, some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT2 -> 't9', which is one of the options. So, perhaps t9 is a terminal that can be produced by NT2.\n\nBut in the string, I have t97 as the first token. I don't see any production for NT97 that produces a terminal. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT97 isn't directly a terminal. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar list, perhaps there's a NT production that leads to 't97'. For example, perhaps NT85 \u2192 NT77 NT56, but none of those help with 't97'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the non-terminals that produce terminals are listed as:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't73'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT73 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT69 \u2192 't67'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't70'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT69 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT87 \u2192 't98'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't44'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't63'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT62 \u2192 't84'\n\nNT80 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't44'\n\nWait, so looking for 't97' as a terminal. I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes 't97'. Similarly, 't98' is directly produced by NT84 \u2192 't98'\u2014yes, that's one. So the second token in the string is t98. That would require NT84 \u2192 't98'.\n\nSo the string starts with NT84 generating t98, so the first two symbols would be part of NT84.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is t97. So if NT84 can produce t98 as the first symbol, then maybe T84 starts with t98, but our first symbol is t97. Hmm. That suggests that perhaps the string is not generated because t97 is not a terminal that any non-terminal can directly produce.\n\nWait, but I might be getting confused. Let me check again. Are there any NT productions that produce 't97' or 't98'?\n\nWait, for instance, looking for NT97 \u2192... I don't see any. So the only way a string can start with t97 is if the initial grammar can produce that.\n\nWait, but looking at the initial production S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S has to generate two NTs, perhaps.\n\nSo let's look at the beginning of the string: t97 t98... Does this correspond to NT6 producing t97 and NT58 producing t98?\n\nBut I don't see any NT6 or NT58 directly producing t97 or t98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check NT6: in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So NT6 can only produce two other NTs. To produce a terminal, you have to go through other productions.\n\nBut the key is that in the string, the first symbol is t97, so some non-terminal must produce t97, either directly or through a series of productions. But looking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal producing 't97' directly.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the productions more carefully. Perhaps I missed something.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', 't44'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't73', 't96'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't64', 't6'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't72', 't28'\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't67', 't13'\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n\n- NT79 \u2192 't16', 't27'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't40', 't98'\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't68', 't49'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT39 \u2192 't58', 't63'\n\n- NT80 \u2192 't22'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't28', 't87'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't69', 't56'\n\n- NT85 \u2192 't95', 't76'\n\nWait, so the only way to get a terminal that's not a substring of more than one symbol is if a non-terminal produces it. So 't97' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal. So how can the string start with 't97'?

{"custom_id":"request-630","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t53 t98 t44 t84 t68 t46 t22 t9 t97 t26 t96 t72 t12 t82 t8 t9 t98 t87 t16 t55 t63 t44 t39 t82 t58 t96 t67 t44 t6 t7 t82 t14 t7`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars in CNF have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Since the string only contains terminals (the t's followed by numbers), I need to track the possible production rules that lead to each of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can see that many of the non-terminals expand into pairs of terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT87 can expand into NT44 (which is 't84' wait, no, NT44's production is 't83' which is different. Hmm, let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, each NT abbreviation corresponds to specific terminals. Let me list the NTs and their expansions to see which ones produce the t's in the string.\n\nFor example, NT78 expands to NT67 NT73, and NT67 is 't53', and NT73 is 't25'. So NT78 can produce 't53 t25'. Similarly, NT97 exists but it has an expansion, but in the provided grammar, I don't see NT97. Wait, let me scan the rules.\n\nWait, the NT97 isn't directly in the production list, but from the provided rules, I see that NT77 exists as ending with t38. Hmm, maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the string's structure and see if it can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nBut this might be complex. Another approach is to consider that each expansion in CNF produces a terminal in a single step, so each production of a non-terminal contributes to a part of the string.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which are the tokens like t53, t98, etc. So each of these must come from the expansion of non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nSince it's a single string, the entire string must be generated by a leftmost derivation. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, except for the leaves, which are terminals. So the entire string would result from a series of such replacements, ending with all terminals.\n\nI think I can represent the string as a series of terminals, and each non-terminal in the string corresponds to a group that can be expanded further.\n\nSo, starting from the initial symbol S, which expands to NT6 NT58. So the string must begin with the expansion of NT6 and NT58, each of which can then split into their own non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the entire string starts with t53, which I think corresponds to NT78 because NT78 \u2192 t53 t25, but let me check.\n\nWait, looking back, NT78's production is either NT67 NT73 or NT52 NT80. NT67 is t53, NT73 is t25, so NT78 can produce t53 t25.\n\nSimilarly, NT52 can produce t19 t28, or wait, NT52's production is NT19 NT28, which are t94 t69. Hmm, but in the string, after t53 comes t98, which isn't directly a terminal from immediate rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to take the string and parse it from right to left, trying to find non-terminals that can expand into the string segments.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can represent the possible expansion for each terminal or substring.\n\nBut this seems too time-consuming. Maybe I can write out some of the possible expansions to see if the string can fit.\n\nWait, the initial symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo the string must start with NT6 expanding into t{something}, and NT58 expanding into t{something else}.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, NT6's production is NT73 NT62, which would produce two non-terminals, so that can't lead directly to a terminal. So S would expand to NT73 NT62 NT58, and that would have a longer string. But in the given string, after the initial t53, the next is t98, which is longer than t53.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nSo looking at the string, the first symbol is t53. So to produce t53, it must be generated by a rule where the non-terminal expands into t53 and something else. Alternatively, maybe a non-terminal ends with t53.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NT's produce t53? Let me check each production to see which NTs have t53 as part of their expansion.\n\nLooking through, I see NT78: NT78 \u2192 NT67 NT73. NT67 is t53, and NT73 is t25. So NT78 can produce 't53 t25'.\n\nSo if in the string, a t53 is followed by t25, that would correspond to NT78 expanding into these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t53 t98 t44 ... Let's see.\n\nAfter t53, the next is t98, which isn't t25. So maybe the first part isn't from NT78. Alternatively, perhaps the initial symbols have to do with NT78 somewhere in the middle.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT6 NT58. NT6 is NT73 NT62, and NT58 is NT84 NT9. Let's see what their possible expansions are.\n\nNT73's production is NT8 NT9, so NT73 can generate t78 (from NT8 \u2192 t8) and t9? Wait, looking at NT8's production: NT8 \u2192 NT12, which is t12, and another NT9 which is t9.\n\nWait, so NT8 \u2192 NT12 t9, since in the grammar, NT12's production is NT82 t12, but wait, actually, each production for a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a terminal plus a non-terminal. So for example, NT8 is NT12, which is a terminal and another non-terminal. Wait, no, actually from the provided grammar, for example, NT8's production is NT12, but I need to correct that.\n\nWait, the grammar is given in some form where each rule is left-hand side followed by right-hand side, which is either two or three symbols. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 aB or A \u2192 Ba, where a is a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the given rules, for example:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nSo that's a production of NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which is two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 is NT32, which might be terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps some of the rules include terminals.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT6: it's NT73 NT62, both non-terminals.\n\nNT73: NT32? Wait, no, NT32 isn't in the list provided. Wait, I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar provided is in a format where some non-terminals have direct terminal outputs, but looking at the provided list, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or something else. Wait, no, all the productions seem to be two non-terminals. So for instance, NT44 \u2192 NT83.\n\nWait, perhaps each production is an expansion into two non-terminals. So each non-terminal can be thought of as requiring two steps to produce terminals.\n\nBut then, how do we get a single terminal in the string? That seems impossible if all productions are of non-terminals into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure. Perhaps some rules lead directly to terminals, but from the provided list, I only see rules where each RHS is two non-terminals. For example:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9\n\nSo S expands into NT6 and NT58, each of which split into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, if this is the case, then the entire string would be a series of t's resulting from the non-terminals that eventually expand into them.\n\nBut I'm confused because the string contains t's, but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, right? Or wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to have two non-terminals on the right side, so maybe it's strictly in CNF without terminals on the right. Hmm, that might complicate things because the CFG is ambiguous, but I need to process it.\n\nThe string I have to check is: `t3 t63 t68 t79 t12 t74 t63 t94 t97 t22 t84 t70 t58 t97 t84 t58 t82 t98 t82 t70 t44 t94 t67 t79 t96 t95 t64 t68 t7 t16 t95 t4 t36`. That's a lot of tokens separated by spaces. So, first, I need to parse this string and see if each token corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, right? So in the grammar, each production starts with a non-terminal (like S, NT6, etc.) and breaks down into smaller non-terminals until we reach terminals.

But with 34 tokens, that's going to be a bit complex. Maybe I should try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t3 t63 t68 t79 t12. Hmm, t3 could come from a production, but looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule that directly produces t3.

And NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT93, and NT38 \u2192 NT68 NT49, but that's getting into deeper levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t3 is produced by NT9 because NT9 has a path that eventually reaches t3. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to list all the terminals and their possible sources.\n\nLooking through all the grammar production rules, the terminals start with t and have three digits. So, t3, t63, t68, etc. I need to see which non-terminals can produce these.\n\nFor example, t7 comes from NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 \u2192 and so on. Wait, but in the given string, I have t7, t79, etc. Let me check which non-terminals produce t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nBut does any non-terminal produce t7? Yes, in the grammar, NT73 is broken down further until we get to terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the last part includes t7. Let me check if t7 is ever a terminal. In the given rules, I don't see t7 directly. Hmm, maybe there's a rule that leads to t7.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at other rules, like NT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2. Wait, NT39 \u2192 NT78 NT46, and so on. Maybe t79 is produced by NT79, but I don't see t79 in the terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt3, t63, t68, t79, t12, t74, t63, t94, t97, t22, t84, t70, t58, t97, t84, t58, t82, t98, t82, t70, t44, t94, t67, t79, t96, t95, t64, t68, t7, t16, t95, t4, t36.\n\nThat's 34 tokens. Let me see if each terminal can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nStarting with the first token, t3.\n\nIs there a non-terminal that can produce t3?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT9 eventually leads to t3. Let me check.\n\nLooking up NT9:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n\u2192 NT63 NT67 (via NT68 and NT40)\n\u2192 NT94 NT22 (via NT63 and NT67)\nNT94 \u2192 NT14\nNT14 \u2192 NT59 NT15\nNT59 \u2192 NT56 NT95\nNT56 \u2192 NT9 NT19\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\nSo, recursively, it's producing these, but does this lead to t3? Let's see.\n\nWait, in the productions, some non-terminals have terminals. Let me see, for example:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66\nNT27 \u2192 NT4 NT14\nNT4 \u2192 NT69 NT17\nNT17 \u2192 NT96\nNT96 \u2192 NT13 (Wait, no, the rule for NT69 is NT69 \u2192 NT13 NT67. Wait, no, looking back, the rules have lines like NT69 \u2192 NT13 NT67, which would mean NT69 produces t13 and t67 as terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, I have t13? Let me check the string: I don't see t13. Hmm, maybe the grammar doesn't produce t13 directly. Wait, in the string, I do have t12, but not t13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t3 comes from another branch.\n\nWait, let's look at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT6. So, this would be a cycle between NT6, NT73, and NT62.\n\nWait, but I don't see any terminals here. So perhaps t63 comes from NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22. NT94 \u2192 NT14, and NT14 \u2192 NT59 NT15, and so on.\n\nBut let me think more systematically. Perhaps building the parse tree for the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps noting that each non-terminal can generate certain terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should check if the string's length is consistent with the grammar.\n\nWait, another thought: In a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, each production has two non-terminals. So, the derivation starts with the start symbol S and each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. This continues until all symbols are terminals. So, the number of steps would relate to the depth of the parse tree.\n\nBut in this case, the string is quite long, so perhaps the derivation is deep. But maybe I can look for the sequence of productions.\n\nWait, another approach: each occurrence of a terminal in the string must correspond to a terminal production in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-647","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine whether a specific string is generated by this grammar. The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. But wait, actually, CNF allows productions where the RHS can be two non-terminals or a single terminal. Hmm, let me confirm that. Oh right, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, some of the productions might be single terminals, but most are two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that several productions have two non-terminals on the RHS, like S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which is two non-terminals. Then there are others like NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, which is also two non-terminals. But I do see some where the RHS is a single terminal, like NT94 \u2192 't77'. Oh wait, but according to the problem statement, the string has terms like 't97', but I think in the grammar, it's actually the terminals that are the 't' followed by a number. So, each 't' ending with a number represents a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t97 t6 t26 t68 t94 t49 t58 t96 t7 t25 t76 t67 t8 t3 t13 t76 t12 t83 t97 t9 t82 t25 t39 t13 t3 t74 t7 t92 t76 t97 t7 t77 t82 t97`. So that's a sequence of terminals.\n\nMy approach is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding according to the grammar.\n\nThe first step is to represent the string as a sequence of terminals. Each of these must match either the RHS of a production or be a single terminal on the RHS of some production.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, during the process of checking, the string can be split into pairs of non-terminals in the derivation, but that might not always apply because some productions might have one terminal.\n\nWait, actually, since the grammar is in CNF and all productions are left-recursive or right-recursive, the derivation could be a bit tricky. Alternatively, using the CYK algorithm might be a more systematic way to determine if the string is in the language, given its structure.\n\nBut before jumping into that, perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, it's 't97'. So in the grammar, we need a production that directly produces 't97'. Looking through the productions, I see that some terminals appear as the RHS. Let me scan the productions:\n\nLooking for where a terminal is on the RHS.\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT56 \u2192 't72'\n- NT68 \u2192 't46'\n- NT84 \u2192 't34' and so on. Wait, perhaps not the most efficient approach.\n\nWait, the problem gave a list of productions where each production is either two non-terminals or sometimes a single terminal.\n\nWait, another approach: The CYK algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach, building a table from the bottom up. Each cell represents a substring, and the algorithm fills it by looking at possible productions that match two symbols.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long (33 symbols), it's easier to use the CYK algorithm here. But I'm supposed to think through this as a human, so perhaps writing out the steps is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I could check if each terminal is directly produced by some non-terminal, and then see if a path exists from S to these non-terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet's see. The string is: t97 t6 t26 t68 t94 t49 t58 t96 t7 t25 t76 t67 t8 t3 t13 t76 t12 t83 t97 t9 t82 t25 t39 t13 t3 t74 t7 t92 t76 t97 t7 t77 t82 t97.\n\nFirst, check if the string can be divided into a sequence where each pair of contiguous symbols can be matched to a production.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at it as pairs, but depending on the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to see if the string can be represented as a sequence of symbols that can expand to the terminal string.\n\nWait, but the structure may require the string to have certain nestings due to the productions.\n\nWait, is there a way to determine whether the string is in the language? Maybe looking for specific patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create a parse tree starting from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nEach NT6 and NT58 must be expanded into the string, but the string starts with t97.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT6 is 't73' (from NT6 \u2192 't73'?)\n\nWait, checking the given productions, let me list each production that is a terminal:\n\nLooking through the list provided:\n\nLooking for NT with a single terminal as RHS.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT56 \u2192 't72'\n- NT68 \u2192 't46'\n- NT84 \u2192 't34' [but that's a non-terminal]\nWait, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT56 \u2192 't72'\n- NT68 \u2192 't46'\n- NT84 \u2192 't34'\n- NT78 \u2192 't67'\n- NT2 \u2192 't9'\n- NT85 \u2192 't95'\n- NT95 \u2192 't94'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- NT38 \u2192 't68'\n- NT22 \u2192 't87'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87'\n- NT39 \u2192 't58'\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT34 \u2192 't36'\n- NT58 \u2192 't46'\n- NT44 \u2192 't83'\n- NT55 \u2192 't92'\n- NT39 \u2192 't63'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT62 \u2192 't84'\n- NT80 \u2192 't22'\n- NT38 \u2192 't49'\n- NT2 \u2192 't44'\n- NT8 \u2192 't12'\n- NT74 \u2192 't77'\n- NT84 \u2192 't40'\n- NT39 \u2192 't26'\n- NT27 \u2192 't7'\n- NT62 \u2192 't97'\n- NT85 \u2192 't76'\n- NT93 \u2192 't95'\n- NT85 \u2192 't58'\n- NT67 \u2192 't53'\n- NT79 \u2192 't67'\n- NT84 \u2192 't55'\n- NT74 \u2192 't8'\n- NT36 \u2192 't79'\n- NT17 \u2192 't96'\n- NT65 \u2192 't82'\n- NT93 \u2192 't39'\n- NT38 \u2192 't74'\n\nWait, correcting the list above, I see that several non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are those where the RHS is a single 't' followed by a two-digit or single-digit number, as per the list:\n\nFor example, NT94 \u2192 't77'\n\nLooking for 't97' in the RHS: Let's check each production.\n\nLooking through the given productions, I see:\n\n- NT698 is not present.

{"custom_id":"request-650","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal on the left side of a rule can produce any combination of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t9 t96 t97 t14 t46 t6 t83 t22 t26 t94 t16 t98 t94 t79 t97 t27 t72 t28 t8 t36 t84 t84 t68 t97 t58 t79 t96 t40 t3 t55 t46 t13 t74`.\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nI'll begin by looking at the top-level production rules. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the string must be a concatenation starting with the string generated by NT6 and followed by the string generated by NT58.\n\nLet me split the given string accordingly. The first part is \"t68 t9 t96 t97 t14 t46 t6 t83 t22 t26 t94 t16 t98 t94 t79 t97 t27 t72 t28 t8 t36 t84 t84 t68 t97 t58\", and the second part is \"t79 t96 t40 t3 t55 t46 t13 t74\".\n\nWait, actually, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the entire string should be the concatenation of NT6's derivation and NT58's derivation, separated by a space. So, the entire string is a single string; perhaps the initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait no, the splitting needs to be based on the productions. So, the entire string is a sequence of terminals (t followed by numbers), so each 'tX' is a terminal. The production rules consist of non-terminals (like NT6, NT9, etc.), so the string would consist of a series of production steps where non-terminals are expanded into sequences of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the entire string must be the result of NT6 and NT58 being expanded.\n\nLet me look at the string and see how many tokens there are. The string has 30 tokens, including all 'tX's.\n\nBut perhaps instead of splitting tokens first, I should look at the structure.\n\nFirst, the first symbol in the string is 't68', but according to the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't73' and NT62 \u2192 't84', etc. Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nWait, let's find out what each non-terminal expands to.\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\nNT6: I think from the rules, it's \"NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\". Because looking at the production rules, I see NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Right, because in the list, NT6: \"NT73 NT62\". So, NT6 is a two-symbol non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, hold on, some NTs have rule productions, and some others are terminals. For example, NT94 \u2192 't77', which is a terminal. Similarly, some NTs expand into other NTs.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse the string from the start, using the grammar.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree.\n\nThe entire string is 30 tokens long. Maybe I can parse it step by step.\n\nThe string is: t68, t9, t96, t97, t14, t46, t6, t83, t22, t26, t94, t16, t98, t94, t79, t97, t27, t72, t28, t8, t36, t84, t84, t68, t97, t58, t79, t96, t40, t3, t55, t46, t13, t74.\n\nBut perhaps that's too long. Let me check if the string makes sense step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, the first part is NT6 and the second part is NT58.\n\nI'll process NT6 first. What does NT6 produce?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73: Let's see the production for NT73. The rules include NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. So, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nThen, NT8: What does NT8 produce? Looking at the rules, I don't see NT8 in the rule list. Wait, wait, let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40.\n\nSo, NT9 is \"NT68 NT40\", which are both non-terminals.\n\nWait, but NT8 wasn't defined in the given rules. Hmm, that's a problem because in the rules, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, but then NT8 is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in copying the rules.\n\nWait, the rules provided are:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17.\n\nWait, perhaps there are more rules.

{"custom_id":"request-667","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. So, the grammar consists of productions where either a non-terminal leads to two other non-terminals, or one leads directly to a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most non-terminals produce two other non-terminals, except for the ones that directly produce a terminal with 't' and a number. So, each production is of the form NT -> NT1 NT2 or NT -> 'tX'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t87 t98 t25 t94 t92 t27 t14 t68 t94 t28 t70 t87 t12 t7 t79 t84 t44 t77 t12 t94 t27 t28 t14 t25 t39 t22 t53 t72 t97 t70 t22 t8 t28 t55 t97`.\n\nEach token in this string is a terminal, which is 't' followed by a number. So, the grammar needs to derive this sequence step by step.\n\nThe first step is to identify the start symbol, which is S in the grammar. So, S needs to produce this entire string. But S can only produce NT6 and NT58 as per the first production: S -> NT6 NT58. So, S directly breaks down into two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. Therefore, the initial step is to check if NT6 can derive the prefix starting after S's production, but wait, S is the root, so the entire string must come from NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either one non-terminal or two non-terminals. So, the structure is that each non-terminal expansion contributes parts of the string. So, the entire string must be built starting from S, which is NT6 and NT58. So the string is built from the left, starting with NT6, then NT58.\n\nBut wait, the string is a single sequence of terminals, so we need to parse it as a leftmost derivation. So, S produces NT6 NT58, so the string would be the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, I can approach this by trying to parse the string by splitting it into parts that correspond to NT6 and NT58, and then recursively check if each part can be derived from their respective non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let's see what NT6 can derive. From the grammar, let's see the productions for NT6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62. Then each of those can potentially split further.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 has a production NT9 and NT67, because in the grammar, NT58 -> NT95 NT98? Wait, no, looking back, I think maybe I misread. Let me check: the grammar is provided, so looking for NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list out the productions for each non-terminal. Alternatively, to save time, perhaps I should look for where the terminals in the string can be generated from the grammar, starting from S.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for how many symbols each non-terminal expects.\n\nWait, in the initial step, S produces two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. So, the entire string's derivation starts with NT6 and NT58, which will each recursively produce parts of the string until all symbols are consumed.\n\nSo, for NT6, the production is NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So, if the string can be split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT73 and the second by NT62, then NT6 can generate them.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps I should try to split it into two parts, left of the first symbol and right. Wait, no, because NT6 is split into NT73 and NT62, so the string generated by NT6 would be the concatenation of NT73's string and NT62's string. Similarly for NT58.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from both NT6 and NT58.\n\nThe entire string is length 42? Let me count: The string is: t87 t98 t25 t94 t92 t27 t14 t68 t94 t28 t70 t87 t12 t7 t79 t84 t44 t77 t12 t94 t27 t28 t14 t25 t39 t22 t53 t72 t97 t70 t22 t8 t28 t55 t97.\n\nSo that's 42 tokens. Since S produces two non-terminals, each of these non-terminals must derive a certain number of tokens. Let's see how many symbols each part would have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to break down the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S: NT6 NT58. So the entire string is the concatenation of what NT6 produces and NT58 produces.\n\nSo, let's first handle NT6.\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nNow, NT73: looking at the grammar, NT73's production is NT8 and NT7. Wait, no, let me check: NT73 -> NT8 NT9. So, NT73 splits into NT8 and NT9, so the string from NT73 would be the concatenation of NT8's string and NT9's string.\n\nSimilarly, NT62's production is NT73 and NT67 (NT62 -> NT73 NT67). So, NT62's string would be concatenation of NT73's string and NT67's string.\n\nWait, but that could create a loop. Let me try to map this.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to approach this as a tree.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to build the parsing tree. Let's see.\n\nBut this is going to take a long time because each non-terminal can split into two, and the string is 42 tokens, which is quite long.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to look for the terminals in the string and see if they match the possible terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for the productions, I see several NTs that produce terminals:\n\nNT2 -> 't9'\n\nNT94 -> 't77'\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\n\nNT79 -> 't16'\n\nNT63 -> 't36'\n\nNT15 -> 't94'\n\nNT69 -> 't67'\n\nNT46 -> 't28'\n\nNT66 -> 't96'\n\nNT87 -> 't98'\n\nNT27 -> 't4'\n\nNT38 -> 't68'\n\nNT22 -> 't87'\n\nNT9 -> 't26'\n\nNT46 -> 't87'\n\nNT39 -> 't58'\n\nNT2 -> 't70'\n\nNT34 -> 't36'\n\nNT58 -> 't46'\n\nNT44 -> 't83'\n\nNT40 -> 't39'\n\nNT68 -> 't84'\n\nNT80 -> 't22'\n\nNT74 -> 't77'\n\nNT84 -> 't40'\n\nNT39 -> 't63'\n\nNT9 -> 't3'\n\nNT62 -> 't84'\n\nNT85 -> 't76'\n\nNT93 -> 't95'\n\nNT85 -> 't58'\n\nNT67 -> 't53'\n\nNT79 -> 't67'\n\nNT84 -> 't55'\n\nNT74 -> 't8'\n\nNT36 -> 't79'\n\nNT17 -> 't96'\n\nNT65 -> 't82'\n\nNT93 -> 't39'\n\nNT38 -> 't74'\n\nHmm, okay, so each of these corresponds to a specific terminal string.\n\nSo, for example, NT2 can produce 't9' but also 't70', 't6', 't44', etc.\n\nWait, in the start rule S->NT6 NT58, each of these will expand, possibly leading to multiple terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I can start by trying to match the string as follows:\n\nThe string starts with t87.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because that means all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is binary, so each step in a derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. Since the grammar starts with S, the leftmost non-terminal, each step replaces one non-terminal with two others, or eventually a terminal.\n\nThe given string is: `t95 t27 t84 t44 t55 t97 t39 t82 t79 t94 t46 t13 t94 t4 t55 t22 t4 t44 t26 t64 t16 t12 t83 t9 t22 t40 t55 t13 t96 t7 t82 t82 t53 t92 t44`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with several t's followed by numbers, which are probably terminals. Each of these could correspond to the productions of the grammar, where a non-terminal might be replaced by a terminal symbol followed by another non-terminal or vice versa.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal (like S, NT74, etc.) has specific productions. For example, NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66, which means S can derive into two non-terminals. The string starts with t95, so I need to see which non-terminals can produce t95.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT95 has two productions:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69\n- NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66\n\nSo, if NT95 is the start, it can produce two sequences, but since the string starts with t95, that t95 must come either from NT9 or NT69 (from the first production) or from NT27 or NT66 (from the second production). \n\nLooking at what these non-terminals produce as terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t94 (from NT95's first production part)\n- NT69 \u2192 t67\n- NT27 \u2192 t4\n- NT66 \u2192 t96\n\nBut the string starts with t95, which doesn't directly match any terminal except for NT95, but wait, NT95's productions produce other non-terminals, not terminals.

Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with t95, which must be produced by a non-terminal that can derive to t95 through some steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the productions for t95. The grammar has NT95 \u2192 t96? No, actually, looking back, the grammar rules are in the form of NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66 and NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69. Oh, but the terminals are also present.

But let's think step by step.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is the top symbol. Looking at the productions for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT69 NT58 \u2192 and then each of NT69 and NT58 have more rules.\n\nSo perhaps each step is replacing into two non-terminals. Let's try to see if the string is a possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string against the grammar. But since I'm not familiar with the steps of CYK, perhaps it's better to see if we can find a way from S to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by S generating it through a series of non-terminals that eventually produce the terminals in the string.\n\nBut another approach: think of the string as a sequence of t's and numbers. The numbers are non-terminals, but the t's are terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-684","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. I'm a bit new to this, but I remember that CNF has some specific rules, like every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the given grammar. It seems to have a lot of productions, starting from S and expanding into various non-terminals until it eventually produces terminal symbols (t-something or specific t-something else). The string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58. So, the string we're evaluating must start with the start symbol S, which is broken down into two parts: NT6 and NT58. Wait, but in the string, the first word is 't79', not a non-terminal. That's a bit confusing. Let me note that down.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that most NTs eventually produce terminals. For example, NT6 -> 't73' and NT73 -> 't25'. Similarly, other NTs like NT74, NT95, etc., lead to specific terminals. So, each non-terminal can be expanded into one or two other non-terminals until it reaches a terminal.\n\nBut the string I have is a series of t's followed by numbers, which are all terminals. Each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal symbol. So, for the string to be valid, each of these must be generated by a production that leads directly to that terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some NTs can produce two non-terminals. For example, NT74 -> NT9 NT66. So, in the string, for 't74' to appear, it would have to come from a production where two non-terminals are expanded into 't74'. But in the string, I don't see 't74'; the first word is 't79'. So, that suggests that NT74 might not be involved here.\n\nBut let me check the string. The first part is 't79'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT79 has a production NT79 -> NT77, but also another one NT79 -> 't26'. Wait, no, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me check the productions for NT79.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT79 -> NT77\nNT79 -> NT94\n\nWait, that's from the initial productions. But also, looking further down:\n\nNT79 -> 't27' in another production. Wait, no, let me scan down:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nNT79 -> 't27'\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nWait, yes, NT94 -> 't14' and NT79 -> 't27' (I think I counted incorrectly earlier). So, NT79 can produce 't27' directly. So, in the string, the first word is 't79', but the grammar doesn't produce 't79' directly. So that seems problematic. Alternatively, maybe NT79 can produce some other combination.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that some NTs produce two non-terminals, but no NT in the start production leads directly to a 't' like 't79'. So, how can 't79' appear in the string?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a production. Let me scan through the grammar again to see if 't79' is directly produced by any NT. Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT79 -> NT77 (from the initial productions), then lower down, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nNT79 -> 't27'\n\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nThen lower:\n\nNT27 -> 't4'\n\nWait, no, 't79' is not directly a terminal. Hmm. So, perhaps 't79' must come from a production that is a chain of non-terminals leading to 't79'. Let me see.\n\nLooking for where 't79' is a terminal in any production. Scanning:\n\nI see NT79 -> 't27', so that's one. Also, looking at NT94, NT79, etc., but I don't see 't79' as a terminal. So the only way 't79' can appear is if some production like NT94 -> 't14' and then another that builds up 't79', but I don't see that. So perhaps this is an issue because the string starts with 't79', which may not be produceable by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see: the start symbol S is NT6 and NT58. NT6 -> 't73' and NT58 -> 't46'. So the string would start with 't73 t46', but the string starts with 't79 t64...', which is a contradiction. So, that suggests that the string cannot be generated because the initial productions don't start with 't79' of 't64'.\n\nWait, but S is NT6 and NT58. So, looking at NT6: NT6 -> 't73' and NT58-> 't46'. So, the first symbol of the string should be 't73' from NT6 and 't46' from NT58. But the given string starts with 't79', so it's impossible. Therefore, the answer must be 'No', the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. NT6 -> 't73', which is the first option, and NT58 -> 't46' is another. So, the initial string should start with either 't73' or 't46'. The given string starts with 't79', which isn't produced by S's immediate expansions. So, the string cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the string. Wait, the string is written as individual words separated by spaces: each element like 't79', 't64', etc. Are these elements directly the results of productions? For example, S -> NT6 NT58, so the string would have to start with 't73 t46', as those are the immediate terminal productions from NT6 and NT58.\n\nTherefore, since the string starts with 't79', which isn't generated by the initial productions, it's impossible for this string to be in the language of the grammar. So, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by breaking down the problem and understanding the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the string we're given has to start with NT6 followed by NT58 for it to be generated from S. Let me see the string: it starts with 't27 t8 t4 t25 t58 t76 t70 t79 t77 t22 t44 t53 t53 t83 t58 t3 t53 t13 t77 t55 t92 t63 t39 t77 t7 t6 t44 t12 t8 t67 t74 t72 t49 t55 t87 t76'. The first token is 't27'. Wait, that's strange because according to the grammar, the first thing after S is NT6. So, NT6 should expand into a sequence that starts with NT6. Looking at the rules, NT6 can be rewritten as NT73 NT62. Let's check what NT73 and NT62 expand into. \n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. NT8 is defined as 't12'. Wait, no, looking back, NT73 is one of the production rules, but checking the given grammar, I see NT73 \u2192 NT82's... Wait, no, looking again, there's a rule for NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and each of those (NT8 and NT9) can be terminals or further non-terminals. NT8 is written as 't8' in one rule, and NT9 as 't9' or something else.\n\nIn any case, for the first token, the string starts with 't27', but from the grammar, the first symbol after S is 't27' since NT6 leads to 't14' or... Wait, no. Let me correct that. In the given grammar, NT27 is a rule that produces 't4', right? Wait, no, let's look at the rules:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't4' is one of the rules. Wait, but in the context of NT6's expansion, how does that happen? NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT8 \u2192 't8', NT9 \u2192 't9', so NT73 \u2192 't8 t9'. Then NT62 \u2192 NT97. Wait, look at the rule for NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT97, and looking at NT97, but wait, in the given rules, I might have to trace each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and then NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, which gives 't8 t9', and NT62 \u2192 NT97, but looking at the list of rules:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT62 is defined as NT97, but NT97 isn't directly given, but I see that NT95 is defined, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently by using a top-down parsing method, expanding S step by step and seeing if at any point, the string tokens match.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long and the grammar has many non-terminals, maybe I should use a chart parser or an algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps a better approach is to check each production step and see if the string can be generated.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach it by building the parse tree step by step, but considering the length of the string, that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can check each part of the string to see if it aligns with the possible expansions.\n\nFirst, the initial symbol in the string is 't27'. Let's see where 't27' appears in the rules. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo if the initial part of the string starts with t27, that can be represented as NT27 \u2192 't4'. But then following that, we have 't8', 't4', etc.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, the first symbol is t27, so the first production is NT27. But wait, no\u2014the first production of S is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the entire string must start with the concatenation of NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t27, which is supposed to be generated by NT27. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string starts with t27 because it's generated by a different production. Let me check.\n\nWait, no. The first token after S in the string is t27, which would have to come from some NT rule, but according to the grammar, the first expansion is NT6 NT58, which is not t27. Wait, that can't be. So perhaps the string is incorrect, but looking at the string, it starts with t27, which would have to come from NT27, but according to the grammar, the first step in any derivation is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So perhaps the problem is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because it starts with t27, which is not the start symbol's expansion.\n\nWait, but that's a problem. Let me confirm the grammar again. The start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So any string generated by the grammar must start with the concatenation of NT6 and NT58. Now, looking at the string, the first token is t27. So unless NT6 or NT58 can produce 't27', which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, according to the grammar rules, NT27 is a non-terminal that can produce 't4'. But that's separate from NT6 or NT58. So, if the first token in the string is t27, that would imply that either NT6 or NT58 expands to 't27', which doesn't look like it's the case, because looking through the given rules, I don't see any NT6 or NT58 directly producing t27. So that's a red flag.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again to see if NT6 or NT58 can produce t27 or something else. Scanning through the rules, I don't see NT6 or NT58 expanding into 't27' or any terminal immediately. NT6 can only produce combinations of other NTs, like NT73 NC62, etc. So, according to the grammar, S starts with NT6 NT58, which are non-terminals, and those can only produce sequences of non-terminals, which then expand down to terminals. But 't27' is a terminal, so the entire expansion from S would start with non-terminals, leading to the first symbol being a non-terminal, not a terminal like t27.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with t27, which is a terminal that doesn't appear as the first symbol in any expansion of S.

The start symbol is S, so the top-level production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string should start with NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t44. Let me check which non-terminal produces 't44'. Looking at the productions, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Where do NT73 and NT62 go?\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. NT8 is a terminal 't8', and NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67. NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22. NT94 \u2192 't77'. Wait, the string starts with t44, but NT6 leads to NT73 and NT62. I don't see a production for NT6 that leads to 't44' directly. Wait, let me check NT2 productions. NT2 \u2192 't9' or 't70' or 't6' or etc. So 't44' is a terminal, but does any non-terminal produce 't44'? Looking through the productions, NT44 is defined? Wait, in the list given, I don't see a production for NT44. Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, the given grammar has productions like NT2 \u2192 't44 NT14', and others. So NT2's productions include 't44' as an option. So NT2 can produce 't44' by itself.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is 't44', which could be the result of NT2 \u2192 't44'... or wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't44 NT14'. So that would produce 't44' followed by NT14.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't44', which could be from NT2. So the first step could be S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Then NT6 goes to NT73 NT62, which then go to NT8 NT9 and NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT6? Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be derived starting from S, using the production rules.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. To see if it's generated by the grammar, each non-terminal must expand into a sequence that matches the string.\n\nLet me try to construct a parse tree. Starting with S, which is NT6 NT58. So the first two symbols in the string should be derived from NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string: t44, t68, t94, t53, t7, t68, t95, t7, t97, etc.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT6 NT58, then NT6 must produce some sequence starting with t44, and NT58 must produce the rest.\n\nLet me see what NT6 can produce. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nSo NT6 must first produce NT73 and NT62. Then, each of those must expand further.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 is a terminal 't8'\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22\n\nNT94 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT67 \u2192 't53'\n\nSo the path for NT73 would be NT73 \u2192 't8' NT9. NT9 \u2192 't63' ('t67') \u2192 wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 \u2192 't8' NT9.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40 \u2192 't68' NT40.\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17\n\nBut 't40' is a terminal? Wait, in the grammar, NT40 has productions to terminal or non-terminal. Wait, looking back, the grammar includes NT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17 and also NT40 \u2192 NT74 NT56? Or maybe I'm getting confused.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to check is: `t9 t4 t40 t6 t68 t26 t97 t8 t58 t77 t13 t16 t74 t83 t44 t27 t84 t28 t8 t9 t74 t26 t36 t74 t7 t9 t94 t74 t95 t26 t12 t83 t28 t58 t53 t95 t39`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The top-level rule is S -> NT6 NT58. So any string generated must start with NT6 and NT58, which then need to expand into the terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll note that it's a sequence of t9, t4, etc., which are terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols (non-terminals and terminals) in the string should be correct. Each production either adds one terminal or splits into two non-terminals, so for a string of length n, the derivation tree would have n-1 splits, leading to a string that's length n.\n\nWait, the string has 44 terminals. Let me count the tokens: each space separates a token, so the string has 44 tokens. Since the grammar is CNF, each production either replaces a non-terminal with one terminal or two non-terminals. The number of steps in the derivation would be (n-1), where n is the number of terminals. So for 44 tokens, the derivation tree should expand S into 44 terminals, which it can if each split corresponds to the right rules.\n\nNow, I need to check the sequence of terminals. Let's map each terminal to the corresponding NT. From the grammar rules:\n\n- NT2 -> t9 (multiple places)\n- NT4 -> t4\n- NT6 -> t6\n- NT8 -> t12\n- NT13 -> t13 (since NT78 is t78, and NT78->t52 or something else? Wait, looking at the grammar, for NT78: grammar shows NT78->NT67 NT73 and other splits. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Each terminal is mapped from a specific NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can create a mapping from NT to terminal:\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT2 -> t9\n- NT4 -> t4\n- NT6 -> t6\n- NT8 -> t12\n- NT9 -> t3 (since NT92 ->t26 or something)\nWait, no. Each NT only maps to one terminal. Looking at the rules:\n\nFor example, NT9 -> NT68 NT40, but NT68 is 't63' (since NT68->t63). Wait, no: looking back, NT68 has a rule like NT68->t63? Or wait:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for NT68: NT68 -> NT63 NT67, but NT63 is 't36' (NT63->t36). Wait, I'm getting confused. Each production for a NT either expands into two NTs or a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list each NT and see what it expands into, either directly or via rules.\n\nLet me go through each NT and see if it can derive into the given t's:\n\n- NT9: Rules are NT95 (t58?), NT40 (t40?), wait NT95 is 't14' or 't95'? Wait, looking back: I think each rule for NT9 gives a terminal.\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar rules, NT9 has rules like NT96 but I might have to list all NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at each NT and see which terminal they directly map to.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each produce is either A->BC or A->a. So for each A, if any production ends in a terminal, that's the only one mapping from A to that terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT2 -> t9 (multiple rules, but all A->t9)\n\nSimilarly, NT4 -> t4 (multiple rules)\n\nNT6 -> t6\n\nNT8 -> t12\n\nNT9 -> t3 (NT92 -> t26, but that's NT92, which may not be directly linked here. Wait, in the grammar, NT9 -> NT68 NT40. Wait, NT68 is NT68->t63 NT67, and NT67->t53, so NT68 expands to t63 t53. Then NT40 can expand into t40 or other NTs. But I'm getting lost here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for each terminal in the string and see which NT it can come from.\n\nThe string is: t9 t4 t40 t6 t68 t26 t97 t8 t58 t77 t13 t16 t74 t83 t44 t27 t84 t28 t8 t9 t74 t26 t36 t74 t7 t9 t94 t74 t95 t26 t12 t83 t28 t58 t53 t95 t39.\n\nLet me list each token and try to associate it with an NT:\n\n- t9: possible NT9 (since NT92 maybe or directly NT9)\n- t4: NT4\n- t40: NT40 (since NT40->t40)\n- t6: NT6\n- t68: NT68 (since NT68->t63 NT67 or derived? Wait, NT68's rule is NT68->NT63 NT67. So t68 might come from NT68's expansion. But wait, in the string, t68 is a terminal, so if NT68 can't produce a terminal, then perhaps the grammar doesn't allow it. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back, NT68 has a rule like NT68->t63 NT67, so it can't directly produce t68. So t68 must come from some other NT. But looking for any NT that has a rule ending with t68. Only NT28->t68 (since NT28 has a rule NT28->t68 NT93). So t68 must come from NT28.\n\nWait, but in the string, t68 is a terminal. So where does t68 come from? If a NT, say NT28, can produce t68, then that NT must expand into t68. So in the string, when there's a t68, it must come from NT28.\n\nSo now, the string starts with t9, which is NT9. Next is t4 (NT4), then t40 (NT40), then t6 (NT6), then t68 (NT28), etc.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules, let's see how these can be produced.\n\nStarting with S->NT6 NT58.\n\nSo the first step is S expands to NT6 and NT58.\n\n- NT6 must expand into t6, which is a terminal. So that's fine.\n\n- NT58 must expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Let's see what NT58 does.\n\nLooking up NT58: the rules are NT58->t84 NT93, and NT58->t84 NT69.\n\nWait, according to the given grammar, in the list:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- There's a line: NT58 -> t84 NT93\n\n- Another: NT58 -> t84 NT69\n\nSo NT58 can produce t84 followed by either NT93 or NT69.\n\nIn the string, the next token after t6 is t68, which comes from NT28.\n\nSo how can NT58 lead to t68? Wait, the first production for S is NT6 and NT58, so the next step is to expand NT58 into something that starts with t68.\n\nBut looking at NT58's rules, it expands to t84 followed by either NT93 or NT69. Neither of these options produce t68, because t84 is a terminal that comes from another NT.\n\nWait, let me check: NT58 is part of S's production. S is NT6 NT58. So when expanding, NT6 is 't6' and NT58 must produce the next part of the string.\n\nBut in the string, after 't6' comes 't68', which would require NT58 to produce 't68' as the next token, but NT58's rules don't generate a 't68' directly; it's either 't84' plus another NT or"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since this grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or terminals if applicable. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions go from a non-terminal to two other non-terminals, except for a few cases where a non-terminal is directly a terminal token, like 't77' etc. So, these terminals are the leaves in the parse tree, and the non-terminals are the internal nodes.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t97 t67 t7 t58 t28 t82 t28 t7 t14 t70 t77 t22 t67 t76 t40 t9 t22 t95 t9 t12 t27 t70 t76 t63 t98 t68 t44 t64 t98 t63 t13 t14 t9 t98 t96 t58 t87 t44`. \n\nI notice that this string is quite long\u2014over 40 tokens. My goal is to see if there's a way to factor this string into a sequence of productions from the grammar, ultimately starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSince each production in CNF produces two terminals or non-terminals, the entire string's length should be of the form 2^n - 1, where n is the number of productions. Let's check that. The number of tokens is 40, so 40 should be 2^n - 1. Let's see what n would be. 2^6 is 64, so 64-1=63. 2^5=32, 32-1=31. 31\u226040. Hmm, 2^6=64, 64-1=63. 63 is less than 40? Wait, 64-1 is 63, which is larger than 40. So 40 isn't of the form 2^n -1, which makes me think it's not possible for this string to be generated by the grammar. But maybe my assumption is wrong because the grammar might have some productions that lead to single terminals or something else.\n\nWait, no, in CNF each production is A->BC, so starting from S which produces two non-terminals, each step increases the number of symbols. So the number of symbols after each production should double. So for each level, the number should be 2^k where k is the number of steps. But if we start with one non-terminal (S), after one step it's two symbols, after two steps it's four, and so on. So the length of the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions.\n\nWait the initial string has 40 symbols. 40 is not a power of two plus one. Let's see, the length after n productions is 2^n - 1. So for n=6, 2^6-1 is 63. But 63 is more than 40. So 40 isn't 2^n -1, which means the string's length doesn't fit the required condition for being generated by this grammar. Therefore, the string can't be derived from S by CNF since the number of symbols isn't 2^n -1 for some n.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the grammar. Some non-terminals directly go to a single terminal\u2014like NT2 -> 't6', NT36 -> 't64', etc. Those can produce a terminal and another non-terminal or two terminals, but if a production can produce two terminals in one step, that affects the total length.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is either to two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if a production produces a terminal and a non-terminal, that's different. But in standard CNF, all productions produce two non-terminals. The problem says it's in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where a is a terminal. But in this grammar, looking at it, I see some productions like NT2 -> 't9', which is a terminal. So those can help in producing terminals at the leaves, allowing the overall string to not be just a series of doubling steps but can mix terminals and non-terminals. Wait, but the way the CNF is structured, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So when you expand S, you get two non-terminals, each of which can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo to build the entire string, each step can add one or two symbols, depending on whether the non-terminal produces two terminals (which is possible if both of its productions are terminals) or one terminal and one non-terminal.\n\nBut this complicates the matter because the string's length isn't just 2^n. It's more complicated. So trying to see if the string can be divided into a structure that fits the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should attempt to parse the string step by step using the grammar's rules, starting from the first symbol and trying to find the productions that match, working backwards.\n\nLet me look at the string again: \n\nThe string is `t97 t67 t7 t58 t28 t82 t28 t7 t14 t70 t77 t22 t67 t76 t40 t9 t22 t95 t9 t12 t27 t70 t76 t63 t98 t68 t44 t64 t98 t63 t13 t14 t9 t98 t96 t58 t87 t44`\n\nThat's 40 tokens as mentioned.\n\nLet me start from the start, S -> NT6 NT58. So S produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: From the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nSo NT6 becomes NT73 and NT62. Now, let's look at NT73 and NT62.\n\nNT73: From the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. So NT73 becomes NT8 and NT9.\n\nNT8: From the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't4' and NT2. Because looking at the grammar, NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 't4' and NT2.\n\nSimilarly, NT9: NT9 \u2192 't3' and NT44? Wait, let me check. Looking back: Oh, no, looking through the list, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Then under NT94, for example, NT94 \u2192 't14', etc. Wait, looking at NT73's productions: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nBut looking through the grammar list, for NT9, for example, there's NT9 \u2192 't26', etc., but I don't see NT8 being in the grammar except as 't4' in one production.\n\nWait, so NT8 is a non-terminal that can produce either 't4' or something else? No, from the grammar provided, the only production for NT8 is NA8 \u2192 't4' and NT2, which suggests that NT8 is a terminal? Wait no, in CNF, each production should have two symbols on the right.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar rules: I see that some have a single terminal as the right-hand side, for example, NT2 \u2192 't9', NT36 \u2192 't64' etc. So for a production like NT8 \u2192 't4' and NT2, this is allowed \u2014 it's a production with one terminal and one non-terminal.\n\nWait, but is NT8 a non-terminal that can produce 't4' alongside another symbol? That would mean that NT8 can produce 't4' and NT2, but when looking from the top, how does that affect the entire parsing?\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to start from the string and try to see if it can be broken down step by step according to the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar's starting symbol S \u2192 NT6 NT58, let's see the options for NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the NT6 production: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 is found several times. Let me check the grammar for NT58:\n\nNT58 appears multiple times, but not sure which production. Looking through the list:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, here are the rules for NT58:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT93\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT93 NT69"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-729","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string and the grammar are quite lengthy, so I'll need to break it down methodically.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure makes it easier for certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not going to use that, I'll have to approach it differently.\n\nThe grammar starts with S and has non-terminals (NT) and terminals (t). Each production is either combining two non-terminals or producing a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 means S can be replaced by NT6 followed by NT58. NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84 means NT65 becomes NT38 and NT84.\n\nThe given string is a series of terminals separated by spaces: `t26 t64 t4 t92 t63 t84 t67 t16 t84 t64 t72 t16 t14 t25 t39 t7 t36 t53 t63 t16 t72 t97 t16 t40 t79 t58 t6 t74 t25 t79 t96 t76 t55 t74 t70 t84 t13 t3`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step can only generate a string of terminals, and each production is exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So any string generated must be built by combining these rules step by step.\n\nLet me note that the grammar has many rules that directly map non-terminals to terminals. For instance, NT9 \u2192 't26', NT36 \u2192 't64', etc. These can be used to replace any occurrence of those non-terminals in the string.\n\nThe key approach here is to start with the entire string and see if it can be broken down into non-terminals according to the grammar. Since the grammar has a lot of NT \u2192 't...', it's possible that many of these can be directly matched.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t26. From the grammar, this is produced by NT9. So if the first part of the string can start with NT9, then we can proceed.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step:\n\n1. Check if the entire string can be represented as a sequence of productions starting from S. Since S \u2192 NT6 NT58, the string must be NT6 followed by NT58.\n\n2. Check each token in the string to see if they match the right-hand sides of the grammar's NT rules.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\n- t26: matches NT9 \u2192 t26\n- t64: matches NT36 \u2192 t64\n- t4: matches NT...? Let me check NT4 \u2192 't3' (from the grammar). Wait, no, in the grammar provided, NT4 isn't a non-terminal, but NT... maybe I'm missing. Wait, the grammar's rules go as NT9 \u2192 't26', NT36 \u2192 't64', NT... looking at the rules, I don't see an NT that produces t4. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the list, the rules for NT are like NT95 \u2192 't14', NT79 \u2192 't27', etc. I don't see any NT that directly produces t4. So if t4 is in the string, it must be part of a longer sequence produced by a combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the first part of the string is t26 t64, which are both terminals, corresponding to NT9 and NT36. Then the next token is t4. So the sequence so far would be (NT9 (producing t26)) followed by (NT36 (producing t64)), then t4 (which is a terminal). How can this happen in the grammar?\n\nIn CNF, each step can only combine two non-terminals or produce a terminal. So the entire string must be built by expanding S into two non-terminals, each of which may themselves be expanded into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string token by token, keeping track of possible non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse the process: instead of seeing if the terminal string starts with S, perhaps see if the terminals can be split according to the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with the entire string, let's see if it can be divided into a sequence of non-terminals according to the rules. Each rule is of the form NT \u2192 NT1 NT2. So the entire string must be split into products of two non-terminals at each step.\n\nBut this might get complicated, so perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal can be associated with a non-terminal that produces it.\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\nEach NT... is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's list all the NT rules that produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t26\n- NT36 \u2192 t64\n- NT40 \u2192 t9\n- NT2 \u2192 t9\n- NT46 \u2192 t87\n- NT44 \u2192 t83\n- NT34 \u2192 t58\n- NT17 \u2192 t96\n- NT65 \u2192 t82\n- NT93 \u2192 t39\n- NT38 \u2192 t74\n- NT27 \u2192 t4\n- NT62 \u2192 t97\n- NT56 \u2192 t72\n- NT85 \u2192 t95 (Wait, no, earlier I saw that some have NT95 with multiple rules. Let me check.)\n\nWait, some NT rules produce a single terminal:\n\nNT95 \u2192 t14 (one rule is NT95 \u2192 't14', but also other rules like NT95 \u2192 NT95 NT6?

Let's see, they are: t55, t63, t44, t6, t27, t9, t79, t22, t49, t84, t13, t3, t76, t94, t46, t16, t49, t82, t76, t76, t36, t9, t8, t16, t14, t13, t40, t68, t39, t63, t3, t94, t49, t12, t39, t9, t26, t94, t97.\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, and from the grammar, S -> NT6 NT58. So, the derivation starts with two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. These non-terminals will then be expanded according to the production rules until we get all terminals.\n\nBut wait, each production is a combination of two non-terminals. So, for a string to be derived, the structure should be such that the non-terminals can expand into sequences of terminals that match the string.\n\nSince using CYK is systematic, maybe I should outline the steps. But considering the string's length is 41 tokens (since there are 41 t's), that's quite long. But I can try to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the production rules that produce the terminals. Each terminal must be produced directly by a production. For example, looking at the grammar, some rules are:\n\nNT2 -> 't9' or 't70' or 't44' etc.\n\nWait, each NT produces specific terminals. So, for instance, NT2 can produce 't9', 't70', or 't44', etc. Similarly, NT36 -> 't64'.\n\nSo, the approach is to see if each token in the string can be matched by a terminal that one of the non-terminals can produce, and that the overall structure can be built up from S.\n\nBut given that it's a context-free grammar, perhaps another way is to see the dependencies.\n\nLooking at the last token, t97. I need to see if any production rule leads to t97.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do I have any rule that directly produces t97? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the list of rules, I see NT27 -> 't4', NT38 -> 't68', NT2 -> 't70', etc. But t97 is produced by NT84. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT84 -> NT34 NT93\nWait, but wait, according to the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any rule for NT97. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Wait, the user provided a long list. Let me scan:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT85 -> NT95 NT55\nNT74 -> NT77\nNT84 -> NT34 NT93\nNT78 -> NT67 NT73\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9\nWait, but perhaps looking for T97. Let's check NT85: NT85 -> t76? No, in the rules, NT85 can go to t76 via NT85 -> t76? Wait, no, in the rules listed, there are some NTs mapped to 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT94 -> 't14', NT73 -> 't25', etc. Also, some NTs have multiple productions. So, looking for t97, perhaps it's produced by a certain NT.\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT97 is not directly mapped, but let's see: looking at the top, the only 't...' are for NT2, NT34, etc. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Or perhaps I need to check all rules to see if any NT is mapped to 't97'.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\n- NT73 -> t25\n- NT79 -> t16\n- NT63 -> t36\n- NT15 -> t94\n- NT69 -> t67\n- NT46 -> t28\n- NT66 -> t96\n- NT79 -> t27\n- NT94 -> t14\n- NT2 -> t70\n- NT36 -> t64\n- NT56 -> t72\n- NT69 -> t13\n- NT87 -> t98\n- NT27 -> t4\n- NT38 -> t68\n- NT22 -> t87\n- NT9 -> t26\n- NT46 -> t87\n- NT39 -> t58\n- NT2 -> t44\n- NT84 -> t55\n- NT39 -> t63\n- NT9 -> t3\n- NT62 -> t84\n- NT80 -> t22\n- NT38 -> t49\n- NT2 -> t6\n- Wait, does any NT produce t97? I'm looking, and I don't see any directly. The last one is NT94, which is t94.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, looking through all the rules again:\n\n- NT79 -> t27, t28 (Wait, no. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, here's the rule for NT79: NT79 -> 't27'? No, wait: Looking at the list, I have NT79 -> 't27'? Wait, the list has:\n\nNT79 -> 't16'? No, wait, the lines in the grammar are:\n\nLooking back, the grammar lines are:\n\nNT79 -> 't27' [Line: NT95 -> NT27 NT66], wait no, that's NT95 -> t27.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs and their terminal productions.\n\nLet me go through each rule and note if any NT produces a 't' followed by something that might be 97.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT27 -> 't4'\n\nNT38 -> 't68'\n\nNT2 -> 't70'\n\nNT36 -> 't64'\n\nNT56 -> 't72'\n\nNT69 -> 't13' and 't67'\n\nNT46 -> 't28' and 't87'\n\nNT39 -> 't58' and 't63'\n\nNT95 -> 't76' (Is there a rule for NT95?)\n\nWait, from the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66 [1 line]\nNT95 -> NT56 NT95 [another line]\n\nWait, but looking for 't97', perhaps it's produced by a certain NT. Alternatively, maybe it's not, and then t97 can't be derived, making the string invalid.\n\nWait, the last token is t97. If there's no production rule for NT97, then it's impossible. So, the string can't be generated because t97 isn't a terminal symbol of any NT in the given grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me check all the NT rules again.\n\nQuickly, the NT rules have t14 for NT94, t77 for NT73, etc. I don't see any NT that produces 't97'. So, t97 is not a terminal in the grammar's productions. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the last token, t97, isn't present in any rule.

The start symbol is S, and the given grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t27 t28`. So, I should see if t27 can be derived from a production that ends in NT27. Scanning through the rules, I see NT27 -> 't4' but there's also NT78 -> NT52 NT80 which includes NT52 and NT80. Wait, maybe NT6 or NT58 can break down into t28.\n\nWait, let me examine the NT and the corresponding terminals:\n\nFrom the rules, NT27 -> 't4' is a direct terminal. Similarly, NT94 -> 't14', NT2 -> 't9' or other 't's.\n\nBut in the string, t27 comes first. Looking through the NT rules, I see NT79 -> 't27' and NT79 also appears in several places, like NT29->, wait no, looking at the list, there's NT27-> 't4', but no NT27 producing t27. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check all rules:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see lines like NT27 -> 't4', which is a terminal symbol, but nowhere does an NT rule produce t27. So that's a problem. The first token in the string is t27, but there's no production for NT27 that produces t27. That suggests that the string shouldn't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the rules for NT27 and t27.\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nI see NT79->'t27' (earlier lines like NT79->... but wait, the rule says NT79->'t27'\u2014is that correct? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nYes, there's a line: NT79-> 't27'. So NT79 can produce t27. But then the string starts with t27, which would require NT79 somehow producing that.\n\nBut then, how does the rest of the string fit in? Let's see: the string is `t27 t28 t55 t3 ...`. So after t27, we have t28. So after the start symbol S, which produces NT6 NT58, which then...\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, since the string starts with t27, which comes from NT79, and elsewhere the string has t28, which might come from NT50 (since NT50-> NT93 NT6 and NT93-> 't40' from looking at rules (wait, I'm getting confused).\n\nWait, perhaps the initial production S->NT6 NT58 would have to resolve NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6: the rules say NT6->'t73' or perhaps other NTs. For example, NT6 is defined as -> NT73 NT62, and NT73->'t8' or -> NT97 NT62, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the parsing starts from S, which is NT6 NT58. So the entire string must be decomposable into these two parts.\n\nBut the string starts with t27, which is derived from NT79. However, S is NT6 NT58, so the initial production does not involve NT79. So if the first t27 is from NT79, that would not be part of the S derivation, which only involves NT6 and NT58. Therefore, the string cannot be derived from S, because the initial parts are not compatible.\n\nWait, that's a key point. The string starts with t27, which must come from NT79. But the start symbol S can only produce NT6 and NT58, which don't include NT79. Therefore, the string should not be generated by this grammar because the initial symbol can't connect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar can derive the string through some other means, but given the structure, the start symbol S can't produce a t27 directly. Therefore, the string doesn't fit.\n\nI think that's the main issue here. The first token t27 can't be derived from S or NT6 or NT58, since NT6 leads to t73 eventually, and NT58 leads to t27? Wait, looking back, NT58-> 't46' or does it have production rules? Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT58: NT58->NT84 NT9, and NT84-> 't46' etc. So NT58 doesn't directly produce t27.\n\nAlternatively, could NT79 be part of some other derivation? Wait, but the start symbol is S, which only splits into NT6 and NT58. So the t27 must be the first symbol, which would be impossible because S can't produce that directly, and neither do the non-terminals in NT6 or NT58.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NT productions. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT6-> NT73 NT62\n\nNT58-> NT84 NT9\n\nThen, NT84-> 't46'\n\nNT9-> 't26'\n\nSo when S-> NT6 NT58, these expand into something else. For example, NT6 eventually leads to t73, and NT58 leads into t46 and t26. So the entire string cannot start with t27 because S's expansion doesn't include NT79.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t27, which isn't part of S's expansion.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form only allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, I need to check if the grammar adheres to this structure, but since the user provided the grammar, I can assume it's correct. My main task is to check if the given string can be produced by this grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t7, t87, t6, etc., ending with t72. I think the approach here is to try to parse the string using the grammar, working from left to right, and see if the entire string can be derived.\n\nBefore starting, I notice that the string has several repeated t's, which suggest that there might be non-terminals that generate repeated sequences. But since the grammar can have multiple paths, I might have to explore different routes.\n\nI know that in Chomsky normal form, the parsing can be done using a stack-based approach. But maybe a better way here is to see if the string can be generated by repeatedly applying the productions. Given the length of the string, it's a bit tedious, but perhaps manageable by looking for patterns.\n\nLooking at the string, let's break it into parts and see if they correspond to any non-terminals or the productions.\n\nFor example, the string starts with `t7 t87`. Let's see which non-terminals can produce `t7` and `t87`. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT73 -> t77 (I think that's if NT73 can produce 't77', but I need to check the productions.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's see. The string is `t97 t46 t95 t79 t67 t39 t68 t67 t9 t49 t74 t6 t74 t39 t96 t40 t95 t25 t74 t28 t70 t13 t13 t83 t13 t76 t9 t77 t97 t36 t92 t63 t87 t14 t13 t96 t79 t82 t9 t76`. That's quite long, so manually tracing it might be tough.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the productions except the terminals like 't9', 't74', etc., seem to fit the form. So that's good.\n\nEach non-terminal must derive a string of terminals, and the string is a concatenation of these terminal strings. So to validate the string, I need to see if it's a correct concatenation according to the rules.\n\nThe string starts with t97, which corresponds to the production NT97 being derived into t97. From the grammar, I see NT94 \u2192 't14' and other terminals, but I'm not sure about NT97. Wait, looking back, I don't see any production for NT97 except perhaps through left-hand sides? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT74 \u2192 t77, NT84 \u2192 t40, etc. But no production for NT97. Wait, that might be a problem. Because if NT97 is a non-terminal, it's supposed to derive into a terminal, but if it's not defined, then it's not a terminal. So that can't be.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar rules again. There's a production NT94 \u2192 't14' and other NT... rules. But I don't see any NT97 \u2192 t..., which is confusing because in the string, the first token is t97. That might mean that NT97 should exist, but in the provided grammar, I don't see any such production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t97 is part of another non-terminal's production. For example, perhaps there's a production like NT97 \u2192 something, but looking through the provided rules:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT65 -> 't82'\n- ... etc.\n\nI don't see NT97 being defined; it's just listed as a terminal, which might not be allowed in CNF, because CNF requires the grammar to consist of non-terminals expanding into terminals or two non-terminals. So if a non-terminal is only a terminal, that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, in CNF, each production must be of the form A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, there's a line:\n\n```\n22222 NT97 NT97 t97\n```\n\nWait, looking through the provided lines, some are unclear. Let me re-express the productions correctly.\n\nThe user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nThen a series of rules like NT74 -> NT9 NT66\n\nThen, further down:\n\nNT94 -> 't77'\nNT74 -> 't77'?\n\nWait, no. Let me parse each production line correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the lines are split, and each line has a production. So for example:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nThen NT74 -> NT9 NT66\n\nNT63 -> NT94 NT22\n\nAnd so on, until the last lines, which have certain terminals as the right-hand sides.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nBut looking again, the last lines have several rules ending with a single terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT73 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't36'\n\nAnd several more: like NT65 \u2192 't82', NT52 \u2192 't19', etc.\n\nWait, that's problematic. Because in CNF, each production should have either a non-terminal or two non-terminals. But a production ending with a terminal (like NT94 \u2192 't14') is allowed because it's A \u2192 a, and a is a terminal.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, the production NT97 \u2192 't97' seems to be missing. Wait, looking for NT97 in the rules. Let me check all the lines.\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nI don't see NT97 being a production. Some lines have terminals on the RHS, like NT2 \u2192 't9', NT94 \u2192 't14', NT74 \u2192 't77', etc. But where is NT97 being defined?\n\nWait, perhaps a typo? Maybe there's a typo in the grammar provided. Because in the string, the first token is t97, so the corresponding non-terminal should have a production that yields t97. But in the grammar, I don't see such a production. This might imply that the grammar cannot generate t97, making the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe the production NT97 is on the left-hand side, but I don't see it. For example, maybe NT97 is the left-hand side of another production, but I don't see any lines where NT97 is on the LHS. So I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, let me count through all the productions. For example, the line 'NT62 \u2192 't84'' is correct. But I don't see NT97. That is a problem because the string starts with t97, which would require that NT97 has a production that ends with t97.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a rule I missed. Let me go through each line carefully.\n\nLooking at the lines in order, the grammar starts with S and goes down. Checking for lines where NT97 appears on the LHS.\n\nLooking through the entire list:\n\nThe productions in the grammar are as follows (only the RHS matters, as LHS is the non-terminal):\n\n- 't9' for several NTs\n- 't14' for NT94\n- 't77' for NT74\n- 't25' for NT73\n- 't16' for NT79\n- 't36' for NT63\n- etc.\n\nNo production involving NT97 except perhaps as a terminal, but that's not allowed in CNF. In CNF, all rules must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nThus, the presence of terminals in the RHS of non-terminals means those non-terminals can act as sources of those terminals. But the absence of a production for NT97 would mean that the grammar cannot derive t97, so the string containing t97 cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed the production for NT97. Let me check all the lines again. Scanning the entire list, I don't see any NT97 being on the left-hand side, which is required to produce t97. So that production is missing, which means the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the grammar cannot generate the given string because NT97 is not defined, and the string starts with t97.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-783","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF has specific productions where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except the start symbol which can go to a terminal. That means each production is either A \u2192 BC or a single terminal. This should help in building a derivation tree or using a parsing method that works with CNF, like the CYK algorithm. But I'm not sure if I need to go that far or if I can do it manually.\n\nLet me look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and looking at the first production: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string starts with NT6 and NT58, both of which are non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it starts with t13, which should correspond to NT13. According to the grammar, NT13 \u2192 NT56 NT95. So I'll start breaking it down from the given string.\n\nThe string is: t13 t8 t7 t4 t96 t67 t53 t9 t70 t9 t82 t67 t76 t44 t77 t72 t95 t44 t74 t63 t94 t77 t49 t6 t87 t76 t44 t27 t79 t77 t94 t98 t14 t25 t87 t27 t3 t64 t3.\n\nSo starting with t13: that must come from NT13 \u2192 NT56 NT95. Now, let's see what each of these produces.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT95 NT36 (from the grammar). So NT56 becomes NT95 and NT36. Then NT95 can be NT27 NT66 or maybe another option. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT95 \u2192 NT95 NT6 is not correct. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT95 appears a couple of times. Let me list the relevant ones:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69 (twice, at production 95 and 49)\nNT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66 (productions 95 and 55)\n\nSo for NT95, there are two options. Similarly, NT36 has multiple productions: NT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2 (appears twice, 79 and 39), and NT36 \u2192 NT40 NT17 (productions 33 and 55).\n\nWait, maybe I should construct the parsing tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be systematic. The CYK algorithm works by filling a table where each cell represents whether a certain non-terminal can derive the substring from that row to column.\n\nBut since the string is quite long (75 tokens), that might be time-consuming, but let's see if there's a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules that produce terminals, as these will be the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT79 \u2192 't16'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT66 \u2192 't96'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT94 \u2192 't14'\n- NT2 \u2192 't70', 't6', 't9', 't44', 't6', etc.\n- NT36 \u2192 't64'\n- NT56 \u2192 't72'\n- NT69 \u2192 't13'\n- NT87 \u2192 't98'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4' (Wait, in the grammar, line NT27 \u2192 't4' and 't44'? Let me check: Yes, NT27 has two productions: \u2192 't4' and 't44'.)\n- Similarly, NT2 has several terminal productions: 't9', 't70', 't6', 't44', 't87', 't96', 't72', 't64', 't97', 't44'.\n\nSo the terminals are the letters 't' followed by numbers. Each rule in the grammar leads to either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t13. So t13 must come from NT13 \u2192 NT56 NT95. So the first two symbols in the string must correspond to the two non-terminals NT56 and NT95.\n\nLet me see the first part of the string: t13 t8 t7 t4...\n\nSo t13 is produced by NT13, which is split into NT56 and NT95. Then, the next symbol is t8, which must be a production of one of these.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when we split NT13 into NT56 and NT95, each of these will need to produce their own substrings. So the entire string should be split into parts based on the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is t13, which comes from NT13. So we need to split the string starting from the first symbol into components that can be generated by NT56 and NT95.\n\n2. NT13 \u2192 NT56 NT95, so the string is split into [t13, t8, t7, t4] and [t96, t67, t53, t9, t70, t9, t82, t67, t76, t44, t77, t72, t95, t44, t74, t63, t94, t77, t49, t6, t87, t76, t44, t27, t79, t77, t94, t98, t14, t25, t87, t27, t3, t64, t3].\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Actually, the whole string should be split into parts based on the NT13 production. So the first two parts are NT56 and NT95. So the entire string is the concatenation of the substring generated by NT56 and the substring generated by NT95.\n\nSo the entire string is t13 followed by the rest. So the string after t13 is 't8 t7 t4 t96 ...'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The way the CYK algorithm works is that you process substrings of the string and for each possible starting and ending index, determine if a non-terminal can derive that substring.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a terminal.\n\nSo each step in the derivation is combining two smaller substrings into a larger one, starting from the terminals.\n\nBut perhaps breaking it down recursively would help.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t13. So the start symbol S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo the entire string is the concatenation of the substring generated by NT6 and the substring generated by NT58.\n\nSo first, let's process NT6 and NT58.\n\nProcessing NT6:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 (from line NT6: 'nt6 \u2192 nt73 nt62').\n\nSo NT6 needs to be split into NT73 and NT62.\n\nFirst substring: [t8, t7, t4, t96, t67, t53, t9, t70, t9, t82, t67, t76, t44, t77, t72, t95, t44, t74, t63, t94, t77, t49, t6, t87, t76, t44]\n\nWait, no. Actually, since the entire string is t13 followed by the rest, which is 't8 t7 t4 ...', that's incorrect because the entire string is 't13 t8 t7 t4 ...' and the production S is NT6 NT58, so it should split into two halves: the part generated by NT6 and the part generated by NT58.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let's clarify:\n\nThe entire string starts with t13, which comes from NT13 \u2192 NT56 NT95. So the first part must be generated by NT56, and the second part by NT95.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT95 NT36 (line NT56: 'nt56 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-805","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we're evaluating.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule either has two non-terminal symbols on the right side or a single terminal symbol. This is helpful because CNF is nice for things like parsing algorithms, but for this problem, we just need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see the start symbol S. The first production is S -> NT6 NT58. So, the string must start with the symbols NT6 and NT58. Wait, no\u2014the string consists of all terminal symbols, so we need to see if the string can be broken down into the sequence of terminals that S produces.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, S is a non-terminal, and the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. So the string must be a sequence of symbols that can be generated by expanding S through the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t72 t55 t46 t26 t16 t98 t9 t83 t26 t72 t72 t82 t26 t92 t55 t25 t83 t67 t28 t79 t84 t4 t40 t14 t79 t6 t28 t36 t77 t77 t13 t97 t16 t70 t44 t83 t82 t6 t74 t64 t49 t55.\n\nThat's quite a long string. Let me count the number of tokens: let's see, each space-separated word is a token. So:\n\n1. t72\n2. t55\n3. t46\n4. t26\n5. t16\n6. t98\n7. t9\n8. t83\n9. t26\n10. t72\n11. t72\n12. t82\n13. t26\n14. t92\n15. t55\n16. t25\n17. t83\n18. t67\n19. t28\n20. t79\n21. t84\n22. t4\n23. t40\n24. t14\n25. t79\n26. t6\n27. t28\n28. t36\n29. t77\n30. t77\n31. t13\n32. t97\n33. t16\n34. t70\n35. t44\n36. t83\n37. t82\n38. t6\n39. t74\n40. t64\n41. t49\n42. t55.\n\nSo 42 tokens. Each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. This means that when generating a string, each step in the derivation either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (which will then be expanded further) or with a terminal.\n\nThe minimal string a non-terminal can generate is a single terminal (when it directly produces one). The maximal is two terminals (if it's a binary production). Wait, in CNF, each production is either A->BC or A->a. So each non-terminal can generate either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the length of the string generated by any non-terminal is determined by the number of derivations. Each production step can potentially increase the number of symbols by one (since BC becomes two non-terminals, which may eventually be two terminals).\n\nWait, maybe that's confusing. Let me think again. For example, if S -> NT6 NT58, then S can generate a string of length k where k is the sum of the lengths of NT6 and NT58.\n\nEach non-terminal either produces one terminal (length 1) or two non-terminals, which in turn will each produce some terminals. So, the total number of terminals in any derivation of S would be the number of leaves in the parse tree.\n\nIn a binary tree, the number of leaves is related to the internal nodes. Since each internal node has two children, the total number of nodes is 2n - 1 for n leaves. However, since each node can produce a terminal or continue to split, the number of terminals can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the stack as a way to derive.\n\nBut maybe instead of getting stuck on that, I can try to see if the given string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by some rule, considering the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, S -> NT6 NT58. So the first two symbols must come from NT6 and NT58. Looking at the string, the first token is t72, which must come from NT6. Then the second token is t55, which must come from NT58.\n\nLooking at the NT6 productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nAnd for NT6, the possible productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nAt the top of the grammar, I see S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nThen, looking for NT6, let's list its productions. Scanning through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nWait, is there any other production for NT6? Scanning, I only find:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nSo, NT6 can only be split into NT73 and NT62. Now, NT73 is a non-terminal, and so is NT62.\n\nSo, for the first part of the string: t72.\n\nLooking for where 't72' appears as a production. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT69 -> 't67' and several others.\n\nWait, but for NT6, all products are to other non-terminals. So, the production for NT6 is to NT73 and NT62. So, the first symbol in the string is t72, but NT6 doesn't produce 't72' directly. That's a problem because 't72' isn't an option for NT6.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The NT6 productions:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nIs that the only one? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list, yes, only that. So, NT6 can only produce NT73 and NT62. So, in the first step, to generate S -> NT6 NT58, which needs to produce t72 t55. But NT6 can't produce t72 directly because its production is to non-terminals.\n\nThis suggests that either the first symbol t72 must be produced by a non-terminal that can directly produce t72, or by a non-terminal that splits into something that can produce t72.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the only place where 't72' appears is as a terminal symbol under certain NT rules:\n\nLooking up 't72' in the terminal mappings: under the grammar rules, I see entries like NT69 -> 't67', but 't72' is not a terminal directly. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding\u2014the grammar defines the production rules where non-terminals can be replaced with sequences of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production that ends with 't72' as a terminal. Wait, let me make sure. The provided grammar doesn't list any direct terminal symbols except for those listed in the bottom, like NT73 -> 't25', etc.\n\nLooking through the terminal symbols:\n\nI see:\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\nNT79 -> 't16'\nNT63 -> 't36'\nNT15 -> 't94'\nNT69 -> 't67'\nNT46 -> 't28'\nNT66 -> 't96'\nNT79 -> 't27'\nNT94 -> 't14'\nNT2 -> 't70'\nNT36 -> 't64'\nNT56 -> 't72'\nAh, here we go. NT56 -> 't72'\n\nSo, in this grammar, the non-terminal NT56 can be directly replaced by 't72'.

{"custom_id":"request-804","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I'm not very experienced with context-free grammars, but I'll do my best to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left-hand side. Each rule can only produce two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. From the production rules, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, S can only generate something if NT6 and NT58 can generate the other parts.\n\nNow, looking at the string provided: it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't79', 't53', etc. These 't' plus numbers are terminals, meaning they are the actual symbols that form the string, not non-terminals.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't79'. So, I need to see if any production rules generate 't79'. Looking through the rules, I see NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84, but that's for non-terminal NT65. There's another rule: NT79 \u2192 NT67 NT73. So, NT79 can produce NT67 and NT73. Hmm, but in the string, 't79' appears at the beginning, so maybe NT79 starts the string.\n\nWait, but that would mean the string starts with NT79, which can only be derived from a production of a non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe there's a rule that directly produces 't79'. Looking through the list, I see NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66. Oh, NT95 produces 't27' and 't66', but that's for 't27' and 't66'. Hmm, maybe I need to track where 't79' comes from.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. There's NT79 \u2192 't16'. So, the production rule is NT79 \u2192 't16'. So, 't16' is a terminal, which could mean that NT79 directly generates 't16', but that's not the case in the string. So, perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, looking again at the rules, I see:\n\nNT79 \u2192 't63' and 't67'? No. Wait, let me scan all rules for 't79'. I see that in the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't79' except maybe NT79 is derived from another NT. For example, looking for 't79' in the productions:\n\nYes, here: NT79 \u2192 't26'? No. Wait, let me go through carefully:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n- NT80 \u2192 NT39 NT28\n- NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93, and NT90something\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- Wait, but I need to find 't79'.\n\nWait, I see a rule: NT95 \u2192 NT56 NT36? No. Wait, maybe I need to see if any NT production directly results in 't79'. Or perhaps 't79' is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, perhaps the string 't79' is generated by NT79, but if NT79 \u2192 't67' and 't73', then it's not 't79'. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't79', so we need to have a production where a non-terminal generates 't79'. But looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't79' as a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 NT67 NT73: so this would give us two terminals, 't67' and 't73', concatenated.\n- Is 't79' a terminal? Yes, looking again at the given grammar, I see that NT94 \u2192 't14', so 't14' is a terminal. Similarly, NT95 \u2192 't27', etc. So 't79' is a terminal.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't79', we need to find a non-terminal that directly produces 't79' as a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNo, there is no rule for any NT that directly produces 't79'. So that's a problem. Because in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, but for terminals, they're not allowed. Wait, but no, in CNF, all terminals are leaves, so each production is an NT \u2192 NT NT. But to get a terminal, you have to derive it through a series of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In CNF, all the rules are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT. Terminals don't have rules. So 't79' is a terminal, so to generate 't79', there must be a rule somewhere where a non-terminal directly equals 't79'. But looking through the rules, the only NT that has terminal symbols is NT94 \u2192 't77', NT95 \u2192 't27', etc. However, 't79' isn't directly a terminal of any NT production.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some lines end with a number but not a 't'. Let me list them again to check for 't79' as a terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all rules, I notice NT79 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n\nNT80 \u2192 NT39 NT28\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93 and other NT9 something.\n\nWait, here's one: NT39 \u2192 't58'\n\nAnother: NT46 \u2192 't28'\n\nBut I don't see any rule where a NT ends up being a single 't79'. So perhaps the string is not in the language because 't79' can't be generated by any rule.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe 't79' is generated through a chain of productions. For example, if NT79 generates 't67' and 't73', then where does 't67' come from?\n\nLooking for 't79': To have 't79' in the string, there must be a production that results in 't79' as a terminal. But none of the NT rules directly result in 't79' as a terminal. So, maybe the string cannot be generated, hence the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to re-examine. Let's see: NT79 \u2192 NT67 NT73, and both NT67 and NT73 might be terminals or other NTs.\n\nLooking at NT67: I see that NT67 \u2192 't53' which is a terminal. Similarly, NT73 \u2192 't25'.\n\nSo, NT67 \u2192 't53', which is a terminal; NT73 \u2192 't25', a terminal. Therefore, NT79 would produce 't53' 't25' when it's expanded. But in the string, the first part is 't79 t53 t83...'.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. So, since the string starts with 't79', which isn't an output of any NTs as per the rules, it's impossible for 't79' to be part of the string generated by this grammar.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the string starts with a production that leads to 't79'. Since the only place 't79' appears is in NT65\u2192 NT38 NT84, but no NT produces 't79' directly. Moreover, other NTs like NT95, NT46, etc., don't produce 't79'.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with 't79', which isn't a terminal production in the given grammar rules.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar provided. It looks like the non-terminals are all combinations of two digits, like NTxx, except for S which is the start symbol. The production rules are either of the form NTxx -> NTyy NTzz or NTxx -> 't' followed by a number, which I believe are terminal symbols.\n\nLet me list out the production rules for clarity. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT6 NT58. So the first step is to see how S can produce the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t53 t53 t27 t8 t96 t4 t9 t28 t87 t68 t49 t63 t3 t46 t77 t7 t63 t7 t27 t84 t96 t39 t53 t68 t40 t22 t63 t12 t44 t9 t96 t9 t26 t4 t53 t14 t36 t8 t28 t3 t9 t96 t63.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. So, every production in the grammar is of the form NTij -> NTkm NTln or NTij -> tX.\n\nI realize that the string only contains terminal symbols, which are the tXXXX strings. So I need to trace back from the string to see if it can be generated by applying the production rules in reverse.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT6 NT58. So the string must begin with t from NT6 and t from NT58, but in this case, the string starts with t53 twice, which doesn't immediately align with NT6 or NT58.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each NT to their productions. Let me see:\n\nNT6 can produce t73 (from NT6 -> t73) or split into NT73 and NT62 (since NT6 -> NT73 NT62). Similarly, NT58 can produce t46 (from NT58 -> t46) or split into NT56 and NT38 (since NT58 -> NT56 NT38).\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t53 t53 t27 t8 t96 t4 t9 t28 t87 t68 t49 t63 t3 t46 t77 t7 t63 t7 t27 t84 t96 t39 t53 t68 t40 t22 t63 t12 t44 t9 t96 t9 t26 t4 t53 t14 t36 t8 t28 t3 t9 t96 t63.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t53 t53, which would imply that somewhere, there are two consecutive t53s. Let's see if any NTs produce t53. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t53. So maybe t53 is from a split production.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. The productions that start with 't' are:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9'\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't16'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n- NT15 -> 't94'\n- NT69 -> 't67'\n- NT46 -> 't28'\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT36 -> 't64'\n- NT56 -> 't72'\n- NT69 -> 't13'\n- NT87 -> 't98'\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n- NT38 -> 't68'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT39 -> 't58'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT34 -> 't36'\n- NT58 -> 't46'\n- NT44 -> 't83'\n- NT55 -> 't92'\n- NT39 -> 't63'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> 't84'\n- NT80 -> 't22'\n- NT38 -> 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT8 -> 't12'\n- NT74 -> 't77'\n- NT84 -> 't40'\n- NT39 -> 't26'\n- NT27 -> 't7'\n- NT62 -> 't97'\n- NT85 -> 't76'\n- NT93 -> 't95'\n- NT85 -> 't58'\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n\nAh, here it is.

{"custom_id":"request-824","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. Also, the start symbol is S, right? Looking at the grammar, S starts by producing NT6 and NT58. So S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nNext, each non-terminal eventually produces a terminal, like 't' followed by some number, or sometimes a single 't' without a number, which I think is just 't'. So each production in the grammar seems to eventually terminate into a terminal string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t55 t92 t55 t97 t92 t40 t26 t13 t83 t96 t4 t46 t87 t14 t7 t44 t96 t13 t92 t72 t87 t96 t39 t22 t4 t9 t76 t72 t40 t40 t14 t4 t49 t95 t46 t94 t63 t16 t3 t40 t46 t58 t95`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each step in the derivation would involve replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until we reach terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parse reduces the number of non-terminals, but I'm more concerned with the end result.\n\nBut maybe instead of trying to parse the entire string, I can check if each token in the string is directly produced by some non-terminal. That is, for each 't' number, there should be a production where the non-terminal directly expands into that 't' number.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can list some productions:\n\n- S -> NT6 NT58\n- NT74 -> NT9 NT66\n- NT63 -> NT94 NT22\n- And many others...\n- Some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT95 -> NT96, which seems to produce 't67' and 't14' (wait, no, looking at the productions, NT95 goes to 't14' through NT2, which then goes to 't70' and 't46', which then produce 't46'? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking closer, the productions end in terminals for some non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT95 -> NT96\n- NT77 is 't55' (I think)\nWait, the terminal productions are a bit spread out. Let me see:\n\nThe terminal replacements are:\n\nNT95 -> t94 (from NT94 -> 't77', but wait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT94 -> 't77' (so NT94 produces t77)\n\nSimilarly, NT73 -> t25, NT79 -> t16, etc.\n\nSo each production like NT95 -> NT96 would mean that NT96 is further expanded into a terminal. So for the string, each token must be the result of a path through non-terminals that eventually produce that token.\n\nSo, for each token in the string, it must correspond to a non-terminal's production that can terminate into that 't' number.\n\nLet me make a list of the token numbers in the string:\n\n55,92,55,97,92,40,26,13,83,96,4,46,87,14,7,44,96,13,92,72,87,96,39,22,4,9,76,72,40,40,14,4,49,95,46,94,63,16,3,40,46,58,95.\n\nWait, let me check which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nI think it's better to create a mapping of non-terminals to their terminal expansions, based on the given productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, in the grammar, each production is A -> BC or A -> 't' or A -> a single 't' perhaps? Wait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals are directly attached to terminals, but those are only those where they have rules like NT94 -> 't77', meaning NT94 directly expands to 't77'. Similarly:\n\n- NT95 -> 't94'?\nWait, looking again, let's parse through each production:\n\n- NT95 -> NT9 NT69: So NT95 becomes NT9 and NT69. Both are non-terminals. But NT9 eventually is 't26' from NT9 -> 't26', so that's part of it.\n\nWait, no, the NT95 -> NT9 NT69 is a production in the grammar, meaning NT95 is followed by NT9 and NT69. But to get the terminal, that path must terminate into the correct t. Let me find which non-terminals eventually end in terminals.\n\nI think the key is to build a mapping from non-terminals to the terminals they can produce. For example, NT95 may have a path that leads to t94, etc. Alternatively, since the grammar is given, perhaps each non-terminal has a fixed terminal it can expand into.\n\nLooking at the given productions, I can see that some non-terminals do not have productions. For example, NT94 is a non-terminal, and one of its productions is NT94 -> 't77'. So NT94 directly produces t77.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 -> 't25', so NT73 produces 25.\n\nBut many non-terminals have productions that involve other non-terminals. So for example, NT14 -> 't79', and 't83' comes from NT83. So on.\n\nWait, maybe I can map each non-terminal to its possible terminal. Let me try to list each non-terminal and see which terminal(s) it can expand into.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT95 -> NT96 (so NT95 must have a path to NT96, which then must expand to 't..'\n- Wait, NT95's other production is not listed except for the one you showed. Wait, let me look again:\n\nWait, the list of productions:\n\nNT95 -> NT9 NT69 (line 4)\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nFirst line: S->NT6NT58\nThen NT74 -> NT9NT66\nNT63 -> NT94NT22\nNT95 -> NT9NT69 (line 4)\nSimilarly:\nNT9 -> NT68NT40\nNT40 -> NT69NT17 (line 14)\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, but some non-terminals might not have a direct production to terminal, but instead expand into other non-terminals. So, to determine if the string ends in all terminals, each non-terminal in the derivation must have a way to reach a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-terminals in the grammar eventually map to specific 't' strings. So each token in the string must be the result of a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nSo for each 't' in the string, is there a non-terminal that can directly produce that 't'? Let's check:\n\nLooking for each token, say 55:\n\nDoes a non-terminal have a production to t55? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT77's production is NT77: T77 (it's on line 74: NT77 -> 't77'). So NT77 -> 't77' which is token 77.\n\nSimilarly, NT95's production is NT95 -> NT9 and NT69 (line 4), NT95 also has another production: NT95 -> NT2 (line 73: NT27->t4, line 74: NT77->t77). Wait, no, NT27's expansion is 't4' and NT2's expansion is 't9' (from line 3: NT2-> NT74 or 't9' [line 52: NT2 -> 't9').\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go through each token in the string and see if there's a path in the grammar that can produce it. Let's take the first token, 't55'.\n\nLooking at the productions, to get 't55', I'm looking for a non-terminal that can directly produce 't55' or can produce a string that includes 't55'. So, for example, if a non-terminal expands into 't10 t55', then 't55' is acceptable.\n\nBut looking through the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-850","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm presented with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has several production rules, and the string provided is a sequence of tokens like 't49', 't77', etc. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given rules, I see that many non-terminals are producing two non-terminals, but some end up producing terminals directly. For example, rule NT2 \u2192 't6' and NT9 \u2192 't26'. These are terminal productions, meaning those non-terminals correspond to single terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t49 t92 t68 t79 t58 t40 t82 t82 t44 t74 t12 t46 t4 t63 t4 t25 t63 t94 t7 t98 t83 t49 t4 t7 t96 t96 t28 t13 t98 t82 t46 t44 t94 t63 t36 t74 t36 t58 t55 t16 t95 t16 t87 t53`.\n\nMy first thought is to parse the string from left to right, starting from the start symbol S. Since S \u2192 NT6 NT58 (as per the initial rule S -> NT6 NT58), the entire string must be generated by expanding NT6 and NT58. So, the string can be divided into two parts: the expansion starting with NT6 (which should generate the first few tokens) and NT58 (generating the rest). \n\nBut wait, looking closer, the initial production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and each of these is a non-terminal. So, each NT6 and NT58 will generate a sequence of tokens. Therefore, the entire string must be a combination of the two derived strings from NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, first I'll check if the string starts with the tokens generated by NT6, followed by those from NT58.\n\nStarting with NT6. I know that NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So, I can replace NT6 with NT73 NT62. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded.\n\nNT73 has a production rule. Looking through the rules: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT7. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. Yes, because in the given rules, NT78 is listed as something else, and NT73 is in the list. Wait, let me check:\n\nNT73's rule is: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. Correct.\n\nSo, NT73 expands to NT8 and NT9. Now, I need to process each.\n\nNT8's production: Looking through the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 NT12 NT11. Wait, actually, in the given rules, I see NT85 \u2192 NT83 NT56? No, wait, I see NT74 is in the initial rules.\n\nWait, I think I need to go step by step.\n\nWait, let me list all the rules to keep track:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 [checking] I see no directly stated rule for NT8. Let me go through all rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\n- NT8 \u2192 looking through the rules, I don't see NT8 being defined as anything except in later rules.\n\nWait, rule 17: NT73 \u2192 't25'? No, actually, no. Rule 17 is NT85 \u2192 NT87 NT55. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the rules are listed, and each line starts with the non-terminal on the left. So, the rules for NT8 would be:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT87 NT66\n\nWait, I'm looking for NT8.\n\nWait, let me check again. It seems that NT8 isn't directly an intermediate, but from the rules, I see that NT74 is a terminal, which is 't77'. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, checking the rules, I see that NT2 has a production: NT2 \u2192 't6' and also NT2 \u2192 't70' (from line 15? Let's see the given list:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nline 24: NT2 \u2192 't6'\n\nline 15: is there a NT2 \u2192 't70' line? Let me check the rules as provided:\n\nThe user provided a long list. Let me go through each line and check for NT8.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT29 is not present, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake. I need to scan all the rules to find for NT8.\n\nLooking for NT8 in the rules:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- Line 14: NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69\n\n- Line 16: NT19 \u2192 NT37 NT69\n\n- Line 17: NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84\n\nWait, line 17: NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84\n\nNo, so NT65 is defined as NT38 NT84.\n\nBut I'm looking for NT8's production. Wait, in the first rule, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, then NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nSo, the first rule is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which becomes NT73 NT62 NT58.\n\nNow, I need to expand NT73, NT62, and NT58.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, so that's two non-terminals.\n\nNow, for NT8: Looking for any rule where the left-hand side is NT8. Scanning the rules:\n\nLooking through each line, I don't see any rule where NT8 is on the left. For example, line 12: NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93, but that's a different NT84.\n\nWait, am I missing it? Let me read all the rules again:\n\nLooking through lines, perhaps NT8 isn't directly produced. Wait, line 24: NT2 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I have to see if NT8 can be derived from other rules, but perhaps I'm not considering the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I need to think recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this by trying to parse the string backward, since the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT58. So the entire string must be a combination of the strings generated by NT6 and NT58. So, the string can be split into two parts: the first few tokens are from NT6's expansion, and the rest are from NT58.\n\nSo, I need to see if the entire string can be divided into two parts, the first part being generated by NT6, and the second by NT58.\n\nWait, but how many tokens does S produce? Each non-terminal may generate one or more tokens. The problem is that I don't know the exact breakdown, so perhaps a better approach is to model this as the entire string must be exactly the concatenation of the string from NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, let's denote that the string is s = s1 s2, where s1 is generated by NT6, and s2 by NT58.\n\nSo, first, let's check if s can be partitioned into s1 and s2 such that s1 is a string from NT6 and s2 from NT58.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 can be expanded to NT2 -> 't12'? Wait, no: from the rules, looking for NT58.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT58's production is:\n\nLooking through the rules, line 46: NT46 \u2192 NT87 NT66\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps I need to find the expansions for each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to parse the string from the end, using the reverse approach, since the grammar is Chomsky normal form, which is suitable for reduction.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the number of symbols in each production.\n\nSince it's a binary grammar (each non-terminal produces two non-terminals or terminals), the number of symbols should match.\n\nWait, the initial string has 60 symbols. Starting from S, which produces two non-terminals, each subsequent step replaces each non-terminal with two others, so the number of symbols could increase exponentially. But in this case, it's possible to have a specific way.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's simpler to check the counts.

{"custom_id":"request-844","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal (like NTx -> 't9'), which is correct for CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t74 t39 t87 t9 t67 t36 t70 t67 t84 t70 t49 t40 t74 t96 t77 t6 t3 t39 t67 t87 t68 t36 t98 t76 t87 t82 t79 t94 t74 t7 t6 t46 t28 t74 t9 t8 t16 t3 t53 t44 t58 t63 t7 t79.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse this string using the grammar. Parsing in CNF is usually done with a top-down approach, like using the CYK algorithm or recursive descent. But since the string is long, it might be challenging to do manually, so perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me look for the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string must start with NT6 and then NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t74 t39 t87 t9 t67 t36 t70 t67 t84 t70 t49 t40 t74 t96 t77 t6 t3 t39 t67 t87 t68 t36 t98 t76 t87 t82 t79 t94 t74 t7 t6 t46 t28 t74 t9 t8 t16 t3 t53 t44 t58 t63 t7 t79.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t74. So according to S \u2192 NT6 NT58, the first non-terminal is NT6. Let's check what NT6 produces. Looking through the grammar for NT6: it produces NT73 NT62. So NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNow, looking at the string, after t74 comes t39. Wait, let's see: t74 t39 t87... Hmm, maybe I need to parse larger chunks first. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to break down the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be reduced by the grammar. Starting from S, which becomes NT6 NT58. So the first step is to split the string into parts corresponding to NT6 and NT58.\n\nBut the string's first symbol is t74, which could be part of a production for NT73 or NT6, depending on the grammar. Let me check NT73 and NT6 in the grammar.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. So that's another two non-terminals. Let me check what NT8 \u2192 't12' (since looking through the productions, I see NT8 \u2192 't12'). So if I have NT8 \u2192 t12, then that part would consume t12.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t74, so perhaps we need to split the string into parts that are produced by each NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the end of the string to see if it can be reduced. That might be another way to approach it.\n\nWait, the string ends with t79. Let me look for the production that has 't79' as the terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see NT79 \u2192 't67' or 't27'. Wait, no, looking through the productions: \n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT79 can appear as part of NT36 \u2192 't64', or NT69 \u2192 't67', but 't79' is another terminal; perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't83'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT79 \u2192 't26'? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, going through the productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', 't6', etc. Maybe I should make a list of all the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can trace through the string step by step.\n\nAnother method is to start from the beginning and see if I can match any productions.\n\nThe first symbol is t74. So looking for productions that start with t74. From the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t74? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t12\n- NT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', 't6', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87'\n- NT28 \u2192 't49'\n- NT74 \u2192 t77\n- NT77 is a terminal, no, wait: looking through the productions, I see NT77 isn't present, except in NT27 \u2192 't4', etc. Wait, perhaps the NT74 \u2192 't77' is correct.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, the one that has t74 as output is NT28 \u2192 't49', and NT74's production is not present. Wait, no, looking at the list:\n\nWait, the grammar includes:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT28 NT73. So it's a production rule, but the right-hand side is non-terminals. So t74 doesn't appear as a terminal in any production from a non-terminal. It seems that t74 is a terminal. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem is presented as a string of terminals and non-terminals? No, in typical CFGs, variables are non-terminals, and symbols like 't' are terminals. So in the string provided, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. And the others are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully at the productions, for example, NT74 \u2192 NT28 NT73. So that's a production of NT74 producing two non-terminals.\n\nSo in the string, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So 't74' is a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, to find which non-terminals produce t74 as a terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9: if NT8 produces a terminal, what does it produce? Looking for NT8's production: NT8 \u2192 't12', yes. And NT9 \u2192 't26'. So NT73 would produce 't12 t26'. But in the string, after t74, it's t39, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the beginning and try to parse the string.\n\nThe string starts with t74. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce t74.\n\nLooking for a production where a non-terminal X \u2192 t74 a or similar. Wait, looking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal producing t74 directly as a terminal. All the non-terminals seem to have other non-terminals on the RHS or sometimes a terminal plus a non-terminal, like NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84, but 38 is a non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me recount the productions:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list out all the non-terminals:\n\nThe non-terminals are all the NT followed by a number. Let me list them:\n\nNT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9, NT15, NT16, NT22, NT27, NT34, NT36, NT39, NT40, NT44, NT46, NT50, NT55, NT56, NT58, NT59, NT62, NT63, NT65, NT67, NT68, NT69, NT73, NT74, NT77, NT78, NT79, NT84, NT85, NT87, NT88 (I think?), etc.\n\nNow, for each of these, their productions are given.\n\nEach production is either something like NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 a terminal.\n\nSo in the given grammar, let's see which non-terminals have terminal symbols in their productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-869","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it makes parsing easier. Let me start by understanding both the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has a set of production rules starting from S and various NT rules (like NT6, NT74, etc.) that eventually produce terminal symbols (like 't9', 't77', etc.). My string is a sequence of these terminals. \n\nFirst, let's note that the initial symbol S must derive the entire string. So, S should expand to produce NT6 NT58, according to the rule S -> NT6 NT58. Then, each NT6 and NT58 must expand further through the productions until all symbols are terminals.\n\nI see that each NT production has two non-terminals on the right side. The string we're evaluating is a list of terminals, so each step in the derivation must replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until the entire expansion leads to the given string of terminals.\n\nLet me write down the string again to visualize it:\n\nt9 t3 t92 t98 t12 t9 t68 t96 t4 t49 t82 t82 t64 t82 t9 t14 t83 t25 t84 t12 t77 t58 t14 t6 t46 t26 t98 t26 t70 t14 t94 t36 t16 t27 t97 t98 t67 t3 t79 t26 t96 t28 t67 t14 t58.\n\nThat's quite long, 44 terminals. Each production step doubles the number of non-terminals, except when a non-terminal can produce a terminal. So, the derivation will involve a binary tree of expansions.\n\nLet's try to work backwards or maybe look for key points in the string. For example, looking at the first symbol 't9'. I need to find which production rules end with 't9'. Looking through the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT40\n- NT40 -> NT69 NT17\n- NT69 -> NT67 NT62\n- NT67 -> NT53 NT79\n- NT62 -> NT84 NT97\n- NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n- NT34 -> NT58 NT65\n- NT65 -> NT82 NT82\n- NT82 -> NT9 NT14\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT40\n- NT40 -> NT69 NT17\n- And so on. Hmm, this seems complex. Maybe it's better to see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reconstruct the parse tree starting from the first symbol 't9'. Let's see.\n\nThe first symbol is 't9'. Let's find a production whose right-hand side has the first part as 't9'. Looking at NT9: NT9 -> NT68 NT40. Neither NT68 nor NT40 produce 't9'. Wait, looking at the rules, NT95 is NT27 NT66, which doesn't help. \n\nWait, maybe it's another NT. Let me check all NTs that perhaps can derive to 't9' eventually. Let's go through each NT:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, most of them eventually end in terminals. Let's pick a few to see how they resolve:\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66. NT27 is 't4', as per the rule NT27 -> 't4'. So that doesn't help because NT27 is a terminal, but NT66 is NT66 -> 't67'. So NT95 can't produce 't9'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently. The string starts with 't9', so we need some NT that can derive to 't9' via some steps. Let's check which NT productions have a terminal 't9' on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\nNone of these start with 't9', except maybe looking for 't9' as a terminal in any step.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from S and recursively expanding, ensuring that the first two symbols match NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, the string starts with t9 t3... So if S -> NT6 NT58, then the first step is to produce NT6 and NT58. So the string must start with what NT6 and NT58 produce. But in the given string, the first symbol is t9, which is the first symbol of NT6's expansion?\n\nWait, let's look at the production rules:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nSo, the first two symbols of the string must be part of the expansions of NT6 and NT58.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't9', which would be the first symbol of the expansion of NT6. Looking at NT6's production:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nBoth NT73 and NT62 are non-terminals. Let me see where they produce:\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9\n\nSo NT73 expands to NT8 and NT9. Now, NT8 is 't12' according to the rule NT8 -> 't12'. So NT73 produces \"t12\" followed by whatever NT9 produces.\n\nWait, NT9 -> NT68 NT40, and NT68 is 't73' (since NT68 -> 't73'), and NT40 -> NT69 NT17. So NT40 produces 't69' and 't17' in the expansion. But this seems off because NT73 is supposed to produce 't12' followed by 't73' and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me try to see if the string can be broken down in terms of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to check if the given string is a valid sentential form of the grammar, i.e., it can be derived by expanding S into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, ending in all terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to simulate a top-down parser, starting from S and seeing if we can generate the string.\n\nGiven the string length is 44, it must be 2^k -1 steps for k being the depth. 2^6 -1 is 63, so 44 is within that, but top-down parsing can handle this.\n\nLet me start by trying to see if the first symbol 't9' can be produced by some NT. Looking through the NTs, for example, NT9 -> NT68 NT40, which eventually produces 't68' and 't40'. Wait, but 't9' is a terminal that some NT might produce. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules:\n\nNT95 -> 't27' 't66'\n\nNT27 -> 't4'\n\nSo that's not 't9'.\n\nWait, maybe NT2? Let me check NT2's production: NT2 -> 't44' 't14'.\n\nWait, looking through all the terminal rules, I see NT2 -> 't9' according to the rule NT2 -> 't9'. Wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, let's see all the terminal rules:\n\nNT2 -> 't9'? Yes, one of the rules is NT2 -> 't9'. Similarly, NT4 -> 't76'?

{"custom_id":"request-886","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or a terminal symbol (like a leaf). So all right, the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't12', 't84', etc. \n\nFirst, I need to map each of these terminal symbols to their corresponding non-terminal symbols. Looking at the grammar, each terminal is mapped under the non-terminals. For example, NT74\u2192't77'. So I can make a list to map each terminal to its non-terminal and the corresponding 't' value.\n\nLet me write down the mappings for each terminal in the string to see if it's present in the grammar:\n\nString: t12 t84 t55 t3 t55 t64 t14 t74 t39 t27 t39 t13 t8 t39 t76 t53 t16 t97 t36 t3 t13 t8 t82 t4 t98 t82 t74 t79 t76 t46 t6 t84 t95 t27 t76 t67 t13 t16 t64 t14 t67 t7 t40 t27 t6 t22.\n\nSo each 'tX' corresponds to a non-terminal that produces this 'tX'. Let's list them:\n\nt12 \u2192 NT44 (as per NT44\u2192't83'? Wait, I might be mixing up the numbers. Wait, no, the grammar has lines like 'NT44\u2192t83' which means NT44 leads to 't83'. But in the string, I have 't12', so I need to find which non-terminal produces 't12'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't87' \nNT36 \u2192 't64'\nNT56 \u2192 't72'\nNT96 \u2192 't12'\nWait, looking at the grammar, there's NT34 \u2192 t36, NT15 \u2192 t94, NT82 \u2192 t12 yes, NT82 is one of the non-terminals producing 't12'. So NT82 \u2192 't12'.\n\nSo, let's make a list of non-terminals for each tX in the string:\n\nt12: NT82\nt84: NT93 (from NT93\u2192't95'? Wait, looking up, NT93 is mapped to 't95' and 't93'? Wait, no, the grammar has lines like:\n\nLooking for t84: search each production for the terminal t84.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT40 \u2192 't74' and 't83' (looks like a typo, maybe NT40 produces 't74' and another t? Or wait, let's check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar lines seem a bit confusing. Let me scan for any NT that leads to t84.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't83'? No, wait:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLine: NT58 -> 't46' (so NT58 leads to 't46'), NT40 leads to 't83' and another 't...?\n\nWait, actually, I notice that the grammar has some rules that might not be clearly written, but perhaps it's better to go step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I should cross-reference each 'tX' in the string with the grammar to find the corresponding NT.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be derived by the grammar. Each 'tX' must come from an NT with a production rule that includes 'tX'. So let's check each 'tX' to see which NT it's linked to.\n\nt12: I see that NT82 \u2192 t12 (from earlier) as per the grammar: NT82 is present and its production is likely 't12' as per the line NT82 -> 't12' elsewhere.\n\nt84: Looking for a non-terminal that produces t84. I see in the grammar, NT84 has several productions, one of which is NT84 \u2192 't34'? Or wait, line: NT84 \u2192 't40' (I think I might be misunderstanding, let's recheck. Looking for 't84' in the grammar.\n\nWait, here's a line: NT34 -> t36 (from NT34's productions). NT6 -> t73, etc. Hmm, maybe it's taking too long. Perhaps it's better to create a list of NT for each 'tX' in the string.\n\nBut maybe I can approach this by considering that the string is a sequence of t values, each derived from an NT, so each t must be the result of a production step.\n\nGiven the string, each t is part of the derivation, so for each t, we need to find the NT that produces it, and then check if that NT can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into chunks corresponding to NT productions.\n\nWait, the string is: t12 t84 t55 t3 t55 t64 t14 t74 t39 t27 t39 t13 t8 t39 t76 t53 t16 t97 t36 t3 t13 t8 t82 t4 t98 t82 t74 t79 t76 t46 t6 t84 t95 t27 t76 t67 t13 t16 t64 t14 t67 t7 t40 t27 t6 t22.\n\nEach tX is a terminal, so each corresponds to a production rule of an NT. Therefore, the string must be a sequence where each element is a terminal derived from some NT.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form NT->T1 T2, where each T1 and T2 are NTs or terminals. So the string is built by replacing each NT with its terminals.\n\nSo, to parse this, the string should be a sequence of terminals that can be generated by the grammar through expanding NTs. Each step in the derivation replaces an NT with two terminals or two NTs, and so on.\n\nBut parsing this directly is time-consuming, but perhaps I can check for the presence of each NT in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a list and try to map each part to a non-terminal.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to see if all the tX values correspond to NT productions. Let me check each 'tX' in the string.\n\nt12 \u2192 NT82 (from the line: NT82\u2192t12)\nt84 \u2192 NT93 (from the line: NT93\u2192t95, no, wait.

Wait, wait: the grammar as provided has lines like:\n\nLooking for 't84':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT84 produces 't34' \u2192 no, that would be NT84 \u2192 t34.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps I should list each terminal and see which NT produces them.\n\nLet's create a list for each terminal and their NT:\n\nt12 \u2192 NT82\nt13 \u2192 NT22\nt16 \u2192 NT79 or NT94\nt22 \u2192 NT22\nt27 \u2192 NT27\nt3 \u2192 NT97\nt39 \u2192 NT39\nt4 \u2192 NT84 (since NT84-> t40?

{"custom_id":"request-883","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar and makes certain parsing techniques easier.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see it's in CNF because each rule on the left side of the arrow has exactly one non-terminal, and the right side can have either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 is a CNF production since NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals. Another example is NT9 \u2192 t44, which is a terminal symbol, also fitting CNF.\n\nNow, the string provided is: \nt44 t25 t68 t98 t79 t16 t44 t64 t92 t97 t13 t27 t44 t8 t16 t16 t87 t39 t58 t55 t28 t4 t13 t79 t27 t27 t13 t53 t53 t82 t12 t77 t55 t49 t13 t9 t4 t98 t25 t94 t13 t55 t4 t72 t63.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation introduces exactly one terminal symbol (unless it's a non-terminal at the end, but in that case, we stop after production). Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, during a leftmost derivation, each step would replace a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut given that the string is a sequence of terminals, the process of parsing would involve decomposing the string into a sequence of production rules. Each production rule corresponds to a part of the string.\n\nGiven that CNF grammars can be parsed efficiently using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just supposed to determine yes or no, maybe I can approach this differently.\n\nLet me think: Each terminal in the string must correspond to the right-hand side of a production. Since each production in CNF is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, the string can be thought of as a sequence where certain symbols are terminals, while others contribute non-terminals that would require further expansion.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is entirely made up of terminals. So, all the production rules used in the derivation must result in terminals at the end. So, each step in the derivation path for this string must expand non-terminals until only terminals are left, forming the string.\n\nBut the problem is, with so many terminals, it's going to involve many steps. Maybe I can find the root of the grammar, which is S, and see if S can generate the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S can only expand into NT6 and NT58. Therefore, any string generated by S must start with NT6 and NT58, which both expand into two parts.\n\nLooking at the string, the beginning is t44 t25. Let's look at the rules for NT6 and NT58.\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\nWait, but NT6 is in the production of S. So S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so NT6 and NT58 must expand into something that, when combined, start the string with t44 t25...\n\nWait, let's get the rules for NT6 and NT58.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT6:\nLooking through the lines:\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nWait, that's right. So NT6 expands to NT73 and NT62.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the lines, NT6 is defined as NT73 NT62.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT58:\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\nFrom the list, yes, line NT58: NT84 NT9. No, wait, I think I misread. Let me find it carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar entries are listed, so for NT58, let's look:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9 (I think that's line NT58: 'NT58 -> NT84 NT9')\n\nBut looking again, perhaps it's the reverse. Let me check each production.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking for 'NT58', I see:\n\nYes, according to the list provided, near the top:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nThen, looking for 'NT58' elsewhere:\n\nWait, towards the end of the list, I see:\n\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9\n\nYes, that's line 58 in the provided grammar.\n\nSo, NT58 expands to NT84 and NT9.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 would expand to NT6 and NT58. NT6's production is NT73 and NT62.\n\nSo, when we start with S, the first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nThen, NT6 expands to NT73 and NT62.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT73, then NT62, then NT58.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t44 t25, so I need to see what the first productions produce.\n\nWait, each non-terminal produces two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So, when S \u2192 NT6 NT58, then NT6 and NT58 must further expand into more symbols.\n\nWait, but in this case, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work backwards from the string, trying to parse it using the productions.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, each part of the string must correspond to a production in the grammar that ends in a terminal.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, when parsing, at each step, you consume a terminal and try to match it to a production's right-hand side.\n\nBut that's perhaps more complicated. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me think about how the grammar can generate terminals. Each production either introduces two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nSo, in order for the entire string to be generated, every step must eventually lead to all non-terminals becoming terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should see if each symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal's single production rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look up the symbols that each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLet's try to see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal has a production that may result in terminals.\n\nFor example, NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65.\n\nWait, but how do I get from NT58 and NT65 to terminals?\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93, and so on. Wait, this seems recursive and could get complicated quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal can only expand into a terminal in one step or through some steps.\n\nWait, but each production in the grammar is in CNF, so production is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the productions can be A \u2192 a, A \u2192 BC, but in the provided grammar, I think all the productions are in the form where the right-hand side is either two non-terminals, but in this case, it's not. Wait, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, checking the list again:\n\nFor example, line 1: S->NT6 NT58: that's two non-terminals.\n\nLine 2: NT74 -> NT9 NT66: two non-terminals.\n\nLine3: NT63 -> NT94 NT22: two non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait a minute, looking at all the lines:\n\nIt seems that all the productions on the right side are two non-terminals except for a few.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. The string provided is a sequence of terminals made up of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the grammar's initial symbol is. From the rules, the start symbol is S, which has the production S -> NT6 NT58. So the first part of the derivation starts with NT6 and NT58. \n\nNow, looking at the string: the first token is 't58'. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT58 is defined as NT84 NT9. So in the grammar, NT58 is replaced by two non-terminals. But in the string, 't58' is a terminal. So how does that work?\n\nWait, in the context of Chomsky Normal Form, when you have a production like A -> BC, then during parsing, each of B and C can be processed in steps. So in this case, the first token in the string is 't58', which corresponds to NT58, which is replaced by NT84 and NT9. So in the derivation, the string would start with NT84 NT9, but those are non-terminals and will be further replaced.\n\nI think I need to parse the entire string step by step to see if it can be fully derived according to the grammar. The process would involve replacing non-terminals with their right-hand sides until we reach the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in reverse. Starting from the string and trying to see if it can be reduced to S by applying the inverse of the productions. That is, each production in the grammar can be reversed, and we try to reduce the string by applying these reversed steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each has two non-terminals except for cases where it's a terminal production (like S -> NT97, wait no, looking again, S is NT6 NT58, and others like NT73 are 't25'. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT22 is written as NT22 -> 't87' for example. So some non-terminals produce terminals. But NT58 is a combination, as NT58 -> NT84 NT9. So how does that reconcile?\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-905","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit new to context-free grammars (CFGs) and Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), so I might need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals, and the start symbol can also be a production with two non-terminals. But looking more closely, some productions like S -> NT6 NT58 have two non-terminals, others like NT2 -> 't9' have a terminal and a non-terminal, which doesn't fit CNF. Hmm, maybe I misread because I know that in CNF, all productions (except perhaps the start) must be to two non-terminals. Since S is the start symbol, it's allowed to have two non-terminals. But if other productions have a terminal and a non-terminal, it's not CNF. Wait, but the initial statement says it's in CNF, so perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe in this grammar, some productions are allowed to have a terminal and a non-terminal, but that's not standard CNF. Anyway, I'll proceed assuming the grammar as presented is in CNF, maybe it's okay because the problem says it's in CNF.\n\nSo the goal is to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a series of terminals: `t58 t26 t92 t9 t27 t12 t53 t16 t84 t77 t92 t97 t64 t13 t83 t12 t64 t53 t3 t55 t40 t72 t64 t98 t4 t76 t84 t13 t96 t94 t67 t94 t94 t46 t72 t79 t22 t83 t46 t53 t74 t4 t6 t53 t8 t77 t36`.\n\nI think the standard approach here is to perform a parse tree check using the CYK algorithm. That's a dynamic programming algorithm designed to parse strings in CNF grammars efficiently. Let me recall how CYK works.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell represents a substring of the string and determines which non-terminals can generate that substring. It starts by initializing the table with single terminals and then builds up larger substrings by combining smaller ones.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, maybe 35 terms, doing this manually would be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can look for patterns or rules that cover the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t58. Let's see what rules produce t58.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production NT58 must be a non-terminal that can produce t58. Let's check the productions for NT58:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT58 -> t46\n\nWait, that's inconsistent because in CNF, a production like NT58 -> t46 is not allowed, because in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. However, looking at the given grammar, I notice some productions involve terminals. For example, NT2 -> 't9', which suggests that these are the terminal symbols. So in this grammar, some non-terminals produce a single terminal and possibly another non-terminal. Wait, but wait, in CNF, all productions must have two non-terminals. If a production has a terminal on the right-hand side, that would break the CNF rule. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, most seem to be of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, but some have terminal and non-terminal, e.g., NT2 -> 't9'. So perhaps this is not a proper CNF, but the problem states it is, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the grammar is given as being in CNF, so perhaps the presence of terminals on RHS is allowed as a special case? Or perhaps it's a mix of left-disjoint and other forms, but I think that's not how CNF works. So I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should proceed assuming that terminals can appear on the RHS, perhaps the grammar is in a form that's sometimes called weakly Chomsky Normal Form or something else. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nSo, back to NT58: looking for any production that can produce t58. From the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at NT58's productions:\n\nThe production at the bottom of the list shows:\n\nNT58 -> t53\n\nWait, let me search through all the rules. Here's the list:\n\nLooking through all the rules for NT58:\n\nLooking at the full list of productions starting with NT58 (or any NTX), perhaps I missed NT58's rules. Let me scan through all the productions:\n\nI don't see NT58 being on the left of any production, except perhaps if I missed. Wait, in the initial grammar, it's written as:\n\nProduction: S -> NT6 NT58\n\nSo that's the only rule starting with NT58. Now, then, looking for what NT58 produces.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, here's what I see:\n\n- NT58 is not the LHS of any production except in the case of S. So wait, maybe I missed some. Wait, perhaps I should list all the LHS and their RHS:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT74 -> NT9 NT66\n\nNT63 -> NT94 NT22\n\nNT95 -> NT9 NT69\n\nNT19 -> NT37 NT69\n\nNT65 -> NT38 NT84\n\nNT14 -> NT59 NT15\n\nNT50 -> NT93 NT6\n\nNT78 -> NT67 NT73\n\nNT56 -> NT9 NT19\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT40\n\nNT40 -> NT69 NT17\n\nNT34 -> NT58 NT65\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nNT36 -> NT79 NT2\n\nNT40 -> NT74 NT56\n\nNT84 -> NT34 NT93\n\nNT78 -> NT28 NT73\n\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9\n\nWait, this is an interesting point. Earlier, I thought that NT58 only appears in S, but looking further, I see:\n\nWait, line:\n\nNT34 -> NT58 NT65\n\nSo NT34 can produce NT58 and NT65. But that's not directly helpful for t58 because it's another non-terminal.\n\nWait, I'm trying to find a production for NT58 that outputs a terminal. Is there any such production? Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I don't see any NT58 on the left except for S -> NT6 NT58. So, from NT58, I don't have any rules in the grammar. That suggests that NT58 is a non-terminal, but it doesn't produce any terminal. So in the string, t58 would have to be produced by some other non-terminal that produces it.\n\nWait, no. The string has t58 as the first token, so we need a production that can directly produce t58. But looking back, I don't see any such production.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check all the rules to see if any NTX produces t58.\n\nLooking through the list, here's what I found:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is 't58' or contains t58 as a production. For example, some rules have only terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT95 -> NT9 NT69: no terminals.\n- NT2 -> 't9': so this directly produces 't9'.\n- NT40 -> NT74 NT56 and others: but no terminals.\n- NT34: produces NT58 and NT65: no terminal.\n- NT58: no production, as in no RHS listed except S.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all the productions again:\n\nLooking through the entire list, the only terminal symbols I can see are:\n\n't9', 't26', 't53', 't16', 't84', 't77', 't92', 't64', 't13', 't83', 't2', 't78', 't96', 't46', 't72', 't38', 't22', 't36', 't34'.\n\nBut none of the productions for any NT produce, say, 't58', which is the first token in the string. That suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because t58 cannot be produced by any rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and missed a rule that produces t58.

The string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, and I need to figure out if it can be derived from the given grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form structures each production rule to have exactly two non-terminals on the left side or a terminal. The given grammar uses terminals ('t' followed by numbers) and non-terminals (like S, NT74, etc.). \n\nThe goal is to parse the string to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Essentially, I need to see if starting from the start symbol S, I can apply the production rules to reach the given string. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit long with many non-terminals. The string starts with 't3'. I should check which production rule leads to 't3'. Looking through the rules, I notice one rule: NT9 -> NT68 NT40, followed by NT40 -> NT69 NT17, NT69 -> 't67', NT17 -> 't96'. Hmm, that seems complex. Alternatively, I see that NT69 -> 't67', and NT68 -> 't26'. So, NT69 is 't67', NT68 is 't26', and NT3 could be something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any 't' productions and see which non-terminals map to them. For example, looking through the rules, I see NT73 -> 't25', NT79 -> 't16', NT63 -> 't36', NT9 -> 't26', NT46 -> 't87', NT38 -> 't68', NT22 -> 't87', NT95 -> 't14', etc. So each of these non-terminals directly corresponds to a terminal string.\n\nThe string has 't3', 't40', 't46', 't3', 't87', 't92', etc. So I need to find a path for each 't' in the string.\n\nStarting with the first 't3'. Let's find which non-terminal produces 't3'. Looking through the rules, I see NT9 -> 't26' (but that's 't26', not 't3'). Oh, maybe I missed something. Wait, looking through all the end productions, none seem to have 't3' directly. Hmm, does any non-terminal expand to 't3'? Maybe I did a wrong search.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look systematically.

So NT2 can produce 't3' when one of its rules results in 't3'. Let me check the rule for NT2: the rule is NT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't3', 't44', 't83', etc. Wait, no, looking back: the rules for NT2 show that it has multiple productions, but none directly produce 't3' except in one of the rules. Wait, actually, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking back, I see in the first part of the grammar, NT2 has a rule: NT2 -> 't9' (from some earlier part), but that's not 't3'. Alternatively, another rule for NT2: Let me check the entire grammar again. Oh, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar provided:\n\nThe grammar lists all the production rules. Looking for NT2, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, several rules are listed under NT2: \n\nWait, for NT2, the rules are:\n\nNT2 -> 't9'\nNT2 -> 't70'\nNT2 -> 't36'\nNT2 -> 't44'\nNT2 -> 't83'\nWait, no, let me look again. The grammar's production rules are listed line by line, but perhaps I misread them. Wait, the grammar seems to include many rules under NT2. Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should note that 't3' is produced by some NT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step for the given string to see if it can be constructed using the grammar.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I can map out which non-terminals expand to each 't' in the string.\n\nLet's list the string again: t3 t40 t46 t3 t87 t92 t63 t95 t70 t3 t49 t4 t44 t64 t92 t87 t79 t64 t98 t27 t6 t9 t4 t67 t9 t27 t83 t92 t98 t67 t16 t14 t67 t83 t94 t40 t26 t8 t95 t4 t44 t82 t27 t9 t67 t16 t49 t22.\n\nEach 't' is followed by a number. So, for each of these, I need to find a path in the grammar to reach the respective 't' expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create a reverse mapping: for each non-terminal, list all possible terminal it can produce. Then, for each 't' in the string, check if the corresponding non-terminal can produce the given 't'.\n\nWait, that might help. Let me list all the non-terminals and their corresponding 't' values they can produce:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25' \u2192 So NT73 can produce 't25'.\n- NT79 -> 't16' \u2192 So NT79 produces 't16'.\n- NT63 -> 't36' \u2192 NT63 produces 't36'.\n- NT9 -> 't26' \u2192 NT9 produces 't26'.\n- NT46 -> 't87' \u2192 NT46 produces 't87'.\n- NT38 -> 't68' \u2192 NT38 produces 't68'.\n- NT22 -> 't87' \u2192 NT22 produces 't87'.\n- NT95 -> 't14' \u2192 NT95 produces 't14'.\n- NT2 -> Possible options: looking through the production rules for NT2.

{"custom_id":"request-931","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one terminal on the right. Wait, actually, in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, almost every production seems to be of the form like S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which is two non-terminals. There's one exception at the end: 't6' is a terminal. But others like NT2 -> 't9' etc.\n\nThe provided string is a sequence of 't's prefixed with numbers, so it's all terminals. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nNow, the grammar defines a set of non-terminals (NT) and terminals ('t' followed by numbers). Each rule splits the left symbol into two right ones until you get to terminals. The given string has a lot of elements, so maybe the grammar has a leftmost derivation or rightmost that corresponds to this.\n\nMaybe I should parse the string from the grammar's perspective, seeing if we can break it down into the production rules.\n\nLet me list the productions and their terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9'\n- NT6 -> 't73' and then broken further (but wait, NT6 -> NT73 NT62, and so on. So these are deeper productions. Similarly for others like NT74 -> 't77', etc.\n\nBut the string starts with 't12', 't13', 't63', etc. So I'll list the string elements first to see if there's a way to match them.\n\nLet's take the string: t12 t13 t63 t44 t76 t67 t44 t84 t84 t68 t28 t28 t6 t64 t55 t67 t72 t76 t83 t46 t82 t53 t6 t49 t84 t27 t25 t74 t3 t28 t70 t14 t96 t76 t77 t44 t13 t63 t7 t98 t55 t68 t27 t68 t55 t63 t7 t70.\n\nThat's a lot of 't's. Let's try to see if the top-level symbol is S. S -> NT6 NT58. So the string should start with the concatenation of what? For example, NT6 produces 't63' eventually (look at NT69 -> 't67', but it's deep), while NT58 is 't46'. So maybe the first two elements would be t63 and t46, but wait, the string starts with t12, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that's a problem because S is NT6 and NT58. So the leftmost derivation would start with NT6 NT58. So the string should start with the expansion of NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nLet me check: the string starts with t12 t13 t63 t44 t76... So the first symbol is t12. Now, in the grammar, NT2 -> 't9', but that's for NT2. I don't see a production for NT12 or NT13, which suggests that maybe the string includes non-terminals that aren't in the grammar. Let me check the grammar symbols.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals: NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, etc. Wait, the grammar provided includes NT2, NT6, NT7, etc. But looking closely, are all the 't' followed by numbers present as non-terminals? For example, does the grammar have a production for NT12? Because the string has 't12', so for that to be a terminal, the grammar must have a rule like NT12 -> 't12', but looking through the given productions, I don't see any NT12 production.\n\nWait, let's check the given grammar. Here's the list:\n\nI need to go through each production to see if any NT has a production that ends in a terminal like 't12' or 't13'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n- NT50 -> NT93 NT6 (ends with 't6')\n- NT65 -> NT38 NT84 ('t84')\n- NT74 -> 't77' (so NT74 is a terminal)\n- NT84 -> 't40'\n- NT78 -> 't67' and 't73'\n- NT28 -> 't38' and 't93'\n- NT2 -> 't9'\n- NT36 -> 't79'\n- NT17 -> 't96'\n- NT65 -> 't82'\n- NT68 -> 't63' and 't67'\n- NT39 -> 't78' and 't46'\n- NT55 -> 't92' (if I read it correctly, but in the productions I see NT55 -> 't92'? Let me check the list again. Yes, I see NT55 -> 't92'. But in the string, there's a 't55' element? Let me look:\n\nWait the string is:\n\nt12 t13 t63 t44 t76 t67 t44 t84 t84 t68 t28 t28 t6 t64 t55 t67 t72 t76 t83 t46 t82 t53 t6 t49 t84 t27 t25 t74 t3 t28 t70 t14 t96 t76 t77 t44 t13 t63 t7 t98 t55 t68 t27 t68 t55 t63 t7 t70.\n\nLooking for 't55', yes, it's there. So if a production for a non-terminal NT... gives 't55', perhaps NT55 has 't55', which is present. Wait, but in the grammar, NT55 is a non-terminal, does it have a production that is a terminal 't55'? Looking through, the grammar's NT55 is 'NT55 -> 't92''? Wait, is that a terminal? Looking through again.\n\nThe grammar seems to have:\n\nLooking through each production:\n- NT95 -> NT9 NT69\n- NT73 -> NT8 NT9\n- NT39 -> NT78 NT46\n- NT87 -> NT98 NT55\n- NT55 -> 't92'\n\nWait, so NT55 is a terminal? No, wait. The grammar lists NT55 -> 't92', which is a terminal. So NT55 produces 't92', but the string has 't55'. How can that be? Unless I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no. Each production rule in CNF is for a non-terminal, but in this grammar, is there any non-terminal that expands into 't55'?\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see any production where a non-terminal produces 't55'. Instead, NT55 produces 't92', not 't55'. So the 't55' in the string suggests that there's a non-terminal that can produce 't55', but I don't see such a production. Or maybe a typo? Or am I missing something.\n\nWait another thought: the starting symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the leftmost part is NT6 and NT58. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT8 \u2192 't12' (from the grammar: NT8 -> 't12'?)\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I can't find NT8's production. Wait, let me check all productions:\n\nWait, NT8 is not in the list. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me look through all the NT symbols:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT2, NT6, NT7, NT84, NT56, etc. Wait, checking, there's NT84 \u2192 't40' but no 't12' directly. Hmm, the string starts with 't12', so maybe NT6 expands into something that eventually produces 't12', but I need to check if any non-terminal expands into 't12'.\n\nWait, but I'm looking through the provided grammar, and the only terminal symbols are things like 't12', 't13', etc., which are probably the leaves. But none of the non-terminals in the grammar seem to produce 't12' or 't13' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-950","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a particular string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is provided, along with the string to evaluate. Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because all the productions on the right side have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: \n\nt92 t82 t76 t97 t53 t72 t40 t67 t68 t95 t6 t63 t27 t26 t92 t98 t36 t12 t7 t77 t68 t53 t76 t40 t96 t64 t8 t27 t79 t58 t77 t40 t95 t16 t13 t82 t98 t84 t98 t4 t87 t67 t16 t67 t79 t79 t4 t26 t9. \n\nWait, but I notice that at the end, the string is quite long. I think the first thing to do is to map each terminal symbol to its corresponding non-terminal in the grammar. But wait, in the grammar, each terminal like 't9', 't7', etc., is produced by specific productions. So perhaps the string is composed of terminals that result from expanding non-terminals like S, NT6, etc.\n\nI think I should start by looking at the grammar and see what each non-terminal produces. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the start symbol S produces a combination of two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. The string must start with a sequence that can be derived from NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is 't92'. So maybe NT6 \u2192 t92? Let me check the grammar. Checking the productions where NT6 appears as a left-hand side: \n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see an entry for NT6 \u2192 something. Wait, the grammar includes some NT6 productions. Let me look more carefully.\n\nAh, yes, I see several entries for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, NT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2, etc. Wait, no, I should check directly for NT6. Looking at the productions given, I see NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67, NT39 \u2192 NT68 NT40, etc. Hmm, but none of these directly produce a terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 't25', so NT73 is a production that results in 't25'. Similarly, other non-terminals produce various terminals. So, I think I need to build a parse tree for the given string, starting from S and seeing if it can derive the string.\n\nBut building a parse tree step by step for a long string might be tedious. Alternatively, I can try to match the string from the start by matching the rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the possible initial steps:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which leads to NT6 NT58. So the first two symbols in the string must come from NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, looking at the string: first term is 't92'. So NT6 must produce 't92' followed by something that ends with NT58 producing the next part. Wait, no. Wait, S produces NT6 NT58, so the string must be a concatenation of the production of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo the entire string is the concatenation of the derivation sequence of NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string: starting with 't92', let's see if there's a production for NT6 that starts with 't92'. Wait, I need to check the productions for NT6.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's find if any NT6 production directly produces a terminal or a combination.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT6: \n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n- NT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2\n- NT46 \u2192 NT87 NT68\n- NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT82\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT93\n- NT2 \u2192 NT44 NT14\n- NT66 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n- NT56 \u2192 NT9 NT19\n- NT55 \u2192 NT95 NT56\n- NT37 \u2192 NT39 NT15\n- NT52 \u2192 NT19 NT28\n- NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n- NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n- NT95 \u2192 NT95 NT56 (Wait, that's a self-loop)\n- NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n- NT69 \u2192 NT67 NT62\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, none of these directly produce a terminal. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the reverse: see if the string can be generated by working backwards from the start symbol.\n\nWait, another approach could be to use the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I remember it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can trace the possible path through the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that in the string, 't92' is part of the terminals. Let's see if 't92' can be produced by any non-terminal. Looking at the list of productions in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal producing 't92' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me check again. The grammar includes:\n\nLooking at NT2: it's produced by 't70' and 't6'. So that's a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for 't92' in the productions:\n\nLooking through all non-terminals and their productions, I don't see any direct production of 't92'. Hmm. So perhaps the string includes a production that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to think of how the string is built up by looking for possible intermediate steps.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the non-terminals that generate each part of the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long to analyze step by step, so maybe it's better to look for a pattern or check if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo the string must start with the result of NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nFirst, let's check the first few terminals in the string:\n\nt92 t82 t76 t97 t53 t72 ...\n\nLet's see if the first production from NT6 can produce 't92' followed by something leading to t82, etc.\n\nWait, but as I noticed before, NT6 doesn't appear to produce any terminal directly. So perhaps 't92' must come from NT6, but how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong grammar. Let me make sure I wrote the grammar correctly. The given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which suggests that NT6 and NT58 appear in that order.\n\nWait, perhaps the string was generated via more than S's initial productions. Alternatively, maybe the start symbol is S, and the string starts with a sequence generated by NT6 followed by NT58, but each of these non-terminals might have their own production sequences.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to identify the possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal in the string.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can look for the production that leads to t92.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a non-terminal NT2 that produces 't70' and 't6'. But there's no production directly for t92. Let me check if any non-terminal's productions include t92.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't92' as a terminal. Hmm. That suggests that perhaps the string might not be in the language because t92 can't be produced directly by any non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, maybe t92 is part of a longer production. For example, perhaps NT6 produces something that eventually leads to 't92'.\n\nWait, I'm going to need to see all the non-terminals and their possible sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to note all the possible non-terminals that can produce 't92' through a chain of productions. But from the given grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that can directly produce 't92'.

It seems that all the non-terminals (like S, NT74, etc.) have productions that split into two other non-terminals each. The string to evaluate consists of a series of terminal symbols separated by spaces. Each of these \"t\" segments probably represents a terminal string, possibly an atom or a more complex structure, but in this context, they seem to be atomic because there are no other rules that generate them except for some NT->t combinations.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals directly produce a single terminal (like NT2->'t9'). So the string is a sequence of these terminal strings. Each token in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar, except that in this case, each token seems to be a single terminal. \n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A->BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol S->NT6 NT58. So the top-down approach involves starting with S and expanding it into NT6 and NT58, then each of those into smaller non-terminals, and so on until all are expanded into terminals.\n\nBut the string in question is quite long, so it's better to think in terms of steps or perhaps find a pattern or a way to parse the string. Alternatively, I could try to see if each token in the string can be directly derived in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each rule either breaks into two non-terminals or into a terminal. So each token in the string must be either a terminal that some non-terminal can produce or built from other tokens. \n\nLet me check the grammar rules to see if each terminal in the string is produced by any non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT2 appears in the string: t14, t4, t70, etc. \n\nLooking for NT2->'t9'. So t9 is NT2. \n\nSimilarly, let's list all the tokens and see if they have corresponding rules.\n\nBut this could take a while. Alternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe the string can be generated by S step by step breaking into NT6 and NT58, then each into their components, etc., until all are terminals, and each terminal corresponds to something in the grammar.\n\nBut the string has 52 tokens. Parsing such a long string manually is time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or reductions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the given grammar is for the language of all strings where each \"t\" token is generated by a specific non-terminal, and the non-terminals form a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each terminal in the string is present in the grammar's terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT2 -> 't9', NT3->'t26', etc.\n\nSo the string's terminals are t14, t4, t70, t8, t28, t79, etc.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I can note down which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9'\n- NT3 -> 't26'\n- NT4 -> 't68'\n- NT7->'t77'\n- NT14->'t94'\n- NT5->'t40'\n- NT6->'t73'\n- NT15->'t94'\n- NT9->'t26'\n- NT46->'t87'\n- NT22->'t87'\n- NT38->'t68'\n- NT27->'t4'\n- NT95->'t14'\n- NT74->'t77'\n- NT84->'t40'\n- NT68->'t63'\n- NT36->'t79'\n- NT58->'t46'\n- NT44->'t83'\n- NT55->'t92'\n- NT73->'t8'\n- NT62->'t84'\n- NT38->'t68'\n- NT2->'t68'\nWait, some of these are conflicting. For example, NT38->'t68' and NT2->'t68' as well. So the same terminal can be produced by different non-terminals.\n\nSo now, looking at the string, I need to see if each token in the string is generated by some non-terminal, and then work backward through the grammar to see if the entire string can be derived starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given grammar is such that the strings are formed by a certain structure. Maybe each tX corresponds to a rule, but it's unclear without reconstructing the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps I can test whether each part can be built step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9.\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-962","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar and a string, and I need to determine if the string can be generated by the grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. Looking at the given grammar, all the rules seem to fit that form, so that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: \n\nt9 t7 t25 t92 t64 t53 t25 t39 t4 t97 t82 t79 t4 t39 t98 t77 t97 t94 t76 t27 t79 t98 t46 t55 t49 t64 t36 t36 t63 t55 t4 t27 t53 t26 t94 t98 t87 t98 t63 t7 t79 t40 t83 t14 t53 t72 t14 t22 t16 t27.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, I might consider converting it to a parse tree with the root being the start symbol S, and each production rule contributing to the tree's structure. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach here, especially since the string is quite long.\n\nI think a better approach might be to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to see if the grammar can derive it. Each step in the parsing would involve replacing a substring with a production rule until all symbols are non-terminals, and then the string is checked against the terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string is only terminals, so the entire derivation must end with the entire string being expanded from the start symbol. So, looking at the grammar, the start symbol S has the production rule S -> NT6 NT58. That means the derivation must start with NT6 and NT58.\n\nThe string begins with t9, so I wonder if any non-terminals expand into t9. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT40\nNT40 -> NT69 NT17\nNT68 -> NT63 NT67\nNT63 -> NT94 NT22 -- and NT94 is 't77'\nAnd other NT9 rules, but also:\n\nNT9 is sometimes the start for terminals. Wait, no, NT9 is a non-terminal that can expand into 't26' as per one of the rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't26'\n\nAnd another rule says NT95 -> 't14', but that's NT95.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t9, which matches NT9 -> 't26' only if t26 is t9, but no, t9 is another.\n\nWait, maybe I should map all the terminals to their production rules. Let me list which non-terminals expand into each terminal:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\nNT94 -> 't77'\nNT73 -> 't25'\nNT69 -> 't67'\nNT46 -> 't28'\nNT28 -> 't38' and also 't73'\nWait, no, under NT28: NT28 -> NT38 NT93, and NT38 -> 't68', and NT93 is 't58', but looking in the rules, I see NT28's expansion isn't directly given as a terminal. Instead, some non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nLet me list each terminal and which non-terminals produce them:\n\n- 't9' appears in several rules as NT9 -> 't26', and also NT6 -> 't7', as per NT6 -> NT73 NT62; NT73 -> 't25', NT62 -> 't84' (which is NT84 -> 't40'), but that's getting tangled. Wait, actually, looking through each rule, the terminals are:\n\nLet me parse through the grammar:\n\n- 't94' is produced by NT94.\n- 't77' by NT77 is not in the grammar, but wait, NT73 -> 't25' and some other rules have t77? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT94: 't77' so NT94 -> 't77'.\n\nWait, looking at each rule, many non-terminals expand to terminals as follows:\n\nNT40 -> 't69'? Or wait, looking:\n\nWait, in the rules, we have lines like NT40 -> NT69 NT17. No, some lines have '-' or other. Wait, perhaps I should note that some NTs expand to other NTs, but others directly produce terminals.\n\nLet me list each NT and see if they directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9' (several times, under NT2: 't9', 't6', 't70', 't44', 't36', etc.)\n- NT34 -> 't64' (NT34 -> 't36' and also 't40'? No, wait in the given rules, looking for terminal outputs:\n\nLooking back:\nLine 23: NT68 -> NT63 NT62\nLine 24: NT36 -> NT79 NT2\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list:\n\nLooking through each production, for each line, check if either side is a terminal or an NT.\n\nWait, it's time-consuming, but let me list each NT that directly goes to a terminal:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9' (appears multiple times)\n- NT34 \u2192 't36' (appear multiple times)\n- NT53 \u2192 't28' (appears in NT56 \u2192 NT95 NT36, which then might go to a terminal? Wait, no, looking at each rule:\n\nWait, I think the approach is to map each NT to its possible terminal production.\n\nLooking at each production, for each right-hand side, if it's two NTs, we need to expand them further until we get to terminals.\n\nBut given the length of the string, which is 64 symbols, it's impractical to do this manually. So perhaps I can structure the problem by noting that each step in the grammar produces two symbols, and each symbol in the string must be generated by either a terminal production or via some combination of two NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of the length. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step increases the number of symbols by one, so a string of length n requires n-2 steps (since S is two symbols, then each step adds one, so for a string of k symbols, the number of steps is k-2). Wait, or perhaps I'm mixing up something else. Alternatively, the derivation starts with two non-terminals and each production adds one symbol. So for a string of length L, there are L-2 productions. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see the string as a sequence of terminals and ensure each can be generated from some non-terminals, possibly recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if there's a way to split the string into a series of production rules.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by finding possible splits that match the grammar. Given that each symbol is a single letter, like 't9', 't7', etc., and the grammar splits each step into two non-terminals, each next symbol in the string would have to come from the expansion of a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to see if there's a way to represent the string as a sequence of expansions from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT6 and NT58. So the first two symbols after S would have to come from the expansion of NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9.\n\nWait, NT58 is directly given as S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so in the derivation, after S, it's NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6, it's NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So the next two symbols should be from NT73 and NT62.\n\nIn the string, the first two are t9 and t7. Does any NT lead to t9 and t7?\n\nWait, no. Because NT73 produces 't25' directly as per one rule, so the first symbol in NT73's expansion is 't25', not 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Let me take it step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t9 t7 t25 t92 t64 t53 t25...\n\nThe first symbol is 't9', so that must come from some NT.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t25 t97 t46\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, context-free grammars usually have a start symbol and production rules that expand non-terminals into other symbols, which can be terminals or other non-terminals. The grammar provided has a bunch of rules where each production either goes to two other non-terminals or eventually to a terminal. So this looks like a typical context-free grammar.\n\nThe string to check is \"t25 t97 t46\". Each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar structure, S starts as NT... So S -> NT6 NT58. So the first step is that S expands into two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. So the string derived from S will start with whatever NT6 produces and end with whatever NT58 produces.\n\nNow, let's look at the rules for NT6, NT58, etc. Wait, the string is t25, which is a terminal. So I need to find how t25 is derived. From the given grammar, I see that some NT non-terminals expand directly into 't' and a number. For example, NT79 -> 't16', and NT73 -> 't25'. So NT73 produces 't25', which matches the first part of the string.\n\nSo the first symbol 't25' must come from NT73. Now, does NT73 appear anywhere else? Yes, in the rule NT73 -> 't25' and also in another rule: NT78 -> NT67 NT73. But since we're starting from NT6, let's see.\n\nWait, starting from S, which splits into NT6 and NT58. So both NT6 and NT58 need to expand into their respective strings. The string of the problem is three parts: t25, t97, t46.\n\nSo the first NT6 needs to generate 't25' as the first part. Let's see what NT6 can derive. Looking through the rules, NT6's production is NT63 NT62. So NT6 -> NT63 NT62. Now, let's see how NT63 and NT62 might expand.\n\nFrom the rules, NT63 -> NT94 NT22. So NT63 expands to NT94 and NT22. NT94 is a terminal: 't94' as per the grammar (since NT94 -> 't94'), but wait, in our target string, the first is 't25', so that might not fit. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no: the first symbol is 't25', which I thought was from NT73, but in S's expansion, we have NT6 and NT58. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me think about the entire string: it's three tokens: t25, t97, t46. So the string is \"t25 t97 t46\", which has three tokens, so in the parse tree, the root S must expand into a sequence of three non-terminals? But wait, S expands into two non-terminals at each step according to the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), all productions are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the productions that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the non-terminals only go to two non-terminals, or to a single terminal. So any production that produces terminals is only one terminal.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, for example, NT73 -> 't25' is a production that only produces one terminal, which is 't25'. Similarly, NT79 -> 't16' and others.\n\nSo each production is either a non-terminal expanding to two non-terminals or a non-terminal expanding to a single terminal. So the string \"t25 t97 t46\" has three terminals, so that implies that somewhere in the derivation, the S non-terminal must expand into three non-terminals, but since S only expands into two, I must have a way of generating an odd number of terminals from S. That seems impossible because in CNF, the number of terminals in any derivation starting from S will be a power of two, I think. Or wait, in a derivation, each step produces two symbols or one. Wait, perhaps that needs more thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the parse tree. Let's see: the string is three terminals. To get three symbols, the root S must have a production of two non-terminals, each of which can themselves have productions, but in a way that leads to three terminals.\n\nWait, but each step can only split into two. So starting with S, the first split gives two non-terminals. Then each of those can split into two each, leading to up to four. For example, if each of the two splits into two, you get four terminals. To get three, perhaps one of the splits produces only one terminal, and another splits into two.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take a small example: suppose I have a grammar where S->A B, A->t, B->C, and C->AB. Then S can produce t AB. Hmm, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string \"t25 t97 t46\" has three terminals, so the total number of terminals in the parse would require that the derivation goes through three steps or something. Or perhaps not. Let me try to see if each part can come from the grammar.\n\nFirst, t25: looking for a production that directly outputs t25. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'? Let me check: wait, looking at the rules, in the grammar, I see NT79 -> 't16', NT89 -> 't94', wait, no, looking through the code, I see lines like NT79 -> 't27' and NT73's rules. Let me check the grammar lines:\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\n- NT82 -> 't82'\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The rules are listed as lines like:\n\nNT73 -> 't25' is present? Let me scan the list:\n\nLooking for any production that is NT... -> 't25'... I see:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar lines, I don't immediately see a production NT73 -> 't25'. Wait, in the initial list, here's the first few lines:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nNT74 -> NT9 NT66\n\nNT63 -> NT94 NT22\n\nNT95 -> NT9 NT69\n\nNT19 -> NT37 NT69\n\nNT65 -> NT38 NT84\n\nNT14 -> NT59 NT15\n\nNT50 -> NT93 NT6\n\nNT78 -> NT67 NT73\n\nNT56 -> NT9 NT19\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66\n\n... and so on. I don't see NT73 -> 't25' directly. Oh, wait, I do see NT78 -> NT67 NT73. Wait, is there a production where NT73 directly expands into 't25'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the provided grammar rules, I think the 't25' is directly produced by some NT rule. Wait, let's look: for example, NT79 is present with some productions: NT79 -> 't16' and others? Let me read through the lines again.\n\nLooking for 't25' in the grammar:\n\nWait, in the provided list, NT73 is mentioned in NT78 -> NT67 NT73, but that's a production from NT78 to NT67 and NT73.\n\nLooking through all the provided rules, I notice that there's NT69 -> 't67' and others, but 't25' isn't directly produced by any of the given non-terminals except perhaps NT73.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal. The string has three tokens: t25, t84, t46. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the relevant productions that result in these terminals. \n\nLooking at NT79 -> t27, but that's t27, not t25. Hmm. Oh, NT79 has another production: NT79 -> t16. That's t16, which isn't matching. Maybe I need to see where t25 comes from. Checking the productions, I see NT79 -> t27 and NT79 -> t16, no t25. Wait, what about NT69 -> t67. That's t67, which is part of the string but not t25. \n\nWait, the first token is t25. Are there any non-terminals that produce t25 directly? Let me check the productions. Yes, NT79 -> t27 and NT79 -> t16. No, nothing gives t25 directly. Hmm. Maybe I should look at how the string could be built. The string is t25, t84, t46. \n\nLet me think about how to get t25. Since none of the productions directly yield t25, perhaps it's derived from a chain of productions. So, perhaps t25 comes from a non-terminal that eventually leads to t25. Looking at NT79, which can produce t27 or t16, but none are t25. Wait, maybe I should check lower levels.\n\nWait, let me see if any non-terminals produce NT79. Checking: NT79 is defined as NT79 -> NT96 NT73. NT96 -> NT95 NT66, and NT73 -> NT8 NT9. Then NT96 becomes NT95 NT66, which leads to NT85 NT66 (since NT95 -> NT95 NT6) and so on. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT58. NT6 is NT73 NT62, and NT58 is NT84 NT9. So let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\nSo S \u2192 NT73 NT62 NT84 NT9.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to produce the corresponding parts of the string. \n\nStarting with NT73: It produces NT8 NT9. So NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nThen, NT8: It produces NT12, which is a terminal 't12'? Wait, but the string we have is t25, t84, t46. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, NT80 also has a production NT80 \u2192 t22. But in the string, we have t84, which corresponds to NT84. \n\nWait, perhaps I should build the derivation step by step. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\nSo, S \u2192 NT73 NT62 NT84 NT9.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to produce the corresponding tokens.\n\nBut let's see, in the string, we have three tokens: t25, t84, t46. So perhaps this is the result of three non-terminals each producing one token. But wait, in the grammar, each production is either a terminal or a split into two non-terminals. So the string must consist of sequences where each non-terminal either ends in a terminal or is split further. \n\nWait, the string has three tokens, which is three steps. So maybe each token is a direct production from the respective non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. Both must be processed, so the string would have two tokens from S. But the input string has three tokens, which suggests maybe some non-terminals in the derivation split into more than one terminal or further non-terminals. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals can produce a terminal directly, and others split further. Let's try to see if any of the non-terminals can produce the tokens directly.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce 't25' as a terminal. Scanning the productions:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 t27\n- NT79 \u2192 t16\n- NT2 \u2192 t70, t6, t44, t4, etc. Wait, NT2 -> 't70' (from the given), but that's not t25.\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nI don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't25'. The closest is NT79, but it produces t27 or t16. So unless t25 can be derived indirectly, the string might not be in the language.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the productions again. \n\nScanning, I see NT79 -> t27 and t16, but no t25. So maybe the string can't be generated because there's no way to get 't25' in the derivation. \n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the initial NT6 or NT58 can generate a 't25' through some path. Let's check NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6: It's NT73 NT62. So NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNT84 is another production: NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try to find if t25 can be part of any chain. \n\nLooking for non-terminals that can eventually derive 't25'. \n\nLet me see where 't25' could come from. Is there any production that ends in t25? It doesn't seem so. The closest non-terminals near t25 are NT79 (\"t27\" or \"t16\"), NT27 (\"t4\"), NT69 (\"t67\"), etc. None of them directly produce t25.\n\nTherefore, it seems that 't25' cannot be generated by any production in the grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze and parse.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most of the productions are of the form NT(n) \u2192 NT(m) NT(k), which fits the A \u2192 BC form. The terminals are represented by those with 't' followed by a number, like 't12', 't3', etc. The starting symbol is S, as it's written on the left-hand side of the first production: S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nThe string to check is \"t12 t3 t97 t46\". Each word is a separate token, so I'll treat each 't' followed by a number as individual terminal symbols. So the string has four terminals: t12, t3, t97, t46.\n\nMy first thought is to see if each terminal in the string is present in the grammar as a terminal. Let me quickly scan the right-hand sides of the productions to see if any of these terminals appear. Oh, I see that 't12' is a terminal (production NT8 \u2192 t12), 't3' is a terminal (NT94 \u2192 t14, but wait, no, looking again, I see NT94 \u2192 t94, which is t94, not t3. Hmm. Wait, let me check the productions carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see lines like NT94 \u2192 't77', NT50 \u2192 't67', NT69 \u2192 't67', NT79 \u2192 't27', NT2 \u2192 't9', etc. So each terminal is on the RHS of a production. Let's list all the terminals present:\n\nFrom the productions:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 t77\n- NT40 \u2192 t17\n- NT56 \u2192 t72\n- NT27 \u2192 t4\n- NT62 \u2192 t84\n- NT80 \u2192 t22\n- NT38 \u2192 t68\n- NT74 \u2192 t7\n- NT36 \u2192 t64\n- NT56 \u2192 t72\n- NT85 \u2192 t76\n- NT93 \u2192 t95\n- NT38 \u2192 t74\n-\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. But looking through all the productions, the terminals listed are:\n\nt77, t17, t72, t4, t84, t22, t68, t7, t64, t95, t96, t27, t9, t83, t92, t8, t77 again, I think I missed some. Wait, perhaps I should make a list.\n\nActually, perhaps it's more efficient to note that the terminals in the given string must be exactly those present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it has t12, t3, t97, and t46. Do these appear in the grammar as terminals?\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT(n) \u2192 t12, t3, t97, or t46 on the RHS. All the terminals are like t77, t17, t95, etc., but not t12, t3, t97, or t46. So, this would suggest that some of these terminals are not present in the grammar, making the string ungenerable.\n\nWait, but let's check each of them.\n\nt12: Is there a production where NT(n) \u2192 t12? Looking at the productions, the only terminals I see are t12 is only in the production for NT2 \u2192 t12. Yes, line: NT2 -> t9. Wait, no, wait. Looking back:\n\nNo, in the given productions, I see NT2 \u2192 t9, NT2 \u2192 t70, and NT2 \u2192 t6. But t12 is not a terminal in any production. So t12 is not present.\n\nt3: Checking for t3 in any production. The only place I see NT94 \u2192 t77, NT9 \u2192 t26, etc. I don't see a production where NT(n) \u2192 t3.\n\nt97: Checking for t97. Looking through the productions, I see NT99 (not sure, no), or checking the given productions, it seems t97 isn't present as a terminal.\n\nt46: Checking for t46. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT(n) \u2192 t46.\n\nSo, all four terminals in the string are not present as terminals in the grammar. That would immediately mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the productions again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions, each terminal is on the RHS of a production. For example, NT17 \u2192 t96, NT68 \u2192 t44, etc. But I don't see any production that would result in any of those terminals in the string.\n\nTherefore, since the string contains t12, t3, t97, and t46, which are not terminals in the given grammar, the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at all the production rules:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t94\n- NT19 \u2192 t37\n- NT2 \u2192 t9, t6, t26, t70, t44, etc.\n- NT22 \u2192 t87\n- NT27 \u2192 t4\n- NT28 \u2192 t44\n- NT34 \u2192 t36, t58\n- NT36 \u2192 t64, t79\n- NT38 \u2192 t68, t2\n- NT39 \u2192 t58, t63\n- NT40 \u2192 t69, t74, t85, t73, t95\n- NT50 \u2192 t93, t6\n- NT55 \u2192 t92\n- NT56 \u2192 t72, t95, t36\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all NT rules that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the ND rules:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 t14\n- NT95 \u2192 t67, t96, t14, t58\n- NT79 \u2192 t27, t16\n- NT69 \u2192 t67, t13\n- NT73 \u2192 t25, t53\n- NT65 \u2192 t82\n- NT66 \u2192 t96\n- NT84 \u2192 t46, t55\n- NT58 \u2192 t46\n- NT34 \u2192 t36\n- NT28 \u2192 t44\n- NT2 \u2192 t9, t6, t26, t70, t64\n\nWait, now I see that NT73 \u2192 t25. Yes! So the first symbol, t25, must come from NT73, which directly produces t25. So the first part of the string is derived from NT73, which gives t25.\n\nSo the substring starts with t25, which is from NT73.\n\nNow, moving to the second symbol, t97. So after NT73 (which is t25), the next NT must produce t97. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the production rules, what can produce t97? NT95 \u2192 t95, which doesn't give t97. NT79 \u2192 t16, t27, but no t97. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, NT97 is not in the list, so perhaps I've misread the rules. Let me check again the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar's NTs are from NT2 to NT97, but the productions are as listed. Wait, NT79 \u2192 t27 and t16, but no production for t97. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see an NT that directly produces t97. So perhaps the string is invalid because the second symbol can't be derived. But wait, the string is t25 t97 t40 t26. If t97 isn't produced by any NT, then the string can't be generated. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NT rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production that leads to t97 through multiple steps. Let me think about each symbol as part of a larger derivation.\n\nWait, let's take each step carefully. Starting from S, which is NT6 NT58.\n\nLet me try to generate the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t25 t97 t40 t26.\n\nLet me think:\n\n1. The string starts with t25. As we saw earlier, t25 comes from NT73 \u2192 t25, so the first NT is NT73.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT6 NT58, we have N73 t97 ... But wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to start from the entire string and see if it can be split into the parts that correspond to the non-terms in the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt25 t97 t40 t26.\n\nAssuming each token is a terminal, the full derivation must split this into a sequence of NTs that can be generated from the grammar.\n\nEach step in the derivation will take an NT and produce either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo the entire string can be written as t25 t97 t40 t26, which would correspond to a series of NTs transforming into terminals.\n\nSo let's denote each NT that can produce a terminal:\n\n- The first t25 comes from NT73.\n- The second t97 needs to come from an NT, so we need to see if any NT produces t97.\n- The third t40 comes from NT40.\n- The fourth t26 comes from NT28.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that NT73 \u2192 t25, so that's one part. But for t97, is there any NT that produces it?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, let's check all NTs:\n\nIs there an NT that directly produces t97? Scanning through:\n\nWait, looking at each production rule, perhaps I missed it.\n\nLooking through the production lists:\n\nWait, the list is extensive. Let me go through each line:\n\n1.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar rules provided. I notice that most of the rules are in terms of non-terminals leading to other non-terminals. The string consists of terminals, so I need to match these terminals against the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me list the given terminals:\n\n- t12\n- t26\n- t84\n- t55\n- t3\n\nI need to find a derivation path that starts from the start symbol S and ends with the given string. In CNF, each step produces exactly two symbols, which can be other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nSo, S splits into NT6 and NT58. The string has 5 parts, so I need to generate each part through derivations. Let me list the steps I need to take:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 ?\n2. NT58 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT6 and NT58:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT73 NT62 NT84 NT9\n\nNow, let's break down each of these non-terminals step by step.\n\nStarting with NT73:\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nSo, NT73 splits into NT8 and NT9.\n\nNT8 (from NT8):\nLooking at the rules, is there an NT8? Scanning, I see:\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93\nNT85 \u2192 NT95 NT50\nNT84 \u2192 NT40 NT93\nNT85 \u2192 NT87 NT55\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\nNT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2\nNT40 \u2192 NT69 NT17\nNT8 \u2192 't12'\n\nAh, there's an NT8 \u2192 t12. So NT8 produces 't12' as a terminal.\n\nSo, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 becomes t12 and NT9.\n\nNext, NT9:\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 splits into NT68 NT40.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n\nSo now, after NT73, we have t12 and NT68 NT40.\n\nLet's process NT68:\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n\nSo NT68 splits into NT63 and NT67.\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT53 NT79\n\nSo NT67 splits into NT53 and NT79.\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT27 NT66\n\nSo NT79 splits into NT27 and NT66.\n\nNow, looking at NT66:\nNT66 \u2192 NT96\n\nWait, that can't be right. Looking back, the rules:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT96\n\nHmm, but NT96 is a non-terminal? Wait, looking again, I don't see any rules for NT96 besides NT66 \u2192 NT96. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, is NT66 producing a terminal or not? Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT66 \u2192 NT96 is one rule. Now, checking NT96, but in the given rules, there's no NT96 production. So NT96 would need to produce a terminal, but I don't see any. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT96, which suggests that NT96 must produce a terminal. Wait, perhaps I missed a rule.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for NT96: There's no direct rule. Hmm, that's a problem. Because without a production for NT96, the derivation would stop at NT96, which doesn't match any terminals in the string. So maybe NT96 produces a terminal?\n\nWait, looking back, I might have missed that. Let me see the entire list again:\n\nOh, actually, I notice that from NT94, for example, it's sometimes ending with 't...', but I need to check if any NT symbols lead to terminals.\n\nLooking more carefully, for example:\n\nNT94 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't27'\n\nWait, so NT94 produces 't77', and NT79 produces 't27'. But I don't see NT96 in any of these terminal rules. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me go back and retrace.\n\nThe initial string is `t12 t26 t84 t55 t3`.\n\nWe have:\n\n- t12 comes from NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, then NT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nWait, but in the breakdown above, after NT73 splits, we have NT8 (t12) and NT9. Then, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, which led me to process NT68 and NT40, then NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67, and so on. But that seems too long because the string is only 5 terminals, so there must be a way to break it down into exactly 5 parts without unnecessary splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the rightmost symbols and see how they can be derived.\n\nThe string is t12 t26 t84 t55 t3. So, perhaps the last part, t3, comes from a non-terminal that directly produces t3.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nWait, that's useful. So, perhaps somewhere in the parse, we can get t26 from NT9.\n\nWait, but the string ends with t3. Let me see if any non-terminals produce t3.\n\nLooking at NT19 \u2192 NT37 NT69.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem relevant. Let me check:\n\nNT53 \u2192 't53'? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nNT53 is an NT that might produce a terminal. Let me check NT53:\n\nWait, I don't see any rule for NT53. So perhaps NT53 is a non-terminal that produces something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me try a different approach. Let me start from the entire string and see if I can trace back using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is t12 t26 t84 t55 t3.\n\nEach of these could come from a non-terminal in the grammar. Let's see:\n\nt12: comes from NT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nt26: comes from NT9 \u2192 t26.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example, NT28 \u2192 t27, but that doesn't match. Wait, let's check the rules for NT28 in the grammar provided. Wait, in the list:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't49'\n\nWait, that's a terminal. So, NT28 can produce t49.\n\nAlso, NT9 \u2192 't26' as per the rules. So, in the given grammar, NT9 \u2192 't26'.\n\nSo, t26 comes directly from NT9.\n\nSimilarly, t3: looking for a non-terminal that produces 't3'. Checking the rules, I see:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't46'? No, that's a string, not a single character. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I need to find a non-terminal NT that directly produces 't3'. Let me check the list again:\n\nNT94 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't58'\n\nHmm, nothing seems to produce 't3' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps 't3' comes from a higher rule.\n\nLooking at the top-down approach, starting from S, which is NT6 NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire derivation can be done in a leftmost way.\n\nWait, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the string is too short, or the non-terminals don't produce the required terminals.\n\nWait, stepping back, perhaps the initial split of S into NT6 and NT58 is correct.\n\nBut then, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which then splits again, leading to more non-terminals, while the string has only 5 terminals. So unless some non-terminals produce terminal symbols in a way that shortens the chain, this could be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT6 and NT58 can directly produce the necessary terminals. Wait, but looking at the rules, NT6 and NT58 produce other non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to get a terminal in one step. Let's look:\n\nIn the rules, for example:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nSo if a non-terminal can lead directly to 't26', that's possible.\n\nBut let me consider the entire string.

So, for the string `t12 t3 t84 t40 t26`, there's a t3 which is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. That would make the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rules for any non-terminal that produces 't3'.\n\nLooking through all the rules again:\n\nNT7 -> but looking at the first few, like NT56 -> NT95 NT36, but that's not relevant.\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT9. Let me check. The rules for NT9:\n\nWait, from the given rules, I see:\n\nNT79 -> 't16'\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT40 \u2192 which produces 't26'\n\nWait, no, maybe I should check all rules again for any that produce 't3'.\n\nWait, I don't see any production that results in 't3'. So, that means the string `t12 t3 t84 t40 t26` cannot be generated by the grammar because t3 is not a terminal in the grammar; there's no way to produce 't3'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me check all rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me go through the list again carefully.\n\nLooking at each rule and their right-hand sides:\n\nNT56 -> NT95 NT36\n\nLooking for 't3' in any of the RHS, I see:\n\n- NT3: does any rule have 't3' on the RHS? Looking through the rules:\n\nI don't see any non-terminal's production that results in 't3' except perhaps in some other way.\n\nWait, let's go through each rule systematically:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-80","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t12 t3 t84 t36 t39 t26\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, except for maybe some terminals. Wait, no, actually, some of the rules end with a terminal, like S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and some NTs produce terminal symbols. For example, NT2 produces 't9', so those are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string we have is \"t12 t3 t84 t36 t39 t26\". Let's split this into individual tokens: [t12, t3, t84, t36, t39, t26]. So the string consists of six tokens. Since we're dealing with a grammar where each production is binary (left-hand side is one non-terminal, right-hand side is two), the number of symbols in the string should correspond to a derivation of length equal to the number of symbols minus one. Wait, for a string of length n, the number of steps is n-1. So for six tokens, we'd need five productions.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The start symbol is S, which is NT6 and NT58. So the start symbol expands into two non-terminals. Each of those could further expand, and so on, until the terminals are reached. So the string should correspond to a leftmost derivation, for example.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the parse tree. Starting from S, which is NT6 and NT58. So the string should start with one of those. Let's see: the first token is t12. So I need to see if t12 is derived from NT6 or NT58.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT6 can produce NT73 and NT62. Let's see how these lead to t73 and t62. Wait, perhaps more depth-first. Let me look at the rules for each NT:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9\nNT8 -> 't12'\nWait, no, in the rules provided, NT8 is 't12' according to the list:\n\nLooking at the provided rules, under NT8: NT8 -> 't12' is not there. Wait, actually, the terminal symbols are given under lines like NT2 -> 't9', NT94 -> 't14', etc.\n\nWait, so looking at the list:\n\nNT2 -> 't9'\nNT94 -> 't14'\n... etc.\n\nSo each of these NTs can produce a terminal or decompose further.\n\nWait, let's see. So for example, NT2 can produce 't9', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT36 is decomposable into NT79 and NT2, as NT36 -> NT79 NT2.\n\nOkay, so starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nThe first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first symbol in the string is 't12'. So 't12' must come from either NT6 or NT58.\n\nLooking at NT58: Looking through the rules, I see NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So NT58 can become two non-terminals, which may further decompose.\n\nNow, looking back at the string: first token is t12.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps t12 comes from NT6. Because NT6 can be decomposed further.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Now, let's see if the first token t12 is derived from NT6.\n\nLooking into NT6's rules: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So to get t12 from NT6, one of its children must derive t12.\n\nLooking at NT73: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. So NT73 decomposes into NT8 and NT9.\n\nNT8: Let's see, looking through the rules, does NT8 have any production? Checking the provided rules:\n\nLooking for NT8: I see NT85 -> NT58, and some others, but I don't see NT8 being a terminal. Wait, no, in the provided rules, for example, NT2 \u2192 't9'. So, looking through the NTs, NT2 is a terminal. But NT8 isn't a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through all the provided rules:\n\nTerminal productions are ones where the left-hand side is an NT and the right-hand side is a single terminal symbol. So 't77' comes from NT73, 't16' from NT79, 't25' from NT73, 't36' from NT15, 't94' from NT46, etc. So in each case, when an NT appears alone, it's a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided rules, I see lines like:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT73 \u2192 't8' (Wait, no, actually, the rules are more like, when the left side is an NT and the right side is a terminal. So for example, NT2 \u2192 't9'.\n\nSo in the provided rules, for example, NT2 is 't9', so it's a terminal. NT94 is 't14', so it's also a terminal, and so on.\n\nSo to find where t12 comes from, I need to look for an NT rule that can produce 't12'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT producing t12 in the provided list. Because for example, NT2 \u2192 't9'; NT36 \u2192 't79' and 't2'; NT12 isn't present.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-77","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It seems to consist of a bunch of production rules where each non-terminal on the left side (like S, NT6, NT74, etc.) is replaced by two other non-terminals. The end of the string has 't's with numbers, and I remember that terminals are the ones that are leaves in the parse tree, meaning they stop the derivation and match the string exactly.\n\nThe string is `t25 t97 t46 t82 t95 t3`. I'll need to see if this can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which is defined as S -> NT6 NT58. So the first two non-terminals in the derivation must be expanded into something that can produce these 't's.\n\nI'll try to trace back from the string. Each 't' corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, so I can see which production rules directly output these terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT79 -> 't16' implies NT79 produces t16.\n- NT73 -> 't25' is there, so NT73 can produce t25.\n- NT65 -> 't72'? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT73 -> 't25' is present, so NT73 can produce t25.\n\nAlso, NT94 -> 't14' and NT14 -> 't73'. Wait, but looking at the initial rules provided, I see NT14 -> NT59 NT15. But that might not be directly helpful.\n\nWait, no. The provided grammar has the production NT14 -> NT59 NT15, and also NT73 -> 't25'.\n\nBut let's focus on the string: t25 t97 t46 t82 t95 t3.\n\nI need to parse this string as a sequence of terminals. Let me try to build the parse tree starting from the top.\n\nS -> NT6 NT58. So the string starts with t25, which is derived from NT73. Hmm, no. Wait, NT6 is one of the non-terminals in S's production. Let's check the rules for NT6.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 has a rule NT6 -> NT73 NT62. That's one way, but I don't see a direct rule for NT6 being a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, I see terms like NT2 is 't9', but looking through, I don't see NT6 directly as a terminal. So maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that match the production rules.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string: there are six 't's with numbers. So the string has six terminals.\n\nSince the start symbol S is a binomial productions (two non-terminals), the parse tree will require that each non-terminal contributes a certain number of terminals. Let me think about the possible structure.\n\nBut wait, the string length is 6, so the parse tree must produce 6 terminals.\n\nSince S -> NT6 NT58, each of these NT6 and NT58 must produce a sequence of terminals. Their combined sequences must sum up to six terminals.\n\nLet me look at NT6's production rules. NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So to get a terminal, perhaps we need to recursively break down these.\n\nWait, but maybe starting from the string, I can try to match possible sequences.\n\nAnother approach is to use the recursive descent method, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, consider that in Chomsky normal form, each production is two symbols, but since the start symbol S is S -> NT6 NT58, which are two non-terminals, and each step will expand each into two non-terminals, but since the string ends in terminals, we need to find a way for those non-terminals to ultimately produce a terminal after some steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the string and try to match possible phrases.\n\nLooking at the string: t25 t97 t46 t82 t95 t3.\n\nI can try to find a production that matches a part of this string. For example, looking for rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't6', 't44', 't12', 't7', etc.\n- NT14 -> 't73'\n- Wait, perhaps looking for the first few terminals in the string.\n\nThe first is t25. Looking through the rules, NT73 -> 't25'. So t25 must be generated by NT73. So that part is NT73.\n\nThen comes t97. I need to see if any non-terminal can combine to produce t97 and something else. Wait, but t97 is itself a terminal. Or maybe t97 is part of another production. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t97.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the rules. I see:\n\n- NT62 -> 't97' is present. So NT62 can produce t97. So the next two terms:\n\nAfter t25 (NT73) comes t97 (NT62), so the first part of the string is t25 followed by t97, which suggests that S's first part (NT6) produces t25 and another sequence, and the second part (NT58) produces t97 and something else.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S -> NT6 NT58. So the first non-terminal (NT6) must produce the first part of the string, and NT58 the second part.\n\nSo S -> NT6 NT58, so the string should be split into two parts, each produced by NT6 and NT58 respectively.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily the case because NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals, so they could produce multiple terminals. So let me see: the string has six terminals. Let's see if it can be divided such that NT6 produces k terminals, and NT58 produces (6 - k) terminals.\n\nLooking at the possible split points:\n\n1. k=1, NT6 produces t25, NT58 produces t97 t46 t82 t95 t3 \u2192 too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT6 produces the first two, NT58 the next four.\n\nBut wait, let's try to see:\n\nLooking at the first terminal t25: can NT6 generate it? Looking at the rules for NT6, it can't because the rules for NT6 are all binomials, e.g., NT73 NT62. So to get a terminal, NT6 must have a production that terminates. But looking through the rules:\n\nDo any of the rules for NT6 end with a terminal?\n\nLooking: I don't see a rule where NT6 is a terminal. So that's problematic. Because if S -> NT6 NT58, and both NT6 and NT58 must expand into sequences that eventually produce terminals, then the entire string must be composed of the terminals produced by NT6 and NT58.\n\nBut if NT6 only produces non-terminals, then its expansion would require more non-terminals until it reaches terminals. So the string has six terminals, so the entire expansion needs to account for that.\n\nWait, but maybe S -> NT6 NT58, and each of those can produce multiple terminals via recursive expansions.\n\nLet me try to find the possible expansion paths for NT6 and NT58 that could generate parts of the string.\n\nFirst, the string is `t25 t97 t46 t82 t95 t3`.\n\nLet's divide it after the first 1, 2, etc., terminals to see if any part matches a production.\n\nLooking at the start: t25.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) for a CFG means that each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So all the productions provided are in this form. That should help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: t12, t36, t53, t8, t72, t97, t46. Each is a single terminal symbol. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nNow, let's look at the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT58. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT6 NT58. This means the string will start with the expansion of NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nI should check the productions for NT6. Looking through the given rules, NT6 can produce NT73 NT62. So the first part becomes NT73 NT62. Now, I need to see how these non-terminals expand.\n\nStarting with NT73, looking at the productions, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. So this splits into NT8 and NT9. Now, checking NT8. From the productions, NT8 seems to have multiple options, but looking closer, I don't see a direct production for NT8 \u2192 something. Wait, actually, in the given rules, I need to check all the productions to find where NT8 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking more carefully: No, in the provided rules, NT8 is not listed as a left-hand side of any production. That might be a problem because if NT8 is a non-terminal but doesn't have any productions, then it can't produce anything, which would mean we can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe NT8 is supposed to be a terminal, but it's written as NT8, which suggests it's a non-terminal. But looking at the productions, there's no production for NT8, which would mean it's undefined and thus can't generate any string. That would immediately cause a problem because the string contains t8, which is derived from NT8, but if NT8 doesn't have a production, it's stuck.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, t8 is present. So if NT8 doesn't produce anything, then it's impossible to derive t8, meaning the string can't be generated by the grammar. That would answer \"No.\" But I need to be thorough.\n\nSo, let me confirm this. The grammar has no production for NT8.

Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, do any of them have NT8 as a non-terminal on the left-hand side? It seems that in the provided list, the only production I see is NT2 \u2192 't9', and then looking through the rest, I don't see NT8 as a LHS. So, NT8 does not have any defined production, meaning it's either a terminal or undefined.\n\nBut in the string, 't8' is part of the input. If NT8 were a terminal, its production would have to be 't8'. But looking at the given rules, I don't see any production where NT8 \u2192 't8' or any other terminal. So that might mean NT8 is undefined, leading to an infinite loop or impossibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in scanning the productions. Let me re-examine the list:\n\n- No NT8 as LHS in all the productions. So, yes, NT8 is undefined, meaning it can't produce any terminal or non-terminal. Therefore, any derivation that requires NT8 cannot proceed further, making it impossible to derive 't8' in the string.\n\nSo, if we have 't8' in the string, and our grammar doesn't have a production for NT8, then the string can't be generated by the grammar, leading to \"No\".\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains \"t8\", and the grammar does not have a production for NT8. \n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The terminals in this case are various 't' followed by numbers, which probably correspond to specific symbols or terminals in the language.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a sequence of terminals: t25, t84, t40, t36, t53, t67, t96. Each of these corresponds directly to a non-terminal in the grammar, as per the production rules. For example, t25 corresponds to NT73, t84 to NT84, etc.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated, we need to see if there's a way to derive this sequence starting from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first rule for S is S -> NT6 NT58. So the first two symbols must correspond to NT6 and NT58. Let's check the string's first two tokens: t25 and t84. \n\nFrom the list, t25 corresponds to NT73, and t84 to NT84. So S produces NT73 and NT84 as the first two symbols. So the string starts with NT73 (t25) and NT84 (t84). \n\nNow, we break down NT73. Looking at the rules, NT73 -> NT8 NT73. Wait, that's a recursive rule where NT73 produces itself and NT8. So it seems like NT73 can be expanded multiple times.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t25, which is NT73. So the first production is S -> NT6 (t25?) No, wait, the first rule is S -> NT6 NT58. So the very first step is to split into NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list the non-terminals and their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT73 -> t25\n- NT84 -> t84\n- NT6 -> t6? Or wait, looking at the rules, I see NT6 -> NT73 NT62, and NT62 is another non-terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string is t25 t84 t40 t36 t53 t67 t96. So the initial step is S, which can produce NT6 and NT58. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t25, which is NT73. But S's first production is S -> NT6 NT58, which would produce t6 (NT6) and t58 (NT58). So how does t25 (NT73) appear first?\n\nWait, that's a problem. If S -> NT6 NT58, then the first symbol in any string derived from S must be NT6 or NT58. So the first token should be t6 (NT6) or t58 (NT58), but the string starts with t25, which is NT73, which is only generated by rules that don't start S. Therefore, S cannot directly produce NT73 as the first symbol because S's rules are S->NT6 NT58.\n\nSo perhaps the string can't be generated because the first term isn't NT6 or NT58. Therefore, the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check the rules. The start symbol is S, and its only production is NT6 NT58. So the initial two symbols in any string generated by S must be t6 and t58, regardless of their further expansion.\n\nBut the given string starts with t25, which is NT73, which is not directly produced by S. So that would make the string invalid. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the start symbol. Maybe S is a non-terminal, and the entire string is built from S.\n\nYes, S is the start symbol, so to generate the string, it must be derived from S, which starts with NT6 and NT58.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I know Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. Some terminals might be present in the base case, but in this grammar, I see that there are rules where certain NTs expand into terminals followed by another NT or another pair. Wait, looking at the grammar, many of the rules have non-terminals only, except for some where terminals like 't25', 't97', etc., appear.\n\nFor example, NT79 -> 't16', so NT79 can produce 't16'. Similarly, NT94 -> 't77', NT73 -> 't25', and so on. These are the base cases where the non-terminals turn into terminals.\n\nThe given string is `t25 t97 t55 t14 t87 t53 t67 t96`. I need to see if each of these terminals can be generated by the grammar and if there's a way to parse the entire string using the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to think about how the grammar could generate a string starting at S. Starting with S, which is NT68 NT62. Wait, no, the grammar is S -> NT68 NT62? Or is it S -> NT6 NT58? Let me check.\n\nWait, the first line is S -> NT6 NT58. So S becomes NT6 and NT58. So to derive the string, the entire string must be a concatenation of two parts from these two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's four parts: t25, t97, t55, t14, then t87, t53, t67, t96. Wait, that's eight terminals, which would require the grammar to generate a string of length 8, which would come from two non-terminals, each producing four terminals. But wait, S is split into two non-terminals, each of which must produce four symbols in this case, assuming each is split into two. Hmm, not sure. Wait, wait, maybe I should think about how many symbols each non-terminal can produce.\n\nWait, each production in CNF either produces a terminal or another non-terminal. But sometimes, non-terminals can produce two non-terminals, which themselves can be terminals or further splits. So to get a string of 8 symbols, each side of S (NT6 and NT58) must generate 4 symbols each as leaves.\n\nWait, but NT6 -> NT73 NT62 (from line `NT68 -> NT63 NT62`? Wait, maybe I'm getting the rules wrong. Let me make sure I parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT79 -> 't16' (so it's a terminal).\n\nNT94 -> 't77' (terminal).\n\nNT73 -> 't25' (terminal).\n\nNT95 -> 't67' (terminal).\n\nOther rules, like NT78 -> NT67 NT73, which would expand into symbols, possibly leading to more non-terminals.\n\nWait, the given string is `t25 t97 t55 t14 t87 t53 t67 t96`. So let's break this string into individual terminals: 't25', 't97', 't55', 't14', 't87', 't53', 't67', 't96'.\n\nNow, to see if each of these terminals can be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77' (line 7)\n- NT73 -> 't25' (line 10)\n- NT19 -> NT37 NT69 (line 13)\n- NT95 -> NT9 NT69 (line 15)\n- NT69 -> 't67' (line 20)\n- NT9 -> 't26' (line 29)\n- NT46 -> 't87' (line 44)\n- NT2 -> 't70' (line 53)\n- NT95 -> NT27 NT66 (line 56)\n- NT27 -> 't4' (line 75)\n- NT38 -> 't68' (line 84)\n- NT56 -> NT95 NT36 (line 55)\n- Wait, maybe I should list all the terminals and their corresponding NTs:\n\n- 't25' comes from NT73\n- 't77' comes from NT94\n- 't67' comes from NT69\n- 't26' comes from NT9\n- 't87' comes from NT46\n- 't4' comes from NT27\n- 't70' comes from NT2\n\nLooking at the string, 't97', 't55', 't14', 't87'... Wait, I don't see 't97' or 't55' in the list of terminals above. Hmm, does any non-terminal produce those?\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT36 -> 't64' (line 32)\n- NT56 -> 't72' (line 55)\n- NT66 -> 't96' (line 62)\nWait, so NT96 is from NT66? But wait, in the given grammar, NT66 is a terminal? No, looking back:\n\nNT66: Let's check line 56: NT56 -> NT95 NT36. And earlier, line 46: NT36 -> 't64'. Line 66: NT66 -> 't96' (line 66?) Wait, looking at the list, I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT66 -> 't96' as one of the rules? Hmm, no, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the list, after NT78, it goes into NT58, then:\n\nNT66 -> 't96' (looking at line 36? Wait, perhaps it's better to redo the list.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines again:\n\nWait, let's go line by line.\n\nLine 1: S -> NT6 NT58\n\nLine 2: NT79 -> NT9 NT66\n\nLine 3: NT63 -> NT94 NT22\n\nLine 4: NT95 -> NT9 NT69\n\nLine 5: NT19 -> NT37 NT69\n\nLine 6: NT65 -> NT38 NT84\n\nLine 7: NT14 -> NT59 NT15\n\nLine 8: NT50 -> NT93 NT6\n\nLine 9: NT78 -> NT67 NT73\n\nLine 10: NT56 -> NT9 NT19\n\nLine 11: NT95 -> NT27 NT66\n\nLine 12: NT9 -> NT68 NT40\n\nLine 13: NT40 -> NT69 NT17\n\nLine 14: NT34 -> NT58 NT65\n\nLine 15: NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nLine 16: NT36 -> NT79 NT2\n\nLine 17: NT40 -> NT74 NT56\n\nLine 18: NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n\nLine 19: NT78 -> NT28 NT73\n\nLine 20: NT58 -> NT84 NT9\n\nLine 21: NT28 -> NT38 NT93\n\nLine 22: NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n\nLine 23: NT85 -> NT95 NT50\n\nLine 24: NT68 -> NT63 NT67\n\nLine 25: NT39 -> NT78 NT46\n\nLine 26: NT85 -> NT87 NT55\n\nLine 27: NT73 -> NT8 NT9\n\nLine 28: NT78 -> NT52 NT80\n\nLine 29: NT50 -> NT85 NT66\n\nLine 30: NT56 -> NT95 NT36\n\nLine 31: NT59 -> NT56 NT95\n\nLine 32: NT52 -> NT19 NT28\n\nLine 33: NT37 -> NT39 NT15\n\nLine 34: NT95 -> NT85 NT6\n\nLine 35: NT73 -> NT8 NT9\n\nLine 36: NT78 -> NT78 NT37\n\nLine 37: NT52"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT9 is defined as NT68 NT40, but NT68 is in the production, and so on. Also, some entries may have the same left-hand side but different right-hand sides, which isn't typical for CNF but seems to be the case here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t3 t84 t40 t3 t82 t95 t3`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse this string using the grammar. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminal productions.\n\nStarting from S, which is the start symbol, we can generate the string step by step, ensuring each step aligns with the grammar.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual symbols: [t12, t3, t84, t40, t3, t82, t95, t3].\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, I need to see if the string can be derived step by step from S.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the string must start with NT6 and then NT58, which each can produce the corresponding terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLet me see what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12' (from NT8 \u2192 't12')\n\nSo, starting with NT8: NT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nThen NT9: Looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40.\n\nWait, but NT9 isn't directly pointing to t3; instead, it's generating more non-terminals. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, hold on. The string starts with t12, which must come from a terminal production. Let me check the grammar for any NT that directly produces t12.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12'\n\nYes, NT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nSo, if any non-terminal reduces to NT8, that would give us t12.\n\nLooking back at the string: It starts with t12, so that suggests that one of the NT's in the derivation is NT8, which immediately produces t12.\n\nThus, to produce t12, the corresponding part in the string must have come from NT8.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is t12, so that suggests that earlier in the derivation, we have NT8, which becomes t12.\n\nBut how did we get to that point? Let's think about the initial S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo S starts as NT6 and NT58. Let's see what each produces.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nSo NT73 becomes NT8 and NT9.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t12 (terminal)\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n\nNow, NT68 (from NT68 \u2192 t? Let's check.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't12' ?\n\nWait, checking the grammar, I don't see NT68 as a terminal. Let me scan:\n\nLooking for NT68 in the production list.\n\nHmm, in the list, NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84  \nNT68 is in NT68 \u2192 't12' ?\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12'  \nBut is there anywhere else that produces 't12'?\n\nYes, NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84  \nThen NT38 \u2192 't68'  \nWait, no, that's for NT38. Let's check:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12' (this is for NT8)\n\nLooking for NT68 \u2192 t? I don't see any terminal for NT68.\n\nHmm, that's an issue. So in the string, the first symbol is t12, which comes from NT8. But in the derivation, NT73 leads to NT8 (which is t12) and NT9 (which is NT68 NT40). So, to get t12, we would have NT8 \u2192 t12, which is okay.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first t12 is at position 1, but in the grammar, from S \u2192 NT6 NT58, both NT6 and NT58 must produce a sequence that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nSo, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62  \nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9  \nNT8 \u2192 t12  \nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40  \nNT68 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, looking back at the production rules, I see NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84, which is production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

My string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived step by step starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it directly produces NT6 NT58.

So I must have a way to derive t25 somewhere.\n\nWait, the start S is NT6 NT58. Let me check what NT6 and NT58 produce. NT6 -> NT73 NT62. NT58 -> NT84 NT9. So, the derived string from S would start with NT73 and NT62 for the first part, and NT84 and NT9 for the second part. So the first two symbols would be 73 and 62, but the string starts with t25.

Let me check the provided rules again.)\n\nWait, looking at the rules, the ones that produce a single terminal are:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n\n- NT79 -> 't16'\n\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n\n- NT15 -> 't94'\n\n- NT69 -> 't67'\n\n- NT46 -> 't28'\n\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n\n- NT38 -> 't68'\n\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n\n- NT46 -> 't87' (Wait, no, that's the same as the previous one.)\n\nWait, okay, so the terminals are: t25, t77, t16, t36, t94, t67, t28, t96, t4, t68, t87, t26, t.\n\nWait, the string given is: t25 t84 t40 t26 t49 t36 t39 t95 t3.\n\nLooking at the string, the third element is t26, which is derived from NT9: NT9 -> t26.\n\nThe first element is t25, which is derived from NT73.\n\nSo, to have t25 as the first step, we need NT73 followed by something else.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S is producing NT6 NT58. So unless NT6 or NT58 can derive to something that starts with t73, which they don't because NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which would produce t73 t62, so the first two symbols would be t73 and t62, not t25.\n\nWait, but the string we have starts with t25. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, maybe the string is not a concatenation of all the symbols but a derivation path. Hmm, no, the string is given, and I have to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73's production is t25.\n\nNT62's production is NT84 NT62 or maybe another? Wait, the rules for NT62 are not given, but looking in the provided rules:\n\nWait, let me list all the NT productions from the given ones:\n\nNT77 -> t77? No, the rules have, e.g., NT73 -> t25, NT79 -> t16, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the NTs have two-character names. For example, NT73 is a single non-terminal symbol that can derive the terminal t25.\n\nSo, if the first part of the string is t25, that would require the first non-terminal to derive t25, which is only possible if the first non-terminal is NT73.\n\nBut according to the start symbol, S is NT6 NT58.\n\nSo unless NT6 or NT58 can derive to something that starts with t73, but looking at NT6's productions, it always goes to NT73 NT62, which starts with NT73 (which is t25) and then NT62. So if S starts as NT6, which goes to t73 t62, then the first two symbols must be t73 t62, but our string starts with t25. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t25. So the first production must be something that leads to NT73. Therefore, perhaps the string is part of a larger derivation, but that's impossible because the string is given. So unless the first production is somehow leading to t25 without the subsequent symbols, but no, the start symbol is S -> NT6 NT58, so the first symbols would be t73 and t62.\n\nThus, the string starts with t25, which would require the first production to start with t25, but S starts with t73 t62, which doesn't match. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something else. Perhaps the string has more steps and maybe multiple productions leading to it. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the string can be built in a different way. Let me try to parse the string.\n\nGiven the string: t25 t84 t40 t26 t49 t36 t39 t95 t3.\n\nWe can see that t25 is from NT73 \u2192 t25.\n\nSo first, we need NT73. So perhaps part of the derivation starts with NT73.\n\nBut the start symbol is NT6 NT58, so unless NT6 or NT58 can produce NT73, but looking at their productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So NT6 would produce t25 t62, making the first two symbols t25 t62. So the string starts with t25, which is possible. Then the third symbol is t84. So after t25 t62, we have t84, which would require the next production to include t84.\n\nWait, but let's think about the structure. S \u2192 NT6 NT58 \u2192 NT73 NT62 NT58.\n\nWait, that's not correct; NT6 is NT73 NT62 and NT58 is NT84 NT9.\n\nSo the derived string from S would be t25 t62 t84 t9.\n\nBut the string we have is t25 t84 t40 t26 t49 t36 t39 t95 t3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match.

I need to figure out if the string can be generated by the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It starts with the initial symbol S, which expands to NT6 NT58. Each NT has production rules that break them down into other NT symbols or terminal symbols (those with 't' like t12, t27, etc.). My string is a sequence of these 't' terms: t12 t3 t97 t55 t26 t74 t40 t39 t26.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from S through a series of expansions. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a a terminal. So, ultimately, I should be able to trace back the way this string could have been generated.\n\nLet me see the string again: t12 t3 t97 t55 t26 t74 t40 t39 t26. It has nine elements, which suggests that the derivation might involve several expansion steps. Let me try to map out how this could happen.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the string starts with T6 \u2192 something. Looking at NT6's productions, I see NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then, each of those might expand further. Wait, but the string starts with t12. Let me check the NT symbols that can produce t12.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT46 \u2192 t28 and NT38 \u2192 t68, but where's t12? Hmm, NT44 \u2192 t83, NT55 \u2192 t92, NT39 \u2192 t26, etc. I don't see t12 yet. Wait, looking again, there's NT8 \u2192 't12'! So, perhaps the first part is NT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nBut wait, NT8 isn't directly in the initial production. Because S starts with NT6 NT58. So maybe the first t12 comes from expanding NT6 or NT58.\n\nWait, let's see. The string starts with t12, so maybe the production starts with NT6 expanding to something that can produce t12. Let me check the NT6 productions again.\n\nLooking up NT6's rules: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, as above. Hmm, but those don't directly lead to t12. Let's see, maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps looking further in the grammar, I see NT2 appears as a terminal when certain non-terminals expand. For example, NT2 \u2192 t70 and others. Also, NT8 \u2192 t12, so if somewhere we have NT8, that gives us t12.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with t12, which comes from NT8. So perhaps S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and one of the NTs is NT8. Let me check if S can produce NT8 anywhere.\n\nLooking at NT8's production: NT8 \u2192 t12. So, if in the initial expansion S goes to NT6 NT58, perhaps one of those non-terminals needs to produce something else. Wait, no, because NT8 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some symbols end with 't' followed by a number, like NT2 \u2192 t9 or t70, but others are pure non-terminals, like NT6, NT74, etc. Wait, no, looking more carefully, actually, the non-terminals are those that don't end with 't'. For example, NT2 is a terminal because one of its productions is NT2 \u2192 't9'. Similarly, NT46 \u2192 't28' is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, the non-terminals are the ones on the left side of the arrows, and the right side may include both non-terminals and terminals. So in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals and others produce non-terminals.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and we have NT6 and NT58, each can expand further. Let me see if any of these can directly produce terminals. For instance, looking at NT6, it expands to NT73 NT62. Looking at NT73, it has NT8 \u2192 t12. So, maybe NT73 can produce t12.\n\nWait, let me check NT73's rules: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT8 \u2192 t12, QT9 \u2192 etc. Wait, so if NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, then when NT8 expands, it gives t12, but then NT9 would need to expand to something that eventually gives a terminal. But in the string, the first part is t12, followed by t3. That suggests that after NT73 (which gives t12), the next thing after NT73 is NT9, which needs to produce t3.\n\nLooking at NT9, does it have a production that gives a terminal? Let me find NT9's productions. Hmm, looking through the list, I see NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66, but more importantly, I see NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me scan the list again: Yes, there's NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, but then NT95 \u2192 etc. Wait, no, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\nNT46 \u2192 t28\nNT95 \u2192 NT94?\n\nWait, no, let me parse the grammar rules line by line.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the list format. Let me go through the rules to find terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see instances where a rule has an arrow pointing to a terminal followed by a number. For example:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t9\nNT3 \u2192 t26\nNT4 \u2192 t83\nNT6 \u2192 t73\nNT7 \u2192 t74\nAnd others, like NT22 \u2192 't87', etc.\n\nWait, I think the terminals are those non-terminals whose productions end with 't' followed by a number. So, for example, NT2 \u2192 t9 is a terminal.\n\nSo to get the string t12 t3 t97 t55 t26 t74 t40 t39 t26, I need to generate that exact sequence through a series of expansions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, perhaps by starting from the left and seeing if the initial production can match a prefix.\n\nFirst token is t12. From the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t12?\n\nLooking for 'a \u2192 t12' rules. From the list, I see NT8 \u2192 t12. So one path is to have NT8 produce t12. So perhaps we have a path where one non-terminal eventually becomes NT8, which then becomes t12.\n\nLooking at the initial S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So perhaps one of these can be NT8. Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT6 NT58, then NT6 and NT58 must be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT58: in the rules, I see several times it's on the left, such as:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nHmm, looking for NT58 \u2192 ... Let me check all NT58 rules.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\nNT58 \u2192 NT34 NT95\n\nSo NT58 can expand into these combinations.\n\nIf I pick NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9, then each of these can expand further.\n\nNow, looking at the string, after t12, the next is t3. So after NT8 which gives t12, we need to have the next expansion produce t3.\n\nSo, after NT8, perhaps another NT that, when expanded, gives t3. Looking for a NT that can produce t3. Let's check the list.\n\nNT3 \u2192 t26? Wait, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT46 \u2192 t28, NT95 \u2192 t94, but where is t3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, checking the list again. I see NT39 \u2192 t58, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I'm looking for a NT that produces t3. Looking through the rules, perhaps NT46 \u2192 t28, which is 't28', not 't3'.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see: the second token is t3, so perhaps after generating t12 (from NT8), the next part is t3, which comes from another expansion.\n\nWait, but how do we get t3?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making it easier to parse or analyze.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure ensures that the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nGiven the grammar, I notice that many rules are of the form NT... \u2192 pair of NTs or a terminal. It's quite extensive, so analyzing it directly might be time-consuming. However, the string given is a sequence of terminals only, meaning it doesn't involve any non-terminals. So, the entire string must be generated through a series of expansions that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nEach terminal in the string must be matched by a rule in the grammar. So, my first step is to check if each terminal in the string is directly produced by a rule, or if it can be derived through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t12 t26 t97 t36 t39 t3 t74 t40 t39 t26`.\n\nLet me list each terminal and see if it's present as a rule.\n\n1. t12: Check if there's a rule NT... \u2192 t12. Looking through the rules, I see that NT8\u2192t12 and NT85\u2192t58. So, t12 is directly produced by NT8. So, the first t12 can be generated.\n\n2. t26: Similarly, check if there's a rule that produces t26. Scanning the rules, I see NT98 has NT27\u2192t4, but elsewhere, looking for t26. Wait, from the rules, there's nothing directly producing t26. Hmm, did I miss it? Let me double-check. Looking through all NT rules, I don't see an explicit rule generating t26 except maybe via multiple expansions, but since in CNF, all productions are either to a single terminal or two non-terminals, t26 must be directly produced. Oh, wait in the initial rules, I don't see a production for t26. Wait, looking through, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the rules. Let me go through each terminal in the string and see if they're directly present.\n\nWait, let me check the list of rules again. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT17\u2192't96'\n- NT9\u2192't26'\nAh, yes! NT9\u2192t26. So, yes, t26 is directly produced by NT9.\n\nWait, the second t26 would be t26, so we need to generate t26, which is directly given by NT9 \u2192 t26.\n\nWait, but in the string, the indices are: t12, t26, t97, etc. So I need to check each one.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and check each one:\n\n1. t12 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 present as a direct production.\n2. t26 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 present.\n3. t97 \u2192 Looking at the rules, do any NT rules produce t97? Let me check. Scanning, I don't see an NT rule directly producing t97. Hmm, that's a problem. Because in CNF, each terminal must be directly derived or generated by the rules, as there are no intermediate steps. So, unless t97 is a rule, it can't be generated. Looking through all NT rules, I don't see any that produce t97, like NT47 or NT97. So, t97 is not a terminal in any rule, meaning it's not directly produced. Therefore, the string must fail here because we can't generate t97.\n\nWait, that might be a mistake. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the string has 't97' as the third element. If the grammar doesn't have a production for 't97', then it's impossible to generate that term. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I overlooked a rule somewhere. So, let me go through all the NT rules to check if any produce t97.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT17\u2192t96\n- NT9\u2192t26\n- NT74\u2192t77 and others, like NT74\u2192NT9 NT66\n- NT22\u2192t87\n- And other rules which are all to other NTs.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, I don't see any rule that produces t97. For example, is there any NT rule that has 't97'? From the given rules, I don't see any. So, 't97' can't be generated because it's not present as a terminal in any rule.\n\nTherefore, since the string contains 't97', which is not a terminal in any production, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars work by expanding non-terminals into other symbols, possibly including more non-terminals that need to be expanded. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That also means that each production is a direct expansion without any symbols except non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the only non-terminals are various NT followed by numbers, like NT74, NT95, etc. The rest are terminals, represented by 't' followed by numbers, or single letters like 'T' or 'F' which I think here are actually terminals but might have been written with 't' in front, so I need to check the rules carefully.\n\nThe string to check is a series of terminals and non-terminals, but actually, all the symbols here are terminals (since they start with 't' except for a few single letters, but looking back, actually the grammar only has non-terminals as NT followed by numbers. So in the string, everything except maybe some 't's and single letters like 'T' or 'F' are terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's a rule NT74 -> NT9 NT66, etc., but in the string, all symbols seem to be 't's followed by numbers or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the string, the tokens are all 't's followed by numbers, like 't12', 't14', etc., except for a few. Wait, looking more carefully, the string is \"t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t26 t67 t64 t97 t46\". So each token is a 't' followed by a number. So each token in the string is a terminal, meaning that in the grammar, they must all be directly derived from terminal symbols or perhaps one of the NT rules expanding to that.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand to other non-terminals, others expand directly to terminals. For example, I notice that some of the non-terminals like NT73 have a production rule that includes the terminal t25, but others in the string are longer. Wait, let's check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT73 -> t25. Similarly, NT78 -> t67 and t73. Wait, no, NT78 is actually a production that splits into two parts, like NT78 -> t67 NT73 or something else? Wait, no, looking more carefully, I see that some NT rules have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT78 -> NT67 NT73. But other NT rules like NT58 -> t46, so that's a direct terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, all the parts are like t12, t14, etc., which are all terminals, meaning that each of these must be produced by some NT rule that has a direct expansion to that terminal. So for each token like 't12', I need to find an NT rule that produces directly that 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can make a note of which NT rules directly produce terminals.

First, I'll start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see that the non-terminals include S, NT2, NT3, NT6, and so on, each expanding into other non-terminals or terminals ending with 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe target string is a sequence of terminals: t12, t14, t87, t53, t77, t3, t67, t79, t97, t55, t3. So, the approach here is to find a derivation path from the start symbol S to this string using the given productions.\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, I'll probably need to do a top-down parsing or use something like the CYK algorithm. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string step by step, looking for applicable productions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the productions that end with a terminal (i.e., the ones where the LHS is a terminal). From the grammar:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 t67\n- NT97 \u2192 t79 (wait, no, looking back, I think I might be mixing up. Let me check: the grammar has NT79 \u2192 t16, NT36 \u2192 t64, etc. Wait, no, the NT productions are all starting with NT followed by a number. Looking through the list, the actual terminal productions are:\n\nNT79 \u2192 t67 (Wait, no, let me check the grammar again.

Now, the string to evaluate has 't12', 't3', etc. I need to see if each 't' in the string corresponds to one of these rules.\n\nLooking at each token in the string:\n\n1. t12: Check if any rule produces t12. Looking through the list, I don't see NT12 in any rule. The closest is NT8 -> t12. But in the string, it's t12, not NT8. So unless t12 is a terminal itself, which it doesn't seem to be based on the rules, t12 cannot be produced directly unless it's an NT. So, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each rule's RHS is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for t12 to appear, there must be an NT rule with \"t12\" as its terminal, but looking through the rules, I don't see any such rule. So perhaps t12 is part of an NT that further reduces. Or maybe it's an error because there's no production for t12. So this could be a No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to parse the string step by step. Let me think differently. Maybe I should try to parse the string backward using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can list all the possible terminals that the grammar can produce and see if the string matches.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the rules, the RHS terminals are:\n\nt77, t25, t16, t36, t94, t27, t14, t70, t64, t72, t67, t28, t96, t49, t6, t3, t94, t77, t84, t79, t2, t87, t58, t39, t63, t95, t82, t74, t8, t44, t12.\n\nWait, t12 is not listed as a direct terminal in any rule. The only rule that produces 't12' is NT8 -> t12. So unless t12 is an NT, it can't be derived. But in the string, we have 't12' as a terminal, which would require a rule where the RHS is just 't12'. Since such a rule doesn't exist, the string has t12 which cannot be generated by the grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of CFG where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided fits this structure since all the non-terminals on the left are producing two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe challenge here is to see if each 't' in the string is being derived correctly according to the grammar. Since the string consists of a sequence of terminals, I need to see if there's a way to parse it using the given productions.\n\nStarting with the leftmost symbol, which is 't12'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT8 is a non-terminal that produces 't12', as per the production NT2 \u2192 't6' and the way non-terminals might combine. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, NT2 appears as a production, but I think NT65 also has a production NT65 -> NT38 NT84 which, combining with another rule, might eventually produce 't12'. Alternatively, maybe I need to look for direct productions of 't12' by a non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see that NT2 \u2192 't6' and NT28 \u2192 NT93 NT73, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the start symbol S is NT6 NT58, so we'll need to build the string from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to think about the number of steps. Since the grammar is in CNF, each application of a production reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So for a string of length n, the derivation depth is n.\n\nThe given string has 12 tokens. So starting from S, which is two non-terminals, we'll need to split this into 12 terminals, meaning each step involves expanding non-terminals into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me try to find possible derivations step by step. First, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string starts with 't6' and 't58'. Wait, no: actually, S is NT6 and NT58, and each of those will need to produce something.\n\nLooking at NT6's production: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then, each of those can be further expanded.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. NT8 is 't8' and NT9 is 't9'. Wait, looking at the productions, NT8 \u2192 't8' is a terminal. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't6' is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the terminal 't12'. From the given grammar, the only way to get 't12' is from NT2 \u2192 't12'? Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, the production is:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nBut in the provided grammar snippet, it's written as NT2 \u2192 't6', so maybe that's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps NT8 corresponds to that.\n\nWait, let me list out the terminals and their corresponding NTs:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\nNT28 \u2192 NGT93 NGT73, but that might not be relevant.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any NT that directly produces 't12'. From the terminal list, the productions are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\nNT8 \u2192 't8'\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, I don't see NT12 as a terminal in the productions. Wait, looking again, the user's provided grammar has:\n\nIn the production rules, I see:\n\nFor example, NT56 -> NT9 NT19\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier. Checking through:\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing 't12'. Wait, actually, in the initial part of the grammar, under NT42 I see NT2 \u2192 't12', but checking the provided grammar, I don't see that.\n\nWait, here's the grammar provided:\n\nThe user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nthen various NT productions, including:\n\nNT28 -> NT93 NT73\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT66\n\nNT2 -> NT44 NT14\n\nWait, but looking through the later productions, I see:\n\nAt the very end, it says:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing correctly. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar lines:\n\nAt the end:\n\nNT2 -> 't6'\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nNT2 -> 't12'\n\nBut I think the user might have had a typo. Wait, actually, checking the provided grammar again:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\n... lines ... near the end:\n\nNT2 -> NT6\n\nWait, I'm not seeing 't12' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 -> NT87 NT46\n\nAnd further down, the last few lines:\n\nNT69 -> 't67'\n\nNo, I think 't12' isn't appearing as a terminal in the provided productions. Wait, but in the initial part, the user wrote:\n\nHere's the string: `t12 t3 t84 t55 t26 t74 t46 t49 t40 t95 t95 t3`.\n\nBut in the grammar, I don't see any production that gives 't12' directly. I think I must have made a mistake in interpreting the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, the production:\n\nNT28 -> NT93 NT73\n\nBut the user wrote:\n\nWait, no, let me re-examine the grammar as provided:\n\nThe grammar is written in a list format, each line is a production.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT2 --> 't9'\n\nWait, but that's conflicting. Maybe I'm missing the rule for 't12'. Wait, perhaps the user mistyped, and in the actual grammar, 't12' is present. Alternatively, perhaps 't12' is not present, which would already make the string impossible.\n\nWait, in the user's provided grammar, let's look:\n\nIn the grammar lines:\n\nI see:\n\nNT2 -> 't9'\n\nWait, that means that the production for NT2 is 't9', but the string has 't12'. That would mean that 't12' is not a terminal, so the grammar can't produce 't12', making the string invalid.\n\nWait, but the grammar starts with NT2 -> NT6 NT73, but perhaps that splits into more NTs.\n\nBut wait, if in the production list, the user has:\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces 't12':\n\nThe only terminal in the string that is present in the grammar as a terminal is 't12'? Wait, in the provided grammar, looking through the lines, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't12'. The only 't's are from NT2, 3, 6, 7,8, etc.\n\nWait, the production NT2 is given as 't9', as per:\n\nLooking through the list, I see a line:\n\nNT2 -> 't9'\n\nWhich suggests that 't9' is the only terminal that NT2 can produce.\n\nSo if 't12' is in the string, but there's no production for NT12, then that would be impossible. Because the only way terminals are produced is if a non-terminal directly reduces to a single terminal. If 't12' is a terminal, there must be a production that's NTsomething -> 't12'.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, the user hasn't included any NT that produces 't12'. Therefore, the string contains 't12' which can't be derived from the grammar, because the grammar only has 't9', 't6', 't7', etc.\n\nWait, but the user's grammar actually has several lines that produce 't' with numbers, like:\n\nNT44 -> 't83'\n\nWait, no, I'm looking again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT34 -> NT58 NT65\n\nNT65 -> NT38 NT84\n\nNT84 -> NT34 NT93\n\nWait, and so on.\n\nBut wait, towards the end, the user wrote:\n\nNT2 -> 't12'\n\nBut in the actual grammar provided, the user wrote:\n\nNT2 --> 't9'\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar:\n\nYes, here it is:\n\nNT2 -> 't12'\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier when looking.

The string to evaluate is `t25 t97 t55 t3 t49 t36 t95 t95 t3 t82 t95 t26`. Hmm, that's quite a long string. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain algorithms, like the CYK parser, more efficient.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's in CNF. All the production rules either have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. Some examples I see include:\n- S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n- NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66\n- NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69\n- And so on, with many more rules.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t25 t97 t55 t3 t49 t36 t95 t95 t3 t82 t95 t26`. These all look like the strings that the non-terminals in the grammar can expand into. So, my goal is to see if there's a derivation path that starts from the start symbol S and ends with this string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the first rule S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the string must ultimately derive from NT6 and NT58. Let me check what each of these non-terminals can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n- NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nSo, NT6 goes to NT73 and NT62. Let's see what those are:\n- NT73 has rules like NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 and NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62 via NT93 or NT65, etc. Wait, I need to look up all possible productions for NT73 and NT62.\n\nFirst, let's focus on NT73:\n- NT73 can produce 't25' directly, or it can split into NT8 and NT9. If it becomes NT8, what does NT8 produce? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT8 rule. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nWait, I see rules like NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9? Or is it NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9? Let me check the rules again. Yes, looking at the list:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nSo, if NT73 splits into NT8 and NT9, we need to see what NT8 and NT9 can do. Looking for NT8: searching through the productions, I don't see NT8 being on the left-hand side except as part of rules for other non-terminals. It seems NT8 might not have a production rule, which might be a problem because then NT8 can't derive any further. Wait, did I miss it? Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT8. Hmm, that suggests that NT8 is a terminal or that I might have misread the grammar. Let's check the rules again. Oh, under \"Other Rules\":\n- NT79 \u2192 't16', etc. Wait, does any rule define NT8? Let me see. I don't see NT8 \u2192 something. That's odd. Maybe I missed it somewhere.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, the only NT8 rule I see is in NT44 \u2192 't83' but that's not relevant here. Let me check again. Maybe I missed it. Hmm, perhaps NT8 is actually a terminal because in the string we have 't8', but wait, looking at the string, I don't see 't8'. The string has 't25', 't97', etc., but no 't8'. So, maybe NT8 is a terminal, but in the string, all the terminals are defined elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the rules for any that produce 't8'. Let me go through the rules again. Oh, I see under NT84, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. That's production for NT58. Not for NT8. Hmm. So perhaps NT8 is a terminal, but in the string, I don't see a 't8'. That's a point against the string being generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see if there's another way through the grammar. Let's see other paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to construct the parse tree for the given string.\n\nThe string is: t25 t97 t55 t3 t49 t36 t95 t95 t3 t82 t95 t26\n\nLet's see. The entire string should be derived from S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, the entire string must be equal to the concatenation of NT6's derivation and NT58's derivation.\n\nLet me first try to handle NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 can produce 't25' directly, as one of its rules. If it does, then the first part 't25' could come from NT73.\n\nThen NT62 has rules. Let's see: NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62 via another production? Or perhaps NT62 can produce 't97' and other things. Wait, looking at the list:\n- NT62's rules include NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62 (perhaps) or NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT56. Wait, looking again:\n\nActually, looking in the list:\n- NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62? Or wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me scan all the rules again, focusing on NT73 and NT62.\n\nWait, the rules include:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n\nSo, if NT73 can start with 't25', that could explain 't25' at the beginning of the string.\n\nThen, for NT62, let's see its rules. Scanning the list, looking for NT62 on the left side. I see:\n- NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62 (maybe). Also, looking for NT62 \u2192 ...? Wait, checking:\n\nIn the list:\n- NT97 \u2192 't97' is one of the rules. Wait, looking for NT62, I see:\n- NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62? Or perhaps not. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n- NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62 (yes, looking back), but I might have misformatted. Wait, looking through, I see:\n\nWait, the list includes:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62\n- NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT56\n\nSo, NT62 can produce 't97' and 't84' in combination with other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, 't97' is a terminal, produced by NT97: \"NT97 \u2192 't97'\". So, for NT62, if it can produce 't97' as part of its derivation, then the 't97' in the string could come from NT62's first part.\n\nWait, but let's try to map this out.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Assuming the first part of the string 't25' comes from NT73, which is one part of NT6. So, the first non-terminal derivation would be NT73 \u2192 't25'. Then, NT62 needs to produce the rest after 't25'.\n\nWait, no, because NT6 is NT73 NT62, so the entire string generated by NT6 would be something like (derivation of NT73) followed by (derivation of NT62).\n\nSo, if NT73 \u2192 't25', then the rest of the string after 't25' would come from NT62's derivation.\n\nBut the string is t25 t97 t55 t3 t49 t36 t95 t95 t3 t82 t95 t26.\n\nSo, after 't25', we have 't97 t55 ... t26'.\n\nWait, but it's better to draw a parse tree or see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down approach could help.\n\nAnother angle: looking for the presence of 't95' and other specific terminals that might have to come from certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT95 can produce either a terminal or non-terminals.\n\nNT95's rules:\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars have rules that produce strings, and in this case, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side or a single terminal. \n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar rules. The top-level rule is S -> NT6 NT58, so S is the start symbol. That means the entire string starts with NT6 and NT58. Each of these NT symbols like NT6, NT58 represents a non-terminal that expands into other symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t25 and t84. I need to see if NT6 and NT58 can expand to t25 and t84 respectively. Wait, in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, for NT6, I should check its production rules.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- NT68 -> NT63 NT62\n- NT46 -> NT55 NT61 (Wait, no, looking at the rules, it's 'NT46 -> NT87 NT66')\nWait, let's list out the NT6's productions. Oh, looking at the grammar, I see NT68 has two rules: NT68 -> NT63 NT62 and NT68 -> NT79 NT2. Also, NT73 has NT73 -> NT8 NT9, and NT79 -> NT27 NT66. So maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the first rule is S -> NT6 NT58. So the start is NT6 and NT58. The first token is t25, so I need to see if NT6 can produce t25.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules:\n\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- Not directly a terminal. So I have to expand NT73 and NT62 further.\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9. So NT73 becomes NT8 and NT9.\n\nThen NT8 has rules like NT8 -> t12, or more expansions. Looking for t8, which is the next token in the string. The rule NT8 can be t12, but not directly. Let me think.\n\nWait, the string is t25 t84 t46 t82 t95 t77 t87 t53 t8 t4 t96 t67 t9.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S is NT6 NT58. So first token is t25, which should come from NT6. But NT6 doesn't directly produce a terminal, so I need to see how it expands. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should build a parse tree based on the given string and see if it conforms to the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t25, t84, t46, t82, t95, t77, t87, t53, t8, t4, t96, t67, t9.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So each step in parsing consumes a terminal or a non-terminal split into two parts.\n\nBut building a parse tree from the string might be challenging. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the string from the root and see if it can be broken down as per the grammar rules.\n\nWait, S -> NT6 NT58. The entire string must be the result of expanding NT6 and NT58. So the entire string is a concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo the first part, NT6, should produce a substring that ends where NT58 starts. Then NT58 should produce the rest.\n\nLooking at the token sequence, t25 is likely from NT6 and t84 from NT58? Or maybe more tokens.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t25, so perhaps NT6 expands to t25... and NT58 to the rest, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can break down the string step by step, checking each part against the grammar.\n\nLet me start with the first symbol, t25. The symbols are in order, so t25 is the first symbol, followed by t84, and so on.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT symbols only expand into other NTs or terminals. So to get t25 from NT6, which is in NT6's production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT6:\n\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- So to get t25, we need NT73 and NT62 to produce t25, which is a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT73's production rules:\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9\nSo NT73 is two non-terminals. Therefore, t25 must come from a path where NT8 or NT9 produces t25. Wait, but in the grammar, are any of the NT symbols able to produce t25 directly?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> NT8 NT9\n- NT8 -> t12 or other expansions\n- NT9 -> t26 or other\n- So perhaps t25 comes from a deeper expansion.\n\nWait, but none of the NTs directly produce 't25.' So that's confusing. Because the first symbol is t25, but NT6->NT73 NT62. So for t25, it must expand through NT73 and NT62, each of which may produce more NTs until we get to a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT symbol that produces a terminal 't25.' So perhaps the first symbol t25 cannot be generated by any NT symbol in the grammar, which would mean that the entire string is not generated by this grammar. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, checking all the NT rules: I see that NT73 has NT73->NT8 NT9, and NT8 has various options, including t12. NT9 can produce t26. But t25 is not directly produced by any rule. So perhaps the string is not possible because there's no NT that directly produces t25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a rule. Let me check the list again:\n\nLooking through all NT symbols, none of them directly produce 't25'. So the production NT73->NT8 NT9 leads to t12 and t26, not t25. Similarly, NT79 has NT79->NT27 NT66, which could produce some tokens, but not t25.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look further down. Let me see:\n\nNT94 -> 't77' (from the grammar), so that's a terminal. NT73->NT8 NT9. NT8 has a rule NT8->t12 or other NTs. So t25 is not directly produced by any NT. Therefore, the string starts with t25, which cannot be generated, meaning the answer is 'No.'\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Maybe the entire string is a single terminal, but starting with t25 isn't possible if NT doesn't produce t25.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-220","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t12 t3 t97 t40 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t74 t55 t39 t26`. Hmm, that's a pretty long string with a bunch of `t` followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side except for the start symbol, which can go directly to a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to be in the correct form. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So each non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals until they reach the terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But wait, maybe I can also approach it by trying to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out the production rules that end with terminals because those are the building blocks. For example:\n\nNT94 \u2192 't77'\nNT73 \u2192 't25'\nNT79 \u2192 't16'\nNT63 \u2192 't36'\nNT15 \u2192 't94'\nAnd so on. Each of these non-terminals directly produce a single `t` followed by a number. \n\nI think the string is composed of several such terminals. Let me break it down piece by piece:\n\nLooking at the string: t12, t3, t97, t40, t77, t87, t53, t67, t96, t74, t55, t39, t26.\n\nI'll start by identifying which non-terminals correspond to each of these. For example, t12 likely comes from NT8, as I see a rule NT8 \u2192 't12'. Similarly, t3 might come from NTsomething. Wait, I need to check each production rule and see where each terminal appears on the right-hand side.\n\nLet me go through each terminal and find which non-terminal it belongs to:\n\n- t12: NT8\n- t3: Looking at the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't26', NT34 \u2192 't36', etc. Wait, t3 isn\u2019t listed in the provided rules as a direct terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, here's NT65 \u2192 't82', but I don't see NT3. Maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about direct terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be divided into a sequence of these terminals, each generated by a non-terminal in the grammar. Since each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals recursively, the string length should be 2^n where n is the number of productions. The string has 13 terms, which is not a power of two, so that might already be a red flag. Wait, no, in CNF, the maximum length is 2^n. Let's see: for the string to be of length L, we need n such that 2^n >= L. If L=13, then n would be at least 4 since 2^3=8 <13 <=16=2^4. But I'm not sure if that directly applies here because the start symbol might produce two symbols at each step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to parse the string step by step. Let's look at each part:\n\nThe string starts with t12. From the rules, t12 comes from NT8 \u2192 't12'. So the root of the parse tree would likely start with S, which breaks into NT6 and NT58. Let's see if t12 is part of NT6 or NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6: the production is NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then NT73 \u2192 't25' and NT62 \u2192 't84'. So t12 can't come from NT6 because that would produce t25 and t84, not t12. Alternatively, looking at NT58, its production is NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93, and NT9 \u2192 't3'. But wait, this seems complicated.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can check each production rule ending in the given string terms to see which non-terminal they originate from.\n\nLet's list each terminal and the non-terminal producing it:\n\nt12 \u2192 NT8\nt3 \u2192 ?\nt97 \u2192 NT9\nt40 \u2192 NT40\nt77 \u2192 NT94\nt87 \u2192 NT87\nt53 \u2192 NT53\nt67 \u2192 NT67\nt96 \u2192 NT96\nt74 \u2192 NT74\nt55 \u2192 NT55\nt39 \u2192 NT39\nt26 \u2192 NT26\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- t12: NT8 \u2192 't12'\n- t97: NT97 \u2192 't97'\n- t40: There's no direct rule for t40, but wait, looking again: NT50 \u2192 NT93 NT6, which leads to t93 and t6. Wait, no, t6 is a terminal. Let's find which non-terminals end directly in t40. Checking, I don't see a direct rule. Wait, maybe I got this wrong. Let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, and NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93, and so on, maybe there's a chain down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for a possible parse tree that can generate the string step by step.\n\nAnother idea: the string has 13 elements, which is 2^3 +1, which doesn't fit neatly into a binary tree because binary trees have 2^n leaves. 2^3=8, 2^4=16, so 13 isn't a power of two, so it might not be possible. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe the grammar can generate a string with 13 terminal symbols even if it's not a power of two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to see if each terminal can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar and build the parse tree accordingly.\n\nLet me start with t12: it comes from NT8. Then, looking at NT8's productions, it's only NT85 \u2192 NT95 NT55 for t77. Wait, no, NT85 has some rules, but in the provided grammar, it's written as NT85 \u2192 NT95 NT55. Hmm, perhaps I need to track back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to try to identify the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built from S by expanding and then down. Let's think about how S is defined: S\u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, if S is the root, it needs to produce two symbols: the first part and the second part. The string given is 13 terms, so each production step doubles the count until we reach 13. But 13 isn't a power of two, so perhaps the grammar can't generate this string. Alternatively, maybe the initial expansion can lead to multiple non-terminals, but I need to check the grammar's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see how many non-terminals each step would introduce. Let's start with S, which splits into NT6 and NT58. Let's see what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 \u2192 't25', NT62 \u2192 't84'. So, taking NT6, it can only produce two terminals: t25 and t84. But in our string, the first part is t12, which comes from NT8, not NT6. So maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal can produce two non-terminals, which can then produce more, until we reach the terminals. But with 13 terminals, that would require a parse tree where the number of leaves is 13. Since binary trees have leaves as powers of two, 13 isn't possible, which would mean that the string can't be generated. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the case because the grammar doesn't specify how many symbols are in the string; perhaps the string's length isn't constrained by the grammar's structure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the grammar is designed to produce specific combinations. For example, NT65 produces t82, but not t3. So, perhaps some terminals can't be produced, making the string invalid. But the string includes t3, and looking through the rules, I don't see any production that leads to t3. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals in the string again and see if their corresponding non-terminals exist"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-234","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t12 t14 t87 t53 t67 t96 t84 t46 t82 t95 t26 t82 t95 t26`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars have production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminals or terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's a list of productions. Each production either has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. For example, some start with S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and others have a single terminal like NT2 \u2192 't9'. So, each production is consistent with CNF.\n\nThe string we're checking consists of a series of terminals separated by spaces. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nOne approach is to model the reduction process: start with the string and see if we can reduce it to the start symbol using the inverse of the productions. Each step in the reduction would involve applying a production rule in reverse, replacing a substring (which is a terminal or a sequence matching a production's right-hand side) with a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in CNF can have a non-empty right-hand side of two non-terminals or a terminal, the length of the string generated by the grammar must be a power of two when starting from S, because each step replaces a single non-terminal with two, leading to exponential growth. However, the string here has 15 terminals, which is not a power of two (2^4=16, 2^3=8). Wait, 15 isn't a power of two, so that might be an issue. But perhaps the string isn't fully expanded yet, or maybe the start symbol is being expanded in steps beyond the maximum length, but that might make it impossible. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding that part.\n\nWait, actually, in the Chomsky Normal Form, a derivation starts with a single non-terminal and each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols doubles each time. However, if the terminals in the string can be matched directly, then the order could vary, but the count must fit the structure.\n\nWait, but the given grammar includes some productions that directly produce terminals, like NT2 \u2192 't9'. So perhaps the initial expansion isn't fully building up the full tree, but parts are being expanded directly.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and see if I can break it down into parts that match productions.\n\nThe string is: `t12 t14 t87 t53 t67 t96 t84 t46 t82 t95 t26 t82 t95 t26`\n\nFirst, I should list all the terminal symbols in order: t12, t14, t87, t53, t67, t96, t84, t46, t82, t95, t26, t82, t95, t26.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's defined as S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S initially produces two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. Therefore, the string we're evaluating must start with symbols derived from NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, I can split the string into two parts that correspond to NT6 and NT58. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first part is up to some point before a symbol from NT58 starts, and the second part corresponds to NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, let me see if I can find where NT6 and NT58 are split.\n\nNT6 is likely to produce something ending with t2, t4, t5, etc., looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. And NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT97. Wait, but in the grammar, I don't see NT97. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see some like NT62 \u2192 NT68 NT40, etc. Wait, perhaps I should map out the possible sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically. Each non-terminal can only produce certain sequences, so I can model this as building up the string by matching each production step.\n\nI can use a recursive approach, checking if the string can be divided using each production and seeing if the resulting substrings can be generated from the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLet's start with the entire string and try to split it into parts based on the productions.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to model this using a top-down parsing method, trying to reduce the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model each non-terminal and see what kind of terminal strings they can generate.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n1.

NT79 \u2192 NT71 NT16 \u2192 Wait, actually, checking the given grammar: NT79 \u2192 't16', so 't16' is a terminal from NT79. So I think I might have miswritten that. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the grammar lists:\n\nNT79 \u2192 't16'\n\nSimilarly, NT69 \u2192 't67'\n\nWait, so each production that ends with a single terminal is a production where the non-terminal is replaced by that specific terminal. So NT79 can be replaced by 't16'; same for others.\n\nSimilarly, NT94 \u2192 't77'; NT73 \u2192 't25'; etc.\n\nSo, back to the overall string. I need to see if it's possible to split the string into sequences that match the possible derivations.\n\nLet me start by looking at the beginning of the string: 't12 t14 t87 t53 t67 t96 t84 t46 t82 t95 t26 t82 t95 t26'\n\nI'll consider that S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo NT6 and NT58 need to be derived from the string.\n\nFirst, let's split the string into two parts: the part that starts with NT6 and the part that starts with NT58.\n\nLooking for NT6 in the string:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nSo NT6 is derived as NT73 followed by NT62.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right. All the productions fit that, so that's good.\n\nThe goal is to derive the string using these rules. Each token in the string is a terminal, so I need to see if each of these corresponds to a production ending in that terminal. Alternatively, since each production leads to a terminal via a chain of productions, I can model this as starting from the start symbol and working towards the string, or maybe the other way around, since derivation is top-down.\n\nWait, but in CNF, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each step consumes two symbols in the string, but sometimes the productions lead to terminals. So maybe I can work backwards, using the string as a list of terminals and trying to match the grammar's productions in reverse.\n\nLet me see.

Looking at the first production: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58.

But since it's a leftmost derivation, we start with S and keep applying productions to the leftmost non-terminal until all are terminals.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated because for a string of 14 symbols, each production could potentially add two symbols, so the length can vary. Alternatively, maybe I can work backwards, starting from the string and checking if each symbol can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nYes, that might be easier. Let's reverse the string first: t44 t67 t27 t62 t97 t85 t58 t39 t74 t84 t55 t93 t79 t25. But I'm not sure if this helps.

So that could be a production ending with t25. So perhaps the last token in the string is the result of NT73 \u2192 t25.\n\nBut wait, the string is 't25 ...' so the first token is t25. If the string is the result of leftmost derivation, the first step would be expanding S into two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-254","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is useful for generating parsers or for transformations. The string to check is `t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t58 t12 t26 t97 t79 t84 t46 t82 t39 t26`. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar. It's presented with several productions, each starting with a non-terminal symbol on the left and two terminals or non-terminals on the right. Since it's in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side. That makes things a bit simpler because it avoids more complex productions with multiple non-terminals.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so I'm guessing these correspond to terminal symbols from the grammar. Each rule might correspond to a way of producing a specific terminal string.\n\nLet me start by looking for the starting symbol S. The first production is S -> NT6 NT58. So S can only be expanded into NT6 and NT58. That means whatever comes from S must be a combination of the strings generated by NT6 and NT58. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t12. I need to check which part of the string corresponds to NT6 and NT58. The string has 15 tokens, which is an odd number, so S would produce two parts that each expand into a sequence of terminals. Each production of a non-terminal should correspond to a certain number of terminal tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's look at the grammar rules and see if any of them have terminal symbols like t12, t77, etc. For example, looking at the rules, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't16'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't9' (appears multiple times)\n- NT36 -> 't64'\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n- NT58 -> 't46'\n- NT58 -> 't58'\n- NT74 -> 't77'\n- NT38 -> 't68'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT34 -> 't36'\n- NT44 -> 't83'\n- NT55 -> 't92'\n- NT39 -> 't63'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT74 -> 't8'\n- NT84 -> 't40'\n- NT68 -> 't63'\n- NT38 -> 't74'\n\nWait, but some of these are appearing again. For example, NT74 -> 't77' and also S -> NT9 NT66, which would then have to be expanded into terminal sequences.\n\nBut perhaps I should try to trace the string back through the grammar. The string starts with t12 and ends with t26. Let's see if t12 can come from a production.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT82 -> 't12'. So if I have a production NT82, that would produce t12. Now, does any non-terminal in the grammar have NT82 as part of its expansion? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT39 -> NT39 NT26: Hmm, that seems a bit unclear. Let me check:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let's list all productions with NT65, NT95, etc., but maybe it's better to see if any NT's can produce t12.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT39 -> NT39 NT15\n- NT82 -> 't12'\n\nSo NT82 produces t12. So if I have a production that leads to NT82, that can give me t12.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, do any rules produce NT82? Let me check the productions provided:\n\nI don't see NT82 in the productions, but there's NT84 -> 't40' and NT82 is not a non-terminal, it's a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar rules provided, the left-hand side are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either non-terminals or terminals. So none of the non-terminals directly produce t12, except those that have a rule ending with t12. For example, looking through the list, I don't see any non-terminal A where A -> t12. Instead, t12 is produced by NT82, which is a terminal symbol. That suggests that NT82 is a terminal symbol, but in the grammar, NT82 is on the left-hand side of a production. Wait, no, looking back, the rule is:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT82: is it on the left side? Let me check the entire list:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT73 -> 't25' \u2014 yes, this is a terminal production.\n\nNT79 -> 't16'\n\nNT63 -> 't36'\n\nNT15 -> 't94'\n\nNT69 -> 't67'\n\nNT46 -> 't87'\n\nNT78 -> 't63'\n\nNT28 -> 't38'\n\nNT2 -> 't9' (appears three times)\n\nNT85 -> 't95'\n\nNT68 -> 't63'\n\nNT39 -> 't39'?\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, in the list, I see lines like:\n\nNT78 -> NT67 NT73\n\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal productions first.

It's in CNF, which means each production has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal. The start symbol is S.

Since it's in CNF, each non-terminal production only has two parts, which can either be non-terminals or terminals. This is helpful because it means each step in the derivation only expands two symbols at a time.\n\nThe string is in the format of a series of 't' followed by some numbers, separated by spaces. Each of these is a terminal symbol in the grammar, so I need to see if each 'tX' can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting from S -> NT6 NT58. So S expands into NT6 and NT58.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string in question is a sequence of tokens that seem to expand based on these rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have production rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals, and the start symbol produces two non-terminals. Each terminal is a single symbol, which in this case seems to be all the 't' followed by numbers. But wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals expand directly to a single terminal, like NT94 -> 't77'. So, the terminals are the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string given is: t12 t26 t84 t40 t77 t87 t53 t77 t3 t49 t95 t12 t26 t87 t94 t13.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to find a derivation from the start symbol S to this string using the grammar rules. Since it's CNF, each production is applied step by step, and the derivation can be represented as a leftmost or rightmost expansion.

Now, the string is t12 t26 t84 t40 t77 t87 t53 t77 t3 t49 t95 t12 t26 t87 t94 t13. Let me count the tokens: 15 tokens.\n\nSo, the string has 15 tokens, meaning the parse tree should have 15 leaves, so the derivation would have 15 steps, each expanding a non-terminal into two symbols. Since the grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58, we'll probably need to see if these two can expand into the first few tokens.\n\nWait, let me think about how the string is structured. Let's break it into the sequence: t12, t26, t84, t40, t77, t87, t53, t77, t3, t49, t95, t12, t26, t87, t13.\n\nI notice that t12 appears twice early on and again later. t26 also appears multiple times. Maybe the string starts with S expanding into NT6 and NT58. Let's check the production rules.\n\nThe start symbol S is NT6 NT58. So, the first expansion would be S -> NT6 NT58. Now, let's see how each of these non-terminals can expand.\n\nLooking at NT6: in the grammar, NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 expands into NT73 NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 -> NT84 NT9, from the production rule.\n\nSo, the first expansion would be S -> NT6 NT58 -> (NT73 NT62) (NT84 NT9). Now, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into their respective components.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is a single rule. So, each non-terminal on the left is replaced by the right-hand side. But in terms of generating the string, each step would replace a non-terminal with two others, until all are leaves (terminals).\n\nBut handling each step for a 15-token string is going to be tedious. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree has a depth equal to the number of symbols in the string, and each leftmost derivation would have the symbols in a specific order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a tree where each non-terminal's children are the symbols generated by its productions.\n\nBut perhaps a more systematic approach is to use the concept of the CYK algorithm, which is used to parse strings in context-free grammars.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm can be optimized, but for human computation, it might still be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each pair of symbols in the string can be generated by a production rule.\n\nLooking at the string: t12 t26 t84 t40 t77 t87 t53 t77 t3 t49 t95 t12 t26 t87 t13.\n\nThe total length is 15, so the parse tree would have 15 leaves. Since S starts as NT6 NT58, each step combines two non-terminals into their productions.\n\nBut perhaps I can work backwards, trying to see where certain tokens could come from.\n\nFor example, looking at the last token, t13. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals expand into t13.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT69 -> 't69'? Wait, no. Wait, in the rules, for example, NT69 -> 't67' (from NT69), but I'm looking for something that expands into t13.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I find:\n\nNT84 -> NT34 NT93\n\nBut NT34 -> NT58 NT65\n\nWait, but for t13, in the production rules, I see NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break down what I have and how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and it's in CNF. That means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The string I need to evaluate is `t12 t77 t87 t53 t77 t7 t96 t16 t44 t97 t40 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96`. So, I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT6 NT58. Each of these NT symbols is another production that eventually leads to terminal symbols (like t12, t77, etc.) or other NTs. My job is to see if, starting from S, I can derive this string by replacing the NTs with their corresponding expansions, ending up with the string provided.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated because there are a lot of NT symbols, and each production has specific endings. Maybe I can represent the string as the result of a series of derivations where each NT expands into parts that fit together.\n\nLet me list out all the NT symbols and their corresponding terminal expansions since each seems to point to a specific terminal string. For example, NT94 -> 't77', NT73 -> 't25', etc. Each NT symbol can be replaced with a specific sequence of t numbers.\n\nNow, the string to check is a concatenation of t12, t77, t87, t53, t77, t7, t96, t16, t44, t97, t40, t77, t87, t53, t67, t96. So it's a sequence of 16 t identifiers. Each t must match the expansion of some NT symbol.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backwards. Starting from the given string, try to parse it by matching the longest possible NT expansions, checking if each terminal part corresponds to an NT's production.\n\nLet me try that. Let's split the string into parts that could correspond to each NT's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string: t12 t77 t87 t53 t77 t7 t96 t16 t44 t97 t40 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96.\n\nI need to see if this string can be formed by a series of NT productions. Each NT can expand into a specific t sequence.\n\nWait, but each NT production in the grammar leads directly to a specific t identifier or combination. For example, NT94 -> 't77'. Let me see if the string can be broken down into units that match these NT productions.\n\nStarting from the left, t12. So I check which NT production leads to t12. Looking through the grammar, I see NT73 -> 't25', but that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe NT44 -> 't83'? No, that's different. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Each NT production corresponds to a single t identifier or a sequence.\n\nWait, looking again, some NTs map directly to a single t. For example:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25' (Wait, NT73 is 't25', but earlier I thought NT73 was 't25'. Let me check the grammar again. Yes, NT73 is 't25'.\nWait, wait, no. Looking back, I see entries like NT94 -> 't14', but that can't be right because t14 is another t, maybe it's combined.

{"custom_id":"request-292","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see that most of the non-terminals expand into two other non-terminals, and some directly into terminals like 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t77 t87 t53 t77 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t63 t94 t67 t97 t36 t95 t26`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I should note that the start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S starts as NT6 NT58. Each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded step by step.\n\nI'll need to identify how each 't' in the string can be produced by the grammar. Each 't' is a terminal symbol, so each must be derived directly from a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I should list out all the rules that directly produce each terminal. For example, NT73 can produce 't25', NT79 can produce 't16', and so on.\n\nLet me create a list of all non-terminals and their corresponding terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't73' (Wait, looking back, I see NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT62, and NT63 \u2192 't36', NT62 \u2192 't84'. But I'm looking for direct terminal produces. Looking through the rules, I think I missed that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, looking back, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't36' (Wait, in the grammar, NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22. Hmm, maybe I was confused earlier. Let me look for rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal or two terminals with one being a non-terminal and the other a terminal?\n\nWait, actually, most of the rules are of the form non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals. But I also need to find rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, which would be when the right-hand side is just a terminal. However, upon scanning, I see that most rules involve two non-terminals on the right. For example, NT6 \u2192 't73' would be a direct production, but looking through the grammar, I don't see that. Instead, looking back:\n\nWait, for example, NT94 \u2192 't14' from the grammar. SoNT94 \u2192 't14'.\n\nSimilarly, NT73\u2192 't25' and NT79\u2192 't16', NT63\u2192 't36', NT56\u2192 't72', and so on.\n\nSo I can make a list:\n\nDirect terminal productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't6', 't70', 't9', 't64' (Wait, no. Let me check each line step by step.\n\nWait, the grammar is a long list, so perhaps I can parse it line by line.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', 't6', 't74', 't8' (multiple entries)\nWait, that can't be right. Each production for a non-terminal is a single rule. Let me see: For example, the first line is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. The next line is NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66. Each line corresponds to a single production.\n\nBut that can't be right because each non-terminal would have a list of productions, but in the given grammar, each line seems to be a single production, which is confusing. Wait, perhaps the formatting is off. Let me try to parse it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps each line represents a production for a non-terminal on the left, and the right side is comma-separated. So for example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and then other non-terminals have their productions.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me look again.\n\nActually, in the given grammar, each line starts with the non-terminal on the left, followed by \u2192, then the right-hand side. The right-hand side seems to be a comma-separated list or just a single expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the way it's written is that each line defines the productions for the non-terminal on the left, with each production being a comma-separated list. That can't be, though, because each line seems to have only one production.\n\nWait, no, because for example, the second line is NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66. That would be one production.\n\nBut later, some lines like NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69, NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66. Wait, that seems to be two productions for NT95: one to NT9 NT69 and another to NT27 NT66. But the way it's written is: NT95 -> NT9 NT69, NT95 -> NT27 NT66.\n\nWait, that would mean NT95 has two productions, each after another. So perhaps the formatting is such that lines can have multiple productions for a single non-terminal, separated by commas.\n\nSo for example:\n\nNT95 -> NT9 NT69, NT95 -> NT27 NT66.\n\nSo for NT95, it has two production rules: one is NT99 and another is NT27 NT66.\n\nSimilarly, let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT95 -> NT9 NT69, NT95 -> NT27 NT66.\n\nSo this means NT95 has two derivations: either produce NT9 followed by NT69, or produce NT27 followed by NT66.\n\nTherefore, each line in the grammar can have multiple productions separated by commas after the non-terminal and its first symbol.\n\nSo, given that, I need to parse each line correctly, identifying all the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nThis requires me to go through each line, split on the arrows, and for each production, take the right-hand side as a single expression, possibly with commas inside. Wait, wait. For example, in the given grammar, for NT2, there are multiple productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't6', 't74', 't8' \u2014 no, that's not right because commas are used for separating multiple productions.\n\nWait, perhaps in this formatting, each line after the first line (which is the start symbol) lists all the productions for the non-terminal. So each line after the first line is a list of productions for that non-terminal, separated by commas.\n\nSo, for example, for NT2, the line is:\n\nNT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't6', 't74', 't8' \u2014 which would indicate that NT2 has five productions, each producing a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, it's written as NT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', 't6', 't74', 't8'. Each production is a single terminal, meaning NT2 can derive 't9', 't70', 't6', 't74', 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 is the production for NT22.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. So, let's parse each line correctly.\n\nAfter the first line, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, all other lines are non-terminals followed by their productions, each line representing all the productions for that non-terminal, separated by commas.\n\nSo for example, the line for NT2 is:\n\nNT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't6', 't74', 't8'\n\nWhich means NT2 can derive 't9', 't70', 't6', 't74', or 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, the line for NT94 is:\n\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nSo NT94 can only produce 't14'.\n\nSo with that understanding, each line after S consists of a non-terminal followed by its possible productions, each being a single terminal symbol.\n\nNow, given that, I need to list out all terminals that each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLet's list them all:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9', 't70', 't6', 't74', 't8'\n- NT22\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- NT34\n- NT36\n- NT38 \u2192 't68'\n- NT40 \u2192 't69', 't74', 't83', 't92'\n- NT46\n- NT55\n- NT56\n- NT59\n- NT6 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

If NT8 is supposed to produce 't12' but it doesn't exist in the grammar, then the 't12' in the string can't be generated because there's no rule for NT8.\n\nWait, but looking back, I see that NT2 can produce 't6', and another rule: NT2 \u2192 't70'. Also, NT38 \u2192 NT27 NT62? No, not directly.

{"custom_id":"request-314","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t12 t26 t97 t36 t39 t14 t87 t53 t13 t96 t68 t36 t95 t39 t36 t53 t13 t96`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar better. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the non-terminals (NT) are on the left side of the arrows, except for a few where it directly has 't' as a terminal. So, the productions start with S and eventually break down into terminals.\n\nThe string given is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each of these must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. I see that some of the NTs are mapped directly to terminals: for example, NT79 is 't16', NT2 is 't9', etc. So each NT can expand into a terminal and another NT, or two NTs.\n\nI think the approach here is to see if the string can be built by expanding the non-terminals step by step. Since the string is long, I should look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nFirst, let's see how the grammar starts. S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S breaks down into two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. Each of these will need to be expanded until they become terminals.\n\nLooking at NT6: the productions for NT6 include NT73 NT62 and NT69 NT17, NT2. Wait, in the given grammar, NT6 has a production to NT36 NT74, NT28 NT73, NT39 NT17, etc. Hmm, maybe I need to correct that. Actually, in the grammar, each NT is defined with specific productions. For example, NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67, NT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each NT and see their possible terminals. Let me go through the NTs and their produce terminals:\n\n- NT94: 't77'\n- NT73: 't25'\n- NT63: 't36'\n- NT95: 't67'\n- NT46: 't87'\n- NT2: 't9' (appears in several places: NT19, NT37, NT87, etc.)\n- NT36: 't64'\n- NT56: 't72'\n- NT38: 't68'\n- NT22: 't87'\n- NT9: 't26'\n- NT46: 't87'\n- NT39: 't58'\n- NT27: 't4'\n- NT2: 't70'\n- NT34: 't36'\n- NT58: 't46'\n- NT44: 't83'\n- NT55: 't92'\n- NT62: 't84'\n- NT80: 't22'\n- NT38: 't49'\n- NT2: 't44'\n- NT8: 't12'\n- NT74: 't77'\n- NT84: 't40'\n- NT93: 't95'\n- NT85: 't76', 't58'\n- NT67: 't53'\n- NT79: 't16'\n- NT84: 't55'\n- NT74: 't8'\n- NT36: 't79'\n- NT17: 't96'\n- NT65: 't82'\n- NT38: 't74'\n- NT95: 't14'\n- NT2: 't6'\n\nHmm, so each NT has a combination of other NTs and some terminals. The only direct terminals are for NTs like NT94 ('t77'), NT73 ('t25'), NT63 ('t36'), NT95 ('t67'), NT46 ('t87'), NT2 ('t9'), etc. So the first step is to see how the string breaks down.\n\nThe string is `t12 t26 t97 t36 t39 t14 t87 t53 t13 t96 t68 t36 t95 t39 t36 t53 t13 t96`.\n\nLooking at 't12', which comes from NT8's production, because NT8 \u2192 't12'. So in the final string, the first symbol comes from NT8. So in the derivation, at the very top, S must eventually produce NT8 and another non-terminal. Let's check S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So NT8 must be derived from either NT6 or NT58.\n\nLet's consider NT8: from the grammar, I see that NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, and NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84, and NT38 \u2192 NT68 NT2, which eventually can produce 't12' (NT68) and another NT. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm complicating it. Maybe I should approach this step by step, breaking down each symbol in the string to see if they can be traced back to S.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Each symbol is either a terminal or derived from a non-terminal. Let's map each 't' in the string to their possible NTs:\n\n- t12: from NT8\n- t26: from NT9\n- t97: Not listed, so perhaps a typo or it's from NT74 (t77), but 97 is not listed. Wait, in the grammar, NT79 is 't16', NT94 is 't77'. Hmm, maybe it's 't97' is incorrect because I don't see any NT mapping to 't97'. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT27 \u2192 't4', which is in the grammar, but not 't97'. So perhaps 't97' is a typo, but the string includes it, so maybe the grammar doesn't produce that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, NT79 is 't16', NT94 is 't77', NT73 is 't25', NT63 is 't36', NT95 is 't67', NT46 is 't87', NT2 is 't9'. So 't97' is not present. Maybe there's a typo, or perhaps I need to check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go symbol by symbol.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\nt12, t26, t97, t36, t39, t14, t87, t53, t13, t96, t68, t36, t95, t39, t36, t53, t13, t96.\n\nLet's see each symbol:\n\n1. t12 \u2192 from NT8 (since NT8 \u2192 't12')\n2. t26 \u2192 from NT9 (since NT9 \u2192 't26')\n3. t97 \u2192 Not directly in the grammar; I don't see any NT mapping to 't97', unless it's a typo and supposed to be 't27' (since NT27 is 't4'). Alternatively, maybe NT... Let me check the grammar again. NT27 is 't4', but no NT is listed as 't97'. So this might be a problem. If 't97' is part of the string but not in the grammar, the answer would be No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that might produce 't97'. Looking through the grammar list, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't97'. So this suggests that the string might not be derivable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo, but assuming the string is correct, then 't97' can't be generated by any NT, so the string is not in the language.\n\nBut before jumping to that conclusion, maybe I should check other symbols to see if the rest of the string could be processed, but since 't97' is the third symbol, if it's invalid, the whole string is invalid.\n\nSo, considering this, my initial thought is that the string is not generated by the grammar because of 't97' not being present as a terminal in any NT.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the grammar to ensure I didn't miss any NT that might produce 't97'.

{"custom_id":"request-312","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule on the left side generating exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can generate terminals or other non-terminals. The grammar given has rules like S -> NT6 NT58, which means S will expand into two non-terminals that eventually lead to the terminals (the t's).\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a series of terminals: `t25 t84 t46 t74 t40 t36 t53 t13 t96 t74 t55 t39 t39 t14 t87 t53 t67 t96`. I notice that each t is followed by a number, which suggests that each is a terminal based on the grammar rules. So, the first step is to see if this string can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nI'll start by working from the beginning of the string, looking for non-terminals that can match the start. Let's see:\n\n1. The string starts with t25. Looking at the grammar, I see NT79 -> t27 t69. Wait, no, actually, the rule for NT79 is `NT79 -> t27 t69`, but in the string, it's t25. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rule. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT79, it's `NT79 -> t16`. Wait no, let me check again. Actually, the rules for NT73 are `NT73 -> t25` and `NT50 -> NT85 NT66`, etc. Wait, maybe I should list the terminal productions first.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that several non-terminals end with 't' and numbers. For example:\n\n- NT73 -> t25\n- NT79 -> t16\n- NT63 -> t36\n- NT69 -> t67\n- NT94 -> t14\n- NT2 -> t70\n- NT36 -> t64\n- NT56 -> t72\n- NT69 -> t13\n- NT87 -> t98\n- NT27 -> t4\n- NT38 -> t68\n- NT22 -> t87\n- NT9 -> t3\n- NT46 -> t87\n- NT39 -> t58\n- NT2 -> t44\n- NT84 -> t40\n- NT39 -> t63\n- NT9 -> t26\n- NT62 -> t84\n- NT80 -> t22\n- NT38 -> t49\n- NT2 -> t44\n- NT8 -> t12\n- NT74 -> t77\n- NT84 -> t40\n- NT79 -> t26\n- NT27 -> t7\n- NT62 -> t97\n- NT85 -> t76\n- NT93 -> t95\n- NT85 -> t58\n- NT74 -> t8\n- NT36 -> t79\n- NT17 -> t96\n- NT65 -> t82\n- NT93 -> t39\n- NT38 -> t74\n\nSo for the string, each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Let me parse the given string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t25, t84, t46, t74, t40, t36, t53, t13, t96, t74, t55, t39, t39, t14, t87, t53, t67, t96.\n\nWait, but parsing in a top-down approach, let's see if these can be generated.\n\nFirst, we start with the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S -> NT6 NT58. So the string must start with the concatenation of NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t25 t84... Let's see if t25 can come from NT6 or NT58.\n\nLooking at the terminal rules:\n\n- NT6 -> t73 t62 (from NT6: NT6 -> NT73 NT62), so this would produce t73 t62. But in the string, the first t is t25, which doesn't match. Wait, no, NT6 doesn't go directly to a terminal. Let me check: NT6's production is NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So to get a t, you have to expand NT6 until it's terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe I should look for the exact rules that produce the terminals in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to check each terminal in the string and see if it corresponds directly to a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each 't' in the string:\n\nt25: from NT73\nt84: NT84 has multiple rules: NT84 -> t40, t40, etc. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking for where '84' is a terminal:\n- NT84 -> t40\n- Also, NT84 can be broken down:\n- NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n- NT34 -> NT58 NT65\n- NT58 can be t46 or further.\nWait, this might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's check each terminal to see if it's a direct production:\n\nt25: Yes, NT73 -> t25\nt84: Does any non-terminal immediately produce t84? Let me check the list. Yes, NT84 has a rule NT84 -> t84. Or wait, looking at the terminal rules:\n\nWait, looking again at the rules, I see:\n\nNT84 is defined as NT84 -> t40, and another rule where NT84 -> NT34 NT93.

Wait, no, actually, the grammar rules are:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, for NT84, I see:\n\nNT84 -> t40\nNT78 -> t77 (but that's NT78)\nWait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT73 -> t25\n- NT84 -> t34 NT93\nWait, no, actually, in the grammar, the first line is S->NT6NT58.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT6: NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- NT34: NT34 -> NT58 NT65\n- NT58: NT58 -> NT84 NT9\n- NT84: NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n- NT73: NT73 -> t25\n- Also, looking for t84, I see that NT84 has a rule NT84 -> t40. So in the grammar, is there a rule where any non-terminal directly produces t84? Yes, for example, NT84 can produce t40, but that's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to make a list of all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nFrom the rules, any non-terminal that directly produces a terminal is:\n\n- NT73 -> t25\n- NT79 -> t16\n- NT63 -> t36\n- NT69 -> t67 and t13\n- NT74 -> t77 and t8\n- NT84 -> t40 and also NT84 can derive down to more non-terminals that might produce t's\n- Similarly, other non-terminals have direct t's.\n\nWait, so for each t in the string, I need to see which non-terminals can produce each t.\n\nLet's map each 't' in the given string:\n\n1. t25: NT73\n2. t84: NT84 (directly or via expansion)\n3. t46: Needs to check which non-terminal can produce this. Looking at the rules, I see NT34 -> t46? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT34 -> NT58 NT65\n- NT58: NT58 -> t46, t9\n- So perhaps t46 is produced from NT58, which is in NT34.\n\nSo t46 is produced from NT58.\n\nSo t46 would come from a non-terminal that derives to NT58.\n\n4. t74: Looking for NT74 -> t77 and t8.

The string is: `t12 t36 t53 t8 t98 t92 t25 t97 t67 t83 t26 t67 t79 t3 t13 t94 t97 t55 t26`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That makes parsing a bit easier, I think.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals and their productions, I see that many are converting to terminals ending with 't' and some numbers. For example, NT6 is `NT73 NT62` and both lead to 't84' or other t... So, each non-terminal expands into two terminals, and some may lead to single terminals like 't3' or 't74'.\n\nThe string provided has a lot of 't's, but I need to see if they follow the production rules. Each non-terminal (like S, NT6, etc.) corresponds to specific 't' expansions.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to build the string step by step, matching each part to the grammar. Starting from S, which is the highest symbol. S => NT6 NT58. So the string should start with whatever NT6 generates and then whatever NT58 generates.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 => NT73 NT62. So from S, it's (NT73 NT62) (NT9 NT69). Wait, no, NT58 is actually NT58 => NT84 NT9. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the initial grammar is S -> NT6 NT58. Then, NT6 is NT73 NT62, and NT58 is NT84 NT9. So S expands into NT73 NT62 NT84 NT9.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should parse the string backward, starting from the end. That might be easier because the string is a sequence of t... Maybe the last few t's can help figure out the derivations.\n\nLooking at the string, the last part is t55 t26. So the last two parts are 't55' and 't26'. I need to see if any rule directly produces these or if they can be built from non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT55: Well, NT55 seems to be a combination of NT55 -> NT92 NT93? Or no, wait. Let me see: Wait, the rules are all in the grammar provided. I see that NT2 -> 't70', NT34 -> 't36', NT40 -> 't69', etc. But wait, is there a rule that directly produces 't55'?\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n- NT36 -> 't34' \u2192 Wait, no. Let me go through the NTs that can produce terminals ending with 't' and have numbers.\n\nWait, for example, NT46 -> 't28', NT52 -> 't19', etc. Hmm, but I'm looking specifically for 't55' and 't26'. Let me check the Nts that produce 't55' and 't26'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT55: Wait, in the grammar, I see NT55 -> NT92 NT93? Or is there a terminal with 't55'? Looking: Yes, I think in the list, NT55 might be part of a rule. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\nNT73 -> 't25'\nNT74 -> 't77'\nNT52 -> 't19'\nND93: Not sure. Wait, looking at the list, some of the rules have 't' as the first part. For example, NT2 -> 't9', NT9 -> 't26', NT27 -> 't4', etc.\n\nSo, looking for 't55', I see in the grammar: NT87 -> 't98', NT84 -> 't55'. Oh, yes, NT84 -> 't55'. So that means NT84 produces 't55'. \n\nSimilarly, for 't26', NT9 -> 't26'. So, perhaps in the string, after some point, we have 't55' and 't26', which would mean we have the sequences NT84 -> 't55' and NT9 -> 't26'.\n\nPutting that together, the substring 't55 t26' would correspond to NT84 NT9.\n\nSo, earlier in the string, before 't55 t26', we have '... t39 t94 t97 t95 t55 t26...'. Hmm, so we have a lot of t... before that.\n\nWait, actually, let's break down the string into its components:\n\nThe string is: t12, t36, t53, t8, t98, t92, t25, t97, t67, t83, t26, t67, t79, t3, t13, t94, t97, t55, t26.\n\nWe can write this as a list of terminal symbols: \n\n[t12, t36, t53, t8, t98, t92, t25, t97, t67, t83, t26, t67, t79, t3, t13, t94, t97, t55, t26]\n\nNow, starting from the end, 't26' comes from NT9. So, the last symbol is NT9.\n\nBefore that, 't55' comes from NT84. So, before 't55' and 't26', we have NT84 NT9.\n\nLooking before 't55', we have 't97 t55', so the substring before that is 't97', then 't55'.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to try to parse the string step by step, building from the start. Let's see:\n\nS expands to NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9.\n\nSo S => NT73 NT62 NT84 NT9.\n\nNow, each of these Nts can produce more. Let's process them:\n\nNT73: NT73 -> 't25'.\n\nWait, no, NT73 is a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, does NT73 produce anything else? Wait, no, in the provided rules, NT73 -> 't25' is present. So NT73 produces 't25'.\n\nSimilarly, NT62: Looking for NT62's expansion. Checking the grammar: NT62 -> NT84 NT9? Wait, I don't see that. Wait, looking through the list, I see NT62: looking for NT62 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see several entries, perhaps I missed. Let's see:\n\nLooking for NT62: Scanning the list, I see entries like NT80 -> NT38 NT73, NT84 -> NT34 NT93, NT69 -> NT67, etc. I don't see NT62 directly expanding to anything. So maybe NT62 is a terminal? But no, NT62 is a non-terminal, so it must have a rule. Wait, did I miss any?\n\nWait, I think I need to check the grammar again. Wait, in the given grammar, for example, NT62 isn't listed. Wait, maybe that's because it's a terminal? But no, NTs are non-terminals, except for the ones that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, do any of the NTs directly produce 't62'? I think not. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me double-check NT62. Is there a rule for NT62? Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking for entries with NT62:\n\nI don't see any production for NT62. That must mean that NT62 is a terminal. Wait, but that's strange because NTs are supposed to be non-terminals. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps NT62 is a terminal, but that's unusual.\n\nWait, maybe the rules are written as NTs followed by NT... Maybe I'm looking for something else. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by considering the entire string as a sequence and trying to split it into the components that match the grammar expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using dynamic programming to track possible derivations, but that might be complicated.\n\nWait, another approach: each production is a single terminal or two non-terminals. So each symbol in the string must be either a node in the grammar (a non-terminal) that can be derived from a sequence, or a terminal.\n\nBut the string has symbols like 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT2 \u2192 't9', NT6 \u2192 't73', NT36 \u2192 't79', etc. So each rule where the RHS is a single terminal will lead directly to that symbol.

Each symbol is a terminal, so each must be derived directly from one of the productions where the RHS is a single terminal, or via a chain of productions leading to terminals.\n\nLet me approach this by trying to derive the string step by step, or alternatively, work backwards from the start symbol S, expanding it, and seeing if we can reach the target string.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT58.

{"custom_id":"request-358","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol when it appears as S \u2192 something. The string I need to check is `t12 t77 t87 t53 t77 t3 t68 t39 t25 t28 t94 t13 t97 t55 t36 t53 t77 t4 t96 t79`.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can infer that each terminal symbol in the string must be either a direct production or must have been derived through a series of productions that ultimately reduce to the terminals. Each step should involve replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until the string is composed entirely of terminals with the correct order.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's defined as S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the entire string should start with a production involving NT6 and NT58. Each of these should produce a series of terminals that match the given string.\n\nLet me list out the production rules that produce terminals. From the grammar, I notice several symbols that end up producing 't' along with numbers:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'\n- NT77 \u2192 't77'\n- NT87 \u2192 't87'\n- NT53 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't4'\n- NT7 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT19 \u2192 't19' (though not directly in the string)\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT28 \u2192 't28'\n- NT36 \u2192 't36'\n- NT55 \u2192 't55'\n- NT36 again later\n- NT39 \u2192 't39'\n- NT79 \u2192 't79'\n- NT77 again at the start\n- NT53 again\n- NT77 again\n- NT6 \u2192 't6'\n- NT39 \u2192 't39'\n- NT77 \u2192 't77'\n- NT53 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT96 \u2192 't96' (but not in the string, but derived from NT8 etc.)\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' (not in the string)\n- NT14 \u2192 't14' (not in the string)\n- NT68 \u2192 't68' (present in the string)\n- NT87 \u2192 't87' (appears twice)\n- NT94 \u2192 't94' (present)\n- NT73 \u2192 't73' (also present)\n- NT56 \u2192 't56'? Wait, no, the string has 't53', 't55', 't39', etc.\n\nWait, I think I need to backtrack. Since the grammar uses NTs, each NT can produce other NTs or terminals. Each step in the derivation must go through NTs until we get to the terminals.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens. Since each production in CNF replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, the derivation tree will have a height determined by the length of the string. But it's more efficient to think about the length. The initial S produces two NTs, each producing two, and so on. The number of symbols grows exponentially.\n\nBut for a string of length 20, the derivation must involve enough steps to reach that length. However, maybe it's easier to work backwards from the given string, replacing each two consecutive symbols with their corresponding NT production.\n\nWait, yes, this is called the CYK algorithm approach. Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, trying to split the string into parts that can be derived by the grammar.\n\nBut since it's a manual process, I'll try working step by step.\n\nLet me write the string again:\n\nt12 t77 t87 t53 t77 t3 t68 t39 t25 t28 t94 t13 t97 t55 t36 t53 t77 t4 t96 t79\n\nI'll map each token to the NT it could correspond to, as there are direct productions from NTs to t followed by a number.\n\nSo each token in the string corresponds to an NT or a combination of NTs that derive to it.\n\nLooking at 't12', it must come from NT12. Similarly:\n\nt12 \u2192 NT12\nt77 \u2192 NT77\nt87 \u2192 NT87\nt53 \u2192 NT53\nt77 \u2192 NT77\nt3 \u2192 NT3\nt68 \u2192 NT68\nt39 \u2192 NT39\nt25 \u2192 NT25\nt28 \u2192 NT28\nt94 \u2192 NT94\nt13 \u2192 NT13\nt97 \u2192 NT97\nt55 \u2192 NT55\nt36 \u2192 NT36\nt53 \u2192 NT53\nt77 \u2192 NT77\nt4 \u2192 NT4\nt96 \u2192 NT96\nt79 \u2192 NT79\n\nSo now, the string can be thought of as a sequence of NT symbols:\n\nNT12, NT77, NT87, NT53, NT77, NT3, NT68, NT39, NT25, NT28, NT94, NT13, NT97, NT55, NT36, NT53, NT77, NT4, NT96, NT79.\n\nNow, since S \u2192 NT6 NT58, the entire string must be derived by starting from NT6 \u2192 something and NT58 \u2192 something else, which then produce the rest of the tokens.\n\nSo, let's confirm if both NT6 and NT58 can produce their corresponding parts.\n\nFirst, check NT6. Looking at the production rules, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Both NT73 and NT62 are involved.\n\nNext, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So starting from NT6 and NT58, each needs to expand into a sequence that, when combined in order, matches the given string.\n\nBut let's also think about how each of these NTs expands.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the NTs in the string and see if they can be further decomposed.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are:\n\nNT12, NT77, NT87, NT53, NT77, NT3, NT68, NT39, NT25, NT28, NT94, NT13, NT97, NT55, NT36, NT53, NT77, NT4, NT96, NT79\n\nLet me try to break down some of these NTs into their possible components.\n\nFor example, NT77: Looking at the grammar, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT40. So to derive t77, it must come from NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT40, and each of those must produce t68 and t40 or further NTs.\n\nSimilarly, NT68 is defined as NT63 NT67. So NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67, each of which must be broken down further.\n\nWait, but this might get too complex quickly. Maybe a better approach is to look for non-terminals that produce a single terminal, as that might help trace back.\n\nLooking at NT2, in several places it's defined with various options. For instance, NT2 \u2192 t70, t6, t44, t22, etc. So NT2 can go directly to some terminals. But in our string, there's a token 't22' which might be NT22, but looking at the grammar, NT22 is defined as t22, so that's a terminal. Thus, 't22' is directly from NT22, which ends the expansion for that NT.\n\nWait, in the string, I have 't28' and 't25', so let's check if those match any NTs.\n\nLooking at NT25: It's listed in the productions as NT25 \u2192 t25. So that's a direct production. Similarly, NT28 is defined as t28. NT94 is t94.\n\nSo let's try to parse the string in segments, starting from the start symbol S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nFirst, NT6 must produce some sequence, and NT58 must produce another sequence, and together, their concatenation should give the entire string.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string as two parts: the first part from NT6 and the second from NT58.\n\nThe total string is 20 tokens. Let's see how the split would occur. Since each step in CNF produces two NTs, the length is a power of two multiplied by the initial symbols. But 20 isn't a power of two, so this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT74, etc.) and terminals (like 't25', 't3', etc.). Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT63 and NT65. So, the first step is to see which non-terminals in the string correspond to these and expand from there.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't25'. Checking the grammar, I see that NT73 \u2192 't25'. But in the grammar, NT73 has two productions: NT73 \u2192 't25' and NT73 \u2192 't4'. So, the first token could come from expanding NT73.\n\nNow, looking back, NT73 is produced from NT63 and NT66 because looking at the grammar: NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22, but wait, no, let's check properly. Wait, the grammar rules are given as individual productions. Let me list down the relevant ones.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the exact productions again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66\n\nNT27 -> 't4'\n\nAlso, NT73 -> 't25' and another production is NT73 \u2192 't4'. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar.\n\nWait, let me look for all the rules involving NT73.

Let me look again.\n\nYes, looking through the rules, I see that NT78 has a rule that could lead to 't25'. Wait, no. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check the given rules again.\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't25'\n\nAnd another possible rule is:\n\nNT78 -> NT67 NT73, but that's part of NT78's production, not NT73.\n\nWait, I might have missed some rules. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can see:\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66\n\nNT27 -> 't4'\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\n\nSo, from NT73, we can get 't25' directly.\n\nBut looking at the string, after 't25', the next token is 't84', then 't55', etc.\n\nSo, let me think about how the string could be broken down.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT63 NT65.\n\nSo the string should start with NT63 and NT65 expansions.\n\nBut the first token is 't25', which is the production for NT73, not NT63 or NT65. Wait, that's conflicting. Because according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT63 NT65. So the first part is NT63, which must expand into 't25', but looking at the rules, NT63 is NT94 NT22 (from the given rules), right? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the given rules include:\n\nNT63 -> NT94 NT22\n\nSo that would mean NT63 can expand into NT94 and NT22. Then NT94 is 't67', and NT22 is 't87'.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the string starts with 't25', not 't67' or 't87'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT73 -> 't25' (so that's one production)\nAnother possible NT73 rule is maybe from a higher non-terminal? Let me check all the NT73 rules.\n\nI think NT73 only has that one rule as 't25' because looking through all the rules, I don't see another NT73 production. So S \u2192 NT63 NT65, and both NT63 and NT65 must expand into something that starts with 't25', but according to the rules, NT63 is NT94 NT22.\n\nWait, that would produce 't67' (from NT94) and 't87' (from NT22), which don't match the string. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol is S \u2192 NT63 NT65, but perhaps one of these non-terminals can produce a string that starts with 't25'?\n\nWait, let me look again. NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22, but NT94 \u2192 't67' and NT22 \u2192 't87', so that would produce 't67 t87', which doesn't match the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84. Let's see: NT38 \u2192 't68' and NT84 \u2192 't40'. So NT65 would expand to 't68 t40'.\n\nWait, so S \u2192 NT63 NT65 would expand into 't67 t87 t68 t40', but the string starts with 't25', which is from NT73.\n\nThis suggests that either the grammar doesn't allow S to produce the string, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the productions work.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if any of the non-terminals in the string can be broken down into other non-terminals. For example, perhaps 't25' is part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't25', which corresponds to NT73. So to get 't25', I need to have NT73 somewhere in the expansion.\n\nBut S is expanding into NT63 and NT65. So perhaps the NT63 or NT65 can expand into something that includes NT73.\n\nWait, but looking at the production for NT63: NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22.\n\nNT94 \u2192 't67', and NT22 \u2192 't87'. So that would mean NT63 \u2192 't67 t87', which doesn't include NT73.\n\nSimilarly, NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84. NT38 \u2192 't68', NT84 \u2192 't40'. So NT65 \u2192 't68 t40', also not involving NT73.\n\nHmm. This suggests that S's expansion starts with NT63 and NT65, which don't produce 't25'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the expansion from S doesn't lead to 't25' as the first token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a production. Let me check if any non-terminals after expansion can reach NT73.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a chain where one of the non-terminals in the string can produce NT73. For example, maybe some production of a non-terminal leads to NT73.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal other than NT73 having a production to something else except a terminal. So, the only way to get 't25' is directly from NT73.\n\nThus, if S's expansion starts with NT63 and NT65 and both of these don't produce 't25', then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way that NT63 can produce something else that leads to NT73 further down. Let me check if NT63 can reach NT73.\n\nLooking at NT63's production: NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22. NT94 \u2192 't67', NT22 \u2192 't87'. So from NT63, we get 't67 t87'. Not helpful.\n\nSimilarly, NT22's production is NT9 NT44. NT9 \u2192 't26', NT44 \u2192 't83'. So that's 't26 t83'.

{"custom_id":"request-378","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The string is \"t12 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t26 t94 t67 t84 t36 t95 t77 t87 t53 t26 t96 t4 t96 t67 t9\". \n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is entirely composed of terminals, the problem reduces to checking if the sequence of terminal symbols can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nI remember that in CNF grammars, the derivation tree must be a binary tree because each production splits into exactly two parts. So, the number of steps in the derivation must be one less than the number of symbols in the string. Let me count the symbols: there are 21 tokens, so if the derivation is correct, there should be 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. In CNF, each rule has two non-terminals, meaning each step of the leftmost derivation doubles the number of symbols, leading to a length that's a power of two. The string here has length 21, which isn't a power of two, so that might already indicate a problem. But I'm not sure if that's a solid reasoning because sometimes the derivation can be non-leftmost, allowing for more flexibility. Hmm, maybe I should proceed differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build the derivation step by step. Starting from S. The first step: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first two symbols should come from NT6 and NT58. Let's look at the string: first two are t12, t36. So NT6 must produce t12, and NT58 must produce t36.\n\nLooking up the productions for NT6 and NT58:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n- NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nNow, the string after t12 t36 should be t53 t26 t96 t26 t26 t94 t67 t84 t36 t95 t77 t87 t53 t26 t96 t4 t96 t67 t9. \n\nSo from NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9, let's see what each produces.\n\nNT73 can be derived from the given rules. Let's check NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. The string has next: t53 t26. So NT73 should derive to t53 followed by t26? Wait, t53 is a terminal, so looking for where t53 is mapped. Checking the rules, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. Then NT8 might produce t53, and NT9 produces t26.\n\nLooking at NT8: I don't see a production for NT8, maybe I missed it. Wait, the rules include NT8 \u2192 t12, which is mapped to 't12' as a terminal. Wait, no, the rules are written with 'NTx \u2192 ...', and at the end, some NTx produce terminal strings. Let me list all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't73' (Wait, no, it's nt9 and nt62 earlier. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, the rules are in parts where some NTx produce other NTs, and others produce a terminal.\n\nI think all the rules at the top are production rules, but some of them are written for NTx as a combination. Wait, the initial rules like S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and then each NTy is a non-terminal. So the entire grammar consists of NT productions, some of which produce terminals, others produce combinations of NTs.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each step in the derivation must replace an NT with terminals or a combination of NTs.\n\nBut parsing can be tricky without a clear structure, but since the string is in order, I should attempt to match the earliest possible NT productions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the string as a sequence of symbols and see if they can be generated by replacing the NTs step by step.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to use a recursive descent parser or apply the productions to see if the string can be split correctly. But that might be complicated manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parse the string into parts that match the possible NT productions. Let's try breaking the string into possible chunks.\n\nThe string is: t12 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t26 t94 t67 t84 t36 t95 t77 t87 t53 t26 t96 t4 t96 t67 t9.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t12, which could come from NT12, but checking the rules, I don't see an NT12 production. Wait, but maybe it's a result of a production that generates t12 as a terminal. Looking at the rules, NT8 \u2192 t12. So, perhaps the first NT is NT8, producing t12.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first step must split into NT6 and NT58. Therefore, the string must start with the results of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, the first part is from NT6, which \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT22. Wait, but let's see: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me start over.\n\n1. The string starts with t12. Looking at the rules, the only terminal symbol that produces t12 is NT8 \u2192 t12. So, perhaps the first part is NT8.\n\nBut according to the initial production, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the first two symbols must come from NT6 and NT58. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the leftmost derivation is what's applicable.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string is a series of the right symbols, but the initial production splits into NT6 (t12) and NT58 (t36). \n\nWait, no, that can't be because NT6 is an NT that can only produce more NTs until it finally produces a terminal. So perhaps the process is like building the string from the start.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the entire string must be the concatenation of NT6 and NT58 derived strings. So the string after derivation is (NT6's string) + (NT58's string), and the original string is \"t12 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t26 t94 t67 t84 t36 t95 t77 t87 t53 t26 t96 t4 t96 t67 t9\".\n\nWait, but \"t36\" is part of the string, which comes from NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So, let me see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT62 \u2192 NT84 NT22\n\nSo, the first part after NT6 is NT73 NT62, which expands to NT8 NT9 NT84 NT22. \n\nThen NT8 \u2192 t12 (since NT8 \u2192 t12 as a terminal). But wait, in the string, after t12 and t36, the next symbols are t53, t26, etc. It doesn't seem to fit because t12 is a single symbol, but in the string, the first two are t12, t36, which would suggest that the initial NT6 produces t12, and NT58 produces t36. But according to the rules, NT6 doesn't directly produce t12. It produces NT73 and NT62, which themselves produce other NTs. So maybe that's possible.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string in stages, looking for possible splits based on the NT productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can think recursively: each time I find an NT in the string, I look for a production that matches it and then split the string accordingly, repeating this until I reach the beginning.\n\nBut since this is complicated, perhaps another approach is to see if all the symbols are used, and each comes from a production. For example, let's try to see where each NT could have come from.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 21 symbols, which is an odd number, and in a CNF grammar, each application of a production increases the number of symbols by one (since each rule replaces one non-terminal with two), so the total number of symbols would be of the form 2^(n) steps, but the string length here is 21.

Hmm, that's a bit of a task, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol which can sometimes have one terminal. Here, all rules except S seem to have two non-terminals, but looking at S, it starts with `S -> NT6 NT58`. So S produces two non-terminals, which is consistent with CNF.\n\nNow, the string given consists entirely of terminal symbols ('t' followed by numbers). The non-terminals in the grammar are things like NT6, NT74, etc. So the process is to parse the string by substituting each non-terminal step by step, making sure the string can reduce down to the start symbol S.\n\nWait, but how? I think the standard approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing in Chomsky Normal Form. But maybe I can do this manually since the string isn't too long.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the non-terminals that appear in the string: all the 't' followed by numbers. The non-terminals in the grammar are things like NT6, NT74, NT55, etc. So each 't' with a number must be matched by a production that generates it.\n\nSo, for example, 't25' is generated by NT73 -> 't25', because looking at the grammar, I see NT73 -> NT8 NT9, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, looking back, the grammar rules are a bit scattered. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some of the rules directly correspond to terminals. For example, NT94 -> 't77', NT77 is a rule, so whenever we encounter 't77', it's generated by NT94. Similarly, 't25' is generated by NT73 -> 't25' because in the grammar, I see NT73 -> 't25'.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check again. The grammar has NT73 -> 't25'. Yes, because in the rules, NT73 -> NT8 NT9, but then looking deeper, NT8 is 't12', NT9 is 't3'. So perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, the rules in the grammar are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So all the rules are either NTx -> NTy NTz, or NTx -> 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo for each 't' in the string, I need to find a non-terminal that directly expands to it. So 't25' must be from NT73 -> 't25' because in the rules, NT73 is defined as NT8 NT9 but also I see NT73 -> 't25' as a separate rule? Wait no. Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see that. Let me go through the rules step by step.\n\nLooking for rules where the right-hand side is a terminal, like 't25'. So, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\n\nYes, that's a rule. Similarly, NT94 -> 't77', NT79 -> 't16', NT63 -> 't36', and so on. So each of these non-terminals directly correspond to a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo the approach is to parse the string by replacing non-terminals with their terminals wherever possible, starting from the top-down or bottom-up, depending on the method.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals that appear in the grammar and their productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, many non-terminals have multiple productions. For example, S -> NT6 NT58, and also NT68 -> NT63 NT67, etc.\n\nI think using a stack or recursive approach would help, but since it's a linear string, perhaps I can try to break it down into parts that correspond to each production.\n\nWait, another approach is to list all the possible sequences that can be formed by these productions. Since each production in CNF is two non-terminals, the parsing can be done by checking if two parts of the string can be formed by applying such productions.\n\nMaybe it's easier to try to write out the entire parse tree. But given the string's length is 20, I think I can approach it step by step.\n\nWait, let's see: the string is:\n\nt25 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t8 t3 t53 t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t58 t25 t84 t79 t28 t94 t67\n\nWait, but the string has 21 tokens, but in the input, it's written as 20. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me count again.\n\nWait, the input is:\n\n`t25 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t8 t3 t53 t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t58 t25 t84 t79 t28 t94 t67`\n\nWait, that's actually 21 terms: let's count them:\n\n1. t25\n2. t84\n3. t55\n4. t14\n5. t87\n6. t53\n7. t8\n8. t3\n9. t53\n10. t12\n11. t14\n12. t87\n13. t53\n14. t77\n15. t58\n16. t25\n17. t84\n18. t79\n19. t28\n20. t94\n21. t67\n\nWait, maybe I misread. So the string has 21 tokens. Hmm, but I think for the purpose of this task, the exact number might not be critical.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to proceed step by step. Let's see, each non-terminal must expand into exactly one terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So the parsing can be done by trying to find where a pair of non-terminals can produce the current portion of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a leftmost derivation would be easier.\n\nBut given the time constraints, maybe using CYK algorithm is better. Let me see.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by creating a table where each cell represents whether a substring can be derived from a particular non-terminal. The size of the table is the length of the string, and each step involves checking possible productions.\n\nSince this is a bit time-consuming, I'll try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the table: Each cell (i, j) represents the substring starting at position i, ending at position j.\n\n2. For each character (i = j), check if it's a terminal that can be generated by any non-terminal. If so, add that non-terminal to cell (i, i).\n\n3. For substrings of length 2 to n, for each possible starting position i, and ending position j = i + len - 1, check all possible non-terminals that can produce the two-character substring, by combining the two smaller substrings.\n\nBut perhaps manually applying CYK would take too long, but let's try.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the entire string as a sequence of non-terminals that can be generated by S.\n\nWait, let me try to see if I can find the entire string being generated by S.\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nSo the string must be a concatenation of the sequences generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nLet me check what NT6 and NT58 expand to.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nSo NT6 expands into two non-terminals: NT73 and NT62.\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\n\nWait, so NT73 directly produces 't25' because in the rules, NT73 -> 't25'.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT73 -> 't25' \u2014 yes, that's a production. So NT73 produces 't25'.\n\nSimilarly, NT62: looking through the rules, let's see.\n\nNT62 -> NT63 NT67\n\nWait, so NT62 expands into NT63 and NT67.\n\nNow, let's look at NT63: NT63 -> 't36'.\n\nAnd NT67: NT67 -> 't53'.\n\nWait, but let me confirm.

{"custom_id":"request-397","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is `t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t98 t92 t12 t77 t87 t53 t26 t96 t7 t96 t27 t6 t84 t16 t6 t97 t46`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing and theoretical purposes.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production seems to start with a non-terminal on the left side, like S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT2 \u2192 't9' is a terminal production, meaning NT2 directly produces the string 't9'.\n\nThe given string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't12', 't77', etc. Each 't' is followed by a two-digit number, which I assume are IDs for the terminals or perhaps part of the non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nMy task is to see if the grammar can derive this string. I think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step can replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The string consists of terminals, so each token in the string must come from a terminal production.\n\nLet me list the terminals present in the grammar: 't1', 't2', 't3', up to 't99' based on the productions. Wait, looking at the grammar, some NTs have terminal productions like NT2 \u2192 't9', which is part of the string I need to validate. So each 't' followed by two digits is a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of 21 terminals: t12, t77, t87, t53, t8, t98, t92, t12, t77, t87, t53, t26, t96, t7, t96, t27, t6, t84, t16, t6, t97, t46. That's 21 tokens, so the parse tree would have depth based on the length, maybe 21\/2^depth or something like that, but perhaps more systematically, the number of productions needed would correspond to the number of non-terminals expanded.\n\nSince each production step in CNF replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals (except when the non-terminal directly expands to a terminal), the number of steps can get quite involved. However, perhaps I can reverse-engineer the string by starting from the string and seeing if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me think about how to reduce the string. Each production is a binary tree, so each token can come from either a terminal or a non-terminal. If I start at the beginning, looking at the first token 't12', I can check if there's a terminal production for NT12. Looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT12 listed directly, but maybe it's built from other terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's check the productions again. The given grammar has a lot of non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 't9', which is a terminal. So, every terminal in the string must be reachable from some non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nSo, looking at the string tokens: t12, t77, t87, t53, t8, t98, t92, t12, t77, t87, t53, t26, t96, t7, t96, t27, t6, t84, t16, t6, t97, t46. Each of these must be either a direct terminal production or derived from non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to see the first token, t12. Is there a non-terminal that produces 't12'? I don't see an entry like NTn \u2192 t12 in the grammar. Hmm, so maybe 't12' is part of a larger non-terminal. For example, NT12 might produce t12, but looking at the grammar, I don't see such a production.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions to see if any have t12 as a terminal. Scanning through:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9' (t9 present)\n\nNT94 \u2192 't77' (t77 is present)\n\nOther terminals include t87, t53, t8, t98, t92, etc.\n\nSo, the string has t12, but in the grammar, there is no direct production for NT12 \u2192 t12. That might be a problem because if 't12' isn't directly a terminal, then it must come from a non-terminal that can derive it. Let me see if any non-terminals expand to t12.\n\nLooking back, I don't see any NT that directly produces t12. For example, NT6 \u2192 nt73 nt62, which doesn't seem to produce t12. Similarly, NT25 \u2192 't25' as given? Wait, looking at the grammar: NT73 \u2192 't25'\u2014that's present. Wait, but NT73 is 't25', which is in the grammar as line: NT73 \u2192 't25'\u2014yes, line 'NT73 -> 't25''. So NT73 expands to t25 directly.\n\nBut the string has t12, which I don't see a direct NT production for. Maybe it's part of a longer production chain. For example, if an NT expands into two other NTs, one of which eventually becomes t12.\n\nBut without such a production in the grammar, I can't derive t12 directly. So, if the grammar doesn't have a production like NT12 \u2192 something \u2192 t12, then 't12' cannot be derived, making the string invalid.\n\nBut wait, perhaps 't12' is part of a larger production. For example, maybe NT12 expands to NTx NTy, where NTx and NTy further expand to produce 't12'. But looking through the given grammar, I don't see any such entries. All NTs that expand to terminals like t12 are themselves terminals, which isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the NTs to see if any produce 't12'. Looking: NT2 is t9, NT34 is t36, CT37\u2192t39, etc. No 't12' anywhere. So, 't12' cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but hold on. Maybe 't12' is part of a larger derivation, but from the given grammar, it's impossible because no non-terminal directly expands to t12, and it's not part of any production step that leads to t12. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, I think the string cannot be generated by the grammar because t12 isn't present as a terminal production.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-400","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is: `t12 t36 t53 t3 t96 t14 t87 t53 t36 t53 t13 t96 t96 t72 t98 t96 t22 t87 t94 t13 t84 t46`.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right-hand side. This makes the parsing a bit straightforward, but the string is long, so I'll need a systematic approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT6 and NT58. NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals, so these must be derived from other rules. But wait, the right-hand sides of many non-terminals have terminal symbols as well, like 't12', 't36', etc. That means each step in the derivation can consume a part of the string, moving us closer to the start symbol.\n\nI'll approach this by building the parse tree, trying to match the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and the target. The string is a series of terminals separated by spaces, which are all two-digit numbers with some letters, but in the given grammar, the terminals are like 't12', 't36', etc.\n\nWait, the grammar's right-hand sides have terminals starting with 't', followed by numbers. So, for example, NT6 is defined as NT73 NT62, which would mean when expanding NT6, it uses 't73' and 't62'. But wait, no, because NT6 is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals, which would then have to be expanded further until we get to terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, each token is a terminal, so each token must correspond to a single terminal production. So, each step in parsing a token is when a non-terminal is expanded into a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. This would produce two terminals, so the entire string's length is even, which matches the given string's length of 24 tokens. So that's a good sign.\n\nNow, let me map the given string to the grammar. Each token is a single terminal, so the string is a sequence of terminals that must be generated by the grammar.\n\nI'll try to work through the steps. Since S \u2192 NT6 NT58, the first two tokens must be the results of expanding NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So, to generate a terminal from NT6, it must expand to NT73 and NT62, which in turn must produce terminals.\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014if NT6 is NT73 NT62, both of which are non-terminals, then to get a terminal, we need to have NT73 and NT62 eventually expanding into terminals. But that might not make sense because NT6 would produce a sequence of terminals, but in the string, the tokens are individual. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, when a non-terminal like NT6 is expanded, each production of NT6 must either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. But in the given grammar, NT6's production is NT73 NT62, which are non-terminals. That would mean that NT6 expands into two non-terminals, each of which may further expand into more non-terminals or into terminals.\n\nTherefore, when expanding NT6, it's not a single terminal, but a sequence of two non-terminals, which have to be expanded further until we get terminals. But wait, that would mean that in the string, each symbol would correspond to a single terminal, but NT6 NT58 would have to produce two sequences of terminals, which might not align with the string's structure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach: for each non-terminal, I'll list what it can produce as a terminal string.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. But NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, NT73 \u2192 NT53 NT84. Wait, let me look up each production:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 (from the rules)\nWait, but in the given rules, NT6 has a production NT73 NT62, but NT73's productions are more detailed.\n\nWait, let me start by mapping each non-terminal to the possible terminals it can generate.\n\nFor example, starting with NT6:\n\nNT6 can expand to NT73 NT62.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals may expand further:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 t74 or NT19 NT12 or other rules? Wait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT8: Not sure if NT8 exists in the given grammar. Wait, looking at the rules, NT2: 't9', but NT94 \u2192 't77', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through the rules for each non-terminal and see what they can produce as terminals.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nFirst, looking for non-terminals that directly produce a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Both of these are non-terminals, so NT6 will produce a sequence of two more symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 NT96 NT9. NT96 \u2192 't67', so that's a terminal. NT9 \u2192 't26', also a terminal.\n\nSo NT58 produces 't67' and 't26'.\n\nWait, that would mean that in the string, the last token is 't46', which might come from a non-terminal that expands into 't46'. Looking through the rules, 't46' is from NT46 \u2192 't46', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, NT58 \u2192 NT96 NT9 \u2192 't67' 't26', which matches part of the string's latest tokens: the last part is 't22 t87 t94 t13 t84 t46'. Wait, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me take the string and split it into individual tokens:\n\nt12, t36, t53, t3, t96, t14, t87, t53, t36, t53, t13, t96, t96, t72, t98, t96, t22, t87, t94, t13, t84, t46.\n\nSo, the string has 24 tokens. Since S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which are two non-terminals, each of which will need to be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut wait, each non-terminal expansion may produce multiple terminals, but the count will vary. So, for the entire string, the number of terminals produced by NT6 and NT58 combined must be 24.\n\nBut it's easier to build the parse tree incrementally.\n\nLet's see: Start with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo, the string should be divided as the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into two parts: the first part is generated by NT6, the second part by NT58.\n\nSo, the entire string is length 24, so each part could be from 1 to 23 tokens. But that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT6 expands into several terminals, and NT58 into the rest.\n\nLooking for known terminals in NT58's expansion.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT96 NT9, and NT96 \u2192 't67', NT9 \u2192 't26'.\n\nWait, so NT58 can only produce 't67' and 't26', but the string includes t12, t36, etc., which suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check again: the grammar has non-terminals that can expand into terminals.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that can expand into a single terminal:\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 't96'\nNT66 \u2192 't96'\nNT46 \u2192 't87'\nNT2 \u2192 't70', 't9' or others?

{"custom_id":"request-414","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the string is `t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t14 t87 t53 t8 t3 t58 t94 t13 t98 t96 t22 t58 t94 t87 t94 t13 t84 t46`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and it breaks down into NT6 and NT58. \n\nEach NT in the grammar eventually resolves into a sequence of terminal symbols, as seen by looking at the productions where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal (e.g., NT94 \u2192 't77'). So, each NT production either stops with a terminal or continues splitting into more non-terminals.\n\nI think the strategy should be to parse the string from left to right, using the productions to break down the string into its components. Since each production is either a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal, I can recursively check if the string can be split accordingly.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. The string begins with `t12`, which is a terminal. Wait, so looking for a production that starts with 't12'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 't96', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I should check each NT rule for a production that produces 't12'. Scanning through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't12' as a terminal. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Looking at the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't12'. Yes, that's correct. So S starts with NT6 and NT58. But the string starts with 't12', which is the result of NT8. So maybe the first part should be NT6 \u2192 ... and see if that can produce 't12'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by breaking down the string into tokens and then seeing if each can be matched by a production rule. Let's list the string as tokens: t12, t77, t87, t53, t8, t14, t87, t53, t8, t3, t58, t94, t13, t98, t96, t22, t58, t94, t87, t94, t13, t84, t46.\n\nNow, starting from S: NT6 NT58. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 and NT58. Let's first process NT6. Looking at the production rules for NT6: from the list, I see NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62. Now I need to expand both of these.\n\nNT73: looking at the rules, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. So now, I need to expand NT8 and NT9.\n\nNT8: in the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 't12'. Perfect, that's the first token in the string. So NT8 corresponds to 't12'.\n\nNow, NT9: looking for a production for NT9. From the list, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. So NT9 splits into NT68 and NT40.\n\nNT68: looking at the rules, NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67. So expanding NT68 into NT63 and NT67.\n\nNT63: NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22. So splitting into NT94 and NT22.\n\nNT94: looking at the rules, there are a few NT94. Specifically, NT94 \u2192 't77' and NT94 \u2192 NT14 NT28. Since the next token is 't77', let's take NT94 \u2192 't77'. That matches the second token in the string.\n\nNow, the next part of the string after 't12' and 't77' is 't87'. Wait, no, let's recount the string: t12, t77, t87, ... So after NT94 ('t77'), we need to process NT22 (since we split NT63 into NT94 and NT22).\n\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me outline the steps more clearly:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n3. NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n4. NT8 \u2192 't12' (matches the first token)\n5. NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n6. NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n7. NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT22\n8. NT94 \u2192 't77' (matches the second token)\n9. Now, after processing up to NT94, the next part is NT22 (since we have NT94 followed by NT22). So NT22's production is NT28 NT93.\n10. NT28 \u2192 't38' or NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT93. Hmm, let's see. The next token is 't87', which I think is 't87'. Wait, not sure. Let me think about NT28.\n\nWait, looking up the rules: NT28 \u2192 't38' or NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT93. So NT28 can produce either a terminal or split further.\n\nBut the next token after 't77' is 't87'. So we have to see if NT28 can produce 't87'. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT28 directly producing 't87'. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me go back. After splitting NT6 into NT73 and NT62, which splits into NT8 and NT9. NT8 is 't12', then NT9 splits into NT68 and NT40. NT68 splits into NT63 and NT67. NT63 splits into NT94 and NT22. NT94 is 't77', so now after that, we have NT22 to process. \n\nSo after 't77', we need to process NT22. Now, looking at NT22's productions: NT22 \u2192 NT58 NT69. So NT22 splits into NT58 and NT69.\n\nNT58 \u2192 't46' or NT58 \u2192 ... Looking at the rules, NT58 \u2192 't46' is one of the options. So if we take NT58 \u2192 't46', that would consume the next token, but in the string, after 't77' comes 't87', not 't46'. So that path doesn't seem to work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT22 can produce a different path. Let me check NT22's rules: NT22 \u2192 NT98 NT69? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar isn't that I can see. Wait, wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT22's productions: From the given list, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT59 NT15.\n\nSo NT22 splits into NT59 and NT15.\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT27 and NT56 (looking up the rules, yes: NT59 \u2192 NT27 NT56). So NT59 splits into NT27 and NT56.\n\nNT27 \u2192 't4' or NT27 \u2192 NT46 NT66. The next token is 't87', so 't4' isn't helpful. Let's see NT46 \u2192 't28' or NT46 \u2192 NT19 NT87. Wait, looking up NT46: from the rules, NT46 has productions, including NT19 NT87. So if NT46 is split as NT19 and NT87, then 't87' would be produced by NT87. But that doesn't make much sense. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me try to re-examine the string and the steps. The string starts as t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t14 t87 t53 t8 t3 t58 t94 t13 t98 t96 t22 t58 t94 t87 t94 t13 t84 t46.\n\nWe've processed t12 (NT8) and t77 (NT94). Now, the next part should be t87, which comes from NT22. So after NT94 ('t77'), we have to process NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-413","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are quite complex, so I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which fits the CNF structure since the RHS has two non-terminals. Other rules, like NT79 \u2192 t16, have terminals on the RHS, which is allowed in CNF since it's equivalent to A -> a B or similar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t67 t16 t83 t97 t79 t7 t96 t94 t84 t46`.\n\nI need to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing can be done using algorithms like the CYK parser, which is efficient for CNF grammars.\n\nLet me list the steps I should follow:\n\n1. **Identify the start symbol:** From the grammar, the start symbol is S.\n\n2. **Check the length of the string:** In CNF, each production in the parse tree has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, the parse tree height corresponds to the number of productions, and the number of terminals in the string should be related to the number of leaves in the parse tree.\n\n3. **Count the number of terminals in the string:** The string has 20 terms (from t12 to t46). So, the number of symbols (n) is 20.\n\nIn CNF, the maximum number of symbols in the string that can be derived from a start symbol S is O(2^k), where k is the number of steps. However, since the grammar can be large, it's better to use the CYK algorithm to determine if the string is in the language.\n\n4. **Set up the CYK table:**\n   - Initialize a table of size (n+1)x(n+1), where n is 20.\n   - The cell CYK[i][j] will represent the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j.\n\n5. **Fill the CYK table:**\n   - For each cell CYK[i][i], check if the terminal t_i is directly derivable from any non-terminal starting with that symbol.\n     - This involves checking all productions where the RHS is a single terminal (A \u2192 a) and if t_i matches that terminal.\n   - For cells CYK[i][j], where j > i, consider splitting the substring into i to k and k+1 to j. For each split, check if there's a production where the non-terminal in i's side can produce a non-terminal, and that non-terminal can produce the next part.\n\n6. **Check the starting symbol S in CYK[1][20]:**\n   - If S is present in CYK[1][20], the string is generated by the grammar.\n\n7. **Possible optimizations:**\n   - Since the string starts with t12, I should look for productions that start with t12. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n     - NT87 \u2192 t97\n     - NT22 \u2192 t87\n     - So, t12 could be part of NT22, which is derived from t97.\n\n   - Similarly, the next terms might be part of other productions. For example:\n     - t14 could come from NT94 \u2192 t14 directly.\n     - t87 could come from NT68 \u2192 t87 (if such a production exists). Wait, checking the grammar, I don't see NT68. Let me check the productions.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9' (from multiple rules like NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT93, but the actual terminals listed are under various NT names.

{"custom_id":"request-435","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t12, t36, etc. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a CNF grammar looks like. CNF means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this case, the productions go from a non-terminal on the left to two other symbols on the right. Some of the productions directly to terminals are also present.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t12 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t14 t87 t53 t8 t26 t26 t94 t67 t96 t26 t58 t94 t13 t26 t94 t67 t97 t46`.\n\nMy first thought is to parse this string from left to right, mapping each 'tN' to its possible non-terminals. But I'm not sure where to start. Maybe I can look for the start symbol S and see how the string could be generated from it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the entire string should start with the two non-terminals NT6 and NT58. Then each of these could decompose further.\n\nLet me write down the string as tokens for clarity:\n\nt12, t36, t53, t77, t36, t53, t14, t87, t53, t8, t26, t26, t94, t67, t96, t26, t58, t94, t13, t26, t94, t67, t97, t46.\n\nEach 'tN' corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So I need to see if these terminals can be the result of the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me see if I can map each terminal to the appropriate non-terminals.\n\nFirst, look at the first production: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string should expand into NT6 and NT58, which will eventually derive t12, t36, etc.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNow, NT6 must be expanded. From the grammar, looking for NT6:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nSo NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Now, these are both non-terminals, so they need to be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT73 in the grammar:\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, or maybe another production? Let's check.\n\nLooking through all NT73 productions, I see that NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, but wait, no, looking again: in the initial list, there's NT73 \u2192 NT25, but that's actually NT73 \u2192 NT25? Wait, actually, the initial list says:\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. There are multiple lines. Let me list the relevant ones.\n\nFrom the initial grammar, for example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT73 \u2192 NT25\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, I think I need to carefully parse each line.\n\nLooking for NT73 in the productions:\n\nI see:\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9\nNT78 -> NT28 NT73\nWait, no, let me check each line:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\nNT73 \u2192 NT25? No, wait:\n\nLooking at the list, for NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT39 NT15\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me go through the list methodically.\n\nThe full grammar is given line by line. Let me search for NT73 in the left-hand side.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- Line: NT95 -> NT27 NT66\n- Line: NT9 -> NT68 NT40\n- Line: NT40 -> NT69 NT17\n- Line: NT34 -> NT58 NT65\n- Line: NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- Line: NT36 -> NT79 NT2\n- Line: NT40 -> NT74 NT56\n- Line: NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n- Line: NT78 -> NT67 NT73\n- Line: NT56 -> NT9 NT19\n- Line: NT95 -> NT27 NT66\n- Line: NT9 -> NT68 NT40\n- Line: NT40 -> NT69 NT17\n- Line: NT84 -> NT40 NT93\n- Line: NT78 -> NT28 NT73\n- Line: NT58 -> NT84 NT9\n- Line: NT28 -> NT38 NT93\n- Line: NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n- Line: NT85 -> NT95 NT50\n- Line: NT68 -> NT63 NT67\n- Line: NT39 -> NT78 NT46\n- Line: NT85 -> NT87 NT55\n- Line: NT73 -> NT8 NT9\n- Line: NT78 -> NT52 NT80\n- Line: NT50 -> NT85 NT66\n- Line: NT56 -> NT95 NT36\n- Line: NT59 -> NT56 NT95\n- Line: NT52 -> NT19 NT28\n- Line: NT37 -> NT39 NT15\n- Line: NT95 -> NT85 NT6\n- Line: NT73 -> NT26 NT80? Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, line 78: NT73 -> NT8 NT9. Yes, so NT73 can derive to NT8 NT9.\n\nIn the string, the third token is t53. So let me see if any of the NT tokens can directly result in t53.\n\nLooking for NT53 in the grammar. Wait, in the grammar, do we have any production where a non-terminal directly goes to t53? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT74 -> NT95 NT15\nNT75... wait, nope. Looking for t53 as a production. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the initial part, the grammar has several rules where a non-terminal directly expands to a terminal. For example, NT69 \u2192 't67' (from line: NT69 -> 't67').\n\nSo, for example, if a production leads to NT69, it can then be replaced by t67.\n\nSo, t53 is in the string as the third token. So at some point, I need to expand a non-terminal to t53, but in the grammar provided, do any rules produce t53 as a terminal? Let me check each production for terminals.\n\nLooking through all productions, I see that NT14 \u2192 't94' from line: NT14 \u2192 't94'.\n\nSimilarly, NT99 doesn't seem to be a thing. Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, looking for 't53', but looking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly maps to 't53'. So that's a problem because the string has t53, but the grammar doesn't have any NT directly mapping to t53. That might mean that the string can't be generated by this grammar, so the answer would be 'No'. But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial look. Let me check again.\n\nThe string given is: t12 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t14 t87 t53 t8 t26 t26 t94 t67 t96 t26 t58 t94 t13 t26 t94 t67 t97 t46.\n\nSo t53 appears several times. The key issue is whether the grammar allows for any non-terminal that can be directly replaced by 't53'. If not, then the string cannot be generated because there's no way to produce t53 from any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT14 \u2192 t94\n\nOther non-terminals may derive to t53 through multi-step productions, but if they don't have a direct production, then t53 can't appear as a terminal in the string. So since the grammar doesn't include any rule where a non-terminal directly expands to t53,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-436","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: `t12 t36 t53 t77 t26 t67 t67 t83 t26 t13 t58 t96 t12 t3 t97 t27 t70 t98 t92 t25 t84 t94 t84 t46`.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The grammar starts with S, which is the initial symbol. The grammar has multiple non-terminals (like NT9, NT65, etc.) and eventually, they all resolve to 't' symbols followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S -> NT6 NT58. So the entire string should be built from these non-terminals expanding down to 't's.\n\nSince each production in CNF either produces a terminal or two non-terminals, each rule has length two. So the derivation starts with S and splits into two non-terminals, each of which becomes more terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't12' and ends with 't46'. Each of these must correspond to a path in the grammar that starts from S and ends at each 't'.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to see if all the 't's in the string can be derived from the grammar by following the production rules. Each 'tX' must be reachable from some non-terminal that eventually leads back to S through a series of derivations.\n\nWait, but how do I check that? Maybe I can list all the non-terminals that derive each 'tX' and ensure that each can connect back to the root. Alternatively, maybe the string should consist of a sequence that can be built by expanding S step by step, each expansion producing two parts that match the next segments of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to check that each segment after expanding S must match the string in parts. But this might get complicated given the length of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken into a sequence of productions that each split into the next parts. For example, S -> NT6 NT58, then each of those NTs needs to produce the next terminals.\n\nWait, the string has 25 't's. Each expansion from S will split the current symbols into two, so the number of symbols in the derivation tree will increase exponentially. But since the string is 25 symbols, maybe after several splits, all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut tracking each step would be tedious. Another approach is to see that all the non-terminals in the grammar expand to certain terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly map to a 'tX'. For instance:\n\nNT94 -> 't77' (and similarly others like NT73->t25, etc.)\n\nSo for each 'tX' in the string, I need to see if there's a path from S to that 'tX' via the grammar.\n\nWait, but the 't's are part of the terminals, so each segment in the derived string must come from a path through the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be divided into a series of non-terminals that each split into two parts, which then become terminals.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to represent the string as a structure that is built from the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps I can map each terminal in the string to a specific non-terminal that it comes from. For instance, 't12' is derived from NT44, as per the grammar: NT44 -> t83 (and other examples), but wait, perhaps I should look up each 'tX' to see which NT they come from.\n\nWait, let me list all the mappings from NTs to their terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT73 -> 't25'\nNT79 -> 't16'\nNT63 -> 't36'\nNT15 -> 't94'\nNT69 -> 't67'\nNT46 -> 't28'\nNT66 -> 't96'\nNT79 -> 't27'\nNT94 -> 't14'\nNT2 -> 't70'\nNT36 -> 't64'\nNT56 -> 't72'\nNT69 -> 't13'\nNT87 -> 't98'\nNT27 -> 't4'\nNT38 -> 't68'\nNT22 -> 't87'\nNT9 -> 't26'\nNT46 -> 't87' (same as above)\nNT39 -> 't58'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT58 -> 't46'\nNT44 -> 't83'\nNT55 -> 't92'\nNT62 -> 't84'\nNT80 -> 't22'\nNT38 -> 't49'\nNT2 -> 't44'\nNT74 -> 't77' (as S is NT6 and NT58)\nNT... I think I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to make a list.\n\nLet me create a mapping for each NT to the 'tX's it can produce:\n\nNT73: 't25'\nNT79: 't16' and 't27'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nNT79: Looking at the rules, I see lines like NT79 -> NT46 NT22, but also NT79 is sometimes written in rules that go to terminals. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I think the NTs that produce terminals are the ones with rules ending with 'tX'. Let me scan:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the ones that have 'tX' are:\n\nNT95 -> NT27 NT66: perhaps not\nNT74 -> NT9 NT66: not a terminal\nNT63 -> NT94 NT22: no\n...\nWait, better to look for any NT that expand to a terminal. Looking:\n\nNT73: Is there a rule NT73 -> t25? Yes. And NT44 -> t83? Wait, no, looking:\n\nWait, each line of the grammar is a production, which is of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. In this grammar, it's written as NTx -> NTy NTz.\n\nBut looking through the grammar:\n\nFor example, NT94 -> 't77' (from grammar line: NT74 -> NT9 NT66; perhaps I'm misreading). Wait, no, the grammar lines are all A -> BC, not A->a. Wait, hold on, maybe the grammar is a mix, because some NTs have rules that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nWait, let me check one of the lines: for example, NT94 -> 't77'. Is that correct? If yes, then it's a terminal production. But in CNF, each production must be two non-terminals or one terminal. So if NT94 -> t77, then that's allowed.\n\nWait, in CNF, all productions must be in the form A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So some non-terminals may directly produce a single terminal.\n\nThus, the grammar provided is actually in a mix of CNF and full CFG because some rules produce two non-terminals (A->BC), others produce a terminal (A->a). But the problem says it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which would mean that all productions are A->BC. So perhaps I've misread some of the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the lines where it says NTx -> [terminals] are actually expansions that have terminal symbols. But in CNF, a production can have a single terminal on the RHS, meaning it's A->a. So maybe each rule in the grammar is either A->BC or A->a.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some lines have 'tX' on the RHS, which would mean that those NTs derive a single terminal symbol. For example, line NT73 -> 't25', so NT73 can produce 't25' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT95 -> 't27' and 't66'? Wait, no, NT95 has lines like:\n\nNT95 -> NT9 NT69\n\nand\n\nNT95 -> 't27' NT66\n\nWait, that's a problem. If a production has both non-terminals and terminals on the RHS, that's not in CNF. Because in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So some of these lines are violating CNF. But the user stated that it's in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting some of the lines.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, perhaps the 'tX' are the results of further production rules.

{"custom_id":"request-456","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t12 t36 t53 t3 t96 t77 t87 t53 t77 t26 t63 t94 t67 t53 t12 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t28 t94 t13 t84 t46`. \n\nFirst off, I'm a bit rusty on CNF grammars, but I remember that CNF is when every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most of the rules seem to fit this form, except some look a bit different, like `NT2 -> 't9'`, which is just a terminal, so that should be fine.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's a CNF grammar, we can use the CYK algorithm, but given that the string is just a sequence of terminals, maybe a top-down approach or using the grammar's rules to derive the string step by step would work better.\n\nLet me start by looking at the initial symbol S. The start rule is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S must start with NT6 and followed by NT58. Let's check if the string starts with these. The first token is t12\u2014wait, in the grammar, the NT symbols are things like NT6, NT74, etc. Looking at the right-hand sides of the grammar rules, I don't see any NT6 or NT58 as terminals, which suggests that NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals that must be expanded.\n\nWait, but the string has 't12' as the first token. Checking the grammar, I see that NT69 \u2192 t67, and NT65 \u2192 t72, etc. So maybe NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals that can be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58, we need to expand NT6 and NT58 into terminals. Let's see how each can be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT6: In the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So we have to expand NT73 and NT62 further. NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. NT8 is not in the grammar as a non-terminal; looking through the rules, I don't see NT8 defined. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. The rules list includes NT8 \u2192 t12, right? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT8 \u2192 't12'. So NT8 is a production that results in 't12'. That's good. So NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which then branches into NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. NT8 \u2192 t12 and NT9 \u2192 t26.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, NT9 is in the list with NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, and NT9 is also directly connected to other rules. Looking again, I see that NT95 \u2192 't14', but that's not relevant here. Wait, let's check NT9 in the right-hand sides.\n\nHmm, I don't see NT9 as a terminal, so it must be expanded. Let me check the grammar again. Looking through the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, and then both of those are non-terminals. NT68 is in the list: NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67. NT63 \u2192 t36, and NT67 \u2192 t53. Wait, no, checking again, NT67 is 't53'? Wait, let me see. \n\nIn the given grammar, I see for example NT67 \u2192 't53', NT68 \u2192 't12', and so on. Let me check:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n- NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT8 \u2192 't12'\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40\n- NT68 \u2192 't12' (from NT68 \u2192 't12' in the list)\nWait, no, in the list, looking for NT68: I see NT68 \u2192 't12' is not present. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, I see NT8 \u2192 't12' and NT2 \u2192 't9' and so on. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me make a table of all the NTs and see which are terminals.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, there are a few NTs that end with numbers like:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9'\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't16'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n- NT15 -> 't94'\n- NT69 -> 't67'\n- NT46 -> 't28'\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT36 -> 't64'\n- NT56 -> 't72'\n- NT69 -> 't13'\n- NT87 -> 't98'\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n- NT38 -> 't68'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT39 -> 't58'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT85 -> 't76'\n- NT93 -> 't39'\n- NT38 -> 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT74 -> 't77'\n- NT84 -> 't40'\n- NT39 -> 't26'\n- NT27 -> 't7'\n- NT62 -> 't84'\n- NT85 -> 't76'\n- NT93 -> 't39'\n- NT38 -> 't74'\n\nWait, so the terminals are those where the right-hand side is a single 't' followed by a number. So, the terminal symbols are:\n\nt9, t77, t25, t16, t36, t94, t67, t28, t96, t7, t4, t68, t87, t4, t26, t87, t58, t58 (again), t98, t4, t26, t87, t6, t77, t40, t77, t40 (again), t55? Wait, no, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9'\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT79 \u2192 't16'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't28'\n- NT66 \u2192 't96'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT94 \u2192 't14'\n- NT2 \u2192 't70'\n- NT36 \u2192 't64'\n- NT56 \u2192 't72'\n- NT69 \u2192 't13'\n- NT87 \u2192 't98'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- NT38 \u2192 't68'\n- NT22 \u2192 't87'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87' (duplicate)\n- NT39 \u2192 't58'\n- NT2 \u2192 't44'\n- NT85 \u2192 't76'\n- NT93 \u2192 't39'\n- NT38 \u2192 't49'\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT74 \u2192 't77'\n- NT84 \u2192 't40'\n- NT39 \u2192 't26' (duplicate)\n- NT27 \u2192 't7' (duplicate)\n- NT62 \u2192 't84'\n- NT85 \u2192 't76' (duplicate)\n- NT93 \u2192 't39' (duplicate)\n- NT38 \u2192 't74' (duplicate)\n\nWait, I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, but I think each rule is unique.

{"custom_id":"request-460","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is 'S'. The string to evaluate is: t12 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t97 t36 t95 t36 t53 t3 t96 t77 t87 t53 t3 t96 t3 t26 t94 t13 t26 t94 t67.\n\nTo decide if the string is in the language, I'll perform a backward approach, starting from the string and tracing back using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out the tokens in the string:\n1. t12\n2. t77\n3. t87\n4. t53\n5. t13\n6. t96\n7. t97\n8. t36\n9. t95\n10. t36\n11. t53\n12. t3\n13. t96\n14. t77\n15. t87\n16. t53\n17. t3\n18. t96\n19. t3\n20. t26\n21. t94\n22. t13\n23. t26\n24. t94\n25. t67\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule splits into two non-terminals, so each token corresponds to a non-terminal. Thus, the length of the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions needed to generate the string. However, 25 is not a power of two, so maybe I'm wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built by a series of productions, so let's see.\n\nWait, no. Each application of a rule increases the string length by a factor of two, starting from the initial symbol S. So if S expands into two non-terminals, each of those could expand into two, and so on. So the final string length should be 2^n, but the given string has 25 tokens, which is not a power of two. Wait, that seems conflicting. Did I count correctly?\n\nWait, let me count again. The string has the following count:\n\nt12, t77, t87, t53, t13, t96, t97, t36, t95, t36, t53, t3, t96, t77, t87, t53, t3, t96, t3, t26, t94, t13, t26, t94, t67. That's 25 tokens, right? Because each production replaces one symbol with two, so the length starts at 1 (for S), then 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. So 25 isn't a power of two, which raises a red flag. That suggests either I made a mistake in counting or the string might not be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list them again:\n\n1. t12\n2. t77\n3. t87\n4. t53\n5. t13\n6. t96\n7. t97\n8. t36\n9. t95\n10. t36\n11. t53\n12. t3\n13. t96\n14. t77\n15. t87\n16. t53\n17. t3\n18. t96\n19. t3\n20. t26\n21. t94\n22. t13\n23. t26\n24. t94\n25. t67\n\nYes, 25 tokens. So it's not a power of two. That's a problem because each step of the grammar production should double the number of symbols. So, unless the string is empty or the start symbol, the length should be a power of two. Since it's 25, which is 2^4 + 1, that's not possible.\n\nWait, unless the string was built by more complex derivations, but in CNF, each expansion increases the length by powers of two. So the string length should be 2^n, where n is the number of expansions from S. Let's see:\n\nS (step 0) => starts with 1 token, but no, actually S is the start symbol; each production replaces S with two symbols. Wait, no, in CNF, S can directly produce two non-terminals, but if a non-terminal is a terminal, it's a production to a single terminal. But in this case, terminals are like t12, t13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S is first expanded into NT6 and NT58, which are two non-terminals. Then each of these can be expanded further, and so on, until we reach terminals. The total number of terminals produced at the end should be 2^n, where n is the depth of the expansion tree.\n\nSo for a string of length 25, it's not a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the number of symbols derived from S must be a power of two. For example, if S expands once: 2 symbols; twice: 4 symbols; thrice: 8, etc.\n\nSo the answer should be No. But wait, to be thorough, maybe the string includes both terminals and non-terminals that further expand, but the final count would still need to be a power of two. However, the string provided is a flat sequence of 25 terminals, implying that the entire derivation ended at a single level, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string was generated through a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but each non-terminal would have to expand into two symbols, increasing the total count as a power of two. So, a string with 25 symbols can't be formed because 25 is not a power of two. So the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string has 25 symbols, which is not a power of two. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production step doubles the number of symbols, so the total must be a power of two. \n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-472","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is: `t12 t36 t53 t8 t3 t63 t94 t13 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t36 t53 t13 t96 t96 t3 t58 t94 t67 t49 t55 t95 t3`.\n\nFirst, I recall that a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form has productions where each rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal and the right-hand side as two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal or two terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, right-hand sides can have at most two non-terminals, but they can also have terminals. The productions given here all seem to fit CNF because each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or A \u2192 B where B and C are non-terminals. Looking at the given grammar, yes, each production has a non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right, except where the right-hand side is a single terminal, which is allowed in CNF as A \u2192 a.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of terminals: each \"t\" followed by a number. These numbers correspond to specific productions in the grammar. My goal is to trace back from the string to the start symbol S, ensuring that each part of the string corresponds to the right-hand side of a production and that the sequence of productions can derive the string.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to work backwards from the string, trying to find the rightmost non-terminal that can produce the given string. This is similar to using a parse table or recursive descent parsing.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t12\", which must come from a production. In the grammar, I see \"NT12\" is present? Wait, no\u2014looking through the grammar rules, I don't see an NT12. Hmm. All the terminals in the grammar are specific, like \"t77\", \"t66\", etc. The string starts with \"t12\", which isn't directly in the grammar. That might be a problem, but perhaps \"t12\" is derived through a production.\n\nWait, looking again, I see a production: NT84 -> t55 and also NT84 -> t40. But nowhere is there an NT84 that produces t12. Wait, let me check the grammar. Wait, no, in the grammar, I don't see any NT12. Let's list out the productions to see if any of them produce t12.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't9'\nNT94 -> 't77'\nNT73 -> 't25'\nNT79 -> 't16'\nNT63 -> 't36'\nNT15 -> 't94'\nNT69 -> 't67'\nNT46 -> 't28'\nNT66 -> 't96'\nNT79 -> 't27'\nNT94 -> 't14'\nNT2 -> 't70'\nNT36 -> 't64'\nNT56 -> 't72'\nNT69 -> 't13'\nNT87 -> 't98'\nNT27 -> 't4'\nNT38 -> 't68'\nNT22 -> 't87'\nNT9 -> 't26'\nNT46 -> 't87'\nNT39 -> 't58'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT34 -> 't36'\nNT58 -> 't46'\nNT44 -> 't83'\nNT55 -> 't92'\nNT39 -> 't63'\nNT9 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't84'\nNT80 -> 't22'\nNT38 -> 't49'\nNT2 -> 't44'\nNT8 -> 't12'\n\nAh, here is one: NT8 -> t12. So \"t12\" comes directly from NT8.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is \"t12\", which comes from NT8. Now, the next part of the string after \"t12\" is \"t36\". So the next symbol in the string after \"t12\" is \"t36\", meaning that the part after \"t12\" must be a production that produces \"t36\".\n\nWait, but in CFGs, the entire string must be generated by the start symbol S, so the entire string is the result of S's expansion. So I think the approach is to parse the string from left to right, applying productions to derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can parse from the end, using a rightmost derivation. Since the grammar is in CNF, leftmost and rightmost derivations are both valid, but sometimes rightmost is easier for checking.\n\nLet's try working from the end. The last symbol is \"t3\". Looking at the grammar, NT9 -> t3. So the last symbol comes from NT9.\n\nBefore \"t3\", the symbol is \"t95\" (the string is ... t95 t3). So before \"t3\", we have \"t95 t3\". That suggests that the production is NT95 -> t95 followed by something that produces \"t3\".\n\nBut looking at NT95 production: The productions for NT95 are NT95-> NT9 NT66, and NT95-> NT27 NT66. No NT95-> t3 directly. So the \"t95\" must be the result of a production that ends with NT95. Let me see what produces NT95.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals have right-hand sides that include NT95. The productions are:\n\n- NT95: NT95-> NT9 NT66, NT95-> NT27 NT66.\n\nSo the last part \"t95 t3\" has to come from a production like A -> t95 B, but wait, in CNF, productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So it must be that NT95 -> t95 something, but in the grammar, NT95 only has productions that are two non-terminals. That's a problem. Because t95 is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT95 can't produce t95 directly.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, in the productions, I see that NT22 -> t87. Wait, no, I think the productions are all as right-hand sides of non-terminals, where each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for NT95, the productions are NT95-> NT27 NT66 and NT95-> NT9 NT66, both of which are two non-terminals. There's no production for NT95 that produces t95. So the string \"t95 t3\" can't be derived from NT95, because NT95 can't produce a terminal. That would mean the string isn't possible, hence the answer is No. Wait, but before jumping to conclusions, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals can produce terminals directly. Let me check. For example, looking at NT6, which is present in the productions: NT6-> NT73 NT62, NT6-> t73. So NT6 can produce a terminal t73.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT95: Is there a production that results in a terminal? Checking all the productions, the ones that have a single terminal on the right side are:\n\nNT2 -> t9 (multiple times)\nNT74->t77\nNT73->t25\nNT79->t16\nNT63->t36\nNT15->t94\nNT69->t67\nNT46->t28\nNT66->t96\nNT79->t27\nNT94->t14\nNT2->t70\nNT36->t64\nNT56->t72\nNT69->t13\nNT87->t98\nNT27->t4\nNT38->t68\nNT22->t87\nNT9->t26\nNT46->t87\nNT39->t58\nNT2->t44\nNT8->t12\nNT62->t84\nNT80->t22\nNT38->t49\nNT2->t44\nNT8->t12\nWait, so NT8->t12, which I noted earlier. So that's one.\n\nOther non-terminals that produce terminals: Let's list all the productions where the right-hand side is a single terminal:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nNT2-> t9, t70, t44 (three times)\nNT74->t77\nNT73->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-475","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite complex with a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a long sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this grammar allows. The Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) productions are all in the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol which can go to a single terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems that all the non-terminals (like S, NT74, etc.) have two terminal symbols on the right side, except for the ones that directly produce 't' something, like the production NT2 \u2192 't9'. But most of them produce two 't' and numbers, which are terminals? Wait, no\u2014wait, the arrows are terminals like 't1', but are these 't' and numbers considered terminals or non-terminals? Wait, the grammar is given with symbols like 'NT' followed by numbers, and then some 't' followed by numbers. So in this case, 't' followed by numbers are terminals, right? So, for example, NT2 \u2192 't9' is a production from the non-terminal NT2 to the terminal sequence 't9'. So each production in the grammar either produces another non-terminal or a pair of terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have a mix where each production either results in two terminals, which are like 't12', 't77', etc., or a combination of non-terminals. So to parse the string, I'll need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string given is: `t12 t77 t87 t53 t77 t87 t53 t36 t53 t13 t96 t96 t26 t13 t27 t44 t96 t36 t53 t77 t72 t58 t94 t13 t97 t46`\n\nSo first, the string starts with 't12'. Looking at the grammar, I need to see if any production starts with NT and ends with 't12'. Looking at the productions:\n\nThe only production that ends with 't12' is NT84 \u2192 't40' and others don't directly produce 't12'. Wait, actually, looking through the productions, there's a production NT84 \u2192 't40'. But 't40' isn't 't12'. Let me check for any production that directly produces 't12' as the first step. Looking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S produces two non-terminals NT6 and NT58. So the first two symbols of the string must come from NT6 and NT58. So the string starts with 't12 t77'. So the first element is 't12' from NT6 and the second from NT58, which gives 't77'. So that would require NT6 \u2192 't12' and NT58 \u2192 't77'. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nIn the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't73' (from NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62; but wait, that's a production for NT6 as NT73 and NT62, which are both non-terminals. Wait, no, looking at NT6: the production is NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So to get 't12', maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps I need to break down the string step by step, constructing the parse tree.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by finding a way to split it into the correct non-terminals. Since the start symbol is S, which splits into NT6 and NT58. So the string must be a sequence that starts with NT6 and then NT58.\n\nSo first, the part before the split is 't12 t77 t87 t53 ...' up to the split, and the second part is what's generated by NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to attempt to parse the given string by starting from the left, applying the grammar's productions to see if it can be built up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each production, when decomposed, can generate the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work through a step-by-step parse.\n\n1. The string starts with 't12', so the first element is 't12'. Let's look at the possible non-terminals that produce 't12' as part of their production. Looking at the given grammar, there isn't a production that starts with any non-terminal and produces 't12' directly. So maybe I need to see if any non-terminal can derive 't12' through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT rules that can lead to 't12' as part of a chain. For example, NT6 is defined as NT73 and NT62. So to find 't12', I need to see how NT73 or NT62 can produce 't12'.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT73 has two rules: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 and NT73 \u2192 't25'. Oh, so NT73 can produce 't25' as a terminal, but 't25' is not 't12'. So that doesn't help. Other NTs:\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce 't12' directly. There's no NT in the grammar that directly produces 't12', but maybe it can be derived through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe 't12' can be generated by a non-terminal that eventually produces 't12'. For example, perhaps some NT produces a chain that ends in 't12'. Looking for any NT that could lead to 't12':\n\nLooking through the productions, maybe NT13. Let's see:\n\nThe productions for NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT28 NT93 and NT13 \u2192 NT52 NT66.\n\nLooking at NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT93, NT28 \u2192 't93'.\n\nSo if NT28 produces 't93', but 't93' is not 't12'. Alternatively, NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT19 NT28 and NT52 \u2192 't68'. Again, not helpful for 't12'.\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce 't12':\n\nWait, perhaps NT96: NT96 \u2192 NT46 NT53, NT96 \u2192 NT72 NT36.\n\nLooking at NT46: NT46 \u2192 NT28 NT74, NT46 \u2192 NT87 NT66.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look at the entire string and see if it can be split into a series of production rules.\n\nLet me group the string into parts based on the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t12 t77 t87 t53 t77 t87 t53 t36 t53 t13 t96 t96 t26 t13 t27 t44 t96 t36 t53 t77 t72 t58 t94 t13 t97 t46.\n\nGiven that S starts with NT6 and NT58, let's see how each part is generated.\n\nFirst, the first two tokens are t12 and t77. So perhaps the initial split into NT6 (generating t12) and NT58 (generating t77).\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So perhaps the t12 comes from NT73 and another part. Wait, but NT6 is produced as NT73 and NT62. So t12 would come from NT73 and t77 from NT62? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the split. Alternatively, maybe the production is in a way that the first part is t12 and the next part is the production of NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is that S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the string must be t12 followed by t77, t87, etc., but how do these tokens line up with the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived sequentially from the start symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the start symbol S and look for a way the entire string can be produced.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can break the string into pairs of productions based on the grammar's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that each production in the grammar either produces two terminals or two non-terminals.

Since it's in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal generating exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be broken down into these productions.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I can start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive this string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S must start with NT6 and NT58, which correspond to parts of the string. Looking at the string, the first two elements are t25 and t84. Wait, but S produces NT6 and NT58, which might translate to t25 and t84. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the rule NT79 \u2192 t16 and NT79 \u2192 NT28 NT73. Also, NT63 \u2192 t36. Hmm, but I need to see if the first two symbols t25 and t84 can come from NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT79 \u2192 t25 because in the grammar, NT79 has a production to t25. So if NT6 is t25, that's possible. Similarly, NT58 \u2192 t84 because there's a production NT58 \u2192 t84.\n\nSo the first two symbols t25 t84 could come from NT6 NT58, which is S's first production. So that's good.\n\nNext, I need to see if the rest of the string can be generated from the result of NT6 and NT58. Let's break down each part.\n\nNT6 must become t25. Looking at the production rules, where does NT6 come from? In the grammar, NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67, and NT79 \u2192 t25. Wait, but NT6 isn't directly a terminal. Maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, NT6 can't be a terminal unless it's somewhere in the productions. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT6 as a terminal, so NT6 must be further expanded. Hmm, that's a problem because t25 is a terminal, so if NT6 can only produce other non-terminals, how does that become t25?\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check. The rule for NT79 is NT79 \u2192 t25, so if a NT79 can produce t25. Similarly, NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67. So if NT6 is actually a non-terminal that can produce t25, but in the first step, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S would generate two symbols: if NT6 can produce t25, and NT58 can produce t84, then that's correct. So how does NT6 produce t25?\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT6 as a production, but I don't see any rules where NT6 directly produces a terminal. Instead, it seems that other non-terminals produce terminals. So unless NT6 has a production to a terminal, it can't generate a t25. That seems like a problem because if S \u2192 NT6 NT58, and NT6 can't produce t25, then S can't start with t25. Wait, but in the given string, the very first symbol is t25, so this suggests that NT6 must produce t25.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nIs there any rule where NT6 directly produces a terminal? Scanning through the rules, I don't see any. It seems that NT6 only appears on the left-hand side of productions that produce combinations of other non-terminals, not terminals. So for example, NT79 \u2192 t25 is a terminal, but NT6 doesn't produce any terminal.\n\nThis is a problem because the first symbol in the string is t25, which would have to come from NT6, but NT6 can't produce t25. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. However, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT69 \u2192 t67, NT38 \u2192 t68, NT27 \u2192 t4, etc. But NT6 is not in the right-hand side of any production as a terminal. It only appears as a non-terminal in other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in associating S \u2192 NT6 NT58 with t25 and t84. Let me confirm: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So if NT6 generates t25 and NT58 generates t84, that's the first part. But since NT6 must generate t25, but the grammar doesn't have a production for NT6 \u2192 t25, that's not possible. So unless there's a way for NT6 to produce t25, the string can't be generated.\n\nIs there any rule where NT6 is a terminal? No, in the grammar, every rule for a non-terminal on the left has either other non-terminals or terminals on the right, but I don't see NT6 being a terminal; it's a non-terminal that only appears on the left side of productions that produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, unless the start symbol can directly produce something. But the start symbol is S, which is NT6 NT58, so that's the first step. So S must expand to NT6 and NT58, which in turn must expand to t25 and t84, but NT6 can't do that because it only produces other non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol t25 cannot be derived from NT6, which isn't allowed.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side, except the start symbol which can produce a terminal. The start symbol is S, and it produces NT6 NT58. So, the string must start with t12 because NT6 \u2192 t12 is one of the options.\n\nLooking at the string: t12 t36 t53 t13 t96 t97 t36 t95 t36 t53 t77 t26 t26 t94 t13 t49 t39 t22 t53 t12 t3 t87 t94 t26 t94 t87 t94 t13.\n\nThe first token is t12, which matches S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the initial expansions would be NT6 and NT58. Let's explore each path.\n\nStarting with NT6: The production for NT6 is NT73 NT62. So, the next symbols should be t73 and t62. But in the string, after t12, the next token is t36, which doesn't match t73 or t62. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build the parse tree step by step. Let me list the string again: t12, t36, t53, t13, t96, t97, t36, t95, t36, t53, t77, t26, t26, t94, t13, t49, t39, t22, t53, t12, t3, t87, t94, t26, t94, t87, t94, t13.\n\nSince the start is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so first we have t12 and t36. Wait, no, NT6 \u2192 t12 and NT58 \u2192 t36. So the first two tokens are t12, t36. But in the string, the first token is t12, followed by t36, which matches. Then next, we need to split each of these into their components.\n\nNT6 is NT73 NT62. So after t12, we have t73 and t62. But the next token is t53, not t73. So maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the NT58 part is producing more than one token.\n\nWait, NT58's production: Looking at the grammar, NT58 is 10 rules. I think the main production for NT58 is NT84 NT9. Let me see. So NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So the next after t36 would be NT84 NT9. Then NT84 is NT34 NT93. So after that, NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65. So t34 is t58 and t65.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the initial production is t12 and t36. But let's see the string:\n\nt12 t36 t53 t13 t96 t97 t36 t95 t36 t53 t77 t26 t26 t94 t13 t49 t39 t22 t53 t12 t3 t87 t94 t26 t94 t87 t94 t13.\n\nAfter t12 and t36, we have t53. So we need to see if NT6 can produce something that leads to t53. Wait, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which must be followed by NT73 and NT62. But t53 is a terminal; none of these rules directly produce t53. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NT structure.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar rules for NTs that lead directly to a terminal. Looking through the grammar, NT2 has a production that leads to 't9', and there are others like NT34 \u2192 t36, but I'm not seeing an NT that directly leads to t53. So perhaps t53 is part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a production where the NT leads directly to t53. Let me check all NTs. For instance, NT46 \u2192 t28, NT28 \u2192 t38, etc. Oh, I don't see any NT that directly produce t53. That might be a problem because t53 would need to be part of a longer derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in seeing the grammar. Let's re-examine the rules:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT78 \u2192 t53. So if somewhere an NT78 is produced, it would result in t53. So maybe somewhere along the parse, a NT78 is needed to produce t53.\n\nSo, after starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58 \u2192 t12 and t36, we now have to split these into their components. Let's take NT6 first: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So after t12 comes t73 and t62. But the next token in the string is t53, not t73 or t62. So how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT58 is producing the t53 part. So let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58 \u2192 t12 (from NT6) and then NT58.\n\nNT58 has multiple productions. Looking through the grammar, one of NT58's rules is NT84 NT9. So perhaps after t12 comes t84 and t9. Then t84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. So after t84 comes t34 and t93. t34 is NT58 NT65 \u2192 t58 t65.\n\nBut we're looking for t53. Hmm, this doesn't seem to be leading anywhere. Let's try another approach.\n\nPerhaps instead of starting with S, let's see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar. Maybe I'll look for patterns in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t12, which is from NT6 \u2192 t12. So we have t12, then t36. Then the string continues with t53, which as we saw earlier, requires an NT78 or something that leads to t53.\n\nWait, let's consider that after t12 and t36, we have t53, t13, etc. So maybe after t12 and t36, we have another split. Let's try:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So after t12 comes t73 and t62. t73 leads to NT78 NT73. NT78 is one of the rules. So if t73 is NT78, it would produce t53 and t95? Wait, NT78 \u2192 t53 t95. No, looking back, the rules for NT78 include NT52 and NT80, but I don't see NT78 directly leading to t53. Wait, do I see a NT78 that produces t53? Looking at the rules, I don't. Instead, NT78 can produce NT52 NT80, which are NTs. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t53 is coming from a different path. For example, is there an NT27 \u2192 t4? No. Wait, there's NT27 \u2192 t4? No, looking back, the rules: NT27 \u2192 't4'. So maybe NT27 would produce t4, but I don't see t4 in the string.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNow, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nSo, after t12 comes t73 (NT73) and t62 (NT62).\n\nLooking at NT73: Its production is NT8 NT9. So after t73, we have t8 and t9.\n\nWait, but the next part of the string after t73 would be t8 and t9. But in the given string, after t73 (if that's the case), the next token is t53, which doesn't fit. So that suggests that this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT73 produces something else. Let me check the rules for NT73. Oh, yes, there's \"NT73 \u2192 t80 t2\" as a production. So if NT73 is 't80 t2', then t80 would come next."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-515","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is quite long. Let me see how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. All the productions are from a single non-terminal to exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. That's typical Chomsky Normal Form. The start symbol is S, and it's broken down into NT6 and NT58. Each of those then breaks down further, and so on until we reach terminals which correspond to 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t25 t97 t36 t95 t36 t53 t13 t96 t74 t36 t95 t95 t36 t53 t36 t53 t77 t58 t12 t3 t97 t16 t9 t96 t26 t26 t94 t13`\n\nFirst, I notice that all the terminals are either two-digit numbers (like t25, t97, t36) or single digits (t3), but in the grammar, most are two-digit except for a few like t36 (but t36 is a production from NT63, which is split into two non-terminals).\n\nWait, but looking back, I see that some NT productions are directly mapped to terminals. For example, NT94 -> t77, so whenever we have t77 in the string, it corresponds to NT94. Similarly, NT73 -> t25, so t25 is NT73. So each of these terminals is part of the derivation.\n\nNow, the grammar has many productions. I need to see if there's a way to parse the string step by step, breaking it down according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut considering the string is 42 tokens long, it's going to be a long parse. Maybe I can look for the structure of the string in parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map the structure of the grammar. Starting from S, which produces NT6 NT58. So S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nSo the first step would be to split the string into two parts, one corresponding to NT6 and the other to NT58. Then recursively parse each part.\n\nBut wait, the string is given in order, so the first part should correspond to NT6, and the second to NT58. So let's split the string into two: from the start up to some point, which is NT6, and the rest is NT58.\n\nWait, but it's more efficient to think about the entire string as S: NT6 NT58. So the first part must derive to NT6, and the second to NT58.\n\nLet me look at NT6 and NT58. The production for NT6 is NT73 NT62. So NT6 must break down into NT73 and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 is in two places: one is NT84 NT9, and another is NT46. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT58, the productions are NT84 NT9 and also from the bottom, I think it's part of NT46 as well. Wait, let me check the given grammar again. Oh, the user provided a lot of NT entries, I need to look for NT58.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, I see NT58 has two productions:\n\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9\n\nand perhaps from other NTs. Wait, from the end of the list:\n\nNT56 -> NT95 NT36\n\nWait, no, maybe I missed it. Looking again, in the top part, NT58 is given as NT58 -> NT84 NT9. So primary production for NT58 is NT84 NT9.\n\nSo to generate the string, the second part of the S split, which is NT58, must be NT84 NT9. So the second half of the string should be NT84 followed by NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 is NT73 NT62, so the first part should be NT73 followed by NT62.\n\nSo let me split the entire string into two parts:\n\nFirst part: from the start until we have NT73 and NT62.\n\nWait, but NT73 is a production that turns into t25 and NT8, which is t12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT73 -> t25. So that's a terminal, so it must correspond to just t25. So that part is straightforward.\n\nThen the next part is NT62. Looking back, NT62 -> NT84 NT62? Wait, no, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking for NT62: from the list, I see NT85 -> NT95 NT50, but not directly NT62. Wait, looking through the list, I think it might be in the later entries.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nYes, there's NT62 -> NT97 NT6. So NT62 must break down into NT97 and NT6.\n\nSo the string will start with NT73, which is t25, then the next part is NT62, which is NT97 (producing t97) and NT6 (producing t73? Wait no: NT6's production is NT73 NT62, which we've already broken down. Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.\n\nWait, let's step back. S is NT6 NT58, which becomes NT73 NT62 and NT84 NT9.\n\nSo the entire string must consist of two parts: NT73 NT62 followed by NT84 NT9.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t25, then t97, etc.\n\nBut let me see:\n\nS splits into NT6 and NT58.\n\nNT6: NT73 NT62. So after NT73, we have NT62.\n\nThen NT58: NT84 NT9.\n\nSo the entire string should be:\n\nNT73 (t25) followed by NT62, which is NT97 (t97) and NT6 (which is NT73 NT62 again? Or wait, NT6 is NT73 NT62, so NT62 can't be further broken down, right?\n\nWait, no: NT62 is a non-terminal. So when you have NT62, it must be replaced by its productions. Looking at the grammar, NT62 -> NT97 NT6.\n\nSo NT62 -> NT97 NT6.\n\nBut NT6 is NT73 NT62, so breaking that down:\n\nSo the entire string starting with NT6 (which is NT73 NT62) and then NT58 (which is NT84 NT9) would have the structure:\n\nt25 (NT73) followed by NT62 (which is NT97 NT6), and then NT84 and t9.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the overall parse tree.\n\nThe string must start with NT73 (t25), then NT62 (which is NT97 and NT6), then NT84, then NT9 (t9).\n\nBut NT62 is NT97 NT6. So after t97, we have NT6, which is NT73 NT62.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nt25 (NT73) | (nt62) (NT97) (NT6) | (NT84) | t9\n\nSo the entire string would be t25 t97 t25 t97 ... No, wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let me consider this more carefully.\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9\n\nTherefore, S produces NT73 NT62 NT84 NT9.\n\nEach of these non-terminals must derive to a string of terminals.\n\nSo breaking down each non-terminal:\n\n- NT73 -> t25\n- NT62 -> NT97 NT6\n- NT84 -> ?\n- NT9 -> t9\n\nWait, wait: NT62 is NT97 NT6, which is NT97 (t97) followed by NT6 (which is NT73 NT62 again). So that would be t97 followed by t25 followed by NT62 again.\n\nWait, that's recursive. Hmm, perhaps I'm going into an infinite loop here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by recursively applying each production.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nThe entire string must be the concatenation of the two parts from NT6 and NT58.\n\nNT6 is NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 is t25.\n\nNT62 is NT97 NT6.\n\nNT97 is t97.\n\nNT6 is NT73 NT62.\n\nSo putting it together: t25 followed by NT62, which is t97 followed by NT6.

{"custom_id":"request-540","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is pretty long, so it might take some time, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and all the productions start with S and move towards the terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, the start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the starting point is to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT6 and NT58. The rest of the string should be generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nLet me write down the string: t12 t26 t97 t55 t14 t87 t53 t8 t98 t92 t12 t36 t53 t77 t72 t84 t16 t83 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t26 t94 t13 t4 t96.\n\nI'll split this into two parts at the first NT6 and NT58. The start would be NT6 generating the first part of the string, and NT58 generating the rest. Let's see what the first symbol for NT6 is. The first symbol is t12, which must be part of NT6's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 is defined as NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So to get t12, I need to see if any production leads to t12. Scanning through, I see that NT8 is defined as NT8 \u2192 t12. So NT8 \u2192 t12. But how can NT6 generate NT8? Let me check the productions for NT6: NT6 can go to NT73 NT62 or NT34 NT53 or NT44 NT14 etc. Hmm, maybe NT6 can go to NT34 NT53. Let's check NT34's productions. Wait, there\u2019s an NT36 \u2192 t79 and NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 needs to produce t12 as the first symbol. Let's trace how NT6 can reach t12 via the given productions.\n\nLooking for NT6 productions:\n\nNT6: \u2192 NT73 NT62, NT34 NT53, NT44 NT14, NT65 \u2192 NT38 NT84, NT96 \u2192 NT84 NT17, etc.\n\nSo to produce t12, that must come from somewhere in the expansion tree. Let me look for the production that gives t12. Scanning through, I see NT8 \u2192 t12. So perhaps NT6 can derive into a sequence that eventually leads to NT8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does NT6 produce NT8 directly? Let's see. No. So how does NT6 get to t12? Let's look at the possible paths. NT6 can go to NT34 NT53. NT34 is in the productions: NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65. So NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT53 \u2192 NT58 NT65 NT53.\n\nThen, NT58 is a production that might lead to t12. Looking at NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. Then NT84 can go to NT34 NT93 or NT55 NT56, etc. This seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I shouldn't think about how it's generated directly but check if the string can be split correctly according to the grammar, starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Then, for NT6 to produce the first part, and NT58 the second.\n\nLet me check if t12 can be part of NT6. Looking at NT6's productions, it starts with NT73 NT62 or others, so perhaps t12 is generated through a chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that NT6 can be broken down. Let me see if NT6 can generate a terminal symbol t12. Let me look at NT6's productions and see what leads to t12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the recursive approach. Starting from S, and trying to derive the string by breaking it into the two parts of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo the entire string has 34 symbols. S will generate NT6 and NT58, each producing 17 symbols. So each part is 17 symbols.\n\nLooking at the first 17 symbols: t12 t26 t97 t55 t14 t87 t53 t8 t98 t92 t12 t36 t53 t77 t72 t84 t16.\n\nWait, but no, the string is split at S \u2192 NT6 NT58. The entire string is a single sequence of symbols, so perhaps it's better to consider the full string as being generated by NT6 and NT58 in sequence. Each non-terminal (NTx) must generate their own substring, and concatenated together, they should form the input string.\n\nSo, in this case, NT6 must generate the first 17 characters, and NT58 the next 17. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should count the exact number of symbols each NT can produce.\n\nWait, no, that's a mistake. Each NT can generate a string of terminals, but the number of symbols isn't fixed unless we know their expansion. For example, a production A \u2192 a would contribute one symbol, but A \u2192 BC would contribute two. So we can't assume that each NT produces exactly 17 symbols.\n\nSo, another approach: For each non-terminal in the production, check if its expansion can generate the required string part.\n\nLet's tackle NT6 first. The first symbol is t12, so let's see how NT6 can derive t12. If NT6's expansion starts with t12, then it must have a production that leads to it. Looking at the grammar, the only way is through NT8 \u2192 t12. So somehow, NT6 must derive a string that starts with NT8, which then produces t12.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: none directly lead to NT8, but let's see if through some chain.\n\nFor example, NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT53. Then NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, and then NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. NT84 can go to NT34 NT93 or NT55 NT56, etc. Maybe this can eventually lead to a NT8 somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, NT6 \u2192 NT44 NT14. Then NT44 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and NT77 is a terminal. Hmm, but NT6's first symbol is t12, which might come from NT77? Wait, no, because NT77 is a symbol in the grammar, but maybe it's a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides have a mix. For example, NT80 \u2192 t22, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT76 \u2192 t98, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, to see if t12 can come from NT6, perhaps through NT8.\n\nLet me try to see if NT6 can eventually derive NT8 somewhere in the tree.

{"custom_id":"request-536","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what's given.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I see a mix of non-terminals and terminals, with some appearing as literals after the arrow. So, these are terminal symbols, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t25 t84 t46 t74 t40 t95 t3 t49 t40 t3 t74 t40 t95 t39 t36 t53 t36 t53 t13 t96 t96 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t58 t94 t13`\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the only production from S is S -> NT6 NT58. So, the string must begin with the sequence generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few terms are t25, t84, which stand out because in the grammar, NT79 maps to t27, but here we have t25. Wait, no, the productions list shows that NT94 -> 't77' and NT73 -> 't25'. So, NT73 is t25. So the first part of the string could be matching from NT73.\n\nBut NT73 can produce NT8 and NT9 via NT73 -> NT8 NT9. Let's see what the first few tokens are:\n\nt25 (which is NT73), then t84, which I need to check if that's possible.\n\nLooking through the productions, t84 is generated by NT34. Wait, no. Let's see: NT84 can produce NT34 and NT93. NT34 in turn produces t36 and NT65, and NT65 in turn can be NT58 and NT84. NT58 can produce t46 and NT9. So it's getting a bit complex.\n\nMaybe it's better to build a parse tree or use the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is a bit involved, perhaps I can approach it step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if all tokens are in the production of some non-terminal and if the leftmost derivation can produce the string.\n\nStarting with S -> NT6 NT58. So the first step is to produce NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t25, which is generated by NT73. But NT6 doesn't directly produce t25. Wait, maybe I mixed up. NT73 is a production that produces t25, so if NT73 is part of the parse tree, the first token could be t25. But NT6 is part of S's production, so perhaps S's first two non-terminals are NT6 and NT58, which need to expand to t25 and t84, respectively.\n\nWait, but NT6 is a non-terminal, so it needs to be expanded. Let's see what NT6 can produce. Looking through the productions, NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 is NT73 and NT62.\n\nBut NT73 -> t25. So if S starts by deriving NT6, which is NT73 and NT62, then the first token could be t25 from NT73. So the first part of the string t25 would be matched by NT73.\n\nThen the second non-terminal NT58: looking at the productions, NT58. Let's find what NT58 produces. Scanning down, I see NT58 -> NT84 NT9. So NT58 can produce NT84 and NT9.\n\nSo, the first part would be NT73 (t25) and NT58 (which leads to NT84 and NT9). Next token in the string is t84, so let's see if NT84 can produce t84. Looking through the productions, NT34 produces t36 NT65, and NT65 is NT58 NT84. NT58 is NT84 NT9, so that goes in circles.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down. NT58 is NT84 and NT9. NT84 in the productions is NT34 and NT93. So NT84 can produce NT34 (which leads to t36 and NT65) or NT93 (which I need to check). Wait, is there a terminal for NT84? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT34 -> t36 NT65. NT65 -> NT58 NT84. So NT34 can produce t36 and NT65. NT58 is itself in the production chain, leading to a loop. Alternatively, let me check if any NT can directly produce a terminal like t84.\n\nWait, I think I might have mixed up NTs. Let me look again. The productions include NT94 -> 't77' and NT73 -> 't25'. But does any NT produce t84 directly? Or does t84 come from a specific NT.\n\nLooking at the string, after t25 (NT73), the next token is t84. So we need to see if NT58 can produce t84 as the next symbol. But looking at the productions, I don't see NT58 producing t84 directly. Instead, NT84 is derived from NT34 and NT93, and NT93 from NT78 and NT73, and so on. This seems too indirect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that NT58 first produces NT84 and NT9. So the first token after t25 could be NT84 producing t84, then NT9 producing something else.\n\nBut wait, the next token in the string is t84. So if the second non-terminal is NT58, which can produce NT84, then the next token is t84, which would come from NT84's expansion.\n\nBut wait, the second non-terminal in S is NT58, so the first production would be NT6 (as part of S) and NT58. So the string starts with the expansion of NT6 followed by NT58. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I should write out the initial expansion steps.\n\nS -> NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nSo after S, we have NT73 NT62, which would produce the first two tokens, t25 and then something else from NT62.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t25, which is correct for NT73. Then the second token is t84. But according to the expansion, after NT73 (t25), the next non-terminal is NT62. So what does NT62 produce?\n\nLooking through the productions, NT62 can produce... let me scan the list. I see NT62 -> 't97' right? Wait, in the list, I see entries like NT85 -> 't85', but I need to look for NT62.\n\nWait, yes, let's look: yes, there's 'NT62 -> 't97''. So NT62 can directly produce the token t97. Wait, but in the string, the second token is t84, so that doesn't match NT62. Hmm, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-examine the string:\n\nThe string is `t25 t84 t46 t74 t40 t95 t3 t49 t40 t3 t74 t40 t95 t39 t36 t53 t36 t53 t13 t96 t96 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t58 t94 t13`\n\nSo after t25, the next token is t84. So if S produces NT6 and NT58, and NT6 produces t25, then NT58 must produce t84 as the next token. But from NT58's productions, I don't see any that produce t84 directly. Because NT58 is NT84 and NT9, and neither of those produce t84. Wait, let's see: NT58 -> NT84 NT9. Then, NT84 can produce NT34 NT93. So it's a chain, so t84 is actually part of the expansion of NT58. But perhaps it's not a terminal directly.\n\nHmm, so maybe the first part, t25, is from NT73, but then NT62 is producing t97, which doesn't match t84. That suggests that the S's expansion starting with NT6 isn't working because the second"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That makes parsing a bit easier, but I'm still a bit new to this, so let me take it step by step.\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of S productions, but the main one is S -> NT6 NT58. So the entire string starts with NT6 and NT58. Looking at the string, the first two tokens are 't25' and 't84'. Wait, let me check the grammar for these.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules. Let's see, NT73 is NT8 NT9, but that's not matching 't25' or 't84'. Hmm, I need to find which NT tokens correspond to 't25' and 't84'. Scanning through the grammar:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n- NT56 -> 't72'\n- NT56 -> 't72' (also NT95 -> 't14', etc.)\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25' \u2192 So NT73 is 't25'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n\nLooking at the string, the start is 't25 t84 t40 ...'. So first token is 't25', which must come from NT73. So S -> NT6 NT58 would derive NT73 (t25) and NT58. So NT58 needs to produce t84.\n\nLooking at NT58's productions:\n\n- NT58 -> NT84 NT9\n- NT58 -> NT46 NT9\n- NT58 -> NT96 NT17\n- etc.\n\nWait, from the grammar, I can see that NT58 has these rules. So for NT58 to produce 't84', which is a terminal, do any of its productions end with t84? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT58 -> NT84 NT9, so that's possibly how. So T84 is a terminal. So for t84 to be produced, that would require NT58 to be split into NT84 and NT9. But NT84 is a terminal, right?\n\nLooking at NT84's productions:\n\n- NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n- NT84 -> NT55 NT66\n- NT84 -> NT95 NT36\n- etc.\n\nSo NT84 is non-terminal. So 't84' can only come from a direct production. Wait, looking back, is there any NT that directly produces t84 as a terminal? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT56 -> 't72'\n- NT59 -> 't95' (but that's non-terminal)\nWait, is there any rule where NT84 is directly a terminal? Looking through, the only terminal mentioned is 't77' in NT94, 't25' in NT73, 't27' in NT79, 't14' in NT95, etc. So 't84' isn't directly a terminal in the grammar. So how can the string have 't84' if it's not a terminal in any of the NT productions?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The NT productions are the non-terminals, and when they produce a terminal, it's by being replaced by that terminal. But looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't84' as a terminal. So 't84' must come from a chain where an NT eventually expands into 't84' through some productions.\n\nWait, let's check again.\n\nLooking at NT58 -> NT84 NT9. So NT84 would have to be expanded. Let's see how NT84 can get to 't84'.\n\nLooking at NT84's productions:\n\n- NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n- NT84 -> NT55 NT66\n- NT84 -> NT95 NT36\n\nSo none of these directly produce terminals except if any of the components result in terminals. Wait, perhaps chain productions could lead to a terminal like t84.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps 't84' is a terminal in another NT's production. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that directly converts to 't84'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't84' as a terminal. The only direct terminals are in NT73 ('t25'), NT63 ('t36'), etc. So perhaps 't84' must come from a longer production chain, but that would require the grammar to have a path where, for example, NT84 eventually leads to 't84'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check the NT production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT84's productions are:\n  NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n  NT84 -> NT55 NT66\n  NT84 -> NT95 NT36\nNone of these are terminal, so 't84' can't directly come from NT84. So perhaps the string contains an invalid token because 't84' isn't in the grammar as a terminal, making the string ungenerable.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again. In the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT58 -> NT84 NT9 (which would require NT84 to produce t84 somehow)\n- But NT84 has no rules that directly produce a terminal except for:\n\nWait, looking again at NT84:\n\nActually, in the grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT84 -> NT34 NT93\n\nNT84 -> NT55 NT66\n\nNT84 -> NT95 NT36\n\nWait, none of these are terminals. So unless there's a way to have NT84 eventually produce t84 via a chain, which I don't see here.\n\nSo if the string has 't84', but according to the grammar, there's no production where an NT directly outputs 't84', then the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine because perhaps I missed a direct terminal. Let me scan all the NT productions for terminals:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT78 -> 't67'\n- NT95 -> 't15' (in a different list? Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\nNT58 -> 't46'\nNo, wait, that's not listed. Wait, looking through the list:\n\nWait, I think I may have misread. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a multi-line string, but I need to find all the NT-> terminals. Let me look at the end of the grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT29 -> ... but no, actually, the last part is:\n\nNT46 -> 't87'\n\nNT28 -> 't49'\n\nNT27 -> 't7'\n\nNT44 -> 't83'\n\nNT45 -> 't92'? Wait, no, looking through, I see:\n\n- NT55 -> 't92'\n- NT84 -> 't55'\n- NT93 -> 't39'\n- etc.\n\nWait, let me search for 't' followed by numbers:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT69 -> 't67'\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT94 -> 't14' (is there a duplicate?)\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules, the only terminals are:\n\n- 't25', 't77', 't27', 't67', 't14', 't87', 't96', 't49', 't16', 't36', 't43' (maybe?), 't26', 't74', etc.\n\nBut 't84' isn't in any of the direct terminals. So that means the string has 't84' which isn't present as a terminal in any of the grammar productions. Therefore, 't84' can't be generated by the grammar, making the string invalid.

{"custom_id":"request-556","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with productions, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF entails. CNF has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminals or one terminal. All the rules should follow this structure. The provided grammar seems to fit CNF because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nNow, the string in question is `t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t98 t92 t25 t84 t16 t83 t26 t53 t25 t28 t94 t67 t77 t87 t53 t77 t76 t25 t84 t79 t13 t94 t97 t40 t26`. The terminals here are all in lowercase 't's followed by numbers. So t12, t14, etc.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation adds two terminals or replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. But since the input string is all terminals, the derivation must end with all non-terminals replaced by terminals.\n\nI think the standard approach here is to perform a derivation starting from the start symbol, which is S in this case. The start symbol S is defined as S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S directly produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. Each of these needs to be expanded, which in turn will produce more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nBut this string is quite long, so I might need a more systematic approach. One method is to check the leftmost derivation, but given the string's length, that might be time-consuming. Another approach is to parse the string from right to left, using the reverse of the grammar, which can sometimes be more efficient for such checks.\n\nI recall that for CFGs in CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm for parsing. But since the string is specific, maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can list all the productions for each non-terminal and see if they can lead to the terminals in the string. Let me go through the productions and see which can lead to the given t's.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT25 NT25 (since NT73 is defined as NT25 NT25, but wait, looking back, I see NT73 is defined as NT25 NT25? Wait, in the given grammar, NT73 is: NT73 -> NT25 NT25. Wait, let me check again. No, in the given grammar, NT73 is actually not present as a starting point. Wait, the start is S \u2192 NT6 NT58.

{"custom_id":"request-577","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. Wait, no, actually CNF allows the start symbol to produce a terminal directly. Hmm, but in this case, the productions sometimes produce terminals, like NT2 \u2192 't9' or NT9 \u2192 't26'. So each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string given is: t12 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t26 t13 t67 t83 t14 t87 t53 t3 t96 t72 t74 t95 t25 t87 t94 t13 t98 t92 t12 t3 t97 t94 t84 t40 t26.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding according to the grammar rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string's length must be 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. But in this case, the string has 31 tokens. 31 is not a power of two, so it's impossible because each production adds exactly one terminal, and in CNF, every expansion step doubles the number of symbols. Wait, no, in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals increases until you reach the terminals. So the number of terminals in the final string should be 2^k for some k.\n\n31 is not a power of two because 2^5=32 and 2^4=16. So that immediately suggests that the string can't be generated by a CNF grammar, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, the number of terminals can vary because the starting symbol can produce a chain of terminals or non-terminals. But in each step, when a non-terminal is replaced, the number of symbols is multiplied. So the total number of terminals in the string must be 2^k where k is the number of steps from the start symbol.\n\nWait, more accurately, for a derivation starting from S, each step is replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals and terminals increases, but it's more about the structure.\n\nBut in this string, there are 31 symbols. 31 is not a power of two. Let's check:\n\n2^0 =1\n\n2^1=2\n\n2^2=4\n\n2^3=8\n\n2^4=16\n\n2^5=32\n\n2^6=64 and so on. So none of these equal 31, except for not exactly. So that's a red flag. Because in a binary tree derivation, you end up with 2^n leaves, where n is the depth of the tree. So any string derived from S must have a length of 2^k for some k. Hence, 31 is not such a number. So the string can't be produced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Each production in CNF either introduces two non-terminals or, if the start symbol, can produce terminals. So the start symbol S can produce two strings A and B. Then each of A and B can produce their own terminal strings, each of which must also be 2^m and 2^n, so the total length is 2^m + 2^n? Or perhaps each substitution step adds a certain number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. If all the expansions are applied in a binary tree fashion, the total number of terminals should be 2^k, but 31 is not. So this would mean the string cannot be produced.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me correct this. The entire string is a sequence of terminals, but the only way to reach a terminal string is through leftmost derivations where each non-terminal is expanded into two non-terminals until reaching the leaves, which are terminals. So the total number of terminals must be 2^k for some k. Let's count: the given string has 31 tokens, which is 31, which isn't 2^k.

So the first part after S is NT6 (which is NT73 NT62), and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT58: NT58 -> NT84 NT9. NT84 is a non-terminal and NT9 is also a non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is `t12`. So let's see what NT6 and NT58 generate.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8 -> `t12`? Let's check NT8's productions. Looking at the productions, there's NT84 -> NT34 NT93. But NT8 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, no: looking for NT8, but in the given grammar, NT84 -> NT34 NT93, and NT84 is a non-terminal. Wait, is there any NT8 production? Let me look.\n\nLooking through the productions, the only NT8 I can find is in NT84 -> NT34 NT93, but there's no NT8 -> something else. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I mislooked. Let me check again. The productions for NT6, NT58, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me parse the string using the grammar, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe first token is `t12`. So looking for a production that starts with `t12`. Looking through the grammar, I see NT2 -> 't9' and other NT's have terminal tokens, but `t12` isn't listed in any NT's production. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me list all the terminals first to see which tokens are allowed. In the grammar, many NTs have productions ending in specific tokens:\n\nFor example, NT2 has multiple productions ending in different 't's. Let's list the terminal tokens:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals are:\n\nt77, t64, t67, t96, t36, t53, t3, t94, t3, t67, t27, t83, t26, t26, t94, t96, t72, t96, t72, t97, t46, t44, t83, t59, t53, etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is `t12`. I don't see `t12` listed anywhere in the grammar. That's a problem. Because if the grammar doesn't have a production that includes `t12`, then the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let's confirm. Looking back through the productions, I don't see any NT that has `t12` as a terminal. So either I'm missing it, or the grammar can't generate a string starting with `t12`.\n\nSo the first token `t12` is not present in any NT's defined in the grammar, which means the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-598","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, but let's start by looking at the grammar structure and the string we're testing.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. That\u2019s helpful because it should be structured in a way that each step in the derivation is straightforward.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The first rule is S -> NT6 NT58. So S directly expands into two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. Therefore, the string we're testing must be obtained by expanding these into terminal symbols.\n\nNow, let's check the string: t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t87 t53 t77 t72 t96 t3 t13 t39 t25 t84 t12 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t36 t53 t13 t96 t26 t94 t13 t97 t79 t84 t46.\n\nI notice that the string consists of several sequences of 't' followed by numbers. Each of these could potentially correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Let's see if any NT non-terminals in the grammar expand into these. For example, NT94 -> 't77', NT27 -> 't4', and so on.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar rules, some NT rules directly give terminals. For example, NT94 \u2192 't77', NT27 \u2192 't4', NT73 \u2192 't25', NT79 \u2192 't16', etc. So to generate the string, each 't' followed by a number must come from one of these terminal productions.\n\nBut each production in the grammar either results in a single terminal or a combination of non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals. The only way a terminal can appear is if a rule directly gives a terminal.\n\nSo the derivation must involve expanding NT6 and NT58 in S, and each of these must eventually derive down to terminals that match the string.\n\nBut wait, the string is quite long, with 36 't's. Let's count how many 't's are present: 36. Each NT rule that produces terminals will contribute one 't' to the string. However, in the grammar, some rules produce two non-terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So expanding NT6 would produce NT73 and NT62, which might further expand until we get to a terminal.\n\nEach expansion step from a non-terminal that's being processed could potentially split into two, leading to more steps. The total number of 't's in the string would be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which would be 2^n, where n is the number of splits. But our string has 36 't's, which is not a power of two (since 2^5=32, 2^6=64, so 36 is in between). This suggests that it's impossible because each step of expansion could only produce a number of 't's that's a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has 36 't's, which is more than 32 but less than 64. That would mean that the grammar isn't producing 36 terminals, which is not possible since each split would only add more non-terminals, leading to a total of 2^k terminals, so k must be such that 2^k = 36, but 36 isn't a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The initial string is 36 tokens, each 't' followed by a number. Let's see how many 't's would come from each NT rule.\n\nIf S is S -> NT6 NT58, then each expansion leads to NT6 and NT58. Each of these could be further expanded into more NT rules, and so on, until they reach terminal symbols.\n\nEach NT rule that produces a terminal contributes one 't' token. For example, NT2 \u2192 't9', so any expansion of NT2 would produce a single terminal. However, some NT rules split into two non-terminals, meaning that each of those would need to expand into more terminals.\n\nThe total number of terminals (i.e., 't' tokens) in the derived string is determined by the number of leaves in the parse tree. Each time a non-terminal splits into two, the number of terminal symbols strictly increases by one. For example, S (which splits into two NT's) would have 2 leaves. If each of those leaves are terminals, then two 't's. If one splits into terminals and the other splits into two NT's, then it's possible to have three 't's, because one subtree contributes 1 't' and the other contributes 2.\n\nWait, maybe I should think recursively. Let's model it:\n\nEach non-terminal NT can either produce a terminal (1 't') or split into two non-terminals, each of which can be terminals or further splits.\n\nThe total number of 't's generated by a non-terminal NT is equal to the number of leaves in its expansion.\n\nSo, for example, if NT X \u2192 NT A NT B, and A and B each produce 't's, then X contributes 2 't's.\n\nIf A produces 't's and B splits into two, then B contributes more 't's.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each rule either ends in a terminal or two non-terminals. So each non-terminal production either contributes 1 't' (if it directly produces a terminal) or contributes between 2 to (n) 't's, depending on how deep it splits.\n\nBut to get the total number of 't's, the sum of the expansions of all NTs must add up to the total. So, for S \u2192 NT6 NT58, each of these NTs would contribute a certain number of 't's, say a and b, respectively. The total 't's would be a + b.\n\nIf I look at the string, it has 36 't's. So S must expand into a combination where a + b = 36, where a and b are the number of 't's from NT6 and NT58 respectively.\n\nNow, let's see what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 't4' as per rule NT8 -> 't4'\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully: DT rules (direct terminals) are listed under NT73 as NT73 \u2192 't25'. Wait, wait, the user provided the grammar as ordered rules. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, and the NT rules are in a list, with each line starting with a specific NT symbol. For example:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 (this is a rule, two non-terminals)\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't77'\n\nSo wait, each line is either a non-terminal (like 'NT95') followed by a production. So let's parse each rule correctly:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't77' (so this rule produces one terminal)\nNT28 \u2192 't44'\nNT40 \u2192 't67'\nNT27 \u2192 't4'\nNT94 \u2192 't77'\nAnd so on.\n\nAlso, NT56 \u2192 NT95 NT36\nWhich means NT56 expands to NT95 and NT36.\n\nBut to get the total, let's see what NT6 expands to:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 't4' (as per NT8: 8 has a rule NT8 \u2192 't4')\n\nNT9 \u2192 't3' (from NT9 \u2192 't3')\n\nSo expanding NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\n\u2192 (NT8 NT9) (NT62)\n\nEach of these: NT8 \u2192 't4', NT9 \u2192 't3', So NT6 \u2192 't4' 't3' and then NT62.\n\nWhat about NT62?\n\nLooking at NT62's rule: NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT66\n\nNT97: NT97 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT66: NT66 \u2192 't67'\n\nSo NT62 \u2192 't79' 't67'\n\nPutting it all together, NT6 expands to 't4' 't3' 't79' 't67'\n\nSo NT6 generates 't4 t3 t79 t67'\n\nSimilarly, NT58's rule is NT58 \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-593","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, first, I need to understand what each part of the grammar does. The grammar consists of multiple non-terminals (like S, NT6, NT74, etc.) that each produce two other non-terminals until they reach terminals (like 't9', 't7', etc.).\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t77 t87 t53 t26 t96 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t49 t39 t25 t63 t94 t28 t94 t13 t84 t55 t36 t53 t13 t96 t49 t55 t95 t36 t53 t13 t96`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level non-terminal is S, which expands to NT6 NT58. So, the first step is to parse the string starting with NT6 and NT58.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts that might correspond to the productions. For example, 't12' appears once, 't77' twice, 't87' twice, etc. I should check if the string can be split into two parts that each correspond to the terminal sequences generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nNT6 is defined as NT73 NT62, and NT58 is NT84 NT9. So, the entire string should split into two main sequences. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT84, it's NT34 NT93. NT34 is NT58 NT65, and NT58 is back to NT84 NT9. This seems a bit recursive. Let me see if there's a way to break this down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can start from the leaves and see how the string can be generated. Maybe I should check each token in the string and see if it corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. The terminals are things like t77, t87, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that many non-terminals have productions that lead to terminal symbols like t77, t87, etc. For example, NT77 is 't77', so if any production leads to NT77, that could produce 't77'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, I see that NT94 is 't77', NT73 is 't25', etc. So, some non-terminals directly produce these terminals. So, when the string has a 't77', that could come from NT94, which is a direct production.\n\nSo, the string has 't12', which I don't see directly in the grammar. Let me check: looking through the grammar, I see NT84 -> NT96 NT9. NT9 is NT68 NT40, and so on. So, it's not immediately obvious where 't12' comes from.\n\nWait, maybe 't12' is generated by a chain of productions. Let me trace through NT8, which is 't12'. So, if NT8 -> 't12', then 't12' must be a direct production.\n\nLooking back, I see that NT8 is directly 't12', so that's fine. So, in the string, after some initial parts, there's a 't12'. That could be NT8.\n\nSimilarly, 't77' appears several times. As I noted, NT94 is 't77'. So, if the string has a 't77', it could correspond to NT94.\n\nBut then, 't87' is produced by NT2, which is 't87'. Wait, in the grammar, NT2 -> 't6'? Or wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking more carefully, I see NT27 -> 't4', NT2 -> 't70', NT36 -> 't64', NT56 -> 't72', NT69 -> 't13', NT87 -> 't98' etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me go back. Each non-terminal may contribute to different terminals. For example, NT2 is 't70' or 't9'? Wait, no, let me look at the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals have as their production directly a terminal. For example, NT94 -> 't77', so whenever NT94 appears in the derivation, it directly produces 't77'.\n\nSo, in the string, 't77' (like the first part) must come from NT94.\n\nThen, looking at the full string, I need to split it into two parts: one generated by NT6 and one by NT58.\n\nWait, another approach is to represent each part as a binary tree, but maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can see if each token in the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start breaking the string down.\n\nThe string is: t12 t77 t87 t53 t26 t96 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t49 t39 t25 t63 t94 t28 t94 t13 t84 t55 t36 t53 t13 t96 t49 t55 t95 t36 t53 t13 t96.\n\nFirst, let's see how 't12' is possible. Since NT8 -> 't12', maybe the overall string starts with NT8, but the top-level is S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. The top-level is S, which is NT6 NT58. So the first symbol in the string should be the start of NT6 or NT58.\n\nWait, the entire string is a sequence of symbols, and S generates this string by expanding accordingly. So the entire string is the result of expanding S into NT6 followed by NT58, which together produce all the symbols.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be split into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT6, and the second part is the expansion of NT58. Alternatively, NT6 and NT58 each expand into two symbols, so the entire string is the concatenation of those.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 35 tokens long. So perhaps the first n tokens correspond to NT6 and the next 35-n tokens correspond to NT58.\n\nBut to find n, I need to know how many symbols each NT produces. Since every NT eventually resolves into terminals or other NTS, but each rule expands into two parts. So, the total number of symbols starts from S which is 2 symbols, then each step either increases or decreases the number.\n\nWait, the string is 35 tokens long. Let's see, starting from S -> NT6 NT58, so two non-terminals. Each non-terminal expansion may lead to more symbols. So, the total number of symbols can vary, but perhaps the given string is 35, which might not be possible because the initial expansion is 2, and each production is binary, so the number of symbols could be 2^k or similar. Wait, 35 is an odd number, which is impossible if starting from 2. Wait, that can't be because 35 is odd, but each rule expands into two symbols. Starting from S (2), each step either keeps it same or increases. Wait, no, each production adds more symbols. Wait, if we start with S (2 symbols), each application of a rule produces two symbols, so the number can vary. Wait, no, each rule replaces one symbol with two. So each step increases the count by 1. So starting from 2, each step adds 1 to the count. So the total number of symbols can be any integer >=2. So 35 is possible.\n\nBut the specific order of symbols matters. So I need to find a split where the first part (NT6 expansion) ends at some position n, and the second part (NT58 expansion) starts at n+1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to start from the leaves and see if each token can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the string can be split into two parts, each generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two equal parts. Wait, 35 is odd, so it's not possible. Maybe the first part has 18 tokens and the second 17? Or perhaps some other split.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that approach. Maybe a better way is to see how each non-terminal could produce the given tokens.\n\nLet's consider NT6: NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should be NT6's expansion. Let's see what NT73 and NT62 could produce.\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9. So, NT73 would produce two symbols: NT8 and NT9. Then, each of those could be further expanded.\n\nNT8 is directly 't12', so that's one symbol.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to consist of a bunch of non-terminals (like S, NT74, etc.) that expand into other non-terminals until they hit terminals like 't12', 't26', etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t12 t26 t97 t40 t77 t87 t53 t36 t53 t3 t96 t3 t98 t96 t22 t28 t94 t67 t96 t26 t53 t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t3 t26 t94 t13 t87 t94 t13`.\n\nI notice the string starts with `t12`. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminals that directly produce 't' are NT8, NT12 (wait, actually, in the grammar, NT8 isn't present. Hmm, perhaps I need to check each terminal to see which non-terminals can produce them. Wait, in the grammar, the non-terminals that are terminals are the ones where rules are of the form A \u2192 a. \n\nWait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals are expanded directly to terminals. For example, I see rules like NT94 -> 't77', NT27 -> 't4', and so on. So each of these non-terminals corresponds to a specific terminal.\n\nTo validate the string, I need to see if each 't' corresponds to a rule in the grammar. So first, let's map each terminal in the string to the non-terminals that produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n- NT46 -> 't28'\n- NT87 -> 't98'\n- NT2 -> 't9', but wait, the string has `t26`, which isn't listed. Wait, let's check the grammar to see if any non-terminal produces 't26'.\n\nWait, the user may have made a mistake because in the provided grammar, the terminals are: NT94 -> 't77', NT27 -> 't4', NT46 -> 't28', NT87 -> 't98', NT2 -> 't9', etc. So perhaps the string has some 't' that don't correspond to any production. \n\nBut the string has t26, which isn't present in the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar again, I see NT19 -> NT37 NT69, NT50 -> NT93 NT6, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the terminals:\n\nWait, in the terminal definitions, I see:\n\nNT94 -> t77\nNT27 -> t4\nNT46 -> t28\nNT87 -> t98\nNT2 -> t9\nNT85 -> t76\nNT64 -> t26 (Wait, does NT64 produce t26? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT64 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string has t26, but the grammar only has NT64 -> 't64'? Wait, no. Looking through the grammar, I see NT64 is not present. Wait, perhaps the string has a t26, but in the grammar, any non-terminal produces 't26'? Wait, in the grammar, let's scan all the productions to see which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT4 -> 't12'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT36 -> 't36'? No, it does NT6 -> 't73', etc. Wait, in the rules provided, there's NT4: is there a production for NT4? Wait, looking back, the first production is S -> NT6 NT58. Wait, but beyond that, each line is a non-terminal and its production. For example, S is a non-terminal that produces NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, each starting with a non-terminal and following with the production.

Wait, do any non-terminals produce t53? Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Each line is a production, like NT94 -> 't77', which means the non-terminal NT94 can be replaced by the terminal 't77'. So, for each 't' in the string, I need to check if there's a production that can produce that 't', i.e., does any non-terminal directly produce that 't'?\n\nSo looking at the string: `t12 t26 t97 t40 t77 t87 t53 t36 t53 t3 t96 t3 t98 t96 t22 t28 t94 t67 t96 t26 t53 t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t3 t26 t94 t13 t87 t94 t13`.\n\nI need to find if each of these 't's corresponds to a production in the grammar. Let's go through each one:\n\nt12: Looking at the productions, I don't see a production that directly produces t12. Wait, is there any rule that produces t12? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the productions, none directly produce t12. So t12 would have to be produced by a non-terminal path, but since t12 is a terminal in the string, there must be a production that directly creates it. If not, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, the first production is S -> NT6 NT58. So S is the start symbol, which produces NT6 and NT58. So to produce any string, it must start with S, then expand NT6 and NT58.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t12. So I need to see if t12 can be produced by S, which would require that either NT6 or NT58 can produce t12.\n\nLooking at NT6's production: NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 expands into NT73 and NT62.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that most non-terminals (NTx) eventually produce terminals (like 't77', 't64', 't94', etc.). So each NT is a single production leading to two terminals. \n\nThe string to verify is long: `t12 t3 t84 t55 t3 t82 t95 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t74 t95 t12 t36 t53 t77 t3 t53 t25 t58 t94 t63 t94 t63 t94 t87 t94 t67 t28 t94 t67`.\n\nI think the approach should be to work backwards. Since the grammar is CNF, the number of steps required to derive the string should be equal to the length of the string minus 1. The string has 40 symbols (including spaces, so actually 39 t's), so the derivation should be 39 steps.\n\nBut that's a lot. Alternatively, each production is left- or right-expanding, so maybe I can parse the string using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: `t12 t3 t84 t55 t3 t82 t95...`. I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string should start with NT6 producing t12 and NT58 producing t3. Checking the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Wait, but the string starts with t12, which is a terminal. Let's see which NT6 can produce t12.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Hmm, but none of these directly produce t12. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in the rules, I need to see which NTx can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, NT8 \u2192 't12' is one of the productions. So NT8 can directly produce t12.\n\nWait, but S starts as NT6 NT58. So NT6 must derive t12, and NT58 must derive t3.\n\nLooking at NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then each of those needs to derive their respective terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, both non-terminals. NT8 \u2192 't12' directly. NT9 needs to produce t3.\n\nLooking at NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40. Then NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67. Both are non-terminals. NT63 \u2192 NT15, NT67 \u2192 NT53.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to try to identify the parse tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is two non-terminals or one terminal, the depth should be the same as the number of symbols minus 1.\n\nWait, each step in the derivation can produce two symbols, so starting with one symbol (S), each step expands a symbol into two, so after n steps, the length is 2^n.\n\nThe input string has 39 symbols, which is 2^5 =32, 2^6=64. 39 is not a power of two. That suggests that it's not possible because with CNF, the length should be a power of two.\n\nWait, but let me recheck: Since each production is A \u2192 BC, each step doubles the number of symbols. Starting from one symbol S, after 1 step: 2 symbols. After 2 steps: 4, etc. So the total length after n steps is 2^n. The input string's actual length (excluding spaces if they count, but I think in the problem they are part of the string, making it 39 symbols). Wait, the string is: `t12 t3 t84 t55 t3 t82 t95 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t74 t95 t12 t36 t53 t77 t3 t53 t25 t58 t94 t63 t94 t63 t94 t87 t94 t67 t28 t94 t67`. That's 40 t's and spaces. Wait, the user wrote it as a string with spaces between t...s, so the number of symbols is 40. Wait, the initial string is written as t12 t3 t84..., which is 39 t's. Let me count: each space is between, so the number of tokens is 39. Therefore, the length is 39 symbols. \n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols. So the length after n steps is 2^n. But 2^n for n steps would be 2,4,8,16,32,64... 39 isn't a power of two. 32 <39<64. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated because its length isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding whether the string length must be 2^n. Because the starting symbol is S, which is a single non-terminal. After 1 production, it becomes two non-terminals. Each production step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols (could be terminals or non-terminals). So the total number of symbols is indeed a sum that's a power of two.\n\nWait, no. Because some of the symbols are non-terminals and would need further productions. The actual number of terminal symbols in the derived string must be a power of two because each step doubles the count. So for example:\n\nStep 0: S (1 symbol, non-terminal)\nStep 1: NT1 NT2 (2 symbols, could be non-terminals)\nStep 2: NT11 NT12 NT21 NT22 (4 symbols)\nStep 3: 8 symbols, etc.\n\nEach time, the number of symbols doubles. So in the end, the number of terminal symbols must be a power of two. \n\nThe input string has 39 terminal symbols, which is not a power of two (since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64), so it's impossible for the grammar to derive this string because the length isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Is there any way the string can have a number of terminals that isn't a power of two? No, in a CNF grammar, each production is length 2, so each step can only produce a number of symbols that is a power of two. Therefore, the total number of terminals in the derived string must be a power of two.\n\nIn this case, the string has 39 terminals, which isn't a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-638","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let's break this down step by step because I'm not too familiar with this, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules. Each production rule has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems like all the rules follow this structure. For example, S -> NT6 NT58 is two non-terminals, and others like NT74 -> NT9 NT66 also follow this pattern. Some rules have a terminal like NT9 -> NT68 NT40 t3, right?\n\nWait, no, wait. Looking more closely, in the given grammar, some non-terminals have a terminal attached. For instance, NT9 -> NT68 NT40 t3. So that's a bit different because it has three symbols on the right side, but actually, the terminals are only one character, like t3. But in CNF, the right-hand side can have two non-terminals or one terminal. So I think that's okay because each terminal is a single symbol.\n\nNext, I need to parse the given string using this grammar. The string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, like t12, t14, etc. Each of these seems to correspond to a non-terminal in the grammar. For example, t22 corresponds to NT22, t77 to NT77, etc.\n\nSo my approach will be to see if the string can be broken down into the production rules of the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, except in cases where a terminal is allowed. But in this case, all the productions seem to be two non-terminals except the ones that have a terminal. However, each terminal in the string corresponds to a non-terminal, so we can map them.\n\nLet me try to list the string components with their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nt12 \u2192 NT12\nt14 \u2192 NT14\nt87 \u2192 NT87\nt53 \u2192 NT53\nt77 \u2192 NT77\nt14 \u2192 NT14\nt87 \u2192 NT87\nt53 \u2192 NT53\nt8 \u2192 NT8\nt3 \u2192 NT3\nt74 \u2192 NT74\nt95 \u2192 NT95\nt25 \u2192 NT25\nt58 \u2192 NT58\nt94 \u2192 NT94\nt28 \u2192 NT28\nt94 \u2192 NT94\nt13 \u2192 NT13\nt63 \u2192 NT63\nt94 \u2192 NT94\nt67 \u2192 NT67\nt84 \u2192 NT84\nt36 \u2192 NT36\nt95 \u2192 NT95\nt36 \u2192 NT36\nt53 \u2192 NT53\nt8 \u2192 NT8\nt26 \u2192 NT26\nt98 \u2192 NT98\nt96 \u2192 NT96\nt22 \u2192 NT22\nt28 \u2192 NT28\nt94 \u2192 NT94\nt67 \u2192 NT67\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this correctly. Let me cross-check. For example, NT95 corresponds to t95, right? So the string is a sequence of these NTs.\n\nSo the string can be represented as a sequence of NTs. Now, the grammar's start symbol is S, which is NT6 NT58. So the string must be derived starting from S by applying the production rules.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, I might need to see if it can be split into parts that match the production rules.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the process: try to parse the string from the end using the grammar's rules. Starting from the last element and moving backwards, trying to see if it can merge into larger chunks until we reach S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check each production step by step. Let me think about each part of the string and see if I can find corresponding production rules.\n\nLet's start from the beginning: t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t14 t87 t53 t8 t3 t74 t95 t25 t58 t94 t28 t94 t13 t63 t94 t67 t84 t36 t95 t36 t53 t8 t26 t98 t96 t22 t28 t94 t67.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t12, t14. So that's NT12 NT14. Do I have a production rule that produces NT12 and NT14? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't6' (Wait, but NT2 is part of S.

{"custom_id":"request-633","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t12 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t8 t26 t98 t96 t22 t28 t94 t13 t74 t95 t12 t14 t87 t53 t8 t3 t53 t25 t58 t94 t87 t94 t13 t28 t94 t13 t84 t46`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a CFG in CNF looks like. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it makes derivations more predictable and can be analyzed using techniques like the CYK algorithm or by checking the derivation steps.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, every production starts with a capital letter (non-terminal) and is either followed by two non-terminals or ends with a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which fits the CNF structure because it's a non-terminal producing two non-terminals. Then, NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69, which again follows the rule.\n\nThe string to check consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. Each 't' number must correspond to a production rule ending with that terminal.\n\nSo, my task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to break down the string into individual tokens and see if each can be matched by some production rule ending with that token. If every token can be matched, then the string is in the language.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order:\n\nt12, t36, t53, t77, t36, t53, t8, t26, t98, t96, t22, t28, t94, t13, t74, t95, t12, t14, t87, t53, t8, t3, t53, t25, t58, t94, t87, t94, t13, t28, t94, t13, t84, t46.\n\nNow, I'll go through each token and see if there's a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nStarting with 't12':\n\nLooking through the grammar, there's a production NT8 -> 't12'. So, NT8 can generate t12.\n\nNext is 't36':\n\nThere's a production NT36 \u2192 't79', NT36 \u2192 't39', etc. Wait, looking at the list, I see NT36 \u2192 't64' and another rule for NT36 \u2192 't79' and 't39'. Hmm, maybe I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, I'm looking through the grammar's terminal rules. Let me scan the list:\n\nLooking for 't36' as a terminal, I see NT63 \u2192 't36', and NT36 \u2192 't64' and 't79'? Or wait, looking at the list, I see NT63 \u2192 't36', so 't36' is produced by NT63.\n\nSo to get 't36', the previous step must have a non-terminal that can produce 't36', which is NT63.\n\nNext is 't53':\n\nLooking for 't53' as a terminal. I see in the grammar, NT79 \u2192 't53'. So, NT79 produces 't53'.\n\nSo 't53' comes from NT79.\n\nNext is 't77':\n\nLooking for 't77'. I see NT74 \u2192 't77', so NT74 can produce 't77'.\n\nThen 't36' again, which is NT63.\n\nThen 't53' again, which is NT79.\n\nSo far, the sequence is t12 (NT8), t36 (NT63), t53 (NT79), t77 (NT74), t36 (NT63), t53 (NT79). \n\nThis pattern seems repetitive, so let's see if this corresponds to a possible derivation.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules, perhaps there's a cycle involving NT63, NT79, etc.\n\nI notice that S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the start symbol S first splits into NT6 and NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT93.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Let's see what NT6 can produce. NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT93.\n\nLooking deeper, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT8 \u2192 't12', as per the terminal rules.\n\nSo NT8 \u2192 't12' is one of the rules.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 is produced by NT63 \u2192 't36', as we saw earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to draw a parse tree or at least follow the steps.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nNow, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nSo, from NT73, we can get t12 and t26, so the first part would generate t12 t26.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t12, so maybe the NT6 derivation is such that the first part is t12.\n\nWait, NT6 can produce NT73 NT62. Let's see: NT73 can produce NT8, which is 't12', or it can produce NT50, which is NT73 \u2192 NT50 NT66? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and not via NT50.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT73 is defined as NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, right? Let me check:\n\nYes, under the grammar:\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9\n\nSo NT73 can't produce directly 't77', unless through NT8 or NT9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought NT73 produces 't8' and 't26', which would give 't8 t26', but where does 't77' come from? Wait, the string after t36 is t53, t77, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt12, t36, t53, t77, t36, t53, t8, t26, t98, t96, t22, t28, t94, t13, t74, t95, t12, t14, t87, t53, t8, t3, t53, t25, t58, t94, t87, t94, t13, t28, t94, t13, t84, t46.\n\nWait, the first token is t12. Let's see which production can generate t12. Looking in the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't12'.\n\nSo the first non-terminal after S must produce t12. From the initial step, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So perhaps NT6 is the one that produces t12, and NT58 produces some other term.\n\nWait, if NT6 \u2192 t12, then that would mean NT6 must be part of a production that ends with 't12', which is only possible if NT6 \u2192 't12' (but actually, from the grammar, NT6 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal. So NT6 must be expanded into something that leads to 't12'. But looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and both of those are non-terminals.\n\nSo, for NT6 to produce 't12', we have to see if the sequence of expansions from NT6 can eventually produce 't12'.\n\nLooking at NT73: NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9. Then NT8 \u2192 't12', and NT9 \u2192 't26'.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing manageable with algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I don't know the exact steps for that, I'll try to find a way through the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it produces NT6 and NT58. Both NT6 and NT58 seem to be part of the derivation. I'll check if each token in the string can be derived from the rules.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't12'. Let's see which non-terminals can derive 't12'. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT74: NT63 | NT67. NT63 -> NT94 NT66, which is 't94' and 't67' since NT94 is 't14' and NT66 is 't96', so 't14' and 't96' \u2192 \"t14 t96\". NT67 is part of other productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of all the non-terminals that produce terminals and see how the string steps can be matched.\n\nLet me list each production that ends in a terminal (like 'a' in CNF):\n\nFor example, NT94 -> 't77', NT73 -> 't25', etc. So, each production for a non-terminal either is a terminal (A \u2192 a) or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nThe string is a series of t's followed by numbers. Each token is treated as a single unit here, so each 'tXX' is a production that directly gives that terminal.\n\nI'll try to break down the string step by step. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 't12'. So, I need a production that gives 't12'. Looking through the rules, is there any NT that produces 't12'? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the 'a' productions, I don't see 't12' listed. That's a problem because if none of the non-terminals directly produce 't12', then the string can't be derived.\n\nWait, but maybe in a derivation, multiple steps produce longer strings, so perhaps 't12' is part of a larger phrase. But in CNF, each production only has two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, unless 't12' can be obtained through a series of productions that produce 't12' eventually, it's impossible.\n\nLooking again at the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't12'. The productions under NT8 (like NT18, NT72, etc.) may generate 't12' via some derivations. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules for NT8:\n\nNT8 -> NT74 NT68\n\nNT74 gives 't77' (from NT74 -> 't77'), and NT68 is NT63 NT67.\n\nNT63 -> NT94 NT36 (t94 is 14, t36? Wait, NT94 is t77, NT36 is t36. Hmm, but NT94 is t77, NT36 is 't36'. So NT63 would be 't77 t36'?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to outline the possible terminals each non-terminal can produce.\n\nFrom the given rules, each \"a\" production is the terminal part. So, NT22 -> 't87' (from NT22 production), NT2 -> 't9' or 't70' or 't4' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is to map each non-terminal to its possible terminal strings.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and note the terminals they can produce if they have a direct production.\n\nNT74 -> NT63 NT67 \u2192 both are non-terminals, so doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\nNT22 -> 't87'\n\nNT2 -> 't9' (from one rule), 't70' (from another), 't44', 't70', 't6' etc. Wait, no, looking again, NT2's rules:\n\nLooking at NT2: NT28 NT93, NT2 -> 't9', NT28: NT38 NT93, NT2 -> 't70', NT34: 't36', so wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the rules are in the form A\u2192 \u03b1 where \u03b1 can be terminals or combinations.\n\nWait, the production NT2 is given as:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT93\nNT2 -> NT44 NT14\nNT8 -> NT12\nWait, no. Looking back, it's:\n\nLooking for NT2:\n\nWait, checking the list:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT44 NT14\nNT2 \u2192 't9' (from rule: 'NT29' is 't9'? Wait no, actual rules are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rows like:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT93\nNT2 -> NT44 NT14\nNT8 -> NT12\n\nWait, yes, here's a production: NT8 \u2192 NT12. But wait, is that correct? Or do I have to check each row properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is such that each rule for NTn specifies two parts. So, in the list:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT93\nNT2 -> NT44 NT14\nNT8 -> NT12\nWait, no, because in the given grammar, the rows are:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT93\nNT2 \u2192 NT44 NT14\nNT8 \u2192 NT12 \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because 't12' is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by recalling what the grammar looks like and how strings are structured based on it.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, I can see that it's a quite complex grammar with many non-terminals and terminals. The non-terminals are followed by numbers like NT74, NT63, etc., and some of these have further productions until they become terminals like 't72', 't36', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t12 t26 t97 t40 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t63 t94 t67 t67 t27 t83 t72 t26 t67 t95 t12 t26 t97 t12 t36 t53 t8 t3 t58 t94 t67 t97 t94.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar only has one start symbol S, and S eventually produces terminals through a series of productions, the string must be a derivation from S.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to parse the string backwards. The rightmost terminals should come from the leftmost productions. Let's list all the terminals in the string in order:\n\nt12, t26, t97, t40, t36, t53, t77, t36, t53, t26, t96, t26, t63, t94, t67, t67, t27, t83, t72, t26, t67, t95, t12, t26, t97, t12, t36, t53, t8, t3, t58, t94, t67, t97, t94.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Instead of trying to derive the entire string from S, which has many steps, maybe I can look for the productions that start with the terminals at the end.\n\nLook at the last part: t94. Checking the grammar to see which non-terminal produces t94. Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\nNT94 -> 't77' and 't14' perhaps? Wait, let me check the given productions.\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT94 -> 't77' (from the line NT94 -> 't77') and also NT94 -> 't14' from NT94 -> 't14'? Let me scan the list.\n\nYes, here: NT94 -> 't77' and NT94 -> 't14'. So, t94 can result from NT94 being split into 't77' and 't14', or vice versa, depending on the order. But since the string ends with t94, which is a terminal, so that must have been derived from NT94.\n\nBut looking at the string, the last terminal is t94, so it must come from NT94. Wait, but t94 is a terminal, so looking at the productions: for example, NT94 \u2192 't77' | 't14', so when a production is to a terminal, it's a leaf.\n\nWait, the last part is t94, which is a terminal. So, perhaps the last part comes from a NT94 that expanded into it. So, that NT94 would have become t94. Looking at the next part before that in the string, it's ... t26, t97, t12, t26, t97, t94.\n\nWait, the string ends with t94. So the last step would be NT94 -> 't94', but from the grammar, NT94 can be 't77' or 't14', but no, actually, the lines are:\n\nLooking again, the relevant lines are:\n\nNT94 -> 't77'\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Are there lines for NT94 in the grammar?\n\nLooking back at the user's grammar:\n\nThe user provided the grammar with these lines:\n\nNT94 -> 't77'\n\nand\n\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nYes, so NT94 has two productions: one producing 't77' and another producing 't14'. So, 't94' is not a terminal for NT94 as I might have thought earlier. Wait, that can't be. So, maybe 't94' is actually 't14', which would make it a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I misread it. Let me check the lines again.\n\nWait, looking at the user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT94 -> 't77'\nand\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nHmm, that would mean that NT94 can produce either 't77' or 't14'. So 't94' is not a terminal derived from NT94; instead, it's either 't77' or 't14'. So, the last 't94' in the string must have been rewritten as 't14'.\n\nWait, but wait, no. The last token is 't94'. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me clarify: in the grammar, a production for NT94 would be, for example, NT94 \u2192 't77' or NT94 \u2192 't14', meaning those are terminals.\n\nSo 't77' and 't14' are terminals; 't94' is not a terminal. Therefore, the string ends with t94, which would have to come from a derivation step where the non-terminal was expanded into a sequence that ends with 't94', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the terminals. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT94:\n\nNT94 -> 't77' and NT94 -> 't14'.\n\nSo, these are the only productions for NT94, which means that NT94 can only generate 't77' or 't14' directly as terminals. Therefore, in the string, any occurrence of 't94' must have come from NT94.\n\nBut in the string, there's a 't94' towards the end, specifically the last part is 't97 t94'.\n\nWait, let's look carefully. The string ends with t97, t94. So that would suggest that the last part is ... t97, t94.\n\nWait, that's an issue because if NT94 produces only 't77' or 't14', then a 't94' in the string would not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting NT94's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps in the grammar, 't94' refers to another non-terminal? Wait, no, because in the grammar, all terminals are strings prefixed by 't'. Like 't77', 't14', etc. So, those are all terminals.\n\nSo if NT94 can only produce 't77' or 't14', there's no way for it to produce 't94' because it's not in the productions. Therefore, the presence of 't94' in the string is impossible because NT94 can't derive it.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent because in the string provided, the last part is 't97 t94', meaning the string ends with 't94'. Thus, this should not be possible if the grammar doesn't have a production that allows NT94 to produce 't94' as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and 't94' is actually 't14'. Let's check that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the last production for NT94 is NT94 -> 't14', which is present. So, 't14' is a terminal.\n\nBut the string ends with 't97 t94', which includes 't94' as a terminal, which doesn't exist in NT94's productions. Therefore, this would imply that the string is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT94 -> 't77' \n\nand\n\nNT94 -> 't14'\n\nYes, so both are terminals, so any string derived from NT94 in the grammar can only contain 't77' or 't14'.\n\nTherefore, having a 't94' in the string is impossible because the grammar has no such production. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but in the string, the last 't97' is followed by 't94'.

{"custom_id":"request-677","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. I see that all the productions are either two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the right, which fits the definition of CNF. That makes things a bit easier because CNF has certain properties that can be exploited, like the fact that the height of the parse tree corresponds to the number of derivation steps, each time replacing a symbol with exactly two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t12 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t84 t40 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t36 t53 t36 t53 t3 t96 t72 t96 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t7 t96 t64 t58 t94 t67 t96 t72 t13 t79`. \n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals. My goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards from the string and try to match it to the grammar. In CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step in the derivation would split a non-terminal into two parts. But since we're given a string of terminals, we need to see if it can be broken down into such a structure.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string starts with 't12', which is a terminal. I need to find a production in the grammar that directly results in 't12'. Looking through the right-hand sides of the productions, I see that NT2 -> 't6' and NT22 -> 't87'. But I don't see any production that directly results in 't12'.\n\nWait, no NT directly produces 't12'. So perhaps 't12' is part of a larger sequence that comes from a non-terminal that can split into 't12' and something else. Let me look at the grammar again. For example, looking for NTs that can produce 't12' when split into two parts.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't12'. Hmm, but maybe 't12' is part of a larger production. Wait, perhaps 't12' is the result of a non-terminal that's derived through multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains 't12 t77 t87...', and looking for NTs that can produce these.\n\nWait, let me list the right-hand sides again to see which terminals correspond to which non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT74 -> 't77'\n- NT87 -> 't98'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT36 -> 't36'\n- NT28 -> 't38'\n- NT6 -> 't73'\n- NT36 -> 't79'\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT84 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't53' (Wait, no NT directly produces 't53', but maybe through a chain.)\nWait, actually, some of the NTs produce different terminals:\n\nFor example, NT2 -> 't6', NT6 -> 't73', NT73 -> 't8', but I don't see any NT that directly produces 't53'. Hmm.\n\nLet me think. Maybe 't53' is part of a chain. For instance, is there an NT that can produce 't53' through a chain of productions?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't53'. But perhaps it's part of a larger construction. Alternatively, perhaps the string has a substring that isn't possible, making the entire string invalid.\n\nWait, the string includes 't53 t77 t36 t53 t77...'. Let me check if there are any NTs that can produce a sequence containing 't53's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if each part of the string can be generated by some non-terminals.\n\nStarting from the first part: 't12' is the start of the string. Looking for a NT that can produce 't12'. From the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't12', but perhaps it's part of a larger production.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol is S -> NT6 NT58. So S produces two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58. Each of these will generate their respective strings, and when combined, they form the overall string.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this by trying to parse the string from the start symbols. Since S is NT6 followed by NT58, the string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 and NT58.\n\nLet me see: So the entire string should be split into two parts, say A and B, where A is the result of NT6 and B is the result of NT58. Let's look at the string: 't12 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t84 t40 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t36 t53 t36 t53 t3 t96 t72 t96 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t7 t96 t64 t58 t94 t67 t96 t72 t13 t79'\n\nIf I can split this into two parts where A is the expansion of NT6 and B is the expansion of NT58, that would help. Let's see what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62.\n\nNT73: NT73 -> NT8 NT9. So NT73 splits into NT8 and NT9.\n\nNT8: NT8 -> 't12' (as per the grammar, NT8 -> 't12').\n\nSo the expansion of NT73 would produce 't12' followed by whatever NT9 produces.\n\nWhat about NT9? Looking at NT9: NT9 -> NT68 NT40.\n\nNT68: NT68 -> NT63 NT67.\n\nNT63: NT63 -> NT94 NT22.\n\nNT94: NT94 -> 't77'.\n\nNT22: NT22 -> 't87'.\n\nSo NT63 expands to 't77 t87'.\n\nThen NT68 expands to 't77 t87'.\n\nGoing back, NT73 is 't12' followed by whatever NT9 produces. But NT9 is NT68 NT40.\n\nSo NT9: 't77 t87' followed by NT40.\n\nNT40: NT40 -> NT69 NT17.\n\nNT69: NT69 -> 't67'.\n\nNT17: NT17 -> 't96'.\n\nSo NT40 expands to 't67 t96'.\n\nThus, NT9 (which is NT68 NT40) expands to 't77 t87 t67 t96'.\n\nPutting it all together, NT73 is 't12' followed by 't77 t87 t67 t96', making 't12 t77 t87 t67 t96'.\n\nWait, that's interesting. But looking at the string, the first part is 't12 t77 t87 t53 t13...', but according to this expansion, the first part from NT73 (which is part of NT6) is 't12 t77 t87 t67 t96'. That doesn't match because the string after 't12 t77 t87' has 't53' next, which isn't part of this expansion.\n\nSo perhaps this path doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the production for NT73 is NT8 NT9. NT8 is 't12'. NT9 is NT68 NT40. NT68 is NT63 NT67. NT63 is NT94 NT22. NT94 is 't77', NT22 is 't87'. So NT63 is 't77 t87', NT68 is 't77 t87', and NT9 is 't77 t87 t67 t96'.\n\nSo NT73 is 't12 t77 t87 t67 t96'.\n\nBut in the string, the next part after 't12 t77 t87' is 't53 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-698","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes things a bit easier because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I think are the terminals, so I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. The start symbol is S, and it directly produces NT6 and NT58. So S \u2192 NT6 NT58. I'll need to explore what each of these NT symbols can produce and see if they can combine to form parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't12'. I need to find a production that leads to 't12'. Let me check the rules. Under NT8, there's a production NT8 \u2192 't12'. So to get 't12', we can have NT8 produce it directly. So if I can get NT8 from somewhere upstream, that's a possibility.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So we need to see how NT6 and NT58 can produce parts of the string. Let me write down the string and see if each 't' in the string can be parsed backward to find the corresponding NT symbols.\n\nThe string is: t12 t26 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t36 t53 t67 t96 t96 t3 t49 t39 t12 t26 t28 t94 t13 t68 t95 t25 t63 t94 t87 t94 t67 t96 t3 t67 t79.\n\nLet me break this down into a sequence of 't' commands:\nt12, t26, t84, t55, t14, t87, t53, t36, t53, t77, t36, t53, t36, t53, t67, t96, t96, t3, t49, t39, t12, t26, t28, t94, t13, t68, t95, t25, t63, t94, t87, t94, t67, t96, t3, t67, t79.\n\nEach of these needs to be generated by some NT production. I think a good approach is to try to parse the string from the end to the beginning, looking for the productions that can lead to the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces two NTs or a terminal. So, the string should consist of sequences where each terminal is followed by two NT rules or something similar.\n\nWait, but since all productions are in CNF, the derivation tree is full and each step combines two symbols except for the leaves. So, for a string of n terminals, the number of symbols in the derivation should be O(n), but I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nLet me try starting from the beginning. The first symbol is t12, which as I mentioned earlier, can come from NT8 \u2192 t12. So, for the first part, we have NT8, and the rest of the string should come from the other part of S, which is NT58.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. After getting t12 from NT8, I guess that NT58 must generate the rest of the string. But wait, let me think again. S is producing NT6 and NT58. So the string is a concatenation of the strings generated by NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, the full string is T = t12 t26 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t36 t53 t67 t96 t96 t3 t49 t39 t12 t26 t28 t94 t13 t68 t95 t25 t63 t94 t87 t94 t67 t96 t3 t67 t79.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT6 NT58, the string must be either the concatenation of NT6's derivation and NT58's derivation, or vice versa. So, I need to see if either NT6 can generate the first part and NT58 can generate the second, or the other way around.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t12. Let's assume that comes from NT8. But NT8 is derived from NT8 \u2192 t12. So, how does that fit into S? Because S produces NT6 and NT58. So, perhaps one of them, let's say NT6, can generate t12. Or perhaps the part after t12 would come from NT58.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try parsing the string backward to see if each 't' can be generated by the start symbol.\n\nLet's start from the end of the string and work our way backward, checking if each terminal can be derived.\n\nThe last symbol is t79. Looking at the grammar, I see NT79 \u2192 t16, but that's not t79. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, checking all the terminals:\n\nLooking at NT79 \u2192 't16', so that's Nt16. So, none of the NT symbols directly produce t79. Hmm, that's a problem. So, if the last symbol is t79, that can't be a terminal because I don't see any production that ends with t79. So that immediately means that the entire string is invalid.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the grammar rules to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I don't see any NT production that produces 't79'. The closest is NT79 \u2192 't16', which is a different terminal. So that means that the symbol t79 in the string doesn't correspond to any production in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm correct. The string includes 't79', which doesn't appear as a terminal in any of the NT rules. So, that's a deal-breaker. The string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Maybe I missed a production.

{"custom_id":"request-695","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar consists of several production rules. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, which is typical for Chomsky normal form. Some symbols on the right-hand side are terminals (like 't12', 't77', etc.), while others are non-terminals (like S, NT6, etc.). \n\nThe start symbol is S, which is defined as NT6 NT58. So, any string generated by this grammar must be a combination of two non-terminals, each of which eventually resolves to a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a series of terminal symbols separated by spaces. The string is quite long, so I need to find a way to parse it step by step using the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll note that each production rule either breaks down into two smaller non-terminals or directly produces a terminal. Since the string is a concatenation of terminals, I should try to see if it can be decomposed into two parts that match the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by dividing the string into two parts, as the start symbol S consists of two non-terminals. The first step is to split the string into two parts, each starting with a possible non-terminal and followed by some terminals. \n\nThe string is: \nt12 t77 t87 t53 t36 t53 t13 t96 t96 t14 t87 t53 t77 t26 t63 t94 t67 t26 t94 t67 t49 t95 t22 t58 t94 t58 t94 t53 t25 t87 t94 t28 t94 t67 t84 t55 t3\n\nI think the first part (left half) should start with a non-terminal that can derive to the front part, and the second non-terminal should derive to the rest. Since the start symbol is two parts, let me consider splitting the string into two substrings where each is a possible left and right derivation.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find the two non-terminals at the top level (after the first step) and see if each part of the string can be derived from each non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production rule either builds up or breaks down non-terminals. The leaves (terminals) are things like t12, t77, etc.\n\nI think a good approach is to represent the string as a parse tree, trying to match the top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nSo S -> NT6 NT58. Therefore, the string must be the combination of two parts: one derived from NT6 and the other from NT58.\n\nLet me first focus on NT6. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT6 has a production rule: NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62. Then each of these can split further. \n\nSimilarly, NT73 has a rule: NT73 -> NT8 NT9. Both of these can further split.\n\nLet me map out a possible way to derive the first part of the string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for symbols in the string that match the right-hand sides of the production rules and see if we can backtrack or forward to see if they can be built up.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the string as a series of concatenated terminals and see if each can be mapped to a production rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to split the string into two parts and then see if each part can be generated by NT6 and NT58, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part starts with t12. So perhaps looking at what non-terminal can produce t12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the production rules for terminals are:\n\n- NT8 -> t12\n- NT74 -> t77\n- NT2 -> t9, t6, t70, t44, t4, t7, etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT2 that can produce multiple terminals. Looking at the provided rules:\n\nNT2 has several productions, including:\nNT2 -> 't9'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't70'\nNT2 -> 't44'\nNT2 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't36' (from some rules)\nNT2 -> 't6' (another rule)\nNT2 -> 't44'\nNT2 -> 't83'\nNT2 -> 't44' (another rule)\nSo NT2 can produce a bunch of terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t12. But looking through the rules, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't12' except NT8, which has NT8 -> t12. So t12 would come from NT8.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, there is no production rule for NT8 that directly matches t12. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT2 -> 't12'\n\nBut in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nWait, the rules start with S and then have NT94 -> 't77', NT73 -> 't25', etc.\n\nBut in the provided grammar rules, there is a rule:\n\nNT2 -> 't12'\n\nWait, in the given rules, here's a part:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT93\nNT2 -> NT44 NT14\nNT8 -> 't12'\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I can see that NT2 has a production rule that leads to 't12'. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> NT44 NT14\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me go through the list provided.\n\nThe user provided a long list of rules:\n\nHere's a selection:\n\nNT2 -> NT44 NT14\n...\nNT28 -> NT38 NT93\nNT52 -> NT19 NT28\n...\nLooking for a rule that results in 't12' \u2014 I see:\n\nYes, looking through the grammar:\n\nIn the provided rules, 't12' is produced by NT2. For example:\n\nNT2 -> 't12'\n\nWait, let me check the given rules:\n\nYes, here's:\n\nNT2 -> 't12'\n\nSo, NT2 directly produces 't12'. So if the first part of the string is 't12', it can be directly derived from NT2.\n\nBut wait, S is NT6 NT58. So S is two non-terminals. So to derive the first part of the string, it must be derived from NT6, and the second part from NT58.\n\nAlternatively, the entire string could be the concatenation of the two non-terminals. So, the first non-terminal is NT6, which must derive to a string that starts with 't12' and ends before the concatenation point. The second non-terminal, NT58, must derive to the rest of the string after that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first non-terminal (NT6) is generating a substring, say from 't12' onwards, and NT58 generates the rest. But the problem is, how do I split the string into two parts that each non-terminal can generate?\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts, each starting with a possible non-terminal and followed by their respective terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be produced by S. To do that, we need to see if S can produce this string. Given that S is NT6 NT58, the entire string must be the combination of the string derived by NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, perhaps I can split the string into two parts where the first part is generated by NT6, and the second part is generated by NT58.\n\nBut how do I split it? It might help to find where the string can split into two, such that the first part can be generated by NT6 and the second by NT58.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backward from the string, trying to match each non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to build a parse tree bottom-up or top-down. Since the string is quite long, let me see if there's a way to break it into smaller chunks.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see:\n\nS -> NT6 NT58\n\nSo the string must start with the output of NT6 followed by the output of NT58.\n\nNT6's production is NT73 NT62.

{"custom_id":"request-714","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and see if I can understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That could make parsing a bit easier, but I'm more concerned with whether the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions.\n\nThe string given is: `t25 t97 t55 t36 t53 t36 t53 t8 t4 t96 t27 t6 t96 t72 t82 t95 t77 t87 t53 t14 t87 t53 t8 t26 t53 t12 t3 t58 t94 t28 t94 t67 t96 t76 t25 t97 t27 t9`.\n\nI notice that all elements are 't' followed by numbers, so these are our terminal symbols. The non-terminals are various NT followed by numbers, like NT74, NT63, etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So to generate the string starting from S, we need to see if we can split S into two parts, each part being a derivation of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT6 NT58, both NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals. So our string must begin with whatever NT6 can derive and then NT58. But wait, the given string starts with t25, which is a terminal. Let me see which non-terminal translates to t25.\n\nLooking through the productions for NT79: nt79 \u2192 t27, but wait, in the list, I see NT79 \u2192 't27' but the production is different. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT79 is not present, but other options. Wait, let me go through the productions systematically.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT63 -> t36\n\nWait, in the productions, NT63 \u2192 t36 is not present. Let me check the list again. Oh, yes, looking at the end of the list, I see NT63 \u2192 t36. So NT63 can produce 't36'. But the string starts with t25, so which non-terminal can produce t25?\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT78 \u2192 t77\n\nWait, let me check the individual NT productions:\n\nLooking at the end of the list again, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 t8 t12\n\nWait, so NT73 can produce t8 followed by t12. Alternatively, checking the list, I see NT73 \u2192 't8' and t12 is another production? Or is it the other way. Looking at the list, I see NT82 \u2192 t97, but I also see NT78 producing t77. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT productions and their corresponding terminals.\n\nHere's a list of NT productions with their terminals:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t77\n- NT68 \u2192 t63 t67\n- NT73 \u2192 t8 t9 (Wait, I think I'm mixing up the NTs. Let me check the list again.)\n\nWait, the list provided has a long list of NT productions. Let me parse them:\n\nLooking for NT79: No NT79 in the list. Wait, in the list, NT95 is present multiple times, but perhaps not NT79. Wait, the list includes:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT67\n- NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT56 \u2192 NT95 NT19\n- NT69 \u2192 NT96 NT17\n- NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93\n- NT39 \u2192 NT78 NT46\n- NT38 \u2192 NT68 NT93\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT28\n- NT95 \u2192 NT27 NT66 (in one production)\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT99 \u2192 not in the list. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for each NT's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each NT and their possible right-hand sides (RHS) and see which of those RHS can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, for example, NT73 \u2192 't8' 't12', as per the production NT73 \u2192 't8' and some lines later I see NT73 \u2192 't8' 't12'? Wait, no, looking at the list, I don't see that. Let me check each NT's production:\n\nLooking through the list step by step:\n\nNT74: \u2192 NT6 NT74 is used in S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe string starts with t25, which must come from an NT production that directly produces t25. Looking through the terminal productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't8' 't9' ? Or does it produce multiple terms? Let's check the list again.\n\nWait, looking at each NT's production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n\nSo, the start symbol S generates NT6 and NT58.\n\nNow, NT6: according to the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through each line for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nSo NT6 can only produce NT73 and NT62, so it's a non-terminal production, not a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9 (Looking through the list, each NT58 production is like that.\n\nWait, but each production of an NT is either combining two other NTs or a terminal. So, for example, NT58 can produce a terminal or more NTs.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t25, which is a terminal, so we have to see which NT production can directly produce t25.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't25'.\nLooking through each NT in the list, I see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't8' (look for 't8' in the list. It appears as NT73 \u2192 't8' 't12'? Or is it a single terminal 't8'?)\n\nWait, let me go through the list:\n\nAfter NT74 is t77, then:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t63 t67\n\nNT73 \u2192 't8' and then what? Let me check the lines. Hmm, looking for NT73 anywhere.\n\nWait, I see:\n\nLine: NT73 \u2192 't8' 't9'\n\nYes, in line NT73 \u2192 't8' 't9':\n\nWait, actually, in the provided context, I see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't8' 't9' \u2014 wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nLine: NT73 \u2192 't8' 't9' \u2014 is that correct? Or is that a typo? Wait, in the user's message, perhaps it's correct.\n\nBut wait, line 110: NT73 \u2192 't8' 't9' \u2014 so NT73 can produce 't8' followed by 't9'. So that might mean NT73 \u2192 t8 t9, meaning it can produce a string of \"t8 t9\".\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't25', so that can't come from NT73. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking further down, I see NT79 \u2192 't27' \u2014 that might be.\n\nWait, line 99: NT79 \u2192 't27'.\n\nSimilarly, line 102: NT79 \u2192 't27'.\n\nSo NT79 can produce 't27' directly.\n\nBut the string starts with t25. So which NT produces t25?\n\nLooking more carefully, I see line 138: NT36 \u2192 't53' \u2014 no, that's t53.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan through each line for any NT that directly produces 't25'.\n\nLooking at each NT's production:\n\nLooking for terminals of 't25' - let's see.\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\u2014no.\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\u2014no.\n\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\u2014no.\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\u2014no.\n\nWait, perhaps I haven't noticed.

{"custom_id":"request-719","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of CNF grammars. CNF requires that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which can't be split further. Looking at the given grammar, I see that it's mostly in the correct form, with each non-terminal except 't's having exactly two non-terminals on the right side. However, I notice that some rules have a terminal on the right side, like S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Wait, but in CNF, all productions must derive from non-terminals except one. So in this case, S is the start symbol, and the production S \u2192 NT6 NT58 is okay because it's two non-terminals. So each rule with non-terminals followed by a terminal might not be following CNF strictly, but perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement. For now, I'll proceed assuming the grammar is correct as given, maybe the 't' tokens are terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t25 t84 t46 t68 t55 t95 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t67 t16 t83 t14 t87 t53 t3 t96 t72 t13 t27 t6 t58 t12 t36 t53 t8 t7 t96 t58 t96 t12 t26 t84 t79 t97 t94`.\n\nEach token is a terminal, looking like numbers or 't' followed by a number. I think the grammar's 'T's are the terminals, but actually, looking at the productions, it's 't' with numbers. Wait, in CNF, the only terminals are the ones present in the productions. So I need to check which symbols are terminals in this grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, symbols ending with 't' followed by a number are all terminals, and non-terminals are those without 't', like S, NT6, NT74, etc. So every time a production has a symbol followed by t..., that's a terminal.\n\nSo to parse the string, I need to see if there's a derivation starting from S that can produce the string by expanding each non-terminal and replacing them with their productions until only terminals are left, matching the string.\n\nGiven that this is a bit complex, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, using some top-down parsing approach. But given the length of the string, it might be easier to see if each symbol in the string can be matched by a production's terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t25. From the grammar, I see that NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT73 also appears as NT73 \u2192 't25' according to the productions. Yes, there's a rule: NT73 -> 't25'. So the string starts with NT73 expanding to 't25', which matches.\n\nNext, the string continues with t84. Let's see what's producing t84. Looking at the productions, I notice NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93 (since that's a production from NT84), but also NT84 \u2192 't40' (since in the productions, I see NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93 and another rule NT84 \u2192 't40'? Wait, looking back, no\u2014I think I need to check all productions for 't84'. Looking through the productions, there's a rule NT84 \u2192 't40' but that's under the list under NT80. Wait no, looking back:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\nLooking for tokens that produce 't84':\n\n- I see in the productions, NT78 \u2192 NT67 NT73 and also 't78' is a terminal. But wait, looking for 't84', let me scan the production list:\n\nIn the given productions, I see:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9\n\nSo NT58 can produce 't84' as the first step? Wait no, in the productions, I have NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. So that would make NT58 expand to 't84' and NT9. But in the string, after 't25' (which is from NT73), the next token is 't84', so perhaps we need to see how 't84' appears.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. In the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLet's scan all the rules for terminals:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT73 -> 't25' (yes, that's one terminal)\n\nLooking for 't84' as a terminal: Let me go through the rules:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65 \u2192 no 't' terminals.\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 \u2192 NT73 is a terminal producing 't25', so that would give 't25' followed by NT62. Not sure.\n\nWait, let me look through all the rules again to find where 't84' comes from.\n\nWait, I see in the rules:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2 \u2192 NT79 and NT2 are non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm focusing on the wrong part. Let's see:\n\nWait, let's make a list of all rules that directly produce a 'tX' terminal.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT78 -> 't78' (I think no, because I have NT78's production as NT67 NT73, but wait, in the production list, I see NT78 \u2192 NT67 NT73, but I also see a rule NT58 -> NT84 NT9. So 't84' is produced by NT84's first step if NT84 \u2192 't40', but no\u2014I must check all 'tX' productions.\n\nWait, actually, from the given list, the 'tX' terminals are:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT78 -> 't78' (I think not; let me check. Oh wait, looking at the given rules, I see:\n\nWait, going through the entire production list, I notice that some rules have a terminal on the right. For example, in the given list, I see:\n\nLooking at NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65, not a terminal.\n\nLooking for any rules that produce a terminal, I think perhaps I might have missed some, but the user provided the entire list, so I need to parse it.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLet's make a list of rules where the right-hand side is a terminal (like 'tX'). From the given production list:\n\n1. NT73 -> 't25'\n2. NT78 -> 't78'? Or does it have a production?\nWait, no. The production for NT78 is: NT78 \u2192 NT67 NT73, but that's a production to non-terminals, so that's not a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-739","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which helps because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Chomsky normal form makes it easier to analyze using parsers or even algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But wait, the string I have is pretty long with a lot of tokens, so doing that might be time-consuming. Maybe I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which directly produces NT6 and NT58. So the string must start with the expansions of NT6 and NT58. Let me see what the string starts with. The first token is t12, then t36, t53, t3, etc. I need to track these tokens and see if they can be generated through the productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that NT6 is one of the non-terminals. Let me check the rules for NT6. There's a production NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So NT6 must be broken down into NT73 and NT62. Let's see what those produce. NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 and NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT97. Hmm, so that's four steps. But wait, then each of those has to be expanded further.\n\nWait, maybe I should start from the top and see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar. The string starts with t12. Looking at the tokens, there's a production for NT8 \u2192 t12. So the part of the string that starts with t12 can come from NT8. Then the next token is t36. Looking at the grammar, NT36 \u2192 t64. So t36 is produced by NT36. Let me check the grammar rules for NT36.\n\nYes, in the productions, NT36 \u2192 t64. So t36 is correct. Next is t53. Checking the grammar, I see that NT53 is not a direct production, but wait, looking further, I see NT69 \u2192 t13 and NT53 isn't present. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see a NT53 production. Hmm, that's a problem. The third token after t12 and t36 is t53. But in the grammar, the only production that gives a token like t53 is NT67 \u2192 t53 (I think). Let me check. Yes, under NT rules, NT67 \u2192 t53. So t53 is generated by NT67.\n\nSo putting it together, after t12 (NT8) and t36 (NT36), the next part is t53 (NT67). Wait, but how do these connect? Because NT8 \u2192 t12, NT36 \u2192 t36, NT67 \u2192 t53. So perhaps the substring t12 t36 t53 can be broken down as NT8 \u2192 t12, followed by NT36 \u2192 t36, followed by NT67 \u2192 t53. But in the grammar, these are separate, so maybe the overall structure is S \u2192 NT6 NT58, but the NT6 and NT58 would each have their own derivations.\n\nWait, but in the string, it goes t12 t36 t53, which seems to correspond to NT8, NT36, NT67. But I'm not sure if they're connected directly or via some intermediate steps. Maybe I should look at the entire string and see if it can be grouped into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the entire string: t12 t36 t53 t3 t96 t14 t87 t53 t3 t96 t77 t87 t53 t8 t36 t53 t13 t96 t63 t94 t13 t67 t79 t53 t12 t26 t74 t95 t25 t58 t94 t28 t94 t28 t94 t13 t97 t40 t26.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Let's see if there's a pattern or if certain parts can be grouped.\n\nFor example, t12 is from NT8, t36 from NT36, t53 from NT67. Then after that, t3 is from NT69 \u2192 t69, but wait NT69 \u2192 t67, so where does t3 come from? Let me check the grammar for t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 t26, but that's another one. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's list all the NT productions and see which ones produce t tokens:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t73, nt62\nNT36 \u2192 t64\nNT53 \u2192 Wait, no, NT53 isn't in the productions. It must be via some other rule. Hmm, let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the grammar again for each NT's production:\n\nNT6: two rules, both produce t73 and t62, which are t tokens. So NT6 can produce t73 and t62 as the first step.\n\nBut t53 is produced by NT67 \u2192 t53.\n\nWait, looking back: I see in the grammar rules, there are several NTs that produce t tokens:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62 (both these produce t73 and t62 directly via other rules)\n- NT36 \u2192 t64\n- NT53 isn't directly a production, but let me check. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see an NT53 production. Did I miss it? Let me scroll through.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT67 \u2192 t53, so that's how t53 is produced. Okay.\n\nSo, the issue is that the given string has t53 appearing multiple times. Let me see if the grammar can generate t53 somewhere.\n\nYes, from NT67 \u2192 t53. Now, I need to see if the entire string can be broken down step by step through these rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to try to parse the string from the start.\n\nThe string starts with t12, which is from NT8 \u2192 t12. So the first part is NT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nNext is t36: NT36 \u2192 t36.\n\nThen t53: NT67 \u2192 t53.\n\nWait, but NT8, NT36, NT67 are all top-level non-terminals? Or are they derived from the start symbol S?\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, so the entire string must come from S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So let's see:\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT84 NT97.\n\nNT84 \u2192 t40.\n\nWait, but in our string, after t12 comes t36, which is from NT36. But according to this, after NT6 (from S) which becomes NT73 and NT62, NT73 becomes NT8 which produces t12. Then NT62 becomes NT84 NT97.\n\nNow, in the string, after t12, the next tokens are t36, t53, t3, etc. So in the derivation, after t12 from NT8, perhaps the other part (from NT58) is generating the rest of the string.\n\nWait, let's think about this. The string is t12 t36 t53 t3 t96 t14 t87 t53 t3 t96 t77 t87 t53 t8 t36 t53 t13 t96 t63 t94 t13 t67 t79 t53 t12 t26 t74 t95 t25 t58 t94 t28 t94 t28 t94 t13 t97 t40 t26.\n\nThat's 41 tokens. The grammar might generate a string that's a concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo, the overall idea is that the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT58. So after generating t12, the rest of the string must come from NT58.\n\nBut let's go step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t12.\n\nSo the first part is t12, then the rest from NT62.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT84 NT97.\n\nNT84 \u2192 t40.\n\nWait, that's t40, which isn't in the string. But in our string, after t12 comes t36, t53, etc. So that suggests that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each part between the t's are the generated symbols. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is non-terminal \u2192 non-terminal non-terminal or non-terminal \u2192 terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT58. So the string should start with either NT6 or NT58 leading to t... something.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts and see the structure. But wait, the grammar has a lot of rules, so maybe it's better to use a parsing method like CYK or recursive descent.\n\nBut doing that manually might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for sequences that match the rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning: the string starts with t12. Looking at the grammar, I see rules that produce t. For example, NT2 can produce t6 or t44 or t96 or t6, etc. Wait, let me check NT2:\n\nNT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't6', 't44' (wait, in the rules: NT2->'t9', NT2->'t70', NT2->'t6', NT2->'t44'). So from NT2, we can get different t's.\n\nBut the string starts with 't12', which isn't directly produced by any NT except maybe via other rules. Let me see: the strings with t12 are in the rules for NT46 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT46->'t28'... Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the rules:\n\nLooking for 't12', I find NT2 can produce 't9' and 't70' which are t9 and t70. But no 't12's are directly produced. Hmm, wait, looking back at the rules, does any rule produce t12?\n\nWait, looking more carefully: I don't see any rule that directly produces t12. So maybe t12 comes from a sequence of other rules. So the token t12 is generated by NT2, which has rules NT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't6', 't44'. None produce t12. Wait, maybe t12 is from a longer production.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at how the grammar can generate t12. If none of the rules directly produce t12, then how does t12 come into the string? That suggests either the string is invalid or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back: perhaps I made a mistake in looking for t12. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT2 has rules that produce 't9', 't70', 't6', 't44'. So none of these produce 't12'. So that's a problem because the string starts with 't12'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string is a concatenation of symbols, and the rules can produce the necessary t's through a chain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, I see that NT94 -> 't77'. So any occurrence of NT94 would produce 't77'. That's in the string as tokens like t77 come up multiple times.\n\nBut how do you get 't12'? Since none of the NT rules produce 't12' directly, but maybe through other rules. Wait, perhaps there's an NT that indirectly leads to 't12' via a combination of rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t12 is part of a longer symbol, like NT2, which has rules to produce certain ts. But wait, I don't see any rule for NT2 that produces 't12'. So if the string starts with 't12', that's a problem because none of the rules produce 't12'. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because maybe the NT2 rule can produce a combination of letters. Wait, no, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is two non-terminals, and terminals are only produced by themselves. So each NT's productions are combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo if none of the rules produce 't12', then the string starting with 't12' is impossible.

{"custom_id":"request-759","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFrom the grammar, I notice it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the start symbol. The start symbol is usually the leftmost non-terminal, which in this case seems to be S. The first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So every derived string must begin with the symbols from NT6 and NT58, but since these are non-terminals, I can't see the string directly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t25 t84 t36 t95 t14 t87 t53 t77 t26 t53 t12 t3 t28 t94 t13 t74 t39 t22 t26 t94 t67 t49 t39 t22 t49 t39 t12 t36 t53 t8 t72 t28 t94 t87 t94 t13`\n\nI'll split this string into individual tokens to process each token step by step. The tokens are: [\"t25\", \"t84\", \"t36\", \"t95\", \"t14\", \"t87\", \"t53\", \"t77\", \"t26\", \"t53\", \"t12\", \"t3\", \"t28\", \"t94\", \"t13\", \"t74\", \"t39\", \"t22\", \"t26\", \"t94\", \"t67\", \"t49\", \"t39\", \"t22\", \"t49\", \"t39\", \"t12\", \"t36\", \"t53\", \"t8\", \"t72\", \"t28\", \"t94\", \"t87\", \"t94\", \"t13\"]\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the maximum string length after k steps is 2^k. For a string of length 43, the derivation needs at least 6 steps because 2^6 = 64 \u2265 43.\n\nI'll try to derive the string step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first step must produce \"t25 t84\" since NT6 \u2192 \"t25\" and NT58 \u2192 \"t84\" (from the grammar rules: NT68 \u2192 \"t63 NT67\" and eventually NT79 \u2192 \"t16\", etc. Wait, actually, I need to check the production rules directly.\n\nLooking at NT6: It's defined as NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then NT73 could go to NT8 and NT9, which might produce terminals. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me check each NT production to see which terminals they directly produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77' directly. That's a terminal.\n- NT73 \u2192 't25' directly. Also a terminal.\n- NT6 can go to NT73 NT62. Maybe NT73 is 't25', and NT62 could eventually produce something else.\n\nBut wait, I need to look at each NT's productions and see which of them produce terminals directly.\n\nLet me list each NT and see their direct terminal output.\n\n- NT94 \u2192 t77 \u2714\ufe0f\n- NT73 \u2192 t25 \u2714\ufe0f\n- NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n- NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 is t25, but NT62 may or may not produce terminals.\nWait, looking at NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT93. Then NT84 can go to NT34 NT93, which I think produces more non-terminals. Hmm, this might be getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to parse the given string using the grammar's productions, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string starts with t25, which must come from NT73 if NT73 is defined as t25. Let me check the grammar: Yes, NT73 \u2192 t25, so that's correct.\n\nThen the first part is S \u2192 NT6 NT58: So after S, we have NT6 and NT58. Wait, no: The initial string starts with t25, which is the first symbol. But in the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first symbol should come from either NT6 or NT58.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which is two non-terminals. So the first step would expand NT6 and NT58 into something.\n\nBut the first token is t25, which would need to come from NT73. However, NT6 and NT58 are separate. Unless NT6 and NT58 can themselves produce terminals.\n\nWait, let me check NT58. According to the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. Looking at the productions for NT84 and NT9: NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93, which in turn may go to other non-terminals. NT9 \u2192 t26.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t25, so that must be derived from NT73. Let's see what NT73 produces. NT73 \u2192 t25, so that's straightforward.\n\nNext, that would have been produced by NT73 in the initial step. So S \u2192 NT6 NT58, but NT6 and NT58 are separate. Wait, this is confusing. Because S is derived into two non-terminals. So the first symbol should come from NT6, but in this case, the first symbol is t25, which is from NT73.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if S \u2192 NT6 NT58, both of these are non-terminals, so the first token in the string should come from NT6 or NT58, not NT73. So unless NT6 can produce t25, but looking at NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, which would require both NT73 and NT62 to be terminals, but from the rules, NT73 is t25 and NT62 seems to produce more non-terminals. So perhaps NT6 can produce t25 and something else.\n\nWait, let me check each production for NT6 and NT58 to see if any produce t25.\n\nLooking at NT6: The only production is NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 \u2192 t25, so if NT62 can produce something that, when combined, would start with t25, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the combination of NT73 and NT62 would lead to t25 followed by more symbols.\n\nBut in our string, the first token is t25. So the first symbol must be from NT73, which is part of the NT6 production. But in the initial step, S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the first symbol should be from NT6 or NT58, not NT73. This suggests a possible conflict.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has left-associative productions? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the derivation process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S expansion can lead to the string's first symbol being part of NT6 or NT58. Let me check NT58's productions.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT84 NT9. NT84 \u2192 NT34 NT93. NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65. Wait, that seems like it's looping. Maybe I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string cannot be produced because the first symbol t25 is from NT73, which is not directly reachable from S.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol should come from NT6 or NT58, which don't produce t25 directly. So the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-753","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It consists of a set of productions where each non-terminal (like S, NT74, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals or a terminal. The terminal symbols seem to be the 't' followed by a number, which I'll denote as tX.\n\nThe string given is a long sequence of ts and numbers: `t12 t36 t53 t3 t96 t14 t87 t53 t13 t96 t13 t16 t83 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t49 t95 t25 t87 t94 t67 t98 t92 t25 t84 t94 t84 t40 t77 t87 t53 t77 t98 t92 t25 t97 t79`.\n\nThe initial symbol of the grammar is S, which produces NT6 NT58. So, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Each of these NTs are non-terminals from the grammar.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived by expanding S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step doubles the number of symbols, but in this case, the string length is 39. The start symbol S would produce two non-terminals, so after the first expansion, we have two symbols. Then each of those can expand further, and so on.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to do a backward derivation. Start from the string and see if it can be reduced to S by applying the inverse of the given productions.\n\nEach production in the grammar can be reversed. For example, if A \u2192 BC, then BC can be reduced to A. So, I'll try to find pairs in the string that match any of the grammar's right-hand sides (RHS) and replace them with the corresponding non-terminal.\n\nLet me list out all the productions with their RHS, because I'll need to match them in the string in reverse:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n   Reverse: NT6 NT58 \u2192 S\n\nLooking at the string, I can try to find the left-hand sides (LHS) of any production in reverse. Each replacement step should reduce the string by one production.\n\nI'll start from the beginning and check if the first two symbols match any RHS of a production.\n\nThe first symbol is 't12', and the second is 't36'. The RHS could be any pair of terminals or non-terminals. So, looking for 't12 t36' in the string, but the string is long, so let's see.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of 't' followed by a number, which are all terminals except for the non-terminals which are pairs like NT6, NT74, etc.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 39 terminals, each being tX.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string is presented as a sequence of tX, so each tX is a separate terminal.\n\nSo in the context of the grammar, these tXs are the terminals. So for example, in the grammar, if a production has 'tX', that's a terminal. So, our string is a sequence of these terminals, and we're trying to see if these occur in the left-hand sides of any productions, or if they can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nIn the grammar, the non-terminals can expand into other non-terminals or into a terminal 'tX'. So, each production's RHS is either two non-terminals or a terminal (like t77, t96, etc.).\n\nSo when doing a backward derivation, each step involves replacing a pair of symbols (could be non-terminals or terminals) with a non-terminal. So for example, if we have a production NT6 \u2192 tsomething, then if our string has tsomething, we can replace it with NT6.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string consists entirely of terminals, which suggests that eventually, all non-terminals must have been expanded into terminals.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, which implies that the derivation must have expanded all non-terminals into these ts and numbers.\n\nSo, let me think. Starting from the string, I can look for pairs that match any of the RHS of the productions. Each time I find such a pair, I replace them with the corresponding non-terminal, effectively undoing a production step. I keep doing this until I either reduce the entire string to the start symbol S, in which case the string is generated, or I can't proceed further, meaning the string isn't generated.\n\nBut the string is long, and since the grammar is quite extensive, this could take a while. Maybe I can look for patterns.\n\nFirst, let's note that the start symbol S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So in any derivation starting from S, the first step would produce NT6 and NT58. So, in the string, these two non-terminals would eventually generate the initial part.\n\nBut wait, the string is all terminals, so unless NT6 and NT58 can produce terminal strings, it might not match.\n\nSo, I need to check if NT6 and NT58 can generate sequences that could result in the initial parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6 and NT58.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62\n\nWait, NT62 \u2192 NT97 NT62, which is a recursive production. Hmm, but in our string, I don't see any 't97's, so perhaps that path isn't viable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the NT6 production: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, etc. Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each non-terminal has a production that leads to a terminal. For example, some of the productions end with a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT97 NT62 (Terminal 't67' perhaps?)\n\nWait, let's look at the productions and see which ones end with a terminal instead of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the list of productions:\n\nNT94 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT73 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT69 \u2192 't67'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't70' (Wait, is this a production of NT2 \u2192 't70'? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, yes, there's a production NT2 \u2192 't70'. Hmm, that's problematic because in the given grammar, NT2 can produce either 't70' or another pair.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the grammar, for NT2, there are actually two productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't70' and NT2 \u2192 NT84 NT5 (Wait, is that correct?

{"custom_id":"request-776","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because it makes parsing easier, but I'm just trying to verify if the string is in the language here.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of productions. Let me see, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT6 NT58. So the string must start with the symbols from NT6 and NT58. Also, NT58 \u2192 NT9 NT69. So breaking it down, I need to see if the string can be derived step by step from S.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each production in the grammar eventually resolves to a terminal (a 't' followed by a number) after a series of steps. So I need to check if each step in the string corresponds to the non-terminals in the grammar, and eventually ends up matching the terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string against the grammar to see if it's a possible derivation. That might be tedious, but since the string is quite long, I need to find a systematic way.\n\nLooking at the string: t12 t77 t87 t53 t14 t87 t53 t77 t3 t67 t64 t96 t36 t53 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t96 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t72 t63 t94 t13 t26 t94 t67 t97 t55 t36 t53 t3 t96 t7 t96 t79.\n\nI know that each production either splits a non-terminal into two or resolves it to a terminal. So for the string to be valid, each part must match the productions.\n\nLooking at the start, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string should start with NT6 followed by NT58, which then breaks down further. Let me see if the first few tokens match. The first is t12, so I look for where t12 comes from. Scanning the grammar, I see NT84 \u2192 t46, wait no, NT84 is t40 in the production list. Hmm, maybe I need to find which NTs produce t12.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 t12. So if I have NT8 producing t12, then perhaps in the string, the first part is 't12', which would be from NT8. But wait, the start is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first token should come from NT6. Let's check which NTs produce t12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't12', but I don't see any NT directly producing t12 except NT8. So the first token is t12, which must come from NT8. But the start is NT6, so let's see what NT6 does. NT6 \u2192 't73' as per one of the productions. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 is defined as NT73 NT62. So to get t12, that would require NT6 to produce t73, but t73 isn't the same as t12. Unless I made a mistake. Wait, no, looking at NT73: NT73 \u2192 't25', 't8', etc., but I don't see a production for NT6 that gives t12. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me list all the rules again.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo each symbol in the string must come from these non-terminals. Let me start by examining each symbol in the string.\n\nThe first token is 't12'. Looking at the grammar rules, which NTs produce 't12'? Let's check the productions for NTs.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo 't12' must come from NT8.\n\nBut since S produces NT6 and NT58, the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT6. Therefore, unless NT6 somehow can produce a t12 directly, which it doesn't based on the rules, the first token 't12' can't be from NT6, so the string might not be in the language. But wait, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a production for NT6 that I don't see. Let me scan the rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nThen NT73 breaks down into:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo putting that together, NT73 \u2192 't12' NT9\n\nAnd NT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nSo NT73 \u2192 't12' 't26' via NT8 and NT9.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't12', so that would require that before 't12', there's some NT leading to it.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So if NT6 leads to a production that starts with 't12', but looking at NT6, it's NT73 NT62, each of which can then produce their terminals. So NT6 \u2192 't12' 't26'? Let me see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\n\nSo combining, NT6 \u2192 't12' 't26' (via NT62, which I think goes elsewhere, but maybe NT62 is t97. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking for NT62's production: NT62 \u2192 't84' as per the grammar.\n\nWait, no, NT62 is defined as NT84, I think. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT84\n\nAnd NT84 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, but NT62 is a non-terminal, so when NT6 is expanded as NT73 NT62, and NT62 goes to t40, perhaps? Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should instead approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, seeing if it follows the productions.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt12 t77 t87 t53 t14 t87 t53 t77 t3 t67 t64 t96 t36 t53 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t96 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t72 t63 t94 t13 t26 t94 t67 t97 t55 t36 t53 t3 t96 t7 t96 t79.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string can be split into chunks corresponding to NTs, and then parsed accordingly.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to see which of the symbols in the string don't correspond to any NT's productions. For example, if there's a 't' number that's not present in any NT production, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar's terminal productions, I see:\n\nNT14 \u2192 t94\nNT15 \u2192 t94\nNT2 \u2192 't6' or 't70' etc.\nNT65 \u2192 t72\nNT66 \u2192 t96\nNT68 \u2192 t36\nNT69 \u2192 t67\nNT73 \u2192 t25, t8\nNT74 \u2192 t77\nNT50 \u2192 t93, t6\nNT78 \u2192 t67, t73\nNT56 \u2192 t72, t84\nNT84 \u2192 t40, t93\nNT95 \u2192 t27, t66\nNT77 \u2192 t77\nAnd so on for others.\n\nWait, looking for t12: from the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 t12. So the string has 't12', which would come from NT8.\n\nBut wait, in the start symbol S, we have S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So how does 't12' come into play? Unless NT6 can somehow produce 't12' as its first symbol, but looking at NT6's productions, it's always two non-terminals: NT73 and NT62. So in NT6's expansion, the first symbol would be 't12' from NT73 (since NT73 \u2192 t12 t26, as per earlier thoughts). So the first token 't12' would fit as the first symbol from NT6's expansion.\n\nWait, but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-779","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token represents a terminal symbol, while non-terminals can be represented by rules expanding into these terminals. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure is useful for parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm dealing with a specific string, I might not need to invoke parsing algorithms here. Instead, I can approach this by trying to work backwards: start from the start symbol and see if I can derive the given string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol here is S. Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, according to this rule, S produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. The string to check starts with 't12 t14 t87...' which is a sequence of terminals. Since S is the start, its expansion must be the entire string. Therefore, the first step is to see if NT6 expands to 't12' and NT58 expands to 't14 t87 t53 t77 t72 t97 t36 t39 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t49 t95 t25 t28 t94 t13 t82 t39 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t68 t46 t74 t55 t26 t49 t40 t39 t95 t39 t36 t53 t67 t96' and so on? But wait, that doesn't make sense because S \u2192 NT6 NT58 is two non-terminals, so the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT58. The given string is of length 38, so the expansions of NT6 and NT58 must add up to 38 terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is to consider that the entire string is the expansion of S, and S expands into NT6 and NT58. So the string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 followed by NT58. That means the string can be split into two parts: the first part matches NT6's expansion and the second part matches NT58's expansion.\n\nBut this approach seems a bit daunting. Let me see if I can look up the non-terminals to see which terminals they correspond to. Alternatively, I can try to see if each part of the string corresponds to a production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the left has a production rule on the right. Let's check NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9, and NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT97. Wait, but NT84 is a non-terminal, right? So, it seems I need to break these down further.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't12 t14'. Let me check the productions for NT12 and NT14. Looking through the grammar, I notice that NT8 \u2192 't12' is not present, but for example, NT84 \u2192 't40'. Hmm, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the RHS of the productions, I can list which non-terminals expand to terminals:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87'\n- NT95 \u2192 't53'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT69 \u2192 't13'\n- NT87 \u2192 't98'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- NT38 \u2192 't68'\n- NT22 \u2192 't87'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87' (duplicate)\n- NT39 \u2192 't58'\n- NT62 \u2192 't84'\n- NT85 \u2192 't76'\n- NT95 \u2192 't53' (duplicate)\n- NT67 \u2192 't53'\n- NT79 \u2192 't67' (duplicate)\n- NT84 \u2192 't55'\n- NT74 \u2192 't8'\n- NT36 \u2192 't79'\n- NT17 \u2192 't96'\n- NT65 \u2192 't82'\n- NT93 \u2192 't39'\n- NT38 \u2192 't74'\n- Others are non-terminals on the left-hand side.\n\nWait, but most of these seem to produce terminals except those on the left side. Hmm, perhaps each non-terminal can produce a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nBut the problem is that the given string is a sequence of terminals, so each non-terminal in the expansion must eventually produce a terminal. Therefore, I need to determine if each non-terminal has a production that can derive a terminal, and the entire sequence matches the string.\n\nLooking more closely, perhaps each non-terminal can derive one or more terminals eventually. Let me consider the structure. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Therefore, each non-terminal can only derive a string of terminals of length either 1 or 2, but in the case of CNF, they can derive only terminals of length 1 as the expansion rules go. Wait, no: in CNF, a non-terminal can only expand into two non-terminals (each step) or a terminal (if the rule is A \u2192 a).\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, so each expansion step increases the number of symbols by one. Therefore, starting from a non-terminal, the derivation ends when all are terminals, with an overall length that can be any number, with each non-terminal contributing its own expansion steps.\n\nBut perhaps looking for the given string is possible by seeing if each token in the string is generated by the expansion of a non-terminal starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards from the string.\n\nEach step, break down the string into possible non-terminals.\n\nBut this can be complex. Alternatively, maybe I should try to parse the given string against the grammar step by step.\n\nLet me try to see what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of the productions, I notice that several non-terminals directly produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87'\n- NT95 \u2192 't53'\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'\n- NT63 \u2192 't36'\n- NT15 \u2192 't94'\n- NT69 \u2192 't13'\n- NT87 \u2192 't98'\n- NT27 \u2192 't4'\n- NT38 \u2192 't68'\n- NT22 \u2192 't87'\n- NT9 \u2192 't26'\n- NT46 \u2192 't87' (duplicate)\n- NT39 \u2192 't58'\n- NT62 \u2192 't84'\n- NT85 \u2192 't76' (duplicate)\n- NT95 \u2192 't53' (duplicate)\n- NT67 \u2192 't53' (duplicate)\n- NT79 \u2192 't67' (duplicate)\n- NT84 \u2192 't55'\n- NT74 \u2192 't8'\n- NT36 \u2192 't79'\n- NT17 \u2192 't96'\n- NT65 \u2192 't82'\n- NT93 \u2192 't39'\n- NT38 \u2192 't74' (duplicate)\n\nSo the non-terminals that can produce a single terminal include: NT94 ('t77'), NT73 ('t25'), NT69 ('t67'), NT46 ('t87'), NT95 ('t53'), NT79 ('t27'), NT63 ('t36'), NT15 ('t94'), NT69 ('t13'), NT87 ('t98'), NT27 ('t4'), NT38 ('t68'), NT22 ('t87'), NT9 ('t26'), NT46 ('t87'), NT39 ('t58'), NT62 ('t84'), NT85 ('t76'), NT74 ('t8'), NT36 ('t79'), NT17 ('t96'), NT65 ('t82'), NT93 ('t39'), NT38 ('t74').\n\nNow, looking at the given string: t12 t14 t87"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-797","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, so I need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar. CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals. But looking at the given grammar, I notice that all productions are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ or NTX -> tY, where tY is a terminal.\n\nWait, in CNF, every production must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the productions match that form, as they either produce two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. But in this case, some productions produce two terminals, like NT2 -> 't9', or NT94 -> 't14', etc.\n\nSo, each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals (like NT74 -> NT9 NT66) or a non-terminal producing a terminal and a non-terminal (like NT38 -> 't68' NT8) or a terminal and two non-terminals? Wait no, looking again, the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, but I'm not sure. Let me confirm CNF: in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So any production that has a terminal in the right-hand side is allowed as A \u2192 a.\n\nBut in the given grammar, for example, NT2 -> 't9' is a single terminal, so that's fine. But for NT74, it's NT74 -> NT9 NT66, so two non-terminals. Similarly, NT6 -> NT73 NT62, so again two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the list provided, there are some productions that seem to have two terminals, like NT2 -> 't9' is a single terminal. Others, like NT28 -> NT38 NT93, two non-terminals, and so on. So overall, each production in the grammar is of the form non-terminal \u2192 non-terminal non-terminal or non-terminal \u2192 terminal.\n\nThis is consistent with CNF, so the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t12 t26 t97 t55 t77 t87 t53 t8 t36 t53 t14 t87 t53 t67 t96 t96 t14 t87 t53 t8 t26 t67 t64 t53 t12 t14 t87 t53 t8 t7 t96 t64 t87 t94 t67 t49 t39 t12 t26 t28 t94 t67`.\n\nI notice that the string has multiple ts followed by numbers. The terminals in the grammar are those that appear on the right-hand side of the productions as 't' plus a number. For example, NT2 -> 't9' so 't9' is a terminal in the grammar. Similarly, NT94 -> 't14', so 't14' is a terminal.\n\nThe challenge is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which in the grammar is S -> NT6 NT58. So the initial expansion starts with NT6 and NT58.\n\nEach of those non-terminals can further be expanded as per the productions, and so on, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, forming the string.\n\nSince the string is long, I might consider parsing it step by step, but that could be time-consuming. Alternatively, I might look for any patterns or repeated patterns in the string that could indicate whether it's possible to derive it according to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production leads to either a single terminal or two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can be replaced with two non-terminals until leaves are terminals.\n\nBut considering the size of the string, it might help to see if the number of symbols is compatible with the possible derivations.\n\nLet me consider the structure. Each production in CNF either introduces two non-terminals (so the number of nodes in the parse tree doubles) or introduces a terminal (so a leaf node). The string length is 64 symbols, and the grammar is context-free, so the derivation will involve splitting up symbols into non-terminals recursively.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact structure and transitions, it might be difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed as sequences of terminals, each corresponding to the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nAnother idea is to check if the string can be split into the terminals that the grammar produces.

I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens like \"t12\", \"t77\", etc. The grammar is quite complex, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions where each rule either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each production has at most two non-terminals, and no \u03b5 productions. The start symbol is S, and the string should be derived from S.\n\nNow, looking at the string: `t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t36 t53 t77 t87 t53 t8 t26 t13 t64 t96 t36 t53 t77 t7 t96 t64 t58 t94 t67 t53 t25 t87 t94 t13 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t36 t53 t67 t96 t96 t3 t63 t94 t67`.\n\nEach token is a terminal except perhaps if they are part of non-terminals in the grammar, but in CNF, non-terminals only produce two symbols at most, so each token in the string must be a terminal. So the string is made up of 43 tokens.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S starts with NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nLet me check the first token. The first token is t12, which is a terminal. In the grammar, I need to see if any non-terminals produce a terminal. Let's look for productions ending with t12.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT85 \u2192 NT95 NT50, and NT50 \u2192 NT85 NT66, but that doesn't produce t12. Wait, let's check the individual terminals:\n\nChecking all entries, I notice that NT36 \u2192 t36, NT46 \u2192 t46, NT37 \u2192 t39, etc. So I need to link the tokens to the non-terminals producing them.\n\nFor example, t36 is produced by NT36, t12 is produced by NT12? Wait, no, looking through the list, I don't see a production for NT12. Hmm. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the entire grammar list for tokens like t12.\n\nLooking down the list: I see NT87 \u2192 t98, NT39 \u2192 t58, NT85 \u2192 t76, etc. But t12 is only mentioned in the grammar as a terminal in NT2 \u2192 t6, but that's not relevant. Wait, wait, no: the grammar seems to have some entries like NT2 \u2192 't9' etc., but perhaps 't12' is a terminal. But in the grammar provided, do any non-terminals produce 't12'?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT44 \u2192 't83', NT55 \u2192 't92', etc. But where is 't12' produced? Let me check each line:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t9 (so NT2 produces 't9')\n- NT94 \u2192 t14\n- NT77 \u2192 t25? Wait, looking up: NT73 \u2192 t25, NT79 \u2192 t16, etc. Wait, no, in the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 NT27 NT66\n- NT63 \u2192 NT96 NT67\n- NT15 \u2192 NT69 NT15\nNo, I don't see a production that results in 't12'. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking through all of them, perhaps 't12' is just a terminal that appears in the given string. So in the string, the first token is t12. Since the grammar doesn't have a production for NTx \u2192 t12 for any non-terminal, the only way to produce t12 is if it's directly a terminal symbol.\n\nIn the provided grammar, are any non-terminals producing t12? Looking through the list:\n\nI don't see any production that gives 't12'. So if the first token is t12, then the grammar can't have a production for that. So that might be the problem. But wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. Looking through all the productions:\n\nFor example, NT44 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't92'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT23? Wait, the list provided is long, but I don't see any production for NT2\u2192't12'. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo, but according to the given grammar, there's no production for any NT to produce 't12', except if there's a rule like NT12 \u2192 t12, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, let's look again. The productions are listed as:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT79 NT2\n\nSo, for example, NT36 \u2192 t36, which is correct. But where is t12?\n\nWait, looking through all the lines, I don't see any production that ends with 't12'. So if the string begins with 't12', but the grammar doesn't have a rule for a non-terminal producing 't12', then that string cannot be generated by this grammar. Because the only way to produce 't12' is as a terminal, but there's no non-terminal with that production.\n\nSo that would mean the answer is 'No'. However, that might not be the case because perhaps I missed looking somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check each production again.\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't9'\u2014that's the only NT2 production.\n- No NT7 \u2192 't12'\u2014no, there is no NT7 with that.\n- NT23 might be present, but no, I don't see it.\n\nWait, maybe the production is part of a two-step derivation. No, because each production is a direct step, so 't12' must be produced directly.\n\nThus, since 't12' isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, the given string cannot be generated by it.\n\nWait, but the string might not use all the productions, so maybe it's impossible to derive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string includes 't12', but that's impossible because the grammar can't produce 't12' as any NT rule ends in a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-814","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to check each token to see if it's derived from the grammar's rules.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like each production rule in Chomsky normal form is a right-hand side (RHS) consisting of exactly two non-terminals. The left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, which means each step in the derivation will replace a single non-terminal with two others. This is important because it tells me about the possible paths the derivation can take, whether binary trees or something else, but in CNF, all derivations are binary.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that there are several 't' tokens attached as terminals. Each non-terminal on the RHS eventually resolves to one of these 't's with certain indices. For example, NT6 -> t67, NT62 -> t84, and so on. My job is to model the derivation steps and see if the given string can be broken down according to these rules.\n\nLet me start by parsing the string into individual tokens. The string is:\n\nt12 t3 t97 t55 t77 t87 t53 t8 t76 t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t3 t67 t79 t84 t67 t83 t4 t96 t16 t83 t26 t49 t95 t12 t26 t58 t94 t28 t94 t67 t26 t13 t94 t98 t92 t12 t3 t97 t94\n\nSo, that's 40 tokens. Hmm, that's a lot. I need to see if each token can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven the grammar, each non-terminal on the RHS of the productions eventually resolves to a 't' with an index. For example, the initial symbol is S -> NT6 NT58. So S will be replaced by NT6 and NT58, each of which can further break down.\n\nI think a possible approach is to try to derive the string step by step. But given the length, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string corresponds to a possible application of a production rule.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to model this as a top-down parsing problem, where I start from S and try to replace symbols until I get all 't's. But I need to track the sequence of replacements that build the string.\n\nAnother thought is to model this as a string derivation where each rule application doubles the number of symbols, which would result in a string that's 2^n in length where n is the number of productions. However, the given string has 40 tokens, which is not a power of two. 2^5=32, 2^6=64, so 40 is in between. So it's not a straightforward exponential length, which suggests that maybe the derivation may involve some symbols that reach a terminal early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string as a leftmost derivation. Each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal in the current string.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to list all possible non-terminals and their production rules, and see which ones correspond to each token in the string.\n\nWait, let's map each of the non-terminals to their RHS:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that each non-terminal on the LHS has a RHS that splits into two other non-terminals. Let me list all of them:\n\n- NT74 -> NT9 NT66\n- NT63 -> NT94 NT22\n- NT95 -> NT9 NT69\n- NT19 -> NT37 NT69\n- NT65 -> NT38 NT84\n- NT14 -> NT59 NT15\n- NT50 -> NT93 NT6\n- NT78 -> NT67 NT73\n- NT56 -> NT9 NT19\n- NT95 -> NT27 NT66\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT40\n- NT40 -> NT69 NT17\n- NT34 -> NT58 NT65\n- NT6 -> NT73 NT62\n- NT36 -> NT79 NT2\n- NT40 -> NT74 NT56\n- NT84 -> NT34 NT93\n- NT78 -> NT28 NT73\n- NT58 -> NT84 NT9\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT93\n- NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n- NT85 -> NT95 NT50\n- NT68 -> NT63 NT67\n- NT39 -> NT78 NT46\n- NT85 -> NT87 NT55\n- NT73 -> NT8 NT9\n- NT78 -> NT52 NT80\n- NT50 -> NT85 NT66\n- NT56 -> NT95 NT36\n- NT59 -> NT56 NT95\n- NT52 -> NT19 NT28\n- NT37 -> NT39 NT15\n- NT95 -> NT85 NT6\n- NT78 -> NT78 NT37\n- NT52 -> NT87 NT66\n- NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n- NT8 -> NT12 (Wait, is that right? Checking the grammar: NT2 -> 't70'. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking back, I think I might have mixed up some rules. Let me check NT2.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several NT2 entries:\n\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- Also, earlier, NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n- Then again, NT28 -> NT38 NT93, and so on.\n\nWait, so that might suggest that NT2 can sometimes produce a terminal, sometimes produce two non-terminals, but that would violate the Chomsky normal form, right?\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So for a non-terminal like NT2, its productions must all be of the form A->BC or A->a.\n\nLooking back at the given grammar, let me check all the NT2 rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n- Also, at the bottom of the list, NT2 -> 't6' and 't12'\n\nWait, that can't be right. If NT2 has multiple productions, including ones that produce terminals, it's possible. But in this case, let's check all NT2 rules:\n\nYes, I see NT2 has several rules: some produce terminals, some produce non-terminals. That's allowed as long as each individual production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, NT2 can be a mix of both. So when parsing the string, whenever I encounter 't70', it corresponds to NT2, and similarly for 't6' and 't12'.\n\nSo, now, back to the string.

{"custom_id":"request-834","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has rules where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. Wait, no, actually, more accurately, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. Oh right, and the start symbol can only produce two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, let me check the productions:\n\nEach production starts with something like S -> NT6 NT58. NT74 -> NT9 NT66... All the way down, every production is two non-terminals on the right. So this grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t25 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t3 t13 t7 t96 t95 t25 t97 t96 t12 t26 t84 t98 t92 t25 t84 t76 t96 t96 t25 t97 t27 t83 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t63 t94 t67 t26 t94 t67 t26 t13 t94`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals, each representing a production. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, but how? Since each production in CNF splits into exactly two non-terminals, the derivation tree is binary, and the length of the string should probably be a power of 2 minus one, or something like that? Wait, no, for CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal into two, so starting with S, the first step gives two non-terminals, then each of those can become two, and so on. The number of terminals in a derivation would be 2^n - 1 for n steps, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because the number of steps might vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for a way to break the string into the right number of symbols and see if each part matches a production's right-hand side.\n\nWait, the string has 47 symbols. Let me count: t25, t84, t55, t14, t87, t53, t26, t96, t3, t13, t7, t96, t95, t25, t97, t96, t12, t26, t84, t98, t92, t25, t84, t76, t96, t96, t25, t97, t27, t83, t36, t53, t26, t96, t26, t63, t94, t67, t26, t94, t67, t26, t13, t94. Let me count again: 47 symbols. Hmm.\n\nWait, the grammar has a certain structure, and each production leads to two non-terminals, so each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols, right? So the minimal number of symbols in a string would be 1 (start with S), then 2, then 4, 8, 16, etc. But 47 isn't a power of two. Wait, 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So maybe 47 is too big, unless the derivation steps are not all using the same number of symbols. But since each production is two non-terminals, each step would increase the count by one (since S \u2192 NT NT gives 2 symbols, then each of those could split into two, etc.).\n\nWait, no, it's a tree structure. The number of symbols is like 2^n, but the total number of nodes might vary. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a series of non-terminals and see if the sequence of terminals can be generated through the given rules.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the beginning, trying to match the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t25, t84, etc. Wait, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT79 \u2192 t27 (but that's a terminal rule, right? Wait, from the list above, for example, NT94 \u2192 't77', so some non-terminals have direct terminal replacements.\n\nWait, each production is either a non-terminal split into two non-terminals (Chomsky Normal Form) or a non-terminal replaced by a terminal. So I can approach this as parsing from the string and seeing if it can be broken down using the rules.\n\nWait, no, Chomsky Normal Form is S \u2192 NT NT, as each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals? Or actually, in CNF, all productions must have two non-terminals, because a production that has a terminal on the right side is not allowed in CNF. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right. So any terminal-only symbols must be atomic, but in this problem, all the productions are for non-terminals, so the string consists only of the terminals, which we need to replace through the productions.\n\nWait, no, the string is composed of all terminals (like t25, t84, etc.), but the grammar's productions replace the start symbol S through a series of steps that involve replacing non-terminals. So I need to reconstruct the sequence of productions that would generate this string.\n\nWait, perhaps the string represents the leaves of a derivation tree in the grammar. Each step doubles the number of symbols or so. But the given string has 47 symbols, which is an odd number, so perhaps it's possible.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the given productions backwards.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\n\n`t25 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t3 t13 t7 t96 t95 t25 t97 t96 t12 t26 t84 t98 t92 t25 t84 t76 t96 t96 t25 t97 t27 t83 t36 t53 t26 t96 t26 t63 t94 t67 t26 t94 t67 t26 t13 t94`\n\nWhich is 47 tokens long. I'll number them from 0 to 46 for reference.\n\nI'll work from the end backward because I know some terminals directly map to non-terminals. For example, some terminal symbols are outputs of non-terminals. Let me look at the production rules for each non-terminal:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 t27\n Wait, no, looking at the given rules:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see something like:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't77'?\n\nWait, no. Let me list all terminal outputs:\n\nLooking through the rules, several non-terminals have a direct terminal production, like:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 t77\n- NT73 \u2192 t25\n- NT69 \u2192 t67\n- NT46 \u2192 t87\n- NT95 \u2192 t58\nWait, perhaps I should make a list:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, looking for which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't77'\n- NT73 \u2192 't25'\n- NT69 \u2192 't67'\n- NT79 \u2192 't16' (Wait no, looking again, the list says NT79 \u2192 't16'? Wait: NT79 is produced by several rules, like NT94 \u2192 't77', NT73 \u2192 't25', etc. Wait, no, hold on: Looking through the rules, some NTs lead to terminals, others lead to other non-terminals.\n\nLet me check each rule line:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 't27'? Or perhaps not. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nAh, here's a line: \"NT27 -> 't4'\". Wait, no, let me parse each line correctly.\n\nWait, the problem presents the grammar as a list of production rules, each line starting with something like S -> NT6 NT58 etc.\n\nBut looking at the list, the rules go like this:\n\n- NT94 -> 't77' \u2192 So NT94 produces t77.\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n\n- NT69 -> 't67'\n\n- NT79 -> 't16' (Wait, checking: Do I see any production for NT79 leading directly to a terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-836","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze how strings are built up.\n\nThe provided grammar has several non-terminals (NT prefixes like NT6, NT74, etc.) and terminals, which are the 't' followed by digits like t12, t77, etc. The string to evaluate is a series of these terminals and non-terminals, and I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me first write down the structure of the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT6 NT58\n- And a bunch of other productions like NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66, etc. Each line ends with something or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t26 t67 t98 t92 t96 t25 t97 t27 t83 t58 t25 t84 t7 t96 t95 t12 t3 t97 t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t72 t97 t98 t92 t96 t96 t25 t97 t67 t6 t7 t96 t94 t84 t55 t3.\n\nWow, that's quite a long string. Let's see where to start.\n\nFirst, note that the string starts with t12. Looking at the grammar, t12 appears several times. For example, NT56 \u2192 NT95 NT36, and NT95 \u2192 NT92 NT6, among others.\n\nBut to get a t12, let's check if any non-terminal directly produces t12. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT69 \u2192 t67, which is a terminal. Hmm, maybe I need to build up from other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down step by step using the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a parsing approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can try to build the string by checking each production and seeing if the symbols can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if all the t's in the string can be explained by the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t26 t67 t98 t92 t96 t25 t97 t27 t83 t58 t25 t84 t7 t96 t95 t12 t3 t97 t12 t14 t87 t53 t77 t72 t97 t98 t92 t96 t96 t25 t97 t67 t6 t7 t96 t94 t84 t55 t3.\n\nThat's a lot of t's. Let's try to see if each t can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, look for the start symbol S, which produces NT6 NT58. So the first two symbols after applying S should be NT6 and NT58.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t12. So either NT6 is t12 or NT58 is t12? Wait, no, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and looking up the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nThen, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nAnd NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40, and so on. So I'm not sure if that leads to t12. Let me check if any of these non-terminals produce t12.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9' (so t9), but not t12.\n\nNT2 appears in NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT66, and NT66 \u2192 't96'.\n\nAlso, NT62 \u2192 't84', and NT69 \u2192 't67', etc. Hmm, not t12 yet.\n\nWait, let's see if there's any production that has a terminal t12.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces t12. So it must be derived via multiple steps.\n\nWait, but none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce t12. Let me list all the terminals and see where they come from.\n\nThe terminals in the string are:\n\nt12, t77, t87, t53, t8, t26, t67, t98, t92, t96, t25, t97, t27, t83, t58, t25, t84, t7, t96, t95, t12, t3, t97, t12, t14, t87, t53, t77, t72, t97, t98, t92, t96, t96, t25, t97, t67, t6, t7, t96, t94, t84, t55, t3.\n\nSo, t12, t77, t87, t53, etc.\n\nLooking through the rules for each of these:\n\n- t12: Do any non-terminals produce t12? Let's see the rules for non-terminals ending with '12', '77', etc. Looking through, I don't see any production that leads to t12 as a terminal, only via the base symbols.\n\nWait, no, the non-terminals' productions convert into other non-terminals or terminals, but none directly have t12. So, perhaps t12 is built from other non-terminals.\n\nSo, t12 is in the string multiple times. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut the first thing I noticed is that the string starts with t12, so the first symbol must be derived from a non-terminal that produces t12 as the first step. Since no non-terminal directly produces t12, we need to find a way that the entire string must expand into through a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's left-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S's expansion must start with NT6 followed by NT58. So the first two parts of the string should correspond to the expansions of NT6 and NT58, respectively.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t12. So either NT6 produces t12 after some steps, or NT58 produces t12 first.\n\nLet me check NT6 and NT58:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12' (Wait, no, NT8's production is NT22 \u2192 't2', or other. Wait looking back at the grammar, does NT8 produce t12? Let me check.\n\nLooking up the grammar:\n\nLooking through each non-terminal, do any of them produce t12 as a terminal? I don't see any production that directly converts a non-terminal to t12. So t12 must come from expanding some non-terminal through multiple steps.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking at all the non-terminals and their productions, I don't see any that produce t12. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for t12 to be the first symbol in the string because no non-terminal directly produces t12, and without that, we can't have t12 as the first symbol.\n\nSo, does that mean the entire string cannot be generated? Because the parsing would fail at the first symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\nThe terminal t12 appears in several places, but no non-terminal seems to directly produce it. For example, NT69 \u2192 't67', NT84 \u2192 't46', etc. So, I don't think any non-terminal directly produces t12.\n\nThus, the string cannot be generated because the first symbol t12 cannot be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t12. How is that possible? Maybe I missed a production. Let me check all non-terminals again.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t9\n\nNT2 appears in NT74, which \u2192 NT9, NT66.

{"custom_id":"request-861","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is quite long, and the grammar seems a bit complex with numerous non-terminals and productions. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions of two types: A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. In this grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT58. These NTs are non-terminals that need to be expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at the string to be evaluated, it's a sequence of 't' followed by two-digit numbers. My goal is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nI'll start by mapping which non-terminals in the grammar correspond to each terminal in the string. Each 'tX' corresponds to NTX. For example, 't12' corresponds to NT12, 't36' to NT36, and so on. My task is to see if the string can be parsed by the given grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Starting from the end, look for possible production rules that can derive the string. Alternatively, I can attempt to parse the string using the grammar, but parsing can be complex given the numerous non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT94 \u2192 't77', NT73 \u2192 't25', etc. These might be useful in building up parts of the string.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual 'tX' components: t12, t36, t53, t3, t96, t98, t92, t12, t14, t87, t53, t36, t53, t8, t4, t96, t79, t96, t76, t12, t36, t53, t13, t96, t84, t67, t70, t97, t39, t25, t97, t12, t14, t87, t53, t77, t98, t92, t25, t97, t64, t97, t64, t97, t46.\n\nNow, I'll try to see if these can be derived from the grammar. Let's look at each step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT6: The production for NT6 is NT73 NT62. So, NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNow, NT73: It has two productions, NT8 NT9 or 't25'. Since the first character is t12, it's not 't25', so it must use NT8 NT9. So, NT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nLooking at NT8: productions are NT12 or terminals like t8, etc. Here, the next part after NT73 is t12, which is a terminal. So, NT8 must produce 't12', i.e., NT8 \u2192 't12'.\n\nThen, NT9: productions are NT68 NT40 or 't26'. The next character after 't12' is t36, which suggests NT9 must produce t36. Looking at NT9's productions, NT98 \u2192 t67, but wait, NT9's productions are NT68 NT40 or 't26'. Wait, I might have mixed up NT9 and NT98. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, NT94 \u2192 't77', NT96 \u2192 't96', etc. But looking at the production for NT9: NT95 \u2192 NT9 NT69, etc., and finally, NT9 \u2192 't26'. Oh, right, NT9's production is either NT68 NT40 or 't26'. So to get 't36', which is NT36, I probably need to look at another part.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to retrace.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9 (since first step).\n\nNT8 can produce NT12 or 't8'. Here, after NT73, the string starts with t12, so NT8 \u2192 't12'.\n\nNow, after NT8 producing 't12', NT9 must produce something. The next token is t36, which is 't36', so NT36. But NT9's production is 't26' or NT68 NT40. How can we get 't36'?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check NT9's production again. Looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT40 or 't26'. So, 't26' is the only terminal that NT9 directly produces. So, how can we get 't36'?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider a different approach. Perhaps I should try to see if any non-terminal can produce 't36' directly, but in the provided grammar, looking through the rules, I don't see any direct production for 't36' as a terminal. The only NT that directly goes to a terminal is those ending with NTXX \u2192 'tXX'. For example, NT2 is 't70', NT36 is 't64', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't64'.\n\nSo, NT36 \u2192 't64'.\n\nTherefore, if I can derive NT36, it would produce 't64'.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't36' comes 't53', which is a terminal, so perhaps I should look at the entire string segment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to map the entire string and see step by step how it can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be efficient, but given the complexity of the grammar, it might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for patterns or direct productions.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from the beginning:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT8 NT9.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't12' (since the string starts with t12).\n\nNow, after NT8 producing 't12', we have NT9 next.\n\nNT9 can either produce 't26' or NT68 NT40. But in the string, the next terminal is 't36', which is NT36. But NT36 is derived from NT15 NT28, perhaps? Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, NT36 is defined as NT15 NT28. So, to get 't36', we need to expand NT36 through NT15 \u2192 NT17 NT2, and NT2 \u2192 various terminals.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let me try to map the entire string and see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be broken down into sequences of terminals that are directly produced by non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by splitting the string into individual terms:\n\nt12, t36, t53, t3, t96, t98, t92, t12, t14, t87, t53, t36, t53, t8, t4, t96, t79, t96, t76, t12, t36, t53, t13, t96, t84, t67, t70, t97, t39, t25, t97, t12, t14, t87, t53, t77, t98, t92, t25, t97, t64, t97, t64, t97, t46.\n\nNow, let's see if each of these can be matched to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce t's:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't70' (from the last part: NT27 \u2192 't4', etc. Wait, let me check NT2:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT2 has multiple productions, including NT27 \u2192 't4', but looking further down, I see:\n\n\"NT28 -> 't38' NT93\", etc., but wait, the actual productions given in the grammar include lines like:\n\n\"NT2 -> 't70'\", so NT2 \u2192 't70'.\n\nSimilarly, NT36 \u2192 't64' because"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-857","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which simplifies certain aspects of parsing. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT58. Both NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals that should eventually lead to terminal strings (the 't' followed by numbers) through a series of productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production on the left will have exactly two non-terminals on the right. This suggests that the parsing can be done using a method like recursive descent or a CYK algorithm, but I'm thinking about how to approach it without implementing the entire parser.\n\nI'll start by examining the grammar productions to see if they can help me break down the string into smaller parts. Since each production has two non-terminals, the string should potentially be split into multiple applications of these productions.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT79 -> 't27', which is a single terminal. Wait, no, looking again, some entries like NT2 -> 't9' mean that when NT2 is expanded, it can directly produce a terminal. Similarly, others like NT28 -> 't70', NT14 -> 't70', etc.\n\nSo, each 't' number in the string must correspond to one of these productions. The challenge is to see if the entire string can be formed by applying these productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt12 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t3 t96 t36 t53 t3 t96 t58 t25 t97 t7 t96 t39 t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t26 t67 t79 t97 t96 t25 t97 t79 t13 t27 t44 t53 t25 t28 t94 t13 t97 t55 t36 t53 t13 t96\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar. Since the left-hand sides (LHS) of the productions are two non-terminals, each of the 20 't' elements must be part of a production that splits into two non-terminals. \n\nWait, but the string consists of 40 elements, which is 20 pairs. Each pair might be produced by a single grammar rule. So I can start by checking pairs of 't' sequences against the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is long, maybe I can see if the entire string is parsed according to the rules. But considering it's 40 elements, that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be reduced step by step using the grammar. But for the sake of time, maybe I can look for patterns or key nodes that might help.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals produce certain 't' sequences. For example:\n\n- NT95 -> NT56 NT95. But NT95 also has some terminal productions.\n\nAlternatively, to see if the string is possible, I can try to trace possible paths.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider that in the grammar, the initial symbol S -> NT6 NT58. So, to derive the string, it must ultimately start with NT6 followed by NT58. Each of those non-terminals must be able to produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT6: The production is NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nNT73 -> NT8 NT9. NT8 -> 't15', according to the list? Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The productions in the grammar list are for NTs, so I have to see which NTs are on the right-hand sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first create a map of NTs to their productions for clarity. Let's parse through the grammar:\n\nS: NT6 NT58\nNT74: NT9 NT66\nNT63: NT94 NT22\nNT95: NT9 NT69\nNT19: NT37 NT69\nNT65: NT38 NT84\nNT14: NT59 NT15\nNT50: NT93 NT6\nNT78: NT67 NT73\nNT56: NT9 NT19\nNT95: NT27 NT66 (Wait, but NT95 is already defined; maybe I misread. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, perhaps I can list all the NTs and their rules:\n\n1. NT74: NT9 NT66\n2. NT63: NT94 NT22\n3. NT95: NT9 NT69\n4. NT19: NT37 NT69\n5. NT65: NT38 NT84\n6.

{"custom_id":"request-878","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string that I need to determine if it's generated by the grammar. Hmm, let me first try to understand the grammar structure and the string.\n\nThe grammar is given in a somewhat complex form, with a bunch of rules. Each non-terminal (like S, NT6, NT74, etc.) produces pairs of terminals or other non-terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all the rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't12', 't77', etc. Each part of the string starts with 't' and a number, and some parts have spaces, but in this case, it's all concatenated without spaces. So the string is t12 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t97 t40 t77 t87 t53 t3 t96 t36 t53 t13 t96 t67 t83 t76 t25 t97 t95 t25 t97 t25 t97 t79 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t26 t96 t36 t53 t13 t96 t67 t79 t67 t64 t67 t94.\n\nWait, no, actually, upon closer inspection, the string is written with spaces separating the 't' components, like 't12 t77 t87 t53...', but each 't' part is a separate token. So each of these is a separate symbol. So the string is made up of a sequence of these 'tX' symbols.\n\nWait, no, maybe I misread. Let me look again. The string is written as `t12 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t97 t40 t77 t87 t53 t3 t96 t36 t53 t13 t96 t67 t83 t76 t25 t97 t95 t25 t97 t25 t97 t79 t36 t53 t77 t36 t53 t26 t96 t36 t53 t13 t96 t67 t79 t67 t64 t67 t94`.\n\nI think each of these is a separate token, so the string is a list of these 48 tokens.\n\nBut in context-free grammars, each step of the derivation produces a single symbol, either a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form allows each production to be two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation starts at the start symbol and breaks down into symbols, eventually replacing non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals. So the generated string is a sequence of terminals, with the non-terminals expanded into sequences of terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo to check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S by repeatedly applying the productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so manually checking each step would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern or see if each 'tX' in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal is defined as a combination of two other non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals seem to be 't' followed by two digits, like 't12', 't77', etc. But looking at the grammar, some of the right-hand sides (RHS) have terminals like `t12`, but others have combinations of non-terminals, like `NT65 -> NT38 NT84`.\n\nWait, but in the grammar rules, every production either has two non-terminals or a terminal. So the way the string is structured, each 'tX' must correspond to either a terminal or be expanded from a non-terminal that eventually produces that 'tX' through a series of steps.\n\nWait, but the string consists of 48 tokens, each being a 'tX' where X is two digits. Let me see if the grammar rules produce such 'tX's as terminals or if they generate strings that, when combined, form these 'tX's.\n\nWait, looking more closely at the grammar rules, some rules have terminals like 't12', 't44', etc. For example, NT2 -> 't9', NT34 -> 't36', and so on. But the string to evaluate has 'tX's that are two digits each, not necessarily matching any of these terminals directly.\n\nWait no, some of the rules have terminals. For example, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9'\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't16'\n- NT63 -> 't36'\n- NT15 -> 't94'\n- NT69 -> 't67'\n- NT46 -> 't28'\n- NT66 -> 't96'\n- NT79 -> 't27'\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't70'\n- NT36 -> 't64'\n- NT56 -> 't72'\n- NT69 -> 't13'\n- NT87 -> 't98'\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n- NT38 -> 't68'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT46 -> 't87'\n- NT39 -> 't58'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT34 -> 't36'\n- NT58 -> 't46'\n- NT44 -> 't83'\n- NT55 -> 't92'\n- NT39 -> 't63'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> 't84'\n- NT80 -> 't22'\n- NT38 -> 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't44'\n- NT8 -> 't12'\n- NT74 -> 't77'\n- NT84 -> 't40'\n- NT39 -> 't26'\n- NT27 -> 't7'\n- NT62 -> 't97'\n- NT85 -> 't76'\n- NT93 -> 't95'\n- NT85 -> 't58'\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n- NT79 -> 't67'\n- NT84 -> 't55'\n- NT74 -> 't8'\n- NT36 -> 't79'\n- NT17 -> 't96'\n- NT65 -> 't82'\n- NT93 -> 't39'\n- NT38 -> 't74'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- And some more...\n\nWait, so several rules have terminals. For example, NT8 -> 't12' is one of them. So 't12' is a terminal that's directly produced by NT8.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't12'. So that must come from NT8. Then the next is 't77', which comes from NT73 or NT94. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT94 -> 't77'\n\nSo 't77' is produced by NT94.\n\nNext is 't87'. Looking at the rules, NT87 isn't directly a terminal; instead, let's see which non-terminals can produce 't87':\n\nLooking through the rules, the rule NT82 -> 't53' is one that has a terminal on RHS. Wait, but I don't see any rule where 't87' is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me check all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nNT8 -> 't12'\n\nNT95 -> 't95' when? Looking back:\n\nWait, some non-terminals have terminals as their RHS. Let me list all the terminals:\n\n- 't9' from NT2\n- 't77' from NT94\n- 't25' from NT73\n- 't16' from NT79\n- 't36' from NT63\n- 't94' from NT15\n- 't67' from NT69\n- 't27' from NT79\n- 't4' from NT27\n- 't68' from NT38\n- 't87' from NT87 (but wait, is there a rule for NT87?)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where the RHS"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and I remember that CNF grammars have productions where each right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Let me start by understanding the structure here.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S. Its production is NT6 NT58. So the string must start with whatever these non-terminals can produce. The string given starts with t25 and then t97, which are probably from the productions of NT94 or something similar.\n\nI'll list out the non-terminals and their productions to see if there's a pattern or a way to trace back to S.\n\nNT77 is produced by NT95, which in turn is produced by NT9 and NT69. NT69 produces NT84 and NT13. Wait, looking at the string, I see t63 and t36. Oh, NT63 is t63 from the production of NT95.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step.

Oh, looking at the productions, NT69 is t69, produced by NT34 and NT93. Wait, no, the way the productions are written, each rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. So, for example, NT2 -> 't9', which is a terminal production.\n\nSo, looking for t25: in the rules, I see NT77 is 't77'? Wait, no, no T, because the rules like NT77 -> 't77' are given.

{"custom_id":"request-895","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is pretty long, so I'll need to methodically walk through it. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar rules to make it easier to refer to. The grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58. So, the string must start with NT6 and NT58. Let me check the given string:\n\nIt starts with t25 t97 t40 t14 t87 t53 t8 t14 t87 t53 t13 t96 t63 t94 t67 t82 t39 t3 t74 t40 t39 t77 t87 t53 t8 t77 t87 t53 t8 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t36 t53 t8 t72 t13 t16 t70 t58 t94 t13 t63 t94 t13.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t25, which comes from NT79 because looking at the rules, NT79 -> t27. Wait, no, in the rules, NT79 is actually the start of some terminals. Let me confirm the rules. Oh wait, in the rules, NT79 is not shown, but in the string, we have t79. Looking through the rules, I see NT79 -> t27, but in the string, it's t25. So the first token, t25, doesn't directly match any terminal rule. Hmm, that could be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I got the rules wrong. Let me look again. Oh, in the rules, I see NT94 -> 't77', NT73 -> 't25', etc. So t25 is from NT73. So the first part of the string starts with t25, which is NT73. So the first production is NT73.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT73 -> NT77 NT73? Wait no, looking at the rules, I think I need to parse the string step by step. Let's think about the structure.\n\nThe string starts with t25, which is the terminal 't73' (wait, no: looking back, the rules say NT73 -> 't25'). So the first production must be NT73. So S starts with NT73, which is 't25', and then another part. But wait, S is NT6 NT58, so the entire string must be built from S, which is two non-terminals: NT6 and NT58.\n\nWait, no, the entire string is a sequence of terminals. So S must derive to a string of terminals. So S is NT6 NT58. So the string must be built from NT6 and NT58.\n\nSo let's parse the string by breaking it down into NT6 and NT58, each of which will be a non-terminal that can be expanded into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the first symbol: t25 is 't73', so that's NT73. Looking at the rules, NT73 is not a non-terminal; it's a terminal. Wait, no, the rules show NT73 -> 't25', which is a terminal. So the first production is NT73 -> t25. So the first part is t25.\n\nNext, looking for where t25 appears. Wait, the string after t25 is t97 t40 t14 t87 t53 t8 t14 t87 t53 t13 t96 t63 t94 t67 t82 t39 t3 t74 t40 t39 t77 t87 t53 t8 t77 t87 t53 t8 t14 t87 t53 t26 t96 t36 t53 t8 t72 t13 t16 t70 t58 t94 t13 t63 t94 t13.\n\nBut I think I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe entire string must be derived from S, which is NT6 NT58. So, the string is t25 followed by other symbols. Let's see.\n\nWait, S -> NT6 NT58, so the first production is NT6 and NT58. So the string starts with NT6 and NT58. Let's see what NT6 and NT58 can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT6 -> NT73 NT62 (from rule NT6: NT6 -> NT73 NT62). So NT6 can expand into NT73 and NT62, each of which are non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 -> NT84 NT9 (from rule NT58: NT58 -> NT84 NT9). So NT58 expands into NT84 and NT9.\n\nSo the string will start with NT6 (NT73 NT62) followed by NT58 (NT84 NT9), but wait no: in the grammar, S -> NT6 NT58, which is a single rule, so the entire string is a concatenation of the expansion of NT6 and NT58.\n\nBut each of these can be multiple symbols, so the string is built as a sequence of symbols resulting from expanding NT6 and NT58.\n\nI think this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use a recursive descent parser or apply the Earley algorithm to parse the string against the grammar. Alternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each rule is a binary production, so we can use that structure.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to look for conflicts or impossibilities directly. Let's see.\n\nThe first symbol is t25, which comes from NT73. Looking at the rules, NT73 -> 't25', which is a terminal. So that makes sense. Now, what comes after t25? The next symbol is t97. \n\nBut NT73 is a terminal, so the parser must have advanced past it. The next non-terminal would be the next symbol, which is t97, but in this grammar, the production rules only produce non-terminals and terminals, so the next symbol must be another non-terminal or terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must result from a rule that expands a non-terminal into that terminal, or perhaps a combination of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut in this case, S starts with NT6 and NT58. So the entire string must be the expansion of NT6 followed by NT58, each of which can be sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nBut each non-terminal in the grammar can only expand into two non-terminals, except for some that directly expand into terminals.\n\nLet me try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT6 and NT58. Let's define the first part as NT6 and the second part as NT58.\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nSo, the first part is NT73 and NT62.\n\nNT73 -> 't25' (terminal), so after expanding NT73, we get t25. Next, NT62 can be expanded. Looking at the rules, NT62 -> NT84 NT62. Wait, no: looking at the rules, NT62 is not present as a non-terminal. Wait, let's check the rules again.\n\nWait, the grammar seems a bit confusing because some rules are written as NT followed by numbers and letters, but perhaps I need to correct that. Wait, in the rules, it's written as NT73 -> ... etc., but I think the actual non-terminals are just NT followed by numbers, like NT73, NT62, etc. So I'll treat them as separate non-terminals.\n\nSo NT62 -> NT84 NT62? No, I don't see such a rule. Let me check:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT62 -> NT73 NT67 (I think), but let me confirm.\n\nYes, in the rules: NT62 -> NT73 NT67, which is written as 'NT62 -> NT73 NT67'.\n\nSo, expanding NT62, we get NT73 and NT67.\n\nBut NT73 is 't25' (terminal), and NT67 is another non-terminal that can expand.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT67 -> 't53' (from the rules: NT67 -> 't53'). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT67 -> 't53', which is a terminal. So the expansion of NT62 would be 't25' followed by NT67, which is 't53'. So the string so far is t25 t25 t53...?\n\nWait, no, because S is NT6 NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-899","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to figure out if they can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. CNF typically has each production replacing a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see that most of the productions are non-terminals on the left and two parts on the right, some of which end up being terminals. For example, NT73 -> 't25' means NT73 directly produces the terminal 't25'. Similarly, NT2 -> 't9' and NT2 -> 't6' show that NT2 can produce terminals 't9' or 't6'. This is helpful because it means when building the parse tree, certain nodes will directly correspond to terminals, and others will split into further non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived by expanding the start symbol S and breaking down the string into the possible productions. The string is:\n\n`t12 t36 t53 t77 t87 t53 t13 t96 t96 t77 t87 t53 t3 t96 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t26 t94 t13 t63 t94 t13 t97 t36 t39 t36 t53 t77 t87 t53 t8 t3 t63 t94 t13 t96 t26 t67 t67 t83 t72 t4 t96 t94`.\n\nThat's quite a long string. My approach will be to look for possible productions that can generate these terminals, starting from the beginning.\n\nLet's start with the first few tokens.\n\nThe first terminal is 't12'. Looking into the grammar, I need to find a production that results in 't12'. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't12'. Checking all productions, the ones that produce a terminal are:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9' or 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't26'\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- And others like NT46, NT94, etc., but none produce 't12'.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, I remember that in the grammar, some non-terminals might eventually lead to terminals through other productions. So 't12' must be the result of expanding some non-terminal that eventually becomes 't12' through a series of steps.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't12'. So maybe 't12' has to be part of a longer production chain. Since in CNF, each step produces two symbols, perhaps the first symbol in the string is part of a larger expansion.\n\nBut wait, 't12' is the first symbol. The only way it can appear is if it's the result of a non-terminal that produces 't12' directly, but in the given grammar, I don't see any such production. So that suggests that the grammar doesn't generate 't12' since it's not present in any production. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar, so the answer is \"No\".\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check. I might have missed a production. Let's go through all the productions again to see if I missed one that produces 't12'. \n\nLooking through all NT definitions:\n\n- NT74 -> NT9 NT66, etc.\nWait, let me compile a list of all productions where RHS is a terminal:\n\nFrom the given production list:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT77 -> 't77' (I think I saw NT66 -> 't96'? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the list, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me list all NT productions that produce terminals:\n\nGoing through each line:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25'\n- NT94 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't6'\nWait, no, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for any where RHS is a single terminal:\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, most RHS are either two NTs or a mix. Only some are terminals:\n\nWait, wait a minute, the user provided the grammar and the string. Let me make sure I correctly parse the grammar.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT58, which are two non-terminals. Let's check for any terminal productions:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT40\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT93\n- NT73 -> 't25' \u2014 wait, no, looking through all the NT productions, are there any that produce a terminal? Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through each NT production:\n\n- NT73 -> 't25' \u2014 no, NT73 -> 't77'\n- Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, actually, the only NT that directly produce terminals are those with RHS as a single terminal. From the list:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nWait, no, the provided grammar seems to have all NT productions with two non-terminals as RHS or mixing NTs and terminals.\n\nWait a second: For example, looking at line 7: NT65 -> NT38 NT84 \u2014 that's a mix. NT66 -> 't96' \u2014 no, NT66 -> 't67'; wait, let me look.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each production:\n\nLooking for any NT with a production where RHS is a single terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't9', 't70', 't6'\n\nWait, line 11: NT2 -> NT44 NT14\n\nLine 12: NT85 -> NT95 NT55\n\nNo, I'm looking for RHS as a terminal. Let me go through each production line for each NT.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more accurate to re-express.\n\nNT73 -> 't77' \u2014 no, looking again, no. Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me see.\n\nWait, wait, the user provided a huge list of productions, but perhaps the actual terminal symbols are only those where the production ends with a single terminal. So for example, NT22 -> 't87' \u2014 no, that's not in the list. Wait, perhaps looking for NT with productions that result in terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the only terminal symbols in the grammar are those that appear at the end of productions, such as 't9', 't77', 't25', etc. So, to check if 't12' is a terminal, I need to see if any NT production directly produces 't12'.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I don't see any production where RHS is 't12'. Therefore, the grammar doesn't have any rule that directly generates 't12' as a terminal. \n\nSince the first symbol in the string is 't12', and the grammar doesn't have a production that directly produces 't12', we can conclude that the string is not generated by this grammar. Because the grammar can only produce strings composed of the terminals that appear in its productions, and 't12' isn't one of them.\n\nWait, hold on, am I missing something? Did I overlook a production that could eventually lead to 't12'? For example, in the grammar, is 't12' reachable through some expansion? But 't12' isn't a terminal in any production, so it can't be generated directly or indirectly.

{"custom_id":"request-913","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is quite long, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar consists of a set of productions where each non-terminal (like S, NT74, etc.) eventually leads to a terminal symbol (like t followed by a number). Some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, while others produce two non-terminals which themselves eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t12 t26 t84 t55 t14 t87 t53 t36 t53 t77 t4 t96 t64 t96 t4 t96 t98 t92 t12 t36 t53 t8 t58 t12 t26 t97 t27 t83 t58 t12 t26 t84 t64 t4 t96 t94 t84 t76 t96 t96 t12 t14 t87 t53 t67 t96 t84 t79`\n\nI should start by breaking down the grammar and seeing if each part of the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S -> NT6 NT58. So S splits into two non-terminals, NT6 and NT58. Each of these will need to produce a terminal that's part of the string.\n\nNext, I see that NT6 has a production NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62. NT73 has a production NT73 -> NT8 NT9, which then each split further. I think I'll need to traverse this tree to see what terminals they produce.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 has a production NT58 -> NT84 NT9. NT84 -> NT34 NT93, and so on. Each non-terminal eventually leads to terminal symbols, which are mostly 't' followed by a number. Some non-terminals map directly to a single 't' number, while others depend on other non-terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string step by step, checking each production. Each step should reduce the string from the start symbol towards the end, ensuring that each production is matched correctly.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. The string starts with t12. Looking at the grammar, the only non-terminal that directly produces t12 is NT44 -> 't83' (which doesn't help) and other non-terminals. Wait, actually, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT34 -> 't36', etc. I need to check which non-terminals produce t12.\n\nLooking at the given productions, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t12 yet. Let me check each production rule. Oh, wait, I see NT68 -> 't63' (t63 is in the string later), but not t12. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me go through each non-terminal's production that directly produces a terminal:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9' (from NT2 productions)\nNT40 \u2192 't69' (from NT40)\nNT94 \u2192 't14')\nNT2 \u2192 't70'\nNT36 \u2192 't64'\nNT56 \u2192 't72'\nNT69 \u2192 't13'\nNT87 \u2192 't98'\nNT27 \u2192 't4'\nNT38 \u2192 't68'\nNT9 \u2192 't26'\nNT46 \u2192 't87'\nNT39 \u2192 't58'\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\nNT34 \u2192 't36'\nNT58 \u2192 't46'\nNT44 \u2192 't83'\nNT55 \u2192 't92'\nNT17 \u2192 't96'\nNT65 \u2192 't82'\nNT93 \u2192 't95'\nNT85 \u2192 't76'\nNT74 \u2192 't8'\nNT36 \u2192 't79' (Wait, but earlier I saw NT36 has another production. Let me check the list.)\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT36: NT6 -> NT73 NT62 (so that's how NT6 is broken down), and also NT34 -> 't36', NT58 -> etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some NT nodes directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT28 -> 't38' etc.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t12. I need to see if any non-terminals produce t12.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't immediately see any non-terminals that directly produce t12. So maybe I need to see if any non-terminals can derive to 't12'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake because I might have missed some productions. Let's go through the list again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT2: 't9', 't70', 't6'\nNT36: 't36', 't79'\nNT58: 't46', 't53', 't98'\nNT17: 't96'\nNT65: 't82'\nNT93: 't95'\nNT85: 't76', 't92'\nNT74: 't8'\nNT84: 't40', 't96', 't55'\nNT39: 't58', 't63'\nNT84: 't55', 't64', 't76'\nNT97: 't27'\nWait, maybe this is getting too confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by parsing the string step by step, reducing symbols using the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the entire string.\n\nBut this approach might take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps the string has a pattern that each part of it is generated by a sequence of productions. Maybe I can see if the productions form a chain that matches the required order.\n\nWait, let's take the first token: t12. Since there's no NT that directly produces t12, perhaps it's generated by a longer chain.\n\nFor example, does any non-terminal produce T12 as a terminal? Looking at the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces t12.\n\nWait, let's check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the given NT productions, I don't see any that produce t12 directly. Is there an NT that can produce t12 through several steps?\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the structure of the grammar.\n\nFor example, starting from S: S -> NT6 NT58. So the entire string must be generated as NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nNow, let's see what NT6 and NT58 produce.\n\nNT6: NT6 -> NT73 NT62.\n\nSo NT6 splits into NT73 and NT62.\n\nNT73: NT73 -> NT8 NT9.\n\nSo NT73 is NT8 followed by NT9.\n\nNT8: NT8-> NT74 NT15.\n\nSo NT8 is NT74 NT15.\n\nNT74: As per the given productions, NT74 is 't8'\u2014so that's a terminal.\n\nNT15: NT15-> NT94.\n\nSo NT15 is NT94, which is 't94'.\n\nSo combining: NT8 is 't8' 't94'.\n\nThen NT73 is NT8 followed by NT9, which we'll get to.\n\nNext, NT62: NT62-> NT97 NT66.\n\nNT97-> 't27'.\n\nNT66-> 't96'.\n\nSo NT62 is 't27' and 't96'.\n\nPutting it all together, NT6 is:\n\nNT73 is 't8' 't94' followed by NT62 't27' 't96' \u2192 So NT6 \u2192 't8 t94 t27 t96'\n\nWait, but the first token in the string is 't12', which doesn't appear here. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should start with the start symbol, S, and recursively try to expand until I reach the string.\n\nBut this might take a while. Maybe it's better to see if the string can be formed by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production in the grammar leads to certain terminals, and the string is a combination of these.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t12, t26, t84, t55, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the production chain for S, the initial symbols after S are NT6 and NT58, which produce 't8 t94 t27 t96' and NT58.\n\nNT58: NT58-> NT84 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-917","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens, all in the form 't' followed by a number. I'll start by understanding the grammar and the process to derive the string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals and productions. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminals here look like 't' followed by a number, except for a few that are just single letters or numbers, but I think in this case, all terminals are 't' followed by digits.\n\nThe grammar has a start symbol 'S' which produces NT6 and NT58, because S \u2192 NT6 NT58. Both NT6 and NT58 are non-terminals that need to be expanded further.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT6 expands to NT73 NT62, and NT58 expands to NT84 NT9. Similarly, NT9 expands to NT68 NT40, which in turn expand further. It's clear that each non-terminal branches into two more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nI also notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminal strings: for example, NT73 \u2192 't97' and NT84 \u2192 't40'. So these are the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt12 t3 t84 t46 t82 t95 t14 t87 t53 t14 t87 t53 t14 t87 t53 t8 t36 t53 t67 t96 t63 t94 t13 t96 t36 t53 t3 t96 t72 t26 t94 t67 t96 t36 t53 t3 t96 t3 t26 t94 t67 t13 t67 t83 t72 t7 t96 t94.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual tokens:\n\nt12, t3, t84, t46, t82, t95, t14, t87, t53, t14, t87, t53, t14, t87, t53, t8, t36, t53, t67, t96, t63, t94, t13, t96, t36, t53, t3, t96, t72, t26, t94, t67, t96, t36, t53, t3, t96, t3, t26, t94, t67, t13, t67, t83, t72, t7, t96, t94.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from S using the grammar rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step produces only two symbols. So the derivation would build the string in a way that each part is built up from smaller parts, and so on, until the whole string is formed.\n\nBut considering the number of tokens, it's quite long, which suggests that the string might be derived from a series of productions that each break down into smaller parts until the terminals appear.\n\nI'll start from the beginning:\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nLet's see what each of these produces.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nNT73 \u2192 t97 (from the given productions: NT73 \u2192 't97'). Wait, but in the string, the first token is t12, not t97. Hmm, that's a problem. Because S starts with NT6, which expands to NT73 NT62, and NT73 immediately produces t97. But the string starts with t12. That suggests that perhaps the initial assumption about the expansion is incorrect, or maybe I need to find a different path for NT73 or NT62 to produce t12.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking back, I see NT73 \u2192 't97'. That's correct. But the first token is t12. So either the initial derivation path is wrong, or perhaps there's another production for NT73 or NT62 that I haven't considered.\n\nWait, let me check NT62. NT62 \u2192 't97' and 't84' and 't62'? Wait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT84 NT62. That seems like a problem. Wait, no, let's look again.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nWait, I see NT62 \u2192 't84' and NT62 \u2192 't97'.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. From the initial provided grammar:\n\nNo, wait in the given grammar, under NT62, it says: NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT67. So it's NT62 splitting into NT84 and NT67.\n\nBut earlier, NT62 is part of the expansion of NT6, which is S's first step.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nThe grammar given is a bit messy, but for example, the part under NT6 is: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62.\n\nAnd under NT62: looking for any rules, I see:\n\nWait, the provided grammar is:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\n\nAnd then, from the given list:\n\nNT73 \u2192 t97\n\nWait, so NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Then NT73 is a terminal 't97'. But that's not matching the string's first token, which is t12.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing another production for NT6 or NT62.\n\nWait, checking the provided grammar:\n\nNo, wait, according to the provided grammar, the rules are:\n\nLooking for where NT73 appears. It's here:\n\nNT73 \u2192 t97\n\nBut I don't see any other rules for NT73. So NT73 only has that production.\n\nSimilarly, for NT62: checking the provided grammar, I don't see any rules except a mistake earlier. Wait, looking through the provided grammar, I see that some NT62's are written as \u2192 't97' or other terminals.\n\nWait, but in the provided list, I don't see NT62 having a production that directly produces a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nWait, is there a rule for NT62? For example, does it have NT62 \u2192 't97'? Let me check the provided list.\n\nNo, looking through, for example:\n\nNope, I don't see NT62 having a production that results in a terminal. The closest is under NT6, which is NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, and NT62 is further split into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe NT62 \u2192 't97'? Or is there another way to get t12?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking for all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT37 NT69\n\nBut no, not terminals. Hmm. Wait, let me look through the productions again carefully.\n\nLooking through the provided list, the terminal strings are when a non-terminal directly expands to a 't' followed by a number. So any rule that is A \u2192 't84' or A \u2192 't12' would be a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I can see several:\n\nNT79 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, wait, looking again at the last line:\n\nThe end is:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't95'\n\nNT85 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT67 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't67'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't55'\n\nNT74 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT65 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT93 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't74'\n\nWait, but in the list, perhaps more:\n\nLooking through, I notice:\n\nNT84 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT94 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I think somewhere in the list, 't12' appears as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-941","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is quite long, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The start symbol here is S, and it seems to involve NTs like NT6, NT74, etc., and some terminals like 't9' and 't25'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol S produces NT6 and NT58. So, any string generated will start with whatever terminal or NT6 and NT58 expand to. Looking at the productions, both NT6 and NT58 seem to lead to other NTs until they reach a terminal symbol.\n\nLet's look at the productions for NT6 and NT58:\n\nNT6 -> NT73 NT62\nNT58 -> NT84 NT9\nAnd so on. Each of these NTs eventually breaks down into terminals like 't25', 't84', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't's followed by numbers. The first thing I notice is that each non-terminal in the grammar must expand into exactly two terminal symbols because it's in CNF. The given string starts with 't25', which is a terminal, so that must come from an NT production that directly has a terminal on one side. Let's check the productions for each 't' to see if there's a corresponding NT rule that leads to that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT79 -> 't16' and NT69 -> 't67', but many of the NTs have two non-terminals on the right. The initial S produces NT6 and NT58. So, to find out if the string is generated, I can try to trace each 't' back through the grammar to see if they can be produced by the NTs.\n\nLet's start with the first 't25'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT73 -> 't25' (from NT73 -> 't25'). So, NT73 must produce 't25'. Now, NT73 is used in some productions, like NT6 -> NT73 NT62, which means NT73 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by 't25' and another NT.\n\nNext, the second token is 't84'. Looking at NT84, I see NT84 -> 't40' and other productions, but to have 't84' as a terminal, I think I need to check if any NT leads to 't84' directly. Wait, in the given rules, NT84 is rewritten as NT34 and NT93, but looking deeper, NT34 is rewritten as NT58 and NT65, which further go down. So maybe 't84' comes from NT83 or something else? Wait, no, looking through, I don't see any production for any NT directly expanding to 't84'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's see: NT84's productions include NT34 and NT93. NT34 is replaced with NT58 and NT65, and NT93 is replaced with NT95 and NT6. Wait, NT6, according to the rules, does NT6 -> NT73 NT62, which then leads to 't25' and other NTs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Instead of breaking down the entire string, perhaps I should see if each 't' is consistently generated. Let's check for each 't' the possible NTs:\n\n- 't25' comes from NT73.\n- 't84' \u2013 looking through the rules, do any NT lead directly to 't84'? From the rules given, NT84 is replaced by NT34 and NT93. Neither of these lead directly to 't84', but they go further. For example, NT34 -> NT58 NT65. NT58 -> NT84 NT9, so if there's an NT84, it breaks into NT34 and NT65, which continue the chain.\n\nWait, that's cyclic. So maybe NT84 leads to a loop, which would mean that 't84' can't be directly produced by any NT, only by a chain that might loop back. So perhaps the string can't contain 't84' at all because it's not the result of a direct terminal expansion from any NT.\n\nBut in the string, the second token is 't84', so this would be a red flag. So if 't84' is in the string and it's a terminal, the grammar doesn't have a rule where any NT directly leads to 't84', so the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way for NT84 to ultimately derive 't84' through multiple steps. Let me trace it:\n\nLooking at NT84, it's replaced by NT34 and NT93.\n\nNT34: NT58 and NT65.\n\nNT58: NT84 and NT9.\n\nSo, NT84 (A) -> NT34 (B) and NT93 (C).\n\nNT34 (B) -> NT58 (D) and NT65 (E).\n\nNT58 (D) -> NT84 (A) and NT9 (F).\n\nNT65 (E) -> NT38 and NT82, I think. Wait, looking back, NT65 -> NT38 NT82. So NT65 becomes NT38 (G) and NT82 (H).\n\nNT38 (G) was replaced by 't68' and NT2? Wait, let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking at NT38: NT38 -> 't68' and NT2? Wait, no, looking at the list:\n\nNT38 -> 't68' NT2? Or maybe someone else.

{"custom_id":"request-939","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because each rule starts with a non-terminal and is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So that's reassuring because CNF has nice properties, especially for parsing, but in this case, I'm just checking for derivation.\n\nThe productions are all quite long and complex, so maybe I should look for starting symbols and see how the string can be parsed according to these rules. The starting symbol is S, which goes to NT6 NT58. So the string should start with the first non-terminal producing NT6 and the second NT58. Let me see the string: it starts with t25 t97... Hmm, wait, t25 is a terminal, and in the grammar, NT73 goes to t25. So that could be a start, but I need to see how the rest unfolds.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string from left to right, looking for possible ways to split into grammar productions. But with such a long string, that might take a while. Alternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string can be derived from the rightmost non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model each part as a series of production steps. Let me think about possible pathways. Starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58, so the first step is to split the string into two parts, one from NT6 and another from NT58. But NT6 in the grammar can go to t73 and t62, because looking at the productions, NT68 \u2192 t63, but wait, in the given grammar, NT6 has a production: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. Oh wait, in the grammar provided, under NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. So NT6 can be split into NT73 and NT62, each of which can be further split into terminals or other non-terminals?\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for the start rule. The initial production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string should start with NT6 and NT58. Let me look at the first few tokens.\n\nThe string is: t25 t97 t40 t14 t87 t53 t36 t53 t13 t96 t96 t4 t96 t95 t25 t84 t25 t97 t39 t12 t77 t87 t53 t8 t3 t74 t39 t25 t26 t94 t63 t94 t28 t94 t67 t97 t12 t36 t53 t26 t96 t72 t97 t16 t70 t49 t40 t95 t3.\n\nSo, the first part is t25. From the grammar, I see that NT73 can produce t25, as one of the productions is NT73 \u2192 t25. So t25 could be the result of NT73, meaning that part of S's production is covered.\n\nBut wait, S is NT6 NT58. So perhaps the initial part is NT6 and NT58. Let's see what NT58 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT58 \u2192 t46, or does it? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT58, there are two rules:\n- NT58 \u2192 t46\n- Also, looking through the list, there's NT58 \u2192 t46.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar includes \"NT58 -> t46\". So yes, NT58 can produce t46 directly.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t25, so that would require that NT58 produces t25, but wait, in the grammar, looking for NT58: yes, NT58 \u2192 t46. So that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the starting point. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, actually, the starting symbol S is NT6 NT58. So the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string starts with the output of NT6 and NT58. So the first part is the output of NT6, and the second part is the output of NT58.\n\nSo let me check the first few tokens. The string starts with t25 t97. So the first part is t25, the second part is t97.\n\nWhat can produce t25? Looking at the grammar, NT73 \u2192 t25 is a production. So perhaps NT6 is producing t25. Wait, but NT6 doesn't have a production for t25 in the given grammar. Wait, let me check: from the list, under NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62. There's no rule like NT6 \u2192 t25. So unless NT73 can produce t25, which it can, then NT6 can be NT73 NT62. But then NT6 would be expanding into something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me approach this differently. Since S \u2192 NT6 NT58, the string should be generated by first generating NT6 and then NT58.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts: the first part generated by NT6 and the second part by NT58.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nStart: t25 t97...\nEnd: ...40 95 t3.\n\nSo the first part is t25, t97, t40, t14, t87, t53, t36, t53, t13, t96, t96, t4, t96, t95.\n\nWait, but NT58 can produce t46, as per the grammar. The second part of the string is longer, so perhaps NT58 is generating a longer sequence. But in the string, after t25, the second part is t97, which is part of the NT58 production.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first part is NT6, which must generate a certain string, and the second part is NT58, which must generate another string. The entire input string should be the concatenation of these two parts.\n\nLooking at the input string: the first token is t25, which would correspond to NT6 generating t25? But in the grammar, NT6 only has a production to NT73 and NT62, not to a terminal like t25. Therefore, this seems impossible because NT6 cannot directly produce t25. So that suggests that the string is invalid because the first token is t25, which can't be produced by NT6.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong because NT73 produces t25. So maybe the NT6 generates NT73, which then produces t25. So let's see: S \u2192 NT6 NT58. NT6 \u2192 NT73 NT62, so the output would be the concatenation of NT73's output and NT62's output, which starts with t25 followed by whatever NT62 produces.\n\nIn the given string, the second token is t97, but in the initial steps, t25 is followed by t97. If NT6 starts with t25, the next part is t97, but is t97 in NT73's output? Let me check: in the grammar, NT73 \u2192 t25, so no, NT73 doesn't produce t97. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string isn't starting correctly because NT6's first production is NT73 NT62, each of which could generate their own sequences. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through the entire string and see if I can find the starting point correctly. Let me see: the string starts with t25, which as I established, can only be produced by NT73. So perhaps S must produce NT73 followed by NT58, but S's production is NT6 and NT58. Hmm, this seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to parse the string differently. Let me try to parse from the end or see if the string can be split into sequences that fit certain productions.\n\nWait, let me list all possible productions that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, several NT rules produce terminals:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 t77\n- NT73 \u2192 t25\n- NT69 \u2192 t67\n- NT79 \u2192 t16\n- NT95 \u2192 t27\n- NT66 \u2192 t96\n- NT59 \u2192 NT63 NT67?

{"custom_id":"request-955","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. The provided grammar has production rules where each non-terminal on the left side of an arrow produces two non-terminals on the right. The start symbol seems to be S, as the first rule is S -> NT6 NT58. My goal is to see if the given string can be produced by this grammar.\n\nThe string in question is: t12 t77 t87 t53 t36 t53 t3 t96 t4 t96 t95 t12 t3 t84 t12 t26 t84 t67 t83 t26 t63 t94 t13 t74 t39 t22 t28 t94 t13 t58 t12 t36 t53 t13 t96 t84 t94 t96 t77 t87 t53 t67 t96 t63 t94 t67 t97 t36 t39 t3.\n\nSo, my task is to check if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each step of derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, except when a terminal is produced. So the string must be constructed by a series of such steps, with the initial symbol S and eventually leading to the terminals in the string.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string and see if it aligns with the production rules. Let's try to do this by finding sequences in the string that match the right-hand sides (RHS) of the grammar's production rules.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t12, t77, t87, t53, t36, t53, t3, t96, t4, t96, t95, t12,...\n\nLet me see if these can be formed from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI know from the grammar that S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the first production starts with S, which becomes NT6 and NT58. So the string starts with these two, which likely correspond to t12 and t77.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t12, then t77. So that matches S \u2192 NT6 NT58, which is probably t12 (NT6) and t77 (NT58).\n\nNow, let's check NT6. Looking at the given grammar, I see that NT6 is defined as NT63 NT62. So, NT6 \u2192 NT63 NT62. Therefore, t12 would be split into t36 and t53 (assuming NT63 is t36 and NT62 is t53, but wait, the actual derivation would be sequential, so it's more about the order). Wait, no, in the string, t12 is the first token, which is produced by NT6, which itself must have been split into NT63 and NT62, giving t36 and t53.\n\nLooking at the string, after t12 comes t77, then t87, t53, t36, etc. So after t12 (NT6 \u2192 NT63 NT62), the next tokens would be t36 and t53, but in the string it's t77, t87, t53, t36. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to represent the string as a series of steps, where each step expands a non-terminal into two others, eventually leading to the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the sequence of non-terminals needed to derive the string and see if each step is valid.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be covered by the grammar's productions, step by step.\n\nLet me try to write down the string and see if I can parse it token by token using the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So the string starts as NT6 and NT58.\n\nBut each non-terminal can be further expanded. So each of these can become two non-terminals.\n\nLet me list all the production rules that lead to terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 t25, so NT73 can produce the terminal t25. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 t9, etc.\n\nSo perhaps I can build a parse tree in my mind.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent the string in terms of the non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t12, t77, t87, t53, t36, t53, t3, t96, t4, t96, t95, t12, t3, t84, t12, t26, t84, t67, t83, t26, t63, t94, t13, t74, t39, t22, t28, t94, t13, t58, t12, t36, t53, t13, t96, t84, t94, t96, t77, t87, t53, t67, t96, t63, t94, t67, t97, t36, t39, t3.\n\nThis is a long string. I need to find a way to break it down into the productions.\n\nLet's look for two terminals in a row that match any production's RHS where the non-terminal produces these two. For example, if there's a production A \u2192 t1 t2, then two consecutive ts could correspond to that.\n\nBut in our case, all productions produce two non-terminals, so each step in the derivation would introduce two new non-terminals. Therefore, each expansion of a non-terminal in the derivation adds more symbols.\n\nWait, but to generate a string, each expansion would replace a non-terminal with two others, which may themselves be non-terminals or terminals. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a sequence of terminals, trying to find segments that can be the result of some non-terminal's production.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe I can use a top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nSo the first two symbols should come from NT6 and NT58. In the string, the first two tokens are t12 and t77.\n\nSo does NT6 produce t12? Wait, in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT63 NT62. So NT6 is t36 and t53. So in the string, the first t12 must correspond to NT6's production? No, because NT6 itself is t36 and t53. So if the string starts with t12 (NT6), but NT6 is actually two non-terminals, this is a problem.\n\nWait no, the grammar is S \u2192 NT6 NT58. So S first produces NT6 and NT58. So the first two symbols of the string should be the first two parts of NT6 and NT58.\n\nLooking in the grammar, what is NT6 and NT58?\n\nFrom the given grammar rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT63 NT62.\n\nNT58 \u2192 t46.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, under NT6 \u2192 NT63 NT62. For NT58, the production is NT58 \u2192 t46. So in the string, the second symbol should be t46 if the grammar is correctly following.\n\nBut in the provided string, the first symbol is t12, the second is t77. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's recheck.\n\nLooking at the produced string, the first token is t12. Then the second is t77.\n\nIn the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT58.\n\nNow, when you derive, the NT6 and NT58 would each get processed further. So after S, you have NT6 NT58. Now, each non-terminal is expanded according to their production rules.\n\nSo NT6 \u2192 NT63 NT62. So when S \u2192 NT6 NT58, NT6 turns into NT63 and NT62, so now the string after expansion would have NT63 NT62 NT58.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 is a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT58's production: yes, in the given rules, NT58 \u2192 t46.\n\nSo if NT58 is a terminal, then after deriving, for example, S \u2192 NT6 NT58 would result in NT63 NT62 t46.\n\nBut in the string, the first two tokens are t12 and t77, so perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I got the steps wrong. Let me start from S and consider what it produces"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Some rules are direct terminals, like NT2 -> 't9', while others derive to combinations. \n\nI'll start by building the parse tree. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is t12. Looking at the grammar, NT8 -> 't12' according to one of the rules. So, the root is NT8.\n\n2. NT8's production is probably something that can generate t12. Wait, looking back, I think NT85 -> NT95 NT66 and NT84 -> NT34 NT93. Hmm, not directly. Wait, in the given rules, I don't see NT8 directly, but from the rules, perhaps NT8 comes from another production.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, I find NT84 -> NT34 NT93, which then might break down into terminals. But let's start again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT84 -> 't34' 't93' because looking at NT34 -> 't36' but maybe I'm confusing. Wait, no, NT34 is a non-terminal, but in the rules, NT34 -> NT58 NT65, which then might break down further. Let me check step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the root is S.

So perhaps the first few symbols belong to NT6.\n\nLooking for NT6's production: NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So NT6 is NT73 and NT62. \n\nLooking at the string: t12 t77 t87... So t12 is part of NT6. So t12 would be from NT73? Wait, let's see NT73's production. NT73 -> 't8' or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, NT73 -> 't8' or NT9. So if the next symbol is t77, perhaps that's from another non-terminal. Maybe after NT6 comes NT58.\n\nWait, S is NT6 NT58. So the first symbol should be from NT6, then the next symbols from NT58.\n\nLooking at the string: t12 (NT6?), t77? Let's see.\n\nWait, NT6 has production NT73 NT62.

So perhaps t12 from NT6 and t77 from NT58.\n\nLet's see: NT58's production is either NT84 NT9 or 't46' as a terminal?

Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules: Yes, for NT58, there's a rule NT58 -> 't46'.\n\nSo if after t12 comes t77, which would come from NT58 being 't46' \u2014 wait that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol t12 is from NT6, then the next part from NT58.\n\nBut NT6 -> NT73 NT62. So let's look at t12 as part of NT73 or NT62.\n\nLooking at NT73 -> 't8' or NT9.\n\nWait, but t12 is a terminal, so it must be produced by an NT that directly produces that terminal. Looking back, is there any NT that directly produces 't12'?\n\nYes, looking through the rules, yes: NT12. No, wait, wait. Let's check all the rules.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT34 -> 't36' (is that right?), but I'm looking for 't12'. Wait, no.

Looking through the production rules, I see:\n\nYes, NT8 -> 't12' \u2014 that's a direct production.\n\nSo S starts with NT6 and NT58. S -> NT6 NT58.\n\nSo the string starts with a symbol from NT6 and then another from NT58.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with t12 t77 t87...\n\nSo if the first part is from NT6, which is t12, then the next part must be from NT58.\n\nBut looking at NT58's productions, one is NT58 -> 't46', another is NT58 -> ... wait, let me check. Actually, in the given rules, NT58 seems to have multiple productions, but the terminal one is NT58 -> 't46'.\n\nSo after S, NT6 produces t12, and NT58 produces 't46'. But the second symbol is t77, not t46.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe the string starts with t12, t77... perhaps S is broken down differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the grammar.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT58. So the initial symbols must be from NT6 and NT58 in some order or as a pair.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t12, which is from NT8. But S is NT6 and NT58, so perhaps the t12 is from NT6 and the NT58 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the t12 is the first part of NT6, but then what about NT58's output?\n\nWait, let's try to see if the string can be split into factors from the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is not directly the start, but that can't be. The start is S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe each NT has a sequence of symbols that must correspond to its productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAssuming that S is NT6 followed by NT58.\n\nNT6 is NT73 NT62.\n\nSo the string starts with t12, which would have to come from NT6's first component, which is NT73.
