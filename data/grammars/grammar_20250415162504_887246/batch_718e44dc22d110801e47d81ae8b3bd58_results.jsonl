{"custom_id":"request-3","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I have to determine if the string `t58` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar seems a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals and productions. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. All the productions are in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except when non-terminals are replaced by terminals. For example, some productions directly map to 't' followed by a number. So, the string we're checking is `t58`, which means we need to see if we can derive this through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice instances where non-terminals end up producing specific terminal strings. For instance, `NT33` can produce 't76' and 't30', `NT30` leads to 't84', 't22', and 't10', and several others end with 't' and numbers.\n\nBut I'm specifically looking at `t58`, so I need to find a production that leads to 't58'. Let me scan the list of terminal productions:\n\n- `NT49` \u2192 't47'?\nWait, no, that's 't47', not 58. Let me check again. Wait, I see `NT33` can produce 't76' or 't30'. Hmm. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, I see `NT49` has `NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6`. But then `NT11` and `NT6` have their own productions. Let me map this out.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which produces NT48 NT11. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNow, I need to see what NT48 and NT11 can produce. Let's check NT48. Looking for NT48 productions: I see `NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6`. Okay, so NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. Then, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So that would lead to NT49 \u2192 (NT11 NT6) \u2192 NT11 and NT6.\n\nWait, but that might loop. Let me try to see if I can find a way to get to a terminal.\n\nLooking deeper, NT11 can produce NT41 NT49, which then leads to NT41 \u2192 't77' and NT49 \u2192 't47'. So NT41 \u2192 't77' (terminal) and NT49 \u2192 't47'. So if I can get to NT41 or NT49, which produce 't's. But I'm looking for 't58'.\n\nWait, let me check NT33. It can produce 't76' and 't30'. But I don't see NT33 directly in any production leading to 't58'. Maybe another path.\n\nLooking through the NTs, perhaps NT58 produces 't58' directly. Let me check: I see `NT58` in the grammar has a production `NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33`, and both NT31 and NT33 can produce terminals.\n\nWait, if I can get to NT58, then NT58 \u2192 't58' would produce the desired string. But how can we get to NT58?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see `NT58` is a non-terminal that starts with NT49, right? Wait, in the grammar, the production is `NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33`, and looking at NT58's entry, it's under NT49's productions? No, let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar as given starts with S, then lists all NT productions. I need to see where NT58 is. Looking through the list, I see:\n\n`NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6` and `NT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44`. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each NT production.\n\nWait, no, looking through the list, it's a bit confusing. Let me make a list of all NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT44: NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT13 | NT12 NT57 | NT6 NT58 | NT14 NT1 | NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33 | NT33 NT14 | NT55 NT... Hmm, I'm getting a bit lost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to try to see if there's a way to derive 't58' directly.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, I notice NT31 can produce 't8' and 't35' (looking at NT31's productions: `NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8 | NT8 NT35`). Similarly, NT33 can produce 't76' and 't30'.\n\nWait, so if I have NT31 in the string, and NT33 can follow, then combining their terminal productions could give us parts of the string.\n\nBut our target is 't58', which is a single terminal. Looking through, I don't see 't58' directly in any NT's productions. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, under NT58, there's a production: `NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33`. So if I have NT58, it can be split into NT31 and NT33, which can produce 't's. So perhaps NT58 can be used to produce 't...t', but our target is a single 't58', which is 't' followed by '58', but in the grammar, it's represented as 't58' as a terminal string? Or wait, the string is `t58`, which means it's a single terminal symbol representing the combination 't' followed by 58.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs produce terminal strings like 't76', 't30', etc. So, is 't58' one of them? Let me see.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't58'. Wait, but then how do I get 't58' in the string? Maybe it's produced via multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the string is `t58` which is a token, but in the grammar, it's represented as a single terminal, e.g., `NT33 \u2192 't76' | 't30'`. Wait, but none of them produce 't58' directly. So perhaps 't58' isn't directly produced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the NTs in a way that's confusing. Let me try to find if any NT leads directly to 't58'.\n\nLooking over all the terminal productions in the grammar, I don't see any NT that produces 't58' directly. So that suggests that 't58' isn't directly in the language of the grammar. But wait, maybe it's possible through some combination.\n\nWait, but the grammar has S \u2192 NT48 NT11. If I can derive both NT48 and NT11 to produce a terminal string, but since each step only splits into two non-terminals, and the only way to get a terminal is through an NT producing a single terminal, which seems not the case here because most NTs go further into two more NTs.\n\nWait, let's take another approach. The string is `t58`, which is a single terminal symbol. For that to be produced, there should be an NT that directly maps to it. Looking through all the NTs, I don't see any NT whose production includes 't58'.\n\nWait, for example, in the list:\n\n- NT40 can produce 't65', 't28', 't1', etc.\n- NT14 can produce 't42', 't76'.\n- NT6 can produce 't4', 't1', etc.\n\nLooking through each NT's productions, the only ones that produce 't' followed by a number are when the NT directly produces a terminal. So, for example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30', but none produce 't58'.\n\nTherefore, I think that the string `t58` is not generated by this grammar because there's no NT production that directly leads to `t58`. So the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-11","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the string \"t26 t65\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the process.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC (where A, B, C are non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (where a is a terminal). The grammar provided seems to follow this structure, except for some rules that have more than two non-terminals on the left, but wait, in CNF, each production can only have two symbols on the right. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see some rules with three parts, like S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Oh, wait, that's not right. In CNF, all productions must have exactly two symbols on the right side except for the start symbol which can have one. So perhaps the user made a typo, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking more carefully, some rules have two non-terminals, some have a mix, and some even seem to have two non-terminals on the right, like NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32 is okay, but some have three? Wait, for example, NT30 \u2192 NT22 NT10. No, that's two. Oh, maybe I was confused. Wait, looking back, the first line is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which is two symbols, so that's fine. Then NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, also two. NT12 \u2192 NT31 NT58, two. NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, two. Wait, actually, all the initial rules seem to have two symbols on the right, and the non-terminals on the left are single. So maybe I misread earlier; the grammar is in CNF. Because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So it's okay.\n\nSo, the goal is to check if the string \"t26 t65\" can be generated by this grammar. Since the string consists of two terminals, \"t26\" and \"t65\", I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. The start symbol is S. The rule for S is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So to generate S, we need to derive NT48 and NT11. Each of these non-terminals will then be expanded further.\n\nFirst, let's expand NT48. Looking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So NT48 can be split into NT49 and NT6. Now, I need to derive nt49 and nt6.\n\nLooking at NT49, there are two rules: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7. Wait, but NT49 is at the top level, so I guess it can choose either. Similarly, NT6 has a rule NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49. So let's see.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's approach this methodically. We'll use a top-down approach, trying to match the given string. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach could be to see if the string can be reduced to the start symbol, but since the string has two terminals, it's more direct to see if S can derive \"t26 t65\".\n\nLet's outline the structure:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 (what?) (what?)\n\nSo S = NT48 NT11. Each of these non-terminals needs to derive their respective terminals.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So NT48 expands into two non-terminals. Then, NT49 can expand as either NT11 NT6 or NT16 NT7, and NT6 expands into NT52 NT49.\n\nSimilarly, NT11 has a rule NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, and NT49 again has possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a more efficient way. Let's look for the rules that produce \"t26\" and \"t65\".\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT20 \u2192 \"t26\" (from NT20 \u2192 't26')\n\nNT6 \u2192 \"t4\" (from NT6 \u2192 't4'), but that seems irrelevant. Wait, no, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT20 \u2192 't53'\n- Wait, so NT20 has two terminal rules: \"t26\" and \"t53\".\n\nSimilarly, looking for \"t65\", I see:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't7' (so perhaps NT52 can also produce other things, but in the given rules, NT52 \u2192 't7' and others like 't14', 't25', etc.)\n\nBut in the provided rules, I don't see \"t65\". Let me check.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules, and in that list, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'\n- NT8 \u2192 't69'\n- NT16 \u2192 't26'\n- NT47 \u2192 't48'\n- NT13 \u2192 't5'\n- NT52 \u2192 't7'\n- NT25 \u2192 't58'\n- NT59 \u2192 't24'\n- NT18 \u2192 't69'\n- NT52 \u2192 't25'\n- NT33 \u2192 't73' (twice)\n- NT55 \u2192 't83'\n- NT44 \u2192 't66'\n- NT7 \u2192 't28'\n- NT28 \u2192 't59'\n- NT14 \u2192 't42'\n- NT43 \u2192 't55'\n- NT35 \u2192 't27'\n- NT48 \u2192 't68'\n- NT49 -> 't47'\n\nWait, looking through these, I don't see any production for NT20 that ends with 't65'. The only 't65' I see is under NT6 \u2192 't4'\u2014no, that's not related. Wait, perhaps I'm confused because the string is \"t26 t65\", so both terminals must be produced by some non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the initial steps, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So we need NT48 and NT11 to produce \"t26\" and \"t65\".\n\nWait, but looking at the rules for NT48: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So to get \"t26\", perhaps NT6 can produce \"t26\", but looking through the rules, I don't see NT6 \u2192 't26'. Instead, NT6 \u2192 't4', 't52', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rules. I think I might have missed some. Let me parse all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't26' and 't53'\n\nSo NT20 can produce \"t26\" or \"t53\". So perhaps \"t26\" comes from NT20.\n\nBut how do we get \"t65\"? Because the string is \"t26 t65\". So \"t65\" must come from some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the rules wrong. Let me check again. Is there any non-terminal that can produce \"t65\"?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT producing \"t65\". Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again:\n\n- NT20: 't26', 't53'\n\n- NT6: 't4'\n\n- NT7: 't36', 't28'\n\n- NT14: 't76', 't42'\n\n- NT16: 't26'\n\n- NT47: 't48'\n\n- NT13: 't5'\n\n- NT52: 't7', 't14', 't25', 't76', 't37'\n\nWait, no, none of these produce 't65'. So if the string is \"t26 t65\", the second part \"t65\" must come from a different non-terminal. But in the given rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't65'. This suggests that \"t65\" cannot be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar, so the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check if any non-terminals can produce 't65'. I'll go through each non-terminal in the rules:\n\n- NT33: has two 't73' options, so no.\n\n- NT59: 't24', 't12', 't25', etc., no.\n\n- NT40: 't28', 't1', 't59', etc.,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t76 t83\". Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I can see that most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs or a terminal. So, this fits the CNF structure.\n\nThe string I'm checking is \"t76 t83\". It seems like it's a sequence of two terminal symbols, 't76' and 't83'. So, my goal is to see if these can be derived from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Hmm, so the start symbol S produces NT48 and NT11. To get a string of terminals, both NT48 and NT11 must be expanded into terminals as well.\n\nLet me look at NT48 and NT11. \n\nStarting with NT48: Looking through the productions, I see NT48 \u2192 NT42 NT13. So, NT48 breaks down into NT42 and NT13. Now I need to expand both of these.\n\nNT42: Checking its productions, NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25. So, NT42 is NT55 and NT25.\n\nNT55: It has two productions, NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59 and another is NT55 \u2192 NT14 NT59? Wait, no, looking back, the productions are:\n- NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59\n- NT55 \u2192 NT14 NT59\n\nWait, no, looking again, in the given grammar, the productions for NT55 are:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\nNT55 -> NT14 NT59\n\nWait, but in the CNF, each production should be either two non-terminals or a terminal. For NT55, it's producing two NTs, so that's fine.\n\nBut let me track back. So, starting from NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25. So, I have to expand NT55 and NT25.\n\nNT55: Let's take the first production, NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59.\n\nNow, expand NT21 and NT59.\n\nNT21: Production is NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45.\n\nExpanding each of these.\n\nNT33 has two terminals: it can produce 't76' or 't30'. So, let's look at how it's producing. \n\nWait, NT33's productions are:\n- NT33 -> 't76'\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n\nBut in our string, we have 't76' at the start. So maybe we'll choose NT33 \u2192 't76'. Alternatively, if we need more steps.\n\nSo, NT33 \u2192 't76' would directly give us 't76'. So, in that case, we can get 't76' from NT33.\n\nNext, NT45: Let's see, NT45's productions are:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1\n- NT45 \u2192 NT12 NT6\n\nBut NT12 is another NT, so I need to expand further.\n\nWait, this seems a bit complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let's see if I can trace the possible path from S to the string.\n\nWe have S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, to get the string 't76 t83', I need to derive 't76' from NT48 and 't83' from NT11.\n\nSo, if NT48 can produce 't76' and NT11 can produce 't83', that would solve it.\n\nBut wait, NT48 \u2192 NT42 NT13. So, let's see NT42:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25. So, NT55 and NT25.\n\nExpanding NT55 first. It can produce NT21 NT59 or NT14 NT59.\n\nLet's try the first option: NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45.\n\nNT33 can be 't76' as required. So, one part is done.\n\nNow, NT59: Let's see its productions.

{"custom_id":"request-25","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string \"t31 t26 t25\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each rule has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t31 t26 t25\". I notice that each part of the string is a terminal symbol, so I need to track how these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must be generated in such a way that each NT corresponds to a part of the string, step by step.\n\nLet me break down the string into three parts: t31, t26, t25. So I need to see if each of these can be produced by a path in the grammar.\n\nLet's look at NT31 first because the first part is \"t31\". In the grammar, I see that NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8. So NT31 needs to derive t31. Then, t31 is from NT20 and NT8.\n\nLooking at NT20: It can be produced from NT33 and NT45. NT20's rules:\nNT20 \u2192 NT33 NT45\nAlso, NT20 can become 't26' directly. So to get t26, NT20 must expand to 't26'. That's straightforward.\n\nWait, so for NT20, if we choose the rule NT20 \u2192 't26', that gives us t26. So far, so good. So the first part would be derived as NT31 \u2192 NT20 t8. But wait, NT8 is another non-terminal. Let me check NT8.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT16 NT7, according to the rules. Then NT16 \u2192 NT26, which is a terminal 't26', and NT7 \u2192 't28'. So NT8 becomes 't26 t28'.\n\nWait, but in our string, the second part is t26. So that would be generated by NT8, right? But wait, NT8 \u2192 't26' if NT16 is 't26' and NT7 is 't28', but that would make the string have t26 t28, which isn't the case here. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's look at NT20 again. The production for NT20 is:\nNT20 \u2192 NT33 NT45\nNT20 \u2192 't26'\n\nSo if NT20 is replaced by 't26', then in the string, that part is t26. So that's correct for the second part.\n\nWait, no, the string is t31 t26 t25. So the first part is t31, the second is t26, the third is t25. So the parts are in order.\n\nSo let's track the derivation:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11 (must be split into NT48 and NT11)\n\nThen, each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nNT48 is: look at the rules, NT48 \u2192 NT14 NT49. So NT48 \u2192 NT14 NT49.\n\nNT14: rules are NT14 \u2192 NT42 NT1, so NT14 \u2192 NT42 NT43.\n\nWait, no, let me look: NT14 \u2192 NT42 NT1.\n\nWait, NT14's production is:\nNT14 \u2192 NT42 NT1.\n\nAnd NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25.\n\nSo NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25.\n\nSo breaking this down, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and NT48 \u2192 NT14 NT49, which is NT14 NT49 \u2192 (NT42 NT1) (NT49). \n\nBut NT42 is NT55 NT25, so that gives NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25.\n\nThen, NT1 would have to be expanded if it's a non-terminal, but looking at NT1's production: NT1 \u2192 NT19 NT41.\n\nSo perhaps that's a path, but we need to see if the string can derive correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me try to generate the string step by step.\n\nWe need to get t31 t26 t25.\n\nLet me check each part:\n\n- The first letter is t31, so it's the result of expanding NT31. NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8.\n\nSo for NT31, if it expands to NT20 and NT8, then the first part is t31. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because NT20 is a non-terminal, and NT8 is also a non-terminal. So NT31 can only produce t31 if both NT20 and NT8 produce their corresponding terminal symbols.\n\nWait, no. So NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8. So the terminal symbols it produces would be (NT20 expansion) (NT8 expansion). So for NT31 to produce t31, we need that NT20 derivation results in 't' followed by whatever NT8 results in.\n\nWait, but t31 is a single terminal symbol, so how does that work? Because NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8. So both NT20 and NT8 must produce terminal symbols. So if NT20 produces 't26' and NT8 produces 't28', then NT31 would generate 't26 t28'. But the string we have is t31 t26 t25. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm getting the NTs wrong. Let me see the production for NT31 again. NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8. So it's two non-terminals, so it will expand into two terminals. But in the string, the first part is just t31, which is a single terminal. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the NT31 is derived.\n\nWait, maybe the initial S expansion isn't S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is divided into NT48 and NT11. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string is built by first expanding NT48 and then NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11: Looking at the production rules for NT11, I see NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT6. Also, NT11 has another rule: NT11 \u2192 t31. So if NT11 is replaced by t31, then that part is covered.\n\nSo for the second part of the string, t26, that must come from NT25 I think. Wait, no, looking at the string, the order is t31 t26 t25. So let's see:\n\nEach part of the string comes from the expansion of the NTs in the order S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo NT48 expands into something that produces t26, t31, and t25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me retrace:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the entire string is built by the combination of NT48's expansion and NT11's expansion.\n\nWait, but the string is t31 t26 t25, which is three terminals. So each part of the NTs must contribute to one part of the string. Or maybe not exactly, because each NT can expand into multiple parts. Wait, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly.\n\nWait, each NT's expansion can produce multiple terminals, so S \u2192 NT48 NT11 would result in a string that is a concatenation of the expansions of NT48 and NT11.\n\nSo for S to produce a string of three terminals, each NT (NT48 and NT11) must each produce one terminal symbol, or perhaps one NT produces multiple terminals, and the other produces one.\n\nWait, but looking at the NT11 production, there's a rule where NT11 \u2192 t31, which is a single terminal. So if NT11 expands directly to t31, then that's the third part of the string.\n\nSo let me consider that S \u2192 NT48 NT11, where NT11 expands to t31. Then, NT48 must expand to t31 t25, but wait, that would make the string t31 t31 t25, but that's not our case. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, because S is NT48 NT11, so the string would be (NT48 derivation) concatenated with (NT11 derivation). So let's think of the string as [NT48 derivation] [NT11 derivation].\n\nOur string is t31 t26 t25. So that's three parts. So either:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-29","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is produced by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t48 t65 t84`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that every non-terminal expands into either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that most of the productions have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which fits CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, etc. However, I see that some non-terminals have a terminal as an option, like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'. That\u2019s expected in CNF when the production ends with a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t48 t65 t84`. This is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the grammar can generate this in the correct order. The approach is to start from the start symbol and see if we can derive this string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT48 NT11. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11. That means the string starts with t48, followed by t65. Then followed by t84. Wait, let me check: the first production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first part is NT48, which must produce t48, and the second part is NT11, which must produce t65, because NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, and then NT41 \u2192 t77, and NT49 \u2192 t6, but wait, looking at the rules, NT11 has a production NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, but I also see NT11 \u2192 t31, but no, looking again: NT11 is defined as NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, and those produce 't41' and 't6' respectively? Wait, no, I think I need to look at the specific rules for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me make this clearer. Each production rule defines how a non-terminal can expand. So starting from S, which is NT48 NT11. So the first symbol in the string should be the expansion of NT48, and the second symbol the expansion of NT11, right?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 has a production rule: NT48 \u2192 't48'. So NT48 directly produces t48. That's good because the first symbol in the string is t48. So the first part checks out.\n\nNext, NT11. Looking at the grammar, NT11 has production rules: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So it expands into two non-terminals. Now, the next part of the string after t48 is t65. So after NT48, we have NT11 producing t65, but NT11 itself produces two non-terminals. Wait, so the string `t48 t65 t84` would have to come from S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would produce t48 followed by the expansion of NT11. But NT11 is two non-terminals, so each would produce their respective terminals.\n\nWait, let me think again. S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So S generates a string where the first non-terminal is NT48 and the second is NT11. So NT48 produces t48, and NT11 produces two non-terminals (since its production is NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49), which then produce t77 (NT41) and t6 (NT49). So the second part of the string should be NT41 expanding to 't77' and NT49 expanding to 't6', which would make the second part 't77 t6', but in the given string it's just 't65'. So that's a problem because the second part of the string is only 't65', not two symbols. So that would mean that NT11 is supposed to produce a single symbol, but in reality, it's producing two symbols. Therefore, the string after t48 should be 't77 t6', not a single 't65'. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Let me look again at the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT11 is defined as NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. But also, NT11 seems to have another production? Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nBut perhaps there are other rules I'm missing. Let me scan through the productions.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I see NT11 only has one production: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. There's no other rule for NT11 that ends with a terminal. So NT11 must produce two terminals. But in the given string, after t48, we have t65, which is a single symbol, but NT11 must produce two. So that's a problem. That would mean the string is longer than it should be, or the second part is a single symbol, which it isn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying what each production does. Let me see: looking at the NT11 productions. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's check all the non-terminals. For example, looking at NT6, it's defined as NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49. Then NT52 \u2192 't7', so NT52 is a terminal. NT49 \u2192 't6'. So NT6 expands into 't7' 't6' = 't76'.\n\nNow, looking at NT11 again. It's only defined as NT41 NT49. So expanding NT11 would yield two non-terminals. So NT41 \u2192 't77' and NT49 \u2192 't6', so the expansion is 't77 t6' \u2192 't776' (assuming concatenation). So the string after t48 would be 't776', but in the given string, it's 't65'. So that's a mismatch.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different path. Let me see if there are other non-terminals that could produce 't65'. Looking through the grammar, is there any non-terminal that produces 't65'? I see NT29 \u2192 't69', NT20 \u2192 't26', NT7 \u2192 't36', etc. Wait, 't65' doesn't seem to be directly produced by any non-terminal except perhaps NT52 when combined with another. Because NT52 is a terminal 't7', but in the grammar, NT52 is listed multiple times, like NT52 \u2192 't7', NT25 \u2192 't58', etc. Wait, but in the string, it's 't48 t65 t84'. So after t48, it's t65, which is one symbol, but according to NT11's production, it should expand into two symbols: 't77 t6'. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the string is invalid because the second part of the expansion is longer than expected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in thinking that S must directly expand into NT48 followed by NT11. Let me check the grammar's top-level productions again. The start symbol is S, and the only production from S is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So indeed, S generates two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. So the string must consist of the concatenation of the expansions of these two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the first part is NT48 \u2192 't48', which matches the first symbol. The second part is NT11 expanding into two symbols: 't77 t6', which would make the total string 't48 t77 t6'... But the given string is 't48 t65 t84', which is three symbols. So the expansion of NT11 in the grammar would produce two symbols, making the total string length four. But the given string is three symbols, which suggests that perhaps S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is not the starting point.\n\nWait, no, S must expand into these two parts. So the string must be 't48' followed by two symbols from NT11, making a length of 3 terms. Wait, no, 't48' plus two symbols would make the string length 3: 't48', then two symbols, but combined as 't48 t65 t84'. Hmm, wait, that's actually three symbols total, but in this"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-47","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t24 t28 t49 t77` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar to see how the terminals and non-terminals interact. The grammar consists of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT11, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals until it eventually reaches terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t24 t28 t49 t77`. That's four terms, each a terminal. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, which means the entire derivation will produce a parse tree where each node has exactly two children, except leaves. So the string should have a leftmost derivation of length 3 steps (since the start symbol S branches off into two non-terminals, each of which may branch further, but the string has four symbols, so three steps after the initial S). Wait, actually, let me think: For a string of length n, there are n-1 productions used in the derivation, so for four symbols, we need three production steps from S.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some rule in the grammar. Let's go through each 't' in the string and see if they appear in the right-hand sides of any production rules.\n\nStarting with the last token, 't77'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT49 has a production to 't77'. So 't77' is reachable via NT49.\n\nNext, 't49' comes before 't77'. Looking at the rules, NT49 also has a production `-> NT16 NT7`. NT16 has a production `->'t26'`, and NT7 has a production `->'t36'`. So that's one possible path for 't77'.\n\nNow, going back, the third token is 't28'. Let's look for where 't28' appears. Scanning the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to 't28'. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see 't28' only appears in the production of NT28: `NT28 -> 't59'`. So 't28' is part of NT28. Now, can any non-terminal expand into NT28? Looking, I don't see any production where a non-terminal expands into NT28. So unless NT28 is reachable somewhere else, 't28' might not be present in the language. Wait, but maybe through some longer expansion? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the string was intended to have 't28 t49 t77' but with 't28' not reachable. Wait, no, let me make sure I'm correct.\n\nWait, looking again, the rules for NT28: it's only `NT28 -> 't59'`. So unless some other non-terminal can expand into NT28, but I don't see that in the grammar. So 't28' can't be generated, which would mean the string `t24 t28 t49 t77` is impossible. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT28's rule again. The user provided the grammar as a multi-line list, and for NT28, it's `NT28 -> 't59'`. So no, that's correct. So NT28 only goes to 't59', which is another terminal. So 't28' is not present in the grammar. That would mean 't28' is not part of any possible expansion, making the string invalid.\n\nBut let me double-check if I misread the grammar. Scanning through all the rules again, I don't see any non-terminal that expands into 't28'. So if the string contains 't28', which isn't present in any production, the answer should be 'No'. However, maybe I should check for all four tokens to see if they can all be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't28' is a part of a larger expansion. Let me think if any non-terminal can produce 't28'. Looking again, NT29 has a production `-> 't25'`, which is another terminal. NT20 has `-> 't26'`. NT14 has `-> 't76'`. NT12 has `-> 't37'`. NT43 has `-> 't15'`. So none of these are 't28'. I don't think any non-terminal expands into 't28', which means the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, the first token is 't24'. Looking through the rules, NT55 has `-> 't72'`, NT59 has `-> 't24'`. So 't24' is generated by NT59. Then, perhaps NT59 is part of a larger expansion. Let me see if NT59 can be derived from S.\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\nLooking at NT48: it's `-> 't68'`, but wait, NT48 might have other productions? Wait, from the provided rules, S is `S -> NT48 NT11`. NT48's rule is `-> 't68'`, but I need to check all NT48 rules. Wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any rules for NT48 except possibly 't68' if I missed it. Wait, looking back, for NT48, the user only wrote one line: `NT48 -> 't68'`. So NT48 directly expands to 't68'.\n\nSimilarly, NT11 expands to something. Let me check NT11's rules. From the rules, I see NT11 has `-> NT41 NT49` and `-> 't31'`. Wait, no, from the provided grammar, NT11's rules are two: `-> NT41 NT49` and `-> 't31'`. So NT11 can produce 't31' or expand further.\n\nIf NT11 is `t31`, then S would produce 't68' 't31', but the string starts with 't24', which is 't72' from NT59. So if the first symbol is 't24', which comes from NT59, and NT59 is part of the S's right-hand side, then the S's right-hand side would have to include NT59 somewhere. But S's right-hand side is NT48 and NT11. So unless NT48 or NT11 can produce NT59, but looking at their rules, neither does. So perhaps the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me approach this differently. Let's look at each terminal in the string and see if it can be generated.\n\n1. 't24': Found in NT59's production. So yes, NT59 expands to 't24'.\n2. 't28': As discussed, not present in any production.\n3. 't49': Present in NT49.\n4. 't77': Present in NT49.\n\nSo since 't28' cannot be generated, the string is invalid.

{"custom_id":"request-39","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the string `t12 t4 t28 t36` is generated by the given context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay. I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. That helps in analyzing the derivation steps.\n\nFirst, let me list out the productions in the grammar to have a clear view. There are a lot of NTs (non-terminals) with various rules. The terminals are 't' followed by numbers which I assume represent specific symbols or tokens.\n\nGiven the string is four tokens: t12, t4, t28, t36. I notice that the grammar uses these as terminals in different productions, so each part of the string corresponds to a specific rule.\n\nThe grammar's S rule is S -> NT48 NT11. So, S starts with NT48 and NT11. Let's check each part.\n\nFor NT48, looking through the productions, I see NT48 -> NT14 NT7. So, NT48 breaks down into NT14 and NT7.\n\nNext, looking at NT14: There's a production NT14 -> 't76'. Wait, but that's a terminal, right? But in the string, we have t12, t4, etc. So, if NT14 directly produces 't76', which is different from t14, this might be a problem. Hmm, does that mean there's a mistake? Or is there another way NT14 can be derived?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see other rules like NT14 -> 't42', but that's not 't14'. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the given productions again. Oh, yes, there's NT14 -> 't76', which is different. So this would mean that NT14 produces 't76', not fitting the string. Wait, but in the string, we have t4. So, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack. Let's consider S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48, the next production is NT48 -> NT14 NT7. So, NT48 can be NT14 and NT7.\n\nThen, NT7 is a production in the grammar. Let me check NT7's rules. There's NT7 -> NT12 NT43, and NT7 -> NT29 NT35, and others. For example, NT7 -> 't36' as one of the rules. So, NT7 can produce 't36'. That's important because the last part of the string is t36. So, maybe NT7 is producing that last part.\n\nWait, but NT7 can be NT12 NT43, which is further down, or other combinations. Let me see, the string ends with t36, which matches NT7's rule NT7 -> 't36'. So, that's possible.\n\nBut let's also consider the first part of S: NT48. If NT48 -> NT14 NT7, and NT7 can produce 't36', but NT14 is a non-terminal. So, to get t12 from NT48, perhaps NT14 produces 't12'? Let's check NT14's rules.\n\nLooking at NT14's productions: I see NT14 -> 't76', 't42', etc., but no rule that directly provides 't12'. Hmm, that's a problem. So, that means NT48 can't directly produce t12 unless through some indirect way. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for an alternative path for NT48. Let me check NT48's other productions. The given production is NT48 -> NT14 NT7. Maybe there's a way NT14 can be broken down further, but looking at NT14, the productions are only to terminals like 't76', 't42', etc. So, NT14 can't be further split; it's a terminal. Therefore, if the string starts with t12, but the only option is 't76' or 't42' from NT14, which don't match t12, maybe that path is blocked.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another way for S to generate the string. Let me think. S -> NT48 NT11. Maybe in the string, t12 comes from NT11 somehow. Let's check NT11's rules.\n\nLooking through the productions: NT11 -> NT41 NT49 and other rules, but wait, I don't see 't12' being directly produced by NT11 in any of its rules. For example, NT11 -> 't31', 't41', etc. So maybe that's not it either.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the productions for S. S is NT48 NT11. So, the two parts are NT48 and NT11. Let me see if each can produce the corresponding parts in the string.\n\nThe string is t12 t4 t28 t36. Let's look at each token:\n\n1. t12: Where does this come from? Maybe some NT's production. Let me check the terminals. Oh, wait, there's a production NT30 -> 't22' and NT20 -> 't26', but not t12.\n\nWait, checking all the productions: I see NT33 -> 't73', but no 't12'. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me look at the rules again.\n\nWait, I see NT20 -> 't26' and NT19 -> 't28', which is for the third token in the string. Hmm, but the second token is t4, which I need to see where it comes from.\n\nLooking at the string: the parts are [t12, t4, t28, t36]. Let's think about t4. Where can that come from? Looking through the grammar, perhaps NT18 -> 't69', or NT29 -> 't5', or NT52 -> 't7' or 't58', etc. Hmm, doesn't seem to directly produce t4.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about each part of the string and see where each could come from.\n\nFirst, the first part is t12. Looking at the productions, terminal t12 is provided by which NT? I don't see any NT directly producing 't12' in the given productions. The productions for t12 are from NT12, but as a non-terminal, let me check NT12's productions.\n\nLooking at NT12: it can be NT39 NT32 or other rules. But it's also used in various productions. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the terminals are only specific ones. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, I'm looking at the productions and some of them are terminal productions, like NT33 -> 't73', NT33 -> 't7', etc. So, the terminals are 't' followed by two digits, like 't12', 't48', etc.\n\nSo, let's list out all the terminal options:\n\n- NT14 -> 't76'\n- NT32 -> 't39' and 't6'\n- NT28 -> 't59'\n- NT44 -> 't73'\n- NT14 -> 't42'\n- NT39 -> 't40' and 't11'\n- NT33 -> 't73' and 't30'\n- NT35 -> 't27'\n- NT48 -> 't68'\n- NT29 -> 't5' and 't35'\n- NT12 -> 't37'\n- NT37 -> 't15' and 't34'\n- NT52 -> 't7', 't58', 't49'\n- NT25 -> 't58'\n- NT55 -> 't83'\n- NT33 -> 't7' and 't30'\n- NT19 -> 't28'\n- NT30 -> 't84', 't22'\n- NT7 -> 't36', etc.\n\nLooking at this, the string has 't12', which isn't listed as a terminal in any production. So, how can it be part of the string? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see if any of the productions can reach 't12'. Let's check the productions that include 't12'. Looking through, in the given rules, none of the terminals directly produce 't12'. So, perhaps the string can't be generated because it includes 't12' which the grammar doesn't have a production for.\n\nWait, but maybe via some intermediate steps. For example, maybe through a series of productions.

{"custom_id":"request-60","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string \"t47 t73 t83 t15 t65\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each rule has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right, but often it's two non-terminals, sometimes a terminal followed by another non-terminal or the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should check each of the given rules to see what's allowed.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which becomes NT48 NT11. So the first step is that S must split into NT48 and NT11. Then each of these non-terminals must produce other combinations until we get to terminals.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence of terminals: t47, t73, t83, t15, t65. So five tokens, all which are terminals. But in the grammar, the left-hand sides (LHS) of the rules are non-terminals, and when you apply productions, you're breaking them down into other non-terminals, which eventually become terminals.\n\nSo the process is like a binary tree: S splits into two, each of those splits into two, and so on until you get to single terminals. So the string we have has five terminals, which suggests that the parse tree would have a structure that leads to five leaves.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the derivation process. Starting with S, which becomes NT48 and NT11. Each of those, in turn, splits into two, so S will have a derivation tree that might be of a certain height. If the overall string has n terminals, the number of steps needed could vary, but the main thing is that the string must be a permutation of all the symbols at the bottom of the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to try to see each part of the string in the grammar.\n\nLet me check each token in the string and see if their productions are possible.\n\nFirst token: t47.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are two rules for NT47: NT47 -> t48, and another production somewhere? Wait, let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT47 -> t48, NT13 -> t5, then looking for other NT47. Hmm, I don't see another rule for NT47, so I think it only produces t48. So if the string has t47, it must not be derived from NT47 because we don't have a rule for that. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a larger term.\n\nWait, no, because T47 is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT47 only goes to t48. So t47 must come from a different NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse the string step by step.\n\nString: t47 t73 t83 t15 t65.\n\nSo, each token is a result of a production rule that ends in a terminal. So each of these must be the result of a non-terminal that can be directly rewritten as that terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules again, maybe t47 comes from a non-terminal. Let me look.\n\nLooking for rules where the right-hand side is t47. I see:\n\n- NT47 -> t48\n- NT29 -> NT7 NT35\n- NT7 -> NT12 NT43\n- NT34 -> NT9 NT14\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT1\n- NT37 -> NT28 NT29\n- NT19 -> NT28 NT37\n- NT44 -> NT29 NT25\n\nWait, maybe t47 is a terminal that comes from NT47, but in the given rules, NT47 only has a production to t48. So t47 isn't a direct production of any non-terminal, unless I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t47 is part of a larger structure. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the string can be broken down into units that correspond to certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string as a sequence: t47 t73 t83 t15 t65.\n\nEach of these must correspond to a path in the grammar. Let me try to build the parse tree.\n\nStart with S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nNow, NT48: looking at the rules, NT48 must split into something. Wait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT48 on the left side except once, in the start symbol. So I need to check if NT48 has any other productions. Let's scan the list.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I don't see any rule for NT48 except in S. So wait, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe rules provided are:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nOther rules are all of the form NT... -> NT... NT.... So looking at NT48 in the rules, I don't see it on the left side. So where does NT48 appear?\n\nLooking through the provided rules, the rule that starts with NT48 is the start symbol. So NT48 is a non-terminal that can derive something? Or is NT48 a terminal? That can't be, because it's on the right side but not on the left of any production.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If NT48 isn't on the left side of any rule except S, then that suggests that it's a terminal. Because in CNF, terminals can't be split further. So perhaps in the grammar, NT48 is a terminal symbol. Similarly, NT11 is a terminal if it's not on the left side of any other rule except S.\n\nWait, checking NT11: looking through the rules, I see NT52 -> NT14 NT32, NT32-> NT39 NT57, etc. So NT11 is on the right side of S's production but not on the left side of any rule. So NT11 must be a terminal. Similarly, NT48 is a terminal.\n\nBut then, looking at the string, the first two tokens are t47 and t73, which are terminals, but according to the grammar, they're not assigned to any non-terminals. So maybe I've made a mistake in identifying the terminals.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the rules. Maybe NT47 and others are non-terminals that can split into other NTs, which eventually become t's.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing NTs and t's. NT stands for non-terminal, t for terminal. So in the rules, a non-terminal like NT47 can derive a terminal t47, for example.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, I don't see any NT47 that derive t47. Let's check:\n\nThe rule NT47 is defined as what? Looking through the rules, I don't see any rule for NT47 except in the start symbol.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-examine the given grammar. It says:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nThen several lines follow. Each of these lines is an NT and its production.\n\nWait, looking at the first line after S: NT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nThen NT12 -> NT31 NT58\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo each NT has a production into two other NTs.\n\nNow, looking for any NT that can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76' and NT33 -> 't30'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT35 -> NT47 NT44, which are both non-terminals, so it doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nNT13 -> t5\n\nSo NT13 has a production to t5.\n\nSimilarly, let's go through the other NTs:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6, which are non-terminals, so no.\n\nNT47 only appears on the left-hand side of another production? Wait, I'm looking through the rules, and I don't see NT47 on the left-hand side except in S.\n\nWait, the first few rules are:\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT3'\n\nSo some NTs produce other NTs, but for the string in question, let's see if each token corresponds to a terminal derived from some NT.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t47 t73 t83 t15 t65\"\n\n- t47: So does any NT produce t47?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see NT47 on the left, except in the start symbol, which is S. So is NT47 a terminal? Let me check.\n\nIf that's the case, t47 would be a terminal. But looking through the other rules, for example, NT33 can produce 't76' and 't30' which are terminals, so yes, those are terminals.\n\nNow, let's check for NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, whatever the string is, it should be derived starting from S, breaking down into NT48 and NT11, and so on.\n\nLet's see how the string `t31 t37 t72 t72 t77` can be constructed step by step. We need to generate a sequence of productions that leads from S to the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal can expand into other non-terminals or sometimes into terminals. For example, NT31 -> NT20 NT8, and NT8 -> 't69'. Wait, no, looking again, I see NT8 is a non-terminal that's transformed into a terminal 't69'. Similarly, NT20 can sometimes produce a terminal like 't26' or 't53', wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. Let me list some non-terminals:\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\n\nNT20 -> 't26' or 't53'? Wait, looking back, I think the rules are:\n\nLooking at the grammar given:\n\nNT8 -> 't69' (I think I saw that somewhere). Hmm, no, wait, perhaps I misremembered. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT8 -> 't69'? Wait, I think in the provided rules, for example:\n\nNT47 -> 't48'\n\nNT6 -> 't4'\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, we have NT6 -> NT52 NT49, NT52 -> NT14 NT32, etc., and some of the non-terminals map to terminals directly, like NT33 -> 't73', NT35 -> 't3', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for which non-terminals directly expand into our terminals (t31, t37, t72, etc.). Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are 't31', 't37', 't72', 't77', and others like 't65', 't26', etc. Wait, no: actually, in the provided rules, some NT's directly go to terminals. For example, NT33 -> 't73', NT52 -> 't7', etc.\n\nWait, but let me verify. For example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT52 -> 't7'\n- NT25 -> 't58'\n- NT49 -> 't16', 't26', etc.\n\nWait, wait, actually, the rule is in two parts: NT49 can go to 't16 NT7' or 'NT26'. Hmm, no, wait, in the rules provided, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar is listed as lines, so for example:\n\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nand\n\nNT49 -> NT26.\n\nWait, but that can't be right? Wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nand separately:\n\nNT49 -> NT26.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect, but perhaps I'm misreading. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the list, yes, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nand\n\nNT49 -> NT26.\n\nWait, but both would be producing a single terminal? No, because NT16 is a non-terminal, it's transformed further, unless it's directly a terminal. Wait, that can't be right. For example, NT49-> NT26, which would require another production for NT26. Looking through, I see NT26: is it a terminal? Hmm, checking the rules, maybe I missed a rule for NT26. Let me see the list again:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see NT26 defined as a terminal. It must be further broken down. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nWait, no, in the rules, for example, NT26 is not present as a non-terminal. So, perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong section. Let me check again.\n\nHere's the grammar provided:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\nNT58 -> NT31 NT33\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\nNT34 -> NT9 NT14\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11\nNT35 -> NT47 NT44\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\nNT37 -> NT13 NT34\nNT21 -> NT33 NT45\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\nNT33 -> 't73'\nNT52 -> 't7'?\nWait, no, looking again, some of these are terminals. For example, NT52 -> 't7' is a production. So, in the given rules, certain non-terminals directly expand into terminals.\n\nLet me list which non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT59 -> 't5'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT25 -> 't58'\n- NT7 -> 't53' ? Wait, no. Wait, in the rules, for example, NT8 is transformed to 't69', but does any NT directly go to 't'?\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nFor example, looking for any rule that has a terminal followed by a number:\n\nLooking through, for example, I see NT49 -> NT16 NT7, which are both non-terminals, so that would not produce a terminal directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some NTs produce single terminals, but in the provided grammar, most of the productions are two non-terminals on the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some NTs have rules that include a terminal, but the initial list provided in the problem does not include those. Wait, looking back, the grammar is given as a series of production rules, each either A->BC, A->a, or some mix. But the way it's written, I need to parse each line correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier if I write down all the production rules properly. Let me try to list them methodically.\n\nEach production starts with a capital letter, followed by '->', then either two capital letters or a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n1.

Let me start by understanding what I have here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should make parsing easier, but I'm not a parser; I'm just trying to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, and from there, it seems like the process begins with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the first step is to generate NT48 and NT11.\n\nHmm, I need to see if these non-terminals can be expanded into the terminals present in the string. Let me look at the rules for NT48 and NT11.\n\nWait, the rules define how non-terminals can expand into other non-terminals or terminals. Looking at the given grammar, I see several NTs with rules that end in terminals like 't76', 't69', etc. For example, NT33 \u2192 't73' or 't3'.\n\nBut the string I'm checking is \"t25 t27 t59 t10 t72 t19\". So, it's a sequence of terminals. I need to trace a path from S through these NTs and terminals.\n\nLet me list the string components again: t25, t27, t59, t10, t72, t19.\n\nSince S produces NT48 and NT11, let's see what NT48 and NT11 can produce.\n\nNT48: Looking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So, to produce t25, I think NT49 and NT6 need to expand into the required terminals.\n\nLooking at NT49 rules: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So, NT49 needs to produce something that can lead to t25. Wait, let me see all NT49 expansions: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, and one of the NT49 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Hmm, but in the string, after t25, we have t27, which is another terminal. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think step by step. The string is six terminals, so the derivation path must be a series of productions that produce these terminals.\n\nLet me try to break down the string. The first term is t25, so maybe it's the result of some NT derivation. Let's look at which NT can produce t25.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 't26' and NT20 also \u2192 't53', but no NT directly produces t25. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6, and NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49. Also, NT52 \u2192 't7' or other things. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check all the NTs and their possible terminal expansions.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the NTs that can produce terminals are:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't73' or 't3'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't84', 't22', or 't10'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't65', 't28', 't1'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT59 \u2192 't24', 't5', 't12'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't76'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't69'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't7', 't58', 't37', 't10', 't25', 't73' [wait, wait, let me check]\n\nWait, looking at NT52 rules: the rules include NT52 \u2192 't7', 't58', 't37', 't10', 't25', 't73', 't55', 't21', 't59', 't28', etc. Okay, so NT52 can produce several terminals.\n\nWait, in the string, t25 is one of the terminals, so maybe NT52 can expand to t25. Let me confirm: looking at NT52's rules, one of the terminals is t5, but wait, does NT52 \u2192 't5'? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT52: I see NT52 \u2192 NT21 NT59, NT52 \u2192 't7', 't58', 't37', 't10', 't25', 't73', 't55', 't21', 't59', 't28', 't25', 't73', etc. Wait, looking more carefully: yes, I see NT52 has multiple terminals, including t25. Wait, in the rules, the line says \"NT52 -> 't7' 't58' 't37' 't10' 't25' 't73' 't55' 't21' 't59' 't28'\". Hmm, I'm not sure if that's a typo because usually, each production is a single rule. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, looking back, the user presented the grammar in a way that might not accurately represent all the rules, perhaps using some formatting that isn't correctly rendered. So, for example, some rules are written as \"NT52 -> 't7' 't58' 't37'...\". So perhaps each line is a separate production. So, in that case, NT52 can produce 't25' as one of its options.\n\nOkay, so that's a key point. So if NT52 can produce 't25', then perhaps that's how t25 appears in the string.\n\nLet me try to map the entire string:\n\n- The string is t25 t27 t59 t10 t72 t19.\n\nLet me break it down into parts and see where each component can come from.\n\nFirst, t25 could be from NT52, as mentioned. So, perhaps the second part of the string starts with NT52 producing t25.\n\nWait, but let's think of the overall process. Starting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Then, NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So, S \u2192 NT49 NT6 NT11. Then, NT49 can expand in various ways. Let's see.\n\nWait, NT49's rules: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, NT49 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT49 \u2192 NT31 NT33, and also NT49 \u2192 NT6 NT7 (wait, is that correct? Let me check the rules again.)\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT31 NT33\n\nSo, three possible expansions for NT49.\n\nThen, when NT48 expands into NT49 and NT6, S \u2192 NT49 NT6 NT11.\n\nNow, assuming that NT49 can produce 't25', wait, no, 't25' is a terminal, so NT52 can produce 't25', but NT49 can't directly; it has to be produced via its children.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach this differently.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be parsed into the grammar. The string is six tokens, so the derivation must start with S, then split into two NTs, each of which might split further.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if each token in the string can be matched by some NT in the grammar, and if the sequence of NTs can be derived from S.\n\nLet me list the tokens: t25, t27, t59, t10, t72, t19.\n\nNow, each of these is a terminal, so each must be produced by some NT rule that has that terminal as an option.\n\nSo, let's identify for each token which NTs can produce it.\n\n- t25: From the rules, NT52 can produce t25, and also maybe others.\n\n- t27: I don't see any NT directly producing t27 in the given rules. Or do I? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT ending with t27 except possibly in the middle of a rule. Wait, in the rules, I see NT43 \u2192 't15' and NT59 \u2192 't24', etc. Hmm, doesn't seem like any NT directly expands to t27.\n\nWait a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-81","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So every rule looks like A -> BC or A -> a. That should help because the left-hand side (LHS) is always a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t84 t84 t37 t24 t68 t42`. So all these are terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol, I see that S -> NT48 NT11. So S starts by producing NT48 and NT11. Both of these are non-terminals, so I need to expand each.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the target string. It has six terminals: t84, t84, t37, t24, t68, t42. Since each production in CNF introduces exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal, but since both parts of the RHS need to be terminals or non-terminals, it's either two terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal), but I think in this case, each production either leads to a terminal or further splits.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either A -> a or A -> BC, where B and C can be any non-terminals. So when expanding, each non-terminal can only produce either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So to produce a string of six terminals, I'd need a derivation where each of these six comes from either a direct production or through a chain of expansions.\n\nLet me see the production rules for the terminals in the string:\n\n- t84: Looking through the rules, I see NT30 -> t84.\n- t37: NT44 -> t37.\n- t24: NT59 -> t24.\n- t68: NT48 -> t68.\n- t42: NT14 -> t42.\n\nSo, let's map the terminals to their non-terminals:\n\nt84: NT30\nt84: NT30\nt37: NT44\nt24: NT59\nt68: NT48\nt42: NT14\n\nNow, let's see what the start symbol S produces. S splits into NT48 (which is T6) and NT11. So S -> T6 T11.\n\nSo T6 and T11 need to be expanded into the respective parts of the string. Let's map them:\n\n- T6 is NT6. Looking at the productions for NT6: NT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n- T11 is NT11. NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo now we have NT6 -> NT52 NT49 and NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nLooking at NT52: NT52 can produce NT14 NT32 or 't7' or 't25'. But in our target string, after T6's expansion (which would be NT52 NT49), the next term is t84. So let's see what NT52 can produce.\n\nNT52's rules:\n- NT52 -> NT14 NT32\n- NT52 -> 't7' (which is 't7')\n- NT52 -> 't25'\n\nWait, in the first expansion, S -> T6 T11, which then becomes NT52 NT49 (from NT6) and NT41 NT49 (from NT11). So the string starts with NT52 NT49 NT41 NT49. But the target string starts with t84 t84. So NT52 needs to produce something that starts with t84, and then another t84 somewhere else.\n\nLooking at NT52's rules, there's a possibility of NT52 -> 't7' or 't25' as single terminals, or as NT14 NT32.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first symbol is t84. So for NT52 to produce t84, looking at the options, is there any production that produces t84? From the terminal rules, I see NT30 -> t84, and that's it. So if NT52 is supposed to produce t84, then perhaps it's via NT30 producing t84. But wait, looking at the grammar, NT30 produces t84, and that's it. So how can NT52 produce t84? It doesn't seem possible directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Looking for NT52, it's defined as NT52 -> NT25 NT36, which again leads to other options.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to find a path through the grammar that produces the string t84 t84 t37 t24 t68 t42.\n\nEach t corresponds to a non-terminal that can produce that terminal.\n\nSo let's break down the string:\n\n1. t84: derived from NT30\n2. t84: again NT30\n3. t37: NT44\n4. t24: NT59\n5. t68: NT48\n6. t42: NT14\n\nSo the string can be written as NT30 NT30 NT44 NT59 NT48 NT14.\n\nNow, let's try to map this back through the grammar, starting from S.\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nWait, but in the target string, the first NT48 expands to NT30, then that splits into NT30 NT57? Wait, no, perhaps this approach is complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string has to be broken down recursively.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, the first symbol is NT48. From the rules, NT48 is defined as NT6 NT49. So NT48 -> NT6 NT49.\n\nThen, NT6 is NT52 NT49.\n\nSo S -> NT48 NT11 -> NT6 NT49 NT11.\n\nNow, NT11 is NT41 NT49.\n\nSo now we have NT6 NT49 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, the symbols are NT48, then NT6, NT49, NT41, NT49.\n\nBut that's just the first step. Each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded step by step until we get to terminals.\n\nContinuing, let's take NT6 first. NT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nSo now, the string becomes NT52 NT49 NT49 NT41 NT49.\n\nWait, but in our target string, the first symbol is t84, which comes from NT30. So perhaps I'm not on the right track.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S isn't the right starting point. Wait, no, S is the start symbol. So the expansion starts with S.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to reverse the process, start from the string and see if we can reduce it by matching the grammar rules.\n\nEach rule is either A -> a or A -> BC, so to reduce, we look for a substring that matches either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is t84 t84 t37 t24 t68 t42, so in tokens, it's six terminals.\n\nEach step in reduction would involve replacing a pair of non-terminals with a terminal, or replacing a non-terminal with a pair of non-terminals. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using dynamic programming approach for parsing would help, but that might be too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the given string can be represented as a series of expansions starting from S.\n\nThe first symbol in the string is t84, which comes from NT30, as per NT30 -> t84.\n\nSo, in the first step, after S -> NT48 NT11, and then NT48 -> NT6 NT49, and NT6 -> NT52 NT49, and NT52 might produce t84, but let's see.\n\nLooking at NT52: NT52 can produce to 't7' or 't25' or NT14 NT32.\n\nWait, but t84 is from NT30, not NT52. So perhaps that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.

{"custom_id":"request-99","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. The string is `t12 t68 t42 t47 t47 t30 t31`. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side. The grammar provided has a bunch of rules, and some terminals mapped directly to specific 't' strings like 't33', 't12', etc.\n\nThe target string has seven tokens: t12, t68, t42, t47, t47, t30, t31. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which immediately splits into NT48 and NT11. So the first step is to see how these can be expanded.\n\nLet's break down each part:\n\n1. NT48: From the rules, NT48 is not directly defined, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT48. Wait, no, looking again, the first line says S -> NT48 NT11. That's the first rule. So that means S can generate NT48 and NT11. Now, looking at NT48, is it a non-terminal? Or is it possible that it's a terminal? Wait, the rules list all non-terminals on the left, so I don't see NT48 as a non-terminal. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at NT48, no, NT48 is actually on the left of the first rule. So S -> NT48 NT11, meaning NT48 must be a non-terminal that can be expanded. Wait, but in the given rules, all non-terminals on the left are two symbols, so each non-terminal on the left has a production that leads to two non-terminals. So NT48 is a non-terminal that must be defined somewhere. Wait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any production for NT48 except its occurrence in S. That seems odd. Wait, maybe I made a mistake looking.\n\nWait, let's list all the rules again. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT49, NT48. Wait, let me see if there's a rule for NT48. I don't see any except in S itself. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe NT48 is actually a terminal, but in the given list, all production rules have non-terminals on the left side except for the terminals on the right. So if NT48 isn't found in any production on the right side, then maybe it's a terminal. But I'm not certain. Wait, that can't be. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing.

So S starts with NT48, which is a non-terminal that expands to 't68'. So that would mean the first token is 't68', but the given string starts with 't12', so that's a problem. So S -> NT48 NT11 can't derive t12 as the first symbol because NT48 would have to expand to a terminal, which in this case is 't68'. But in the string, the first token is 't12', so that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the initial rule. Let me check again. The first rule is S -> NT48 NT11. Looking at NT48's rule, in the given list, I see NT48 isn't listed as a non-terminal in any other production except possibly the last one I added. Wait, looking through all the rules I listed, I see:\n\nNT48 -> 't68'. Oh! So NT48 is a non-terminal that can derive the terminal 't68'. So if S -> NT48 NT11, and NT48 -> 't68', and NT11 -> 'something', then the first token would be 't68', but the given string starts with 't12'. So that's a problem because the first token doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe NT11 can derive something else. Let's look at NT11's production. From the rules, NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So NT11 is a non-terminal that splits into NT41 and NT49. Each of those can further divide. Let me see what NT41 and NT49 produce.\n\nLooking at NT41, in the rules: NT41 -> 't77'. So NT41 is a terminal 't77'. NT49 can produce several things, let me check: NT49 -> NT11 NT6, or NT49 can lead to 't81' or another option? Wait, looking through all the rules, I see that NT49 is defined as:\n\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT49 -> 't81'\n\nSo each time it can split into NT11 and NT6, or it can terminate as 't81'. So if I'm trying to get the string to start with 't12', but S's first production starts with 't68', that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying something. Maybe NT48 is a terminal. But in the rules, any node that isn't on the left is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-122","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe grammar provided has several production rules, and some of them already directly produce terminal symbols like 't76', 't69', etc. The given string I need to evaluate is `t76 t69 t10 t28 t26 t81 t68 t31`.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since S -> NT48 NT11, which is a production with two non-terminals, the string should ideally have a derivation where the non-terminals expand into the terminals in the order specified.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't76'. From the grammar, 't76' can be produced by NT33 or NT40 or NT14. Let's see which of these might fit into the sequence.\n\nWait, the start symbol S produces NT48 and NT11. So the string should come from deriving NT48 and NT11 into their respective parts. Let's check NT48: in the grammar, NT48 -> NT35 NT44. NT44, I see, has two production rules: NT44 -> NT12 NT57 and NT44-> NT7 NT37. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me look for terminals that match the string. The first symbol is 't76', which is produced by NT33 (as per the rules: NT33->'t73' or NT33->'t76'). Wait, wait, no, the grammar for NT33 is 't73' or 't76'? Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar provided, under NT33 there are two rules: NT33->'t73' and NT33->'t76'. So NT33 can produce either 't73' or 't76'. Similarly, NT40 can produce 't65' or 't47' or 't81'.\n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is 't76', so that would have to come from NT33. So that would mean that in the expansion, NT48 would have to derive to something that includes 't76'.\n\nWait, let's reconstruct the steps.\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nSo NT48 and NT11 are both non-terminals that need to derive into parts of the string. The string is length 8, so each non-terminal must expand into a sequence that contributes to the overall string.\n\nLooking at the string, the order is important. So the first two symbols would come from the expansion of NT48 and the next two from NT11? Or perhaps it's more involved because the order isn't fixed yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT48 and NT11 both generate sequences that concatenate to form the string. Let's break down the string into two parts: the first four terms and the last four. No, that might not work because the grammar might produce more in a single expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to match the productions.\n\nAlternative approach: try to parse the string from the start, considering the grammar rules.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to see if the string can be split into subparts that correspond to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string again: t76 t69 t10 t28 t26 t81 t68 t31.\n\nLet me list them as positions 1 to 8.\n\nPosition 1: t76\nPosition 2: t69\nPosition 3: t10\nPosition 4: t28\nPosition 5: t26\nPosition 6: t81\nPosition 7: t68\nPosition 8: t31\n\nNow, I need to see if these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, S->NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the string should be NT48's expansion followed by NT11's expansion. Let's suppose that.\n\nFirst, NT48's expansion is t76, which requires NT48->...->t76.\n\nBut NT48 isn't a terminal. Looking at NT48's productions, it's under the grammar as NT48->...?\n\nWait, wait, in the grammar, I should check for all symbols. Let me scan the grammar for NT48.\n\nLooking through the rules given, I don't see NT48 on the left-hand side. Wait, the grammar provided has several entries, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, let me re-express the grammar. The user provided a long list of production rules, but perhaps I should group them by non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the production rules:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\n\nNT58 -> NT31 NT33\n\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\n\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\n\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\n\nNT34 -> NT9 NT14\n\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11\n\nNT35 -> NT47 NT44\n\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\n\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\n\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\n\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\n\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\n\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\n\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\n\nNT37 -> NT13 NT34\n\nNT21 -> NT33 NT45\n\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\n\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\n\nNT33 -> 't76' | 't30'\n\nNT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'.\n\nNT35 -> NT27 | 't3' (from the grammar, looking at NT35's rules: I think I might have to check all the rules again.)\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to see the entire expansion of S and see if the string can be formed.\n\nBut perhaps I should try to build the string step by step.\n\nStarting from S, S->NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the string must be NT48 expansion followed by NT11 expansion.\n\nNow, for NT48: in the given grammar, do we have a production for NT48? Let me check again. The user listed a bunch of production rules, but in the list, I don't see NT48 on the left. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13 (NT44 on left)\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58 (NT12 on left)\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49 (NT6 on left)\nIs there any NT48 rule? Not in the list provided. So maybe I need to check if the user intended to represent that.\n\nWait, no, the provided grammar doesn't include NT48 as a non-terminal on the left-hand side of any production. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe in the user's initial grammar input, NT48 was present? Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\n\nNT58 -> NT31 NT33\n\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\n\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\n\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\n\nNT34 -> NT9 NT14\n\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11\n\nNT35 -> NT47 NT44\n\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\n\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\n\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\n\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\n\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\n\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\n\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\n\nNT37 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-144","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t28 t26 t24 t19 t66 t65 t19 t59 t59` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, this sounds a bit tricky, but I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which in this case seems to be rewritten as S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the first thing I should check is if the string can start with the non-terminals NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with `t28 t26 t24...`. So, the string has a bunch of terminals. To derive this string, the non-terminals in the starting production must expand into these terminals correctly.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals in the starting production: NT48 and NT11. So, I need to see if each of these can derive into parts of the string.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string backward. Starting from the end and moving backward. So, the last part of the string is `t59`. Looking at the grammar, I see NT59 can produce `t59` in two ways: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1 or NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1 (wait, that doesn't look right. Let me look again. Oh, wait, in the grammar, for NT59, the productions are: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1 and NT59 \u2192 NT59 \u2192 t24? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1? Or does it produce t24 somewhere? Looking back:\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, in the NT59 rule: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1 and NT59 \u2192 t24. Because in the grammar, under NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59, and also NT59 is defined with \u2192 t24. So, NT59 can be a terminal t24 or a combination of NT18 and NT1.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, the grammar has:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1\n\nand also:\n\nNT59 \u2192 t24.\n\nWait, no, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nWait, no, looking back, the NT55 rule is: NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59.\n\nBut in the grammar provided, there's a rule for NT59 \u2192 t24, and another for NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1.\n\nWait, no, looking again, I see in the section: NT59 -> NT18 NT1, and also NT59 -> t24. So NT59 can produce either NT18 NT1 or t24.\n\nBut in the string, the last part is t59. Wait, no, the string is `t28 t26 t24 t19 t66 t65 t19 t59 t59`. So the last two tokens are t59 and t59. That means when parsing, the last part is t59 followed by t59.\n\nWait, but t59 isn't an actual terminal in the string; the string has t28, t26, etc., but the last part is t59 and t59. Wait, no, the string given is `t28 t26 t24 t19 t66 t65 t19 t59 t59`. So each element is a terminal. So, to parse this, the last two are t59.\n\nSo, for the first NT59, we can have it derive t24 or NT18 NT1. But in our case, it's t59, which means the first NT59 must be expanding to NT18 and NT1, and the second NT59 must expand to NT18 and NT1 again?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me outline the steps more carefully.\n\nThe string is: t28, t26, t24, t19, t66, t65, t19, t59, t59.\n\nSo there are 9 terms. The structure must expand from S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so each of these non-terminals must expand into one or more terminals.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, we need to see if NT48 can expand into t28, t26, etc., and NT11 can do the same.\n\nLooking at NT48, in the grammar, it is defined as:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, yes: NT48 \u2192 t68. So that's straightforward. So the first non-terminal in the start symbol, NT48, must expand to t68.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t28. So how does t68 relate to t28? That seems conflicting. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT48 is defined as NT49? Wait, no.\n\nWait, no. Let's look at all the NT48 definitions. The grammar starts with:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nThen, looking for NT48:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68.\n\nSo NT48 directly produces t68.\n\nWait, so the first part of the string must be t68, but the string starts with t28. That's a problem. So that would mean that the string can't be derived from the grammar because NT48 can only produce t68, but the string starts with t28.\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at all the NT48 productions:\n\nLooking for NT48 in the grammar:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t68.\n\nThat's the only production for NT48. So NT48 can only generate the terminal t68.\n\nBut in the string, we have 't28' at the beginning. So that would imply that the start symbol S must expand into t68, but the string starts with t28, so that's impossible.\n\nUnless I miscounted. Wait, the string is `t28 t26 t24 t19 t66 t65 t19 t59 t59`.\n\nSo the first token is t28, which must come from NT48.\n\nBut NT48 can only produce t68. Therefore, this can't be possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the NT48 isn't directly producing a single terminal, perhaps it's part of a larger expansion. But according to the grammar, NT48 can only go to t68 as a single terminal.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would produce t68 followed by whatever NT11 produces. But the string starts with t28, so unless there's a way for NT48 to produce t28 through multiple steps, which the grammar doesn't allow because NT48's production is direct and only t68.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar because the first token doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided:\n\nYes, under NT48: NT48 \u2192 t68.\n\nSo yes, only t68 is possible.\n\nThus, the string starts with t28, which the grammar cannot produce from NT48.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the parsing is not that straightforward. Maybe the NT48 is part of a larger expansion that includes multiple terminals. But according to the grammar, NT48 can't expand to anything else besides t68. So it's a direct production.\n\nTherefore, the first symbol must be t68, but in the string it's t28. So no possible derivation can lead the start symbol S to produce t28 as the first symbol.\n\nHence, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. Looking at the rules, each non-terminal (like S, NT44, etc.) eventually breaks down into terminals and other non-terminals. The terminals seem to be all the words starting with 't' except 't43', which I see isn't a terminal. Wait, no, looking again, some are 't' followed by numbers, like 't53', 't12', etc. So maybe those are all the terminals.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of these 't' terms. Breaking it down step by step, I'll try to see if each part can be formed by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first part: the string begins with 't53'. Looking at the grammar, I see production rules where 't53' appears as a terminal. Checking the rules, I notice that NT29 -> 't7' and 't5', and NT20 -> 't26'. Wait, not directly. Another approach: Check each non-terminal that can produce 't53'. Looking at the rules, for example, NT55 -> NT21 NT59, which then branches into 't21' and 't59'. Hmm, this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, I'll try to parse the string step by step, starting from the first symbol and seeing if each can be derived from a non-terminal. Let's see:\n\n1. 't53': Do any non-terminals produce 't53'? Looking through all the productions, I notice NT59 -> NT18 NT1, which after reduction becomes 't69' and 't36' based on other rules. Wait, that's 't69' and 't36', not 't53'. Another possibility: NT25 -> 't58' breaks down into something else. Maybe NT19 -> 't28', but not directly related.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree. Let's see what the start symbol S does. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT48 NT11.\n\nSo S -> NT48 NT11\n\nNow, NT48: Looking at the rules, NT48 is not a non-terminal in the original grammar. Wait, I might have misread. Wait, no, looking through the grammar, the non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, the first production is S -> NT48 NT11. Hmm, but in the grammar, I see NT48 is defined as NT49 NT6. So substituting that, S becomes NT49 NT6 NT11.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because NT48 isn't listed in the productions except as S's left-hand side. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check:\n\nThe given grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11. Then, NT48 is not further defined, so that seems odd because in Chomsky Normal Form, all non-terminals on the right should have two non-terminals. Maybe I misread that.\n\nWait, looking again: The first production is S -> NT48 NT11. But then, looking for NT48 in the rules, I don't see it listed. Similarly, NT11 has a production NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So perhaps the correct way is that the initial S's production is actually a typo, and intended to be another non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe the non-terminals are all the NT followed by two digits, as in NT48, NT44, etc.\n\nWait, I notice that in the given grammar, after S, NT12, NT1, etc., the NTs are two digits. So perhaps NT48 and NT11 are valid non-terminals, but in the actual given productions, I didn't list them. So maybe I should check if S produces into NT48 and NT11.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT48 is not defined, but maybe there's a typo, perhaps it should be NT44 or another NT. Alternatively, perhaps the initial productions are correct, and I need to proceed.\n\nAssuming that the parsing starts with S -> NT48 NT11, but NT48 doesn't exist. Hmm, perhaps the initial productions are correct, but I didn't list all the NTs. Alternatively, perhaps I need to proceed differently.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The string starts with 't53'. We need to find a production rule for 't53'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT20 -> 't26', NT18 -> 't69', NT59 -> 't18' etc. Wait, looking through all the rules, I see that 't53' isn't directly a production. Wait, looking again, actually, in the rules, I don't see any terminal being 't53'. Hmm, that's a problem. If NT25 -> 't58', and NT20 -> 't26', but 't53' isn't a terminal, so none of the non-terminals directly produce 't53'. So perhaps the string cannot be generated, as it contains symbols that aren't terminals. But wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules, the only terminals are 't5', 't19', 't26', 't28', 't30', 't32', 't33', 't36', 't40', 't41', 't42', 't43', 't47', 't48', 't49', 't52', 't53', 't54', 't55', 't58', 't59', 't65', etc. Wait, but 't53' is listed here. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT28 -> 't59'\n- NT14 -> 't42'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT35 -> 't27'\n- NT48 -> 't68'\n- NT49 -> 't47'\n- NT55 -> 't83'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT14 -> 't42'\n- NT44 -> 't73'\n- NT13 -> 't5'\n- NT52 -> 't10'\n- NT37 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT11 -> 't31'\n- etc.\n\nWait, I'm seeing that 't53' is a terminal, as it's listed as one of the terminals. So there must be a non-terminal that can produce 't53'. Let me check all the NT rules to see if any production ends with 't53'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT1 \u2192 after substitution, it becomes 't69' and 't36' (since NT18 -> 't69' and NT1 -> 't28', but wait no, in the rules, NT1 is 't25'. Wait, looking at the rules, NT19 \u2192 't28', and NT59\u2192NT18 NT1, which is 't69' and 't25'? No, wait, looking at the rules, NT18 \u2192 't69' and NT1... Let me check NT1:\n\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41 \u2192 which then becomes 't28' (since NT19 \u2192 't28') and 't77' (since NT41 \u2192 't77'). So NT18 would produce 't69' and 't25'. Similarly, NT1 would produce 't28' and 't77'. Therefore, NT59 would produce 't69' and 't25', which doesn't include 't53'.\n\nLooking further, I'm trying to find a non-terminal that can directly produce 't53'. Wait, looking in the rules, I see that NT59 is 't69' and 't25'; NT33 is 't73' and 't3'. No 't53' so far. Wait, what about NT20 \u2192 't26', and NT29 \u2192 't5'. Let me see:\n\nLooking through all NT rules:\n\n- NT52 -> 't7' and 't49' (since NT52->NT14 NT32, which breaks down into 't42' and 't57'), but wait no, NT52 has production rules, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their productions to see if any produce 't53'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, maybe a typo? Let me check. Oh, the grammar provided starts with S->NT48 NT11, and I'm looking through the rules, but 'NT48' doesn't appear again. Hmm, maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps NT48 is supposed to be another rule. But looking through, I don't see NT48 defined as anything, so maybe this is an error. Alternatively, perhaps the indices might be different, but in the given grammar, NT48 isn't defined. Similarly, NT11 is present.\n\nWait, in the grammar, S->NT48 NT11, but looking through all the productions:\n\nLooking for NT48: I don't see a production for NT48. The closest is NT44, NT49, etc. So maybe it's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be NT34 or something. Or perhaps it's an example mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the NT numbers match the indices elsewhere. But regardless, let me check the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't81', which is a terminal. So looking at the terminal productions, let me see which NTs produce t81. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT30 -> 't84'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT37 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT11 -> 't31'\n- NT9 -> 't25'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT52 -> 't7' (twice)\n- NT33 -> 't76' (also present here)\n- NT14 -> 't42'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT52 -> 't25' (added again)\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT59 -> 't12'\n- NT49 -> 't81'\n- NT7 -> 't53'\n- NT28 -> 't59'\n- NT14 -> 't42'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT35 -> 't27'\n- NT21 -> 't33' (wait, that's not in the string)\n- NT48 -> 't68'\n- NT49 -> 't47'\n\nWait, looking at the NT49 production, it can produce 't81'. So, in the string, the second token is 't19'. Looking through the NT productions, NT19 doesn't appear in the list, so that's an issue. Wait, the string is:\n\nt81 t19 t7 t65 t32 t47 t76 t15 t58 t66\n\nWait, the second token is 't19'. Let me check if any NT produces 't19'. Looking at the terminal productions, I see NT19 isn't present. The closest is NT11 -> 't31', NT18->'t69'. So 't19' isn't directly a terminal; it must be produced by some NT.\n\nWait, but looking back, maybe I missed some NT productions. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nI don't see any production that results in 't19' directly. So 't19' must be part of the NT that eventually leads to a terminal. Let's see if any NT can produce 't19'. Maybe a chain that ends in 't19'.\n\nBut in the grammar, none of the NTs seem to directly produce 't19'. So perhaps the string cannot be generated, but wait, let's check other elements.\n\nLooking at the first token: 't81'. As I saw, NT49 can produce 't81' because NT49 -> NT11 NT6, and NT11 -> 't31', NT6 -> 't4', but wait no, under the terminal productions, NT6 is 't4', NT58 is 't31', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me list the terminal productions again from the grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided productions:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT30 -> 't84'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT37 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT11 -> 't31'\n- NT9 -> 't25'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT52 -> 't7' (twice)\n- NT33 -> 't76'\n- NT14 -> 't42'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT52 -> 't25' (this is a mistake? Wait, earlier I saw NT52->t7 and NT52->t25). So, NT52 can produce 't7' and 't25'.\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT59 -> 't12'\n- NT49 -> 't81'\n- NT7 -> 't53'\n- NT28 -> 't59'\n- NT14 -> 't42'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT35 -> 't27'\n- NT21 -> 't33' (though this isn't in the string)\n- NT48->'t68'\n- NT49->'t47'\n- NT18->'t69'\n- etc.\n\nSo, for 't81', it's only produced by NT49.\n\nThen, looking at the string, the first token is 't81', so the initial production must be S->... and the first step is to produce 't81' via NT49.\n\nWait, but according to the initial production, S->NT48 NT11. But NT48 isn't defined, so perhaps it's a typo and should be NT34 or another index. Alternatively, perhaps the correct production is S->NT48 NT11, but this would mean NT48 produces 't68' as per the production NT48 -> 't68'. So S would generate NT48 (which gives 't68') and NT11 (which gives 't31'), making the first part of the string 't68 t31'. But the provided string starts with 't81 t19 t7...'. So this suggests that perhaps the initial production is not matching, leading to a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is correct, but the string can't be generated because S's first step is to produce something else.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me start over.\n\nThe string is \"t81 t19 t7 t65 t32 t47 t76 t15 t58 t66\".\n\nEach token is a terminal, so I need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst token: 't81' \u2014 produced by NT49. So that's NT49.\n\nWhat produces NT49? Looking at the production rules, I don't see NT49 on the left side. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nS->NT48 NT11\n\nNT48 isn't defined, so perhaps the correct index is different. Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the grammar provided, and it should be NT34 or another number. Alternatively, maybe NT49 is the one that's actually needed. But looking at the productions:\n\nIn the terminal productions, only NT49->'t81' exists. So in the initial step, S must produce NT49 in the first position, but in the given grammar, S->NT48 NT11. So unless NT48 can somehow produce 't81', which it can't because it doesn't have a production that starts with 't81' \u2014 looking at NT48, perhaps it's undefined or something. Wait, no terminal production for NT48, because in the provided grammar, for example, NT48 is mentioned only as S->NT48"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that context-free grammars (CFGs) in Chomsky normal form (CNF) have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that every production seems to fit this structure. Some start with NT and some with 't'. Wait, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't76', 't15', etc.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. To derive a string of terminals, each step in the derivation decreases the number of non-terminals. So, for example, starting from S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or with a terminal. Ultimately, we should end up with a string of terminals, which is the input string.\n\nThe first step is to build the derivation tree for the string. Alternatively, since the string is given, I can check if each consecutive pair of 't's in the string can be derived from a production.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model this as a parsing problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm or memoization to check if the string is in the language. However, since I'm doing this manually, I might need a more straightforward method.\n\nLet's list all the productions and terminals:\n\nStart symbol S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nNT productions:\nNT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13\nNT12 \u2192 NT31 NT58\nNT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\nNT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33\nNT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1\nNT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57\nNT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1\nNT34 \u2192 NT9 NT14\nNT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11\nNT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44\nNT1 \u2192 NT19 NT41\nNT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\nNT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\nNT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32\nNT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57\nNT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\nNT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59\nNT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25\nNT37 \u2192 NT13 NT34\nNT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45\nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1\nNT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7\nNT31 \u2192 NT8 NT35\nNT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\nNT35 \u2192 't3' or 't76' (Wait, let me check)\nNT52 \u2192 't7', 't58', 't10', etc.\nNT44 \u2192 't68' or 't73' or 't43'?\nWait, no. Looking back, NT44 has several productions: NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1 and also in CNF, but in the given grammar, the productions for NT44 are NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1, so I think I might have misread earlier.\n\nWait, let's parse the grammar correctly. Let me list all the productions to make sure I don't make a mistake here.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so S is the start symbol.\n\nNow, each NT (Non-Terminal, like NT48, NT11, etc.) has productions. For example, NT48 \u2192 NT52 NT76.\n\nWait, no, actually in the provided grammar, each line is like \"NTx \u2192 NTy NTz\", except for the 't' terminals.

Similarly, other NTs may lead to 't's.\n\nAlso, looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, S produces two NTs: NT48 and NT11.\n\nEach NT in turn is replaced by other NTs or eventually by terminals.\n\nTo derive the given string, we need to find a sequence of productions that transforms S into the string consisting of 't83 t15 t72 t7 t76 t19 t69 t55 t49 t7'.\n\nWait, but this is a string of terminals. So, in terms of the derivation, we start with S (which is a non-terminal), and through a series of productions, we replace each non-terminal until we get all terminals.\n\nTo model this, let's consider that each application of a production reduces the count of non-terminals. Since we start with two non-terminals (NT48 and NT11), the derivation must build up from that.\n\nBut considering the string has 10 't's and spaces, and each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal, perhaps it's better to see if each consecutive pair of 't's in the string can be connected via the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look at the start symbol S's productions and see if they can lead to the string, but this might be complex.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be the result of a single production rule, specifically where a non-terminal is replaced by a single 't'.\n\nLooking back, some NTs directly lead to terminal symbols:\n\nNT33 yields 't76' or 't30'\n\nNT35 has NT35 \u2192 't3' or 't76' (Wait, in the grammar, NT35 is defined as 't3' and 't76'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT35 -> 't3' ?\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, NT35 isn't directly a terminal.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.

Wait, no, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking at the production lines:\n\nNT33 can produce 't73' or 't30'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't73'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't76'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't77'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, perhaps for each terminal, I can find what NT it comes from.\n\nLet me list each terminal and which NT it is derived from:\n\n- t42: looking at productions, which NT produces 't42'? Looking through the list, I don't see any NT's production that directly outputs 't42'. Wait, maybe it's part of a longer derivation. Alternatively, perhaps it's derived from an NT through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map all the terminals to their parent NTs.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t27: looking at the productions, let's see. What NTs derive to t27? Looking, under NT35: NT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, checking the list, I see:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44.\n\nWait, no, that's an NT derivation to two Nts, not a terminal.\n\nLooking back, I think it's best to map each terminal to which NT can produce it directly.\n\nSo, let me go through each terminal in the string and find if any NT produces it:\n\nt42: Look through the production list for any NT \u2192 t42, but it seems none of the Nts directly produce t42 as a terminal. So perhaps t42 is derived from some NT that can produce t42 through a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps that's an issue. Because in the given grammar, most of the terminals are in the form of single letters, but some Nts produce pairs of Nts, which can then produce terminals through further expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken, and some NTs do produce terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, each production is either NT1 \u2192 NT2 NT3 or NT4 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT33 \u2192 't73' and NT33 \u2192 't30'. So these are two Nts that produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT30 \u2192 't84', but looking through the list, maybe another NT produces 't42'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check each NT's production:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n1. NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT59\n\n2. NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1\n\n3. NT47 \u2192 NT48 NT44\n\n...\n\nLooking for any NT that produces t42:\n\nWait, is there an NT that directly produces 't42'? It doesn't seem so, as most Nts either produce other Nts or single terminals like 't7', 't25', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let's think again: perhaps t42 is produced indirectly.\n\nSo, let's imagine a parse tree where, for example, a root NT (like S) produces two Nts, which further produce terminals. So, perhaps one of the Nts in the string is S, which then breaks down into other Nts that expand into the terminals.\n\nBut that's a bit vague. Maybe it's better to work step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if each terminal can be reached by some expansion path.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to consider each symbol in the string and see how they can be grouped.\n\nLooking at the string: t42 t47 t83 t7 t66 t30 t36 t58 t24 t65 t27.\n\nI can list them as [t42, t47, t83, t7, t66, t30, t36, t58, t24, t65, t27].\n\nNow, perhaps each of these terminals is produced by some NT, which themselves are connected via the grammar.\n\nLet me list each terminal and perhaps the NT that produces it:\n\n- t42: Let's see if any NT can derive this. Looking through, perhaps NT44 can be a problem since it's defined as NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT49. No, not directly.\n\nWait, maybe starting from the end.\n\nLet me look at the terminal t27.\n\nLooking through the productions, I think NT35 can derive it. Wait, no. Because NT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44, which are NTs, not terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the NTs, perhaps t27 is directly produced by some NT.

{"custom_id":"request-184","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t83 t68 t7 t83 t55 t76 t25 t58 t58 t77 t7`, and I have the grammar provided with a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This grammar looks to be in CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals, so I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of expansions.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the start is S, and it generates two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11.\n\nNow, each of these NTs eventually leads to a terminal. My goal is to trace how these NTs resolve into the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: `t83 t68 t7 t83 t55 t76 t25 t58 t58 t77 t7`. It's a sequence of 11 terminals. Let me count: 1. t83, 2. t68, 3. t7, 4. t83, 5. t55, 6. t76, 7. t25, 8. t58, 9. t58, 10. t77, 11. t7.\n\nI notice that t7 appears twice, at positions 3 and 11, which might be important.\n\nLet's try to figure out the derivation steps. The string should be built by expanding S through the rules, and the order should match the leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo we have NT48 and NT11. These will each expand into sequences of non-terminals and terminals that ultimately resolve to the terminals in the string.\n\nI think the string is built by a series of nested productions, so perhaps each NT is expanding into parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT48 in the grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So NT48 expands to NT49 and NT6.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT6, it's in multiple places. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, but wait, no, specifically, NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49 is in the grammar? Let me check the provided rules.\n\nYes, looking back, I see NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Wait, in the grammar provided, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT6 -> NT52 NT49. So indeed, NT6 is NT52 and NT49.\n\nBut wait, NT48 is NT49 and NT6. So expanding NT48: first it becomes NT49 and NT6, and then each of those can expand further.\n\nWait, but NT49\u2019s productions: looking through, I see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So each time NT49 appears, it's replaced by NT11 and NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 can be replaced by NT52 and NT49.\n\nWait, so let me try to map this step by step.\n\nLet me see: S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6.\n\nSo the string is starting with NT49 and NT6. Then, each of these will be replaced as we go deeper.\n\nLet me see what NT49 becomes: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So NT49 now is NT11 and NT6.\n\nThen, the string is now NT11, NT6, NT11 (from the original S's NT11).\n\nEach of these NTs is being expanded.\n\nLooking at NT11: It has productions like NT11\u2192 NT41 NT49, but also NT11\u2192 NT41 NT49 in multiple places? Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nYes, that's one option, and another is perhaps NT11-> something else? Let me check. Hmm, I see NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 only.\n\nSo NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. But NT41 \u2192 NT77. Wait, NT77 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT77 as a non-terminal on the left-hand side. Instead, I see NT20 \u2192 't26', so 't20' is a terminal. So maybe NT77 is a terminal? Wait no, NT77 is not a non-terminal, it's in the output of NT55. Wait, looking at the rules, for example, NT55 \u2192 't72'\u2014so a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check: NT77 is mentioned in the rules. Looking at the grammar, 'NT77' is on the right-hand side of some productions? Or is it a terminal? Let's see.\n\nIn the rules, I see NT77 \u2192 't77'? No, wait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't84'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't58'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n\nSo, 't77' is not directly a terminal; it's a production of NT77. Wait, is NT77 a non-terminal? I think all NTs are non-terminals since they are on the left-hand side. So perhaps NT55 \u2192 't72' is a terminal.\n\nWait, let me clarify: some NTs produce terminals, others produce non-terminals. For example, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, which are NTs. But some NTs produce terminals, like NT33 \u2192 't73', NT30 \u2192 't84', etc.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar mapping, there are several production rules where NTs produce terminals like NT33 \u2192 't73', which would mean that NT33 is a non-terminal that produces the terminal 't73'.\n\nSo, in the string, when I see a 't' followed by a number, it must come from a non-terminal production that outputs that 't'.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I need to see if each 't' in the string can be generated by a NT's production rule.\n\nNow, the string is:\n\nt83 t68 t7 t83 t55 t76 t25 t58 t58 t77 t7.\n\nLet me write these as a list:\n\n1. t83\n\n2. t68\n\n3. t7\n\n4. t83\n\n5. t55\n\n6. t76\n\n7. t25\n\n8. t58\n\n9. t58\n\n10. t77\n\n11. t7\n\nI need to see if these can be generated by the grammar through leftmost derivation.\n\nThe grammar is in CNF, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSince the string is being produced, the derivations would involve a leftmost expansion until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, giving the resulting string.\n\nLet me start by trying to map the start symbol S:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, NT48 and NT11 will be expanded.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6.\n\nSo, S expands to NT49 NT6 NT11.\n\nNext, the next non-terminal to expand is the first one in the string, which is t83. So NT49 must produce the first terminal.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, that's another expansion. So NT49 is expanding to NT11 and NT6.\n\nTherefore, after expansion, we have NT11, NT6, NT11.\n\nNow, NT11 needs to produce t83. Looking at the rules, NT11 can produce NT41 NT49. Hmm, but that's another NT, so perhaps another expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe initial expansion is S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nThen, NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6, so we have NT49 NT6 NT11.\n\nNow, the next step in derivation is to expand NT49, which is the first non-terminal in the current string.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.\n\nSo, after this expansion, the NTs are NT11, NT6, NT6, NT11.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me recount:\n\nWait, starting with S: [NT48, NT11] \u2192 expanding NT48 first.\n\nAfter expansion, NT48 \u2192 NT49, NT6.\n\nSo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-207","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is produced by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t15 t58 t72 t4 t53 t68 t84 t42 t66 t42 t42 t19`. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that context-free grammars define languages using production rules. The given grammar starts with S and has various non-terminals (like NT12, NT11, etc.) that produce other non-terminals or terminals (like 't30', 't4', etc.), which are the actual symbols in the strings.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. Some of these might represent terminals from the grammar. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me look at the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production is S -> NT48 NT11. So, the very first step is that S must produce NT48 and NT11. That means the first two elements in the string should correspond to NT48 and NT11 productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t15 t58 t72 t4 t53 t68 t84 t42 t66 t42 t42 t19`. The first two tokens are 't15' and 't58'. So, I need to check if NT48 can produce 't15' and NT11 can produce 't58'.\n\nLooking at NT48, from the grammar: NT48 -> 't48' according to the rule. But wait, the first token is 't15', not 't48'. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find if there's another way to produce NT48, but looking through the rules, I don't see NT48 producing anything else\u2014it directly goes to 't48'. Similarly, NT11's production is NT11 -> NT41 NT6. So, NT11 can't directly produce 't58'. Let me check NT58's rules: NT58 -> NT31 NT33. Those are both non-terminals, or perhaps can produce the actual 't' tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the string is a series of terminal symbols. So each 't' followed by a number must come from one of the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me see if I can parse the entire string by using the productions.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to reconstruct the parse tree starting from S.\n\nS -> NT48 NT11. So, the first part is NT48, and the second is NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48's production: It can only directly produce 't48'. So the first token in the string must be 't48'. But in the string, the first token is 't15', which doesn't match. So that would mean S can't produce the given string because the first two tokens can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Looking through all the rules, NT48 is only 't48' and NT11 is NT41 NT6. So, the first token of the string must be 't48' if it starts with NT48. But in our string, it's 't15', which is not 't48'. Therefore, it's impossible for S to produce the string because NT48 doesn't produce 't15' and NT11 doesn't produce 't15' either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing the start symbol. Wait, S produces NT48 and NT11. So, the first two tokens should be the results of NT48 and NT11. So, 't15' is from NT48, which cannot be, because NT48 only produces 't48'. Unless I can combine NT48 and NT11 into something else, but that doesn't seem to be the case. NT11 is a non-terminal that can go to NT41 and NT6. So, perhaps the NT48 is already a terminal, meaning that the first token must be 't48'.\n\nSince the string starts with 't15', which is not 't48', the string cannot be produced by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-203","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I just need to figure out if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure. The grammar is given in a list format where each line represents a production rule. For example, the first line is S -> NT48 NT11, which means the start symbol S expands into the two symbols NT48 and NT11. Each production rule seems to be in CNF, which I remember stands for Chomsky Normal Form. In CNF, every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, it's important that there are no epsilon productions, which I don't see here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t12 t30 t73 t72 t65 t24 t10 t58 t26 t49 t22`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the given production rules.\n\nI think I should start by analyzing the grammar to see which symbols correspond to terminals and which are non-terminals. Looking at the right-hand sides of the production rules, if a rule's RHS contains only terminals, then that non-terminal must produce those terminals. But sometimes, rules can have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, which complicates things.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the RHS can't have mixtures unless the productions allow for those, but I think each production only has non-terminals or terminals. So in the given grammar, any production that has terminals on the RHS must be terminal symbols. So I can look through the entire grammar and identify which symbols are terminals.\n\nLooking through the RHS, I see lines like NT33 -> 't76' and NT33 -> 't30'. Similarly, NT41 -> 't77', NT7 -> 't36', etc. So these are terminals. The other symbols like NT48, NT11, NT44, etc., are non-terminals because they don't have terminals in their productions; their productions only involve other non-terminals, except for the cases where they have terminals.\n\nWait, no, sometimes a non-terminal's production might have a mix, but in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS or a single terminal. So in the given grammar, every production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, which means that all the RHSs with 't' are terminals, and the others must be non-terminals that can still be expanded.\n\nBut wait, looking back, for example, S -> NT48 NT11. If NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals, then we need a way to expand them further. So perhaps we need to find a derivation starting from S and expanding until we get all terminals.\n\nLet me try to simplify the problem. Let's represent each symbol (like NT12, NT48, etc.) as nodes, and their parent productions. Then, the string provided consists of a sequence of terminals: `t12, t12, t30, t73, t72, t65, t24, t10, t58, t26, t49, t22`.\n\nSo, the string is 12 tokens long. Each token is a terminal, so to generate this string, each NT in the grammar must eventually produce exactly one terminal each time they are expanded. Wait, no\u2014since it's a context-free grammar, each NT can be expanded multiple times, but each expansion step produces a certain number of symbols.\n\nWait no, in CNF, each production on the left-hand side (LHS) is expanded into two LHS symbols or one terminal. So each expansion step increases the number of symbols by one. For example, if I have S -> A B, then A and B can be non-terminals that themselves expand further.\n\nSince the string in question is 12 terminals, and each expansion step adds one symbol, starting from S (which is one symbol), the number of steps needed to reach the string would be 12-1=11 steps, hence a derivation of length 12. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a tree where S is the root, and each node is a non-terminal, expanding into its children, and so on, until the leaves are all terminals matching the given string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backward from the string. Each terminal in the string must be the result of a rule that directly produces a single terminal. So I can check if each terminal in the string can be matched by some production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for each terminal, I need to see if there's a production rule that directly produces it. For example, t12 is produced by NT20 -> 't26', but wait, t26 is not t12. Hmm, maybe I need to look for rules that have 'tX' on the RHS. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> NT19 NT41\n- NT31 -> NT20 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT12 NT43\n- NT47 -> NT48 NT37\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT57 -> NT9 NT37\n- NT8 -> 't69'\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT33 -> 't76' and 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't84', 't22', 't35', etc.\n- NT35 -> 't3', 't27'\n- NT40 -> 't65', 't28', etc.\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- And more, like NT13 -> 't5', etc.\n\nWait, looking closely, are there any rules that produce t12, t12, t30, etc.?\n\nLooking for t12: checking the rules, I see that NT30 -> 't84', 't22', 't53', etc., but no direct production for t12 except in NT30 and NT12, but NT12 is involved in productions.\n\nWait, looking again, the string includes 't12' as the first and second tokens. So, we need to find a way for the grammar to produce each 't12' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT30 -> 't84', 't22', 't53', etc.\n- NT12 -> NT39 NT32\n- So maybe NT12 can expand into NT39 and NT32, each of which might expand further.\n\nWait, but we also have a rule that says NT52 -> 't7', 't58' (from 't7' and 't58'), that is:\n\nLooking back, I think I misread earlier lines. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT52 appears on the RHS in a few places, such as NT44 -> NT12 NT57, NT55 -> NT21 NT59, etc. Wait, looking at NT52: NT52 -> NT14 NT32, NT49 -> NT16 NT7, etc. But I think my earlier mapping may have been wrong.\n\nWait, I think I need to go step by step. Let's look for all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76' (twice)\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT33 -> 't58'\n- NT33 -> 't83'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT35 -> 't27'\n- NT40 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT18 -> 't69', NT13 -> 't5', etc.\n\nWait, no, looking again at the entire grammar, I think I might have gotten some lines wrong earlier. Let me list all the productions that have terminals.\n\nHere's a list:\n\nLooking for any NT symbol and in the RHS, a string of 't' followed by a number.\n\n- NT33 -> 't76' (twice)\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't84', 't22', 't53', etc. Wait, looking again: line 14? Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, I think it's easier to look line by line and note which symbols produce terminals.\n\nLet me number each line and check:\n\n1. S -> NT48 NT11\n2. NT44 -> NT42 NT13\n3.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it a bit easier to parse. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way where all the production rules are either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which initially produces NT48 NT11. So, S -> NT48 NT11. Then, each of these NT (non-terminals) will have their own productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of terminals: t7, t3, t53, etc., all separated by spaces. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process must proceed in a way that each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut wait, sometimes a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal. Let me check the productions for some terminals. For example, in the given grammar, I see that NT33 can produce either 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, NT35 can produce 't3' or other things, but it also has rules leading to more non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string has 13 tokens: t7, t3, t53, t77, t58, t5, t84, t27, t66, t15, t32, t73, t19. Let me think about how this could be built.\n\nSince S starts with NT48 NT11, these are the first two parts. So, the string starts with t7 and t3, which could correspond to NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48 -> NT58 NT25. Wait, but in the string, the next after t7 is t3, so maybe that's not the path. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the string and see possible paths through the grammar.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so we're looking for a derivation path that produces this sequence. Let me approach this by trying to parse the string backwards, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to see if each step in the string can be broken down into the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t7. Let's see where t7 can come from. In the grammar, NT7 -> NT12 NT43, and then NT12 -> NT39 NT32. Wait, but NT43 might have more rules. Let me check: NT43 -> NT35 NT37, and NT35 -> NT40 NT1, etc. This seems a bit complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see which parts of the string correspond to which non-terminals. For instance, t7 appears in NT7, which is part of NT7's rule NT7 -> NT12 NT43. So, maybe t7 is in NT12 or NT43 somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.

In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol can't be on the right side of a production. So, the given grammar seems to be in CNF because all the productions on the right have two non-terminals or end with terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t66 t32 t26 t32 t19 t27 t19 t48 t12 t49 t30 t25 t68`. I need to see if this string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the top symbol (S) and see if I can derive it.\n\nThe initial string starts with t66. Looking at the grammar, I see that there must be a production that directly produces t66. Scanning through the productions, I see NT6 -> t4. Wait, no, NT6 is a non-terminal that produces t4, not t66. There might be another approach.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the right side of a production is either another non-terminal or a terminal. The string consists of terminals, so each part of the string must come from a terminal production.\n\nI'll list all the terminals present in the string: t66, t32, t26, t32, t19, t27, t19, t48, t12, t49, t30, t25, t68.\n\nNow, I'll check if each of these terminals has a production rule. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- t66: NT40 \u2192 t65. But that's t65, not t66.\n- t48: NT48 \u2192 t68? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 t68.\n\nWait, no, NT48 is not a non-terminal. Oh wait, the productions are from NT48, so NT48 produce terminals. Let's check:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68. Yep, that's one.\n\nSo first, t68 comes from NT48. So the first symbol is t68, but our string starts with t66, which is different. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I misread the grammar?\n\nWait, let me look again. Oh, wait, I think I might have mixed up the indices. Let me check for t66.\n\nLooking for a production where a non-terminal produces t66. Scanning through:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t65. Not 66.\n- NT49 \u2192 t81. No.\n- NT16 \u2192 t26. No.\n- NT59 \u2192 t12. No.\n- NT31 \u2192 t20. No.\n- NT44 \u2192 t73. No.\n- NT35 \u2192 t3. No.\n- NT11 \u2192 t12. No.\n- NT52 \u2192 t10. No.\n- NT45 \u2192 t1. No.\n- NT29 \u2192 t25. No.\n- NT7 \u2192 t53. No.\n- NT25 \u2192 t58. No.\n- NT21 \u2192 t33. No.\n- NT37 \u2192 t32. No.\n- NT19 \u2192 t30. No.\n- NT30 \u2192 t22. No.\n- NT55 \u2192 t83. No.\n- NT33 \u2192 't73'. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong index. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT52: NT52 \u2192 t7. No. Wait, NT52 also has:\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32. Then NT14 -> t42, so NT52 can produce t42 through NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32 \u2192 t42 t32.\n\nWait, maybe each step can produce multiple outputs. But in the string, they are all single t's. So I think I need to check where each t in the string is derived from.\n\nWait, the string is: t66 t32 t26 t32 t19 t27 t19 t48 t12 t49 t30 t25 t68.\n\nEach t is an individual terminal symbol, as opposed to being a string themselves. So each t in the string is a production that directly from a non-terminal that produces that t.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Each production rule produces a sequence of symbols (non-terminals or terminals). So, to get a single t in the string, that t must come from a production rule that's directly a terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, which terminals are directly produced by a single non-terminal? Let's list each non-terminal and their rules:\n\n- NT33: two rules, production to 't73' and 't30'.\n- NT35: two rules, 't3' and 't5'.\n- NT11: 't12'.\n- NT31: 't20'.\n- NT41: 't77'.\n- NT40: 't65'.\n- NT29: 't5'.\n- NT52: 't7', but also two productions to NT14 NT32 and another to NT7 NT35.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar is as follows:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces a lone terminal.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT33: two productions, both to terminals t30 and t73. So NT33 can produce 't30' or 't73'.\n- NT35: two productions, both to terminals t3 and t5.\n- NT11: 't12'.\n- NT31: 't20'.\n- NT41: 't77'.\n- NT40: 't65'.\n- NT29: 't5'.\n- NT52 has two productions: NT14 NT32 and NT7 NT35. So NT52 needs two non-terminals, but since we're building the string symbol by symbol, maybe this is a longer string production.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a sequence of t symbols, each possibly from a terminal production.\n\nAlternatively, the string could be built by sequences of non-terminals and then each non-terminal expanding to a terminal.\n\nBut considering that the given string is only made up of single-character terminals, each of those must be the result of direct productions by non-terminals. So, for example, if the string starts with t66, then there must be a non-terminal NT that can produce t66. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal with a production rule that directly produces t66. Let me check:\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT40: 't65'\n- NT6: 't4'\n- NT44: 't73'\n- NT49: 't81'\n- NT33: 't73' and 't30'\n- NT35: 't3' and 't5'\n- NT11: 't12'\n- NT31: 't20'\n- NT41: 't77'\n- NT29: 't5'\n- NT52: 't7' and two more rules. Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nLooking more carefully at NT52. Oh, I see. There's a production NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32 and also NT52 \u2192 NT7 NT35. Additionally, earlier in the list, NT52 also produces t7:\n\nNo, in the initial grammar as provided, the productions for NT52 are:\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\n\nNT52 -> NT7 NT35\n\nAlso, I notice that there are two NT52 productions but no direct 't7' from NT52. Hmm, so actually, NT52 as per the initial list does not have a direct production for 't7' or 't66'. So that would mean that 't66' is not directly produced by any NT in the grammar. Therefore, the given string cannot be generated because the first symbol t66 has no corresponding production.\n\nWait, but the initial list of grammar productions might be longer. Let me double-check because sometimes when you copy, you might miss some.\n\nIn the given grammar, looking at NT52: it has the production NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32 and NT52 \u2192 NT7 NT35. So, no direct 't7' from NT52. Therefore, the only way to get t66 is if t66 is a terminal in some production, and perhaps through a chain of non-terminals.\n\nWait, no.

The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Let me list out all the non-terminals and terminals from the grammar provided.\n\nNon-terminals (N) in the grammar:\nS, NT11, NT12, NT14, NT19, NT20, NT21, NT25, NT29, NT31, NT32, NT33, NT34, NT35, NT37, NT39, NT40, NT41, NT42, NT43, NT44, NT45, NT47, NT48, NT49, NT52, NT55, NT57, NT58, NT59, NT6, NT7, NT30.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the productions more carefully. Each production starts with a capital letter on the left, which could be a non-terminal. On the right, each production has either two non-terminals or sometimes a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, it might be helpful to identify which of these non-terminals are leaves (i.e., produce terminals) and which are internal (produce more non-terminals). From the given grammar, for example:\n\nNT33 -> 't73' \u2192 this is a terminal production.\n\nSimilarly, NT35 -> 't3' and NT7 -> 't36' etc.\n\nSo some of these non-terminals produce terminals, others produce two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to test is: t19 t65 t7 t83 t19 t15 t68 t4 t55 t7 t81 t27 t24 t53.\n\nI notice that each symbol is a terminal (they all end with numbers or 't'). So my job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recap the grammar provided. The grammar has a series of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT6, NT7, etc.) breaks down into two other non-terminals until we reach terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by a number. So each production is of the form A -> BC, where A and B\/C are non-terminals, except for the terminals.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate starts with a series of 't' terms, each with a different number. I think the first step is to figure out the structure of the string in terms of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string, the first few symbols are t65, t66, t58, etc. I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol S is defined as S -> NT48 NT11. So according to the grammar, S splits into NT48 and NT11. Let me write that down: S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNow, each of these NT's must then be rewritten until we get to the terminals. Let's take NT48 first. Looking at the grammar, NT48 is immediately replaced by 't68'. So NT48 \u2192 t68. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, NT11: What's NT11's production? From the grammar, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So we need to replace NT41 and NT49.\n\nLet's start with NT41: Looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t77. So NT41 becomes t77.\n\nNow, NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7. So we need to break down NT16 and NT7.\n\nNT16 \u2192 t26 (from the grammar, I see NT16 \u2192 t26). So NT16 is t26.\n\nNow, NT7: Looking through the grammar, NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43. So we need to replace NT12 and NT43.\n\nNT12: I see NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32. So we need to break down NT39 and NT32.\n\nNT39 \u2192 t40 (looking at the grammar, NT39 is 't40'). So NT39 is t40.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57. Wait, that can't be right because NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57, but NT39 is 't40' and NT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37.\n\nLet me correct that: NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57. So replace both NT39 and NT57.\n\nNT39 \u2192 t40 (from the grammar, I see NT39 -> t40).\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37. So now, we need to replace NT9 and NT37.\n\nNT9 \u2192 t25 (from the grammar, NT9 \u2192 t25).\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35. Both of these need to be replaced.\n\nNT30 \u2192 t84 (grammar shows NT30 \u2192 t84).\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3 (grammar, looking at NT35, it's t3).\n\nWait, but NT35 is rewritten as t3. But t3 is a string, but in the grammar, is it a terminal? Because in the string we have 't65', 't66', etc., which are all terminals. So NT35 \u2192 t3 would be a terminal, right? Yes, because in the grammar, NT35 \u2192 t3. So that's fine.\n\nPutting that together:\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3\n\nSo NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35 \u2192 t84 t3\n\nNow, going back up:\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37 \u2192 t25 t84 t3\n\nSo NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57 \u2192 t40 t25 t84 t3\n\nNow, going back to NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32 \u2192 t40 t25 t40 t25 t84 t3\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\n\nNT39 \u2192 t40\n\nNT32 \u2192 t40 t25 t84 t3\n\nSo putting it together, NT12 \u2192 t40 t40 t25 t84 t3? That seems a bit lengthy, but let's move on.\n\nNow, going back to NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43 \u2192 t40 t40 t25 t84 t3 NT43\n\nNext, NT43 \u2192 t55 (grammar shows NT43 \u2192 t55).\n\nSo now, the string becomes t40 t40 t25 t84 t3 t55.\n\nWait, but let me recount that to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nWait, I think I might have messed up the chain. Let me go step by step again.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n\nNT41 \u2192 t77\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7\n\nNT16 \u2192 t26\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\n\nNT39 \u2192 t40\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57\n\nNT39 \u2192 t40\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37\n\nNT9 \u2192 t25\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35\n\nNT30 \u2192 t84\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nNT7 (from NT11 replacement) \u2192 NT12 NT43 \u2192 NT39 NT32 NT43 \u2192 t40 NT32 NT43 \u2192 t40 (NT32) (NT43)\n\nNow, NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57 \u2192 t40 NT57 \u2192 t40 (t40) (NT57)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me write it more systematically.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 NT11\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 \u2192 t77 NT49\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7 \u2192 t26 NT7\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43 \u2192 NT12 t43\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32 \u2192 NT39 t32\n\nNT39 \u2192 t40\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57 \u2192 t40 NT57\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37 \u2192 t25 NT37\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35 \u2192 t84 t3\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire string would be:\n\nt68 t77 t26 (from NT7's first part) t40 (from NT39) t25 (from NT57) t84 t3 (from NT37) t43.\n\nBut wait, that's t68 t77 t26 t40 t25 t84 t3 t43. But the original string is \"t65 t66 t58 t24 t30 t28 t24 t22 t49 t83 t30 t68 t73 t84\". So this seems to be quite a different sequence.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to check other branches. Perhaps S doesn't derive to just that one path. Or perhaps I missed a different replacement in NT11.\n\nWait, in the initial step, when we have S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the NT11 is NT41 NT49, and we took NT41 \u2192 t77. But maybe there are multiple ways to expand NT41? No, in the grammar, each non-terminal has exactly one production. So NT41 \u2192 t77, nothing else.\n\nBut wait, let me look at the list again to verify. The grammar is provided in a list where each line is of the form <Non-terminal> -> <Two parts>. So, for example, the first line is S->NT48 NT11, which is non-terminal S rewritten as NT48 and NT11.\n\nThen, looking for NT48, I don't see it further down except in that first line, so perhaps other non-terminals derive to it. Let me check the grammar for NT48.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT48 is first mentioned as S->NT48 NT11. I don't see any other production for NT48 later on.

Hmm, where to start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. That means for a string to be in the language, each token in the string (split by spaces here) must correspond to a terminal right-hand side of a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals (like NT44) have productions, but many of them eventually lead to terminals like 't76', 't30', 't65', etc. So each 't' number is a terminal.\n\nThe string has several 't's: t15, t3, t36, t32, t84, t72, t26, t25, t65, t47, t69, t19, t65, t4, t72. I need to check if each of these is a terminal, which they all are, so that's a good sign.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, each leading to exactly two terminals or non-terminals. The string has 15 tokens, so the derivation must have a certain structure. Each step in the derivation should consist of replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols, leading to a leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact parse tree, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I should try to find a way to break down the string into the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a method where I construct the parse tree starting from the initial symbol S and see if it can derive to the given string.\n\nLet me look at the initial symbol S. The rule for S is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, S splits into NT48 and NT11. Each of these needs to generate substrings of the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t15 and t3. That makes me think that NT48 should produce t15 and something else, and NT11 should produce t3 and something else. Wait, no\u2014since each step in the rule leads to two symbols, maybe NT48 \u2192 t15 and something, and NT11 \u2192 t3 and something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think recursively. Let's start by trying to match the entire string to S. So the entire string should be divided into two parts according to S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first part would be from left to some point, generating the first part, and the second part from that point would generate the second part.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t15. Let's see which NT can produce t15. Looking at the productions, I see NT13 \u2192 t5 and t19, but wait, NT13 isn't there. Wait, let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, t15 is in NT35 \u2192 t27 t5, and NT37 \u2192 t48 t13 (wait, no), and NT35 also has \u2192 t27 t5. Wait, maybe I'm missing others.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, let's list out all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n- NT40 -> 't65'\n- NT14 -> 't76'\n- NT8 -> 't69'\n- NT16 -> 't26'\n- NT47 -> 't48'\n- NT13 -> 't5'\n- NT52 -> 't7'\n- NT25 -> 't58'\n- NT59 -> 't24'\n- NT14 -> 't76'\n- NT8 -> 't69'\n- NT16 -> 't26'\n- NT47 -> 't48'\n- NT13 -> 't19'\n- NT52 -> 't10'\n- NT37 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT11 -> 't31'\n- NT30 -> 't84'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT19 -> 't28'\n- NT30 -> 't10'\n- NT7 -> 't53'\n- NT12 -> 't37'\n- NT52 -> 't55'\n- NT18 -> 't69'\n- NT28 -> 't59'\n- NT14 -> 't42'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT35 -> 't27'\n- NT48 -> 't68'\n- NT49 -> 't47'\n\nSo each of these NTs has a specific terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t15. But I don't see any NT directly producing t15, which is a problem because in CNF, a production can only split into two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps t15 is part of a derivation from a non-terminal. Let me check again: Maybe there's an NT that can derive t15. Looking through the productions, I see NT35 \u2192 t27 t5, but no t15. NT37 \u2192 t48 t13, no t15. Did I miss any?\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\n- NT33: t73 or t30\n- NT44: t42, t73 (Wait, NT44 had two rules, one produces t42 and another t73, correct)\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, let me jot down the grammar rules to have a better look. The grammar starts with S, and each production seems to be splitting on NTs (like NT48, NT11, etc.), which are non-terminals. The leaves of these productions are either other non-terminals or terminal symbols, which are all lowercase t followed by numbers, except for the initial S.\n\nLooking at the production rules for S:\nS -> NT48 NT49\nNT48 -> NT44 NT47\nWait, I see that NT49 is split into NT11 and NT6, but I might get lost in all these rules. Instead of going through the entire grammar, maybe I can approach this by trying to parse the string from the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string given is a series of terminal symbols: t5, t25, t65, t65, t59, t68, t30, t28, t15, t42, t77, t59, t36, t68, t66. So, in order for the string to be generated, each of these terminal symbols must appear in the left-hand sides of the productions or be directly connected to the start.\n\nI think the best approach here is to perform a top-down parsing, starting from S, and see if I can derive the string step by step. Let me try to break it down.\n\nStarting with S, which produces NT48 and NT49. So after S, the string starts with t6 (since NT48 -> t6) because looking at the rules, NT48 is connected to 't6' in one of the productions. So after S, the first symbols must be t6.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the productions again. I see NT48 -> NT44 NT47, and NT47 is 't48'. But also, in the rules, NT6 -> t4, so maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see NT48's rule is: wait, no, the initial rule is S->NT48 NT49. Then, looking through the rules, I don't see NT48 anymore except for being part of other rules. Hmm, maybe I got confused earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again:\n\n- S -> NT48 NT49\n- NT48 -> NT44 NT47\n\nWait, no, actually checking the rules again, I realize that the initial production S has two non-terminals, NT48 and NT49. Then, in the rules, NT48 is further broken down into NT44 and NT47, both of which are non-terminals. NT47 is a terminal t47, so that would mean that from NT48, we can get t44 and t47. Wait, but wait, in the rules, I think I might have misread. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT48 -> NT44 NT47 \u2192 but then I check and see that NT47 is 't48' no, wait, looking again: no, actually, in the rules given:\n\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT44 -> NT12 NT57\n- NT12 -> NT39 NT32\n- NT57 -> NT9 NT37\n- NT9 -> 't25'\n- NT37 -> 't32'\n- So NT9 is 't25', NT37 is 't32', so NT57 is 't25' and 't32' (i.e., t25 t32)\n- NT12 is split into NT39 and NT32. Noting that NT32 is 't35' or something else? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT35 is 't27' or 't35'? Let me see:\n\n- NT35 -> NT27 NT2 is probably a typo or maybe I'm confused. Wait, no, within the rules, looking for NT35:\n\n- NT35 -> NT27 NT2 \u2192 Hmm, wait, the actual rules for NT35: in the given grammar, I see NT35 -> NT27 NT2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking back, the user provided a list of grammar rules, which include:\n\n- NT35 -> NT27 NT2 \u2192 that seems incorrect, unless it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the rule is NT35 -> NT27 NT28? Or perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be NT35 -> NT27 NT2? Hmm, perhaps it's meant to be NT35 -> NT27 NT28. Wait, but in any case, I'll proceed with what's given.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck because it's hard to parse all these rules without seeing how they connect. Perhaps a better approach is to map the production rules in terms of how they expand into terminals. For example, looking at each non-terminal and seeing what terminals it can produce directly or eventually.\n\nSo starting from S, it's NT48 followed by NT49. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nFirst, NT48 -> according to the rules, it's split into NT44 and NT47. Now, NT44's production is NT12 and NT57. So NT44 -> NT12 NT57. Then NT47, looking back, seems to be 't48' if I can find it, but actually, in the rules, I look for NT47, and I see no other NT47. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules after the initial S, I see:\n\n- NT48 -> NT44 NT47 \u2192 So NT47 is one of the possible expansions. Then, in the rules, NT47 appears again as another symbol. Checking, I see:\n\n- NT39 -> NT40 NT11\n- NT17 -> NT6 NT6\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT47: I see in the rules, NT47 is used but only as a left-hand side of NT13: NT13 -> NT5 NT19, so no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to look for each non-terminal and see what their possible terminal expansions are.\n\nStarting with NT48: NT48-> NT44 NT47.\n\nNT44-> NT12 NT57. NT12-> NT39 NT32. NT57-> NT9 NT37.\n\nSo NT12: from NT12 -> NT39 NT32.\n\nNT39 can produce t40 or other terminals?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT39-> NT40 NT11.\n\nAnd NT40-> t68 or something else?\n\nWait, looking at the string, the terminals are various t and numbers. Let's see, in the string, the terminals are t5, t25, t65, etc.\n\nSo perhaps I can traverse the string and see if each terminal matches some production.\n\nLet me start with the string:\n\nt5, t25, t65, t65, t59, t68, t30, t28, t15, t42, t77, t59, t36, t68, t66.\n\nSo the very first symbol is t5. Let me see if any non-terminal directly produces t5.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT59-> t18 t1\n- Wait, no. Looking back at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the given rules:\n\n- NT31-> NT20 NT8.\n\n- NT55-> NT21 NT59.\n\nNT21-> NT33 NT45.\n\nNT45-> NT29 NT1.\n\nSo, I might be getting stuck here. Let me make a mapping of each non-terminal to its possible terminal symbols:\n\n1. S-> NT48 NT49 \u2192 So starts with something derived from NT48 and NT49.\n\n2. NT48-> NT44 NT47 \u2192 From there, it's NT44 and NT47.\n\n3. NT44-> NT12 NT57 \u2192 From NT44, we get NT12 and NT57.\n\n4. NT12-> NT39 NT32 \u2192 NT12 splits into NT39 and NT32.\n\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-287","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that the right-hand side of each production has either two non-terminals or, in some cases, terminals. Wait, in CNF, productions should only have non-terminals or terminals at the end, but here I see some productions that might have terminals, but perhaps the ones with only non-terminals are the important ones.\n\nNow, looking at the string: `t31 t22 t24 t76 t37 t32 t10 t32 t84 t32 t47 t10 t53 t15 t49 t81`. Each token is separated by a space, so I assume the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree will be binary. The top symbol is S. So the initial step is S, and each step we replace non-terminals.\n\nThe string's length is 16 tokens. So the derivation must be of length 15 (since each step adds one token). But wait, in CNF, each production either adds one terminal or splits a non-terminal into two. Starting from S, each step either increases the depth (by splitting) or moves towards terminals. The total number of tokens is 16, which for a binary tree of height h, the number of leaves is 2^h. Let's see:\n\n16 is 2^4, so the height is 4. That means each derivation must have 4 layers, so we must have 15 steps to produce 16 terminals.\n\nLet me see the string's order: t31, t22, t24, t76, t37, t32, t10, t32, t84, t32, t47, t10, t53, t15, t49, t81.\n\nWait, that's 16 tokens, so 16 steps from S. So, I need to see if the leftmost symbols derive to this sequence.\n\nBut manually tracing 16 steps is time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or see which non-terminals produce which terminals, then see how the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is small, I can try to parse the string from the start to see if it can be derived.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the given non-terminals in the grammar, and see if the structure matches a possible leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for possible splits and see if the string can be formed by combining smaller parts.\n\nLooking at the first token in the string: t31. Let's see where t31 is defined. In the grammar, I see NT31 appears, and the productions for NT31 are:\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\nAlso, looking at the terminals, NT31 has two productions: NT20 NT8 and NT8 NT35.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t31, which could come from NT31. Let's see which production of NT31 would produce t31.\n\nLooking at the grammar's NT31 productions, but I don't see any direct terminal production for NT31. All are non-terminals. So I need to see how NT31 can produce t31.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. The terminals in the grammar's productions are listed under some of the non-terminals. For example, NT31 has terminal options like t31, t5, etc. Wait, actually, no, looking back, each line after NT31 has '-> NT...', except some have arrows ending with a single token, like 't30' or 't53' or 't49'. So for example, looking at the top of the grammar:\n\nNT33 -> 't73' and 't76'. So NT33 can produce either t76 or t73. Wait, but in the given list, let's look:\n\nI see lines like NT33 -> 't76', which means NT33 can directly produce t76. Similarly, other non-terminals have terminals. So, any production that ends with a terminal is a terminal production. The other productions are non-terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT33 can produce t76 or t73.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some lines end with 't...', like NT33 -> 't76', 't73', etc.\n\nSo, the approach is that each non-terminal can produce a sequence of two non-terminals (leftmost) or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT31 has productions:\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\n\nSo, these are non-terminals, and when we derive, we need to expand these non-terminals further until all are terminals.\n\nSo, given that, the first token is t31, which must come from a terminal production, but looking at the grammar, no non-terminal directly produces t31 except perhaps NT31, but looking at its productions, NT31 only produces non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, there's a production: NT31 -> NT8 NT35 (line: NT31 -> NT8 NT35). So T31 must be expanded into NT8 NT35.\n\nSo, to get t31 as a terminal, we'd need NT31 to produce t31, but looking through the grammar, I don't see NT31 directly producing a terminal. Or do I? Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar list given, the line: NT31 -> NT8 NT35. So no direct terminal for NT31. But perhaps another non-terminal that ultimately produces NT31?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the productions again carefully.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT31 appears in a few lines:\n- NT31 -> NT20 NT8\n- NT31 -> NT8 NT35\n\nSo, to get t31, it must be produced by one of these, but since both are non-terminals, I must expand them further to see if they can reach a terminal.\n\nBut wait, t31 is appearing in the string, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe NT31 has a production to t31 somewhere else, but I didn't see it. Let me go through all the grammar lines again.\n\nLooking through the entire list:\n\nNT31: 2 productions, both to non-terminals.\n\nNT33: has productions 't76', 't73', etc.\n\nWait, the given grammar list: for example, NT49->'t81', so NT49 can directly produce t81 or t47, etc.\n\nSo, the first token is t31. How can that happen? Because t31 is not a terminal, but perhaps I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token is NT31, which has productions NT20 NT8 and NT8 NT35. So the first step is S -> NT44 NT4... Wait, perhaps I should start from the beginning.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nSince the string starts with t31, we need to find a way to derive t31. Since the grammar is in CNF, the first symbols in the string must come from the leftmost derivations. So we need to see if the start symbol S can produce the given string in a leftmost fashion.\n\nGiven that, we can approach this with a recursive descent parser, or at least simulate the leftmost derivation.\n\nBut let me first see how S is defined. S-> NT44 NT48.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT44 NT48. Then, each of these non-terminals must be expanded. So, the derivation starts with NT44 and NT48.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first symbol is t31. So, perhaps one of NT44 or NT48, when expanded, produces t31.\n\nWait, checking NT44, what do we know? Let's look for any productions for NT44: looking through the list.\n\nLooking: NT44 has production: NT29 NT13.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT44 NT48.\n\nThen, we have to expand NT44 and NT48.\n\nLet me think step by step: The string starts with t31.\n\nSo, the production for NT44 must eventually yield a sequence starting with t31. But NT44's production is NT29 NT13, which are non-terminals. So, to get t31, we need to expand NT44's symbols further, perhaps through NT29 and NT13.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with some expansion that leads to t31 after S.\n\nBut wait, maybe the string is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it's structured in a way that makes parsing a bit more straightforward, albeit still challenging.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The non-terminals are all the capital letters like S, NT1, NT2, etc., and the terminals are lowercase letters and strings with a 't' followed by a number. The start symbol is S, which goes straight to NT48 and NT11. So, the string I'm given should start with those, but let's see.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t53 t68 t48 t59 t4 t15 t49 t55 t49 t48 t73 t49 t66 t37 t48`\n\nHmm, looking at the beginning of the string, it starts with `t4`, which I remember from the grammar. Let me look back at the grammar rules to see where 't4' is defined. Oh, I see several NT20 rules that sometimes result in 't4'. For example, NT20 can become 't26' or 't53', but not 't4'. Wait, no, looking again, there's a rule like NT20 -> NT7 NT35, and then other rules further down: NT20 -> 't26' or 't53'. So 't4' might come from another N-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals. Let me check the production rules. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> NT12 NT43\n- NT43 -> t15 (from NT43 -> t15)\nWait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see 't4' as a direct result. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's coming from a longer derivation. For example, perhaps a non-terminal that eventually leads to 't4' through a chain of derivations.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So every step reduces the number of symbols by one, ultimately deriving the terminal string.\n\nGiven the string, I should try to parse it by breaking it down into the grammar.\n\nThe string is 17 symbols long. Let me count the symbols and see how they can be grouped. Each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, so the parse tree could have a certain structure.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be the results of derivations from NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with 't4', 't53', etc. So maybe NT48 and NT11 derive parts of this.\n\nLooking at NT48 rules: In the grammar, there's a rule NT48 -> t68, and another production for NT48. Wait, no, let me check the rules provided:\n\nI see NT48: `NT48 -> t68` and others? Let me check the given grammar rules carefully.\n\nWait, the rules include:\n\nNT48 -> NT49 t68\nWait, is that correct? Or is it a production rule like NT48 \u2192 t68? Let me check the given rules.\n\nLooking through the given list:\n\nYes, here's a rule:\n\nNT48 -> 't68'\n\nBut wait, another line says:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nSo S directly becomes 't68' and whatever NT11 becomes.\n\nWait, no, because NT48 \u2192 't68' is a production. Similarly, for NT49 \u2192 't47' etc.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT48 NT11. NT48 \u2192 't68', NT11 I need to see what it produces.\n\nLooking at NT11's productions:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\nNT41 -> 't77'\nNT49 -> 't47'\n\nSo NT11 \u2192 't77' 't47', making it 't77t47'.\n\nSo S \u2192 't68' 't77t47' \u2192 t68t77t47.\n\nWait, but the string we're given starts with t4, which doesn't match t68. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps S is broken down differently. Maybe I have to consider that NT48 and NT11 can produce other things, not just the terminals listed.\n\nWait, looking again, in the list of rules, I see:\n\nThere's a rule NT48 \u2192 t68, but also NT48 \u2192 NT49 t68?

{"custom_id":"request-307","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are terminals or non-terminals, and a is a single terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this because all the productions are from a single non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t24 t76 t48 t37 t4 t65 t24 t22 t81 t65 t59 t73 t31 t26 t31 t48`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's made up of a bunch of non-terminals and terminals. The terminals seem to be words starting with 't' followed by numbers, like 't5', 't24', etc. So the string is composed of these terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the bottom-up parsing method, perhaps the CYK algorithm, since it's designed for CNF grammars and can efficiently determine membership. Alternatively, I can try to see if the rightmost derivation leads to the string.\n\nLet me consider how the grammar produces strings. Each production is a non-terminal expanding into two others, which themselves can expand. The leaves of the parse tree will be terminals, and the string we're given is a sequence of terminals. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol S expands into NT48 and NT11 (S \u2192 NT48 NT11). So the entire string must be a concatenation of two parts: the expansion of NT48 and NT11. Let me split the given string into two parts. Wait, but the string is a long sequence, so I need to see how it's split into two parts corresponding to NT48 and NT11.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire string as the concatenation of derivations from NT48 and NT11. So I need to check if the entire string can be produced by first producing NT48 and then NT11, or vice versa, but that might not be the case because in CNF, the order depends on the structure.\n\nWait, no, the production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would mean that the entire string must be NT48's expansion followed by NT11's expansion. So the string is S's expansion only if it's the concatenation of NT48's string and NT11's string.\n\nWait, no, in a context-free grammar, when you have a production like A \u2192 BC, the entire string must be B followed by C. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11 means that the string must be NT48's expansion concatenated with NT11's expansion. So I need to check if the given string can be divided into two parts where the first part is generated by NT48 and the second by NT11.\n\nSo the given string has 17 tokens: `t5 t24 t76 t48 t37 t4 t65 t24 t22 t81 t65 t59 t73 t31 t26 t31 t48`. Wait, no, the string is written as a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, so let's count them:\n\nt5 (1), t24 (2), t76 (3), t48 (4), t37 (5), t4 (6), t65 (7), t24 (8), t22 (9), t81 (10), t65 (11), t59 (12), t73 (13), t31 (14), t26 (15), t31 (16), t48 (17). So 17 tokens.\n\nIf S is NT48 followed by NT11, then the entire string must be NT48's derivation followed by NT11's. So I need to see if the first k tokens form a string generated by NT48, and the remaining 17 - k tokens form a string generated by NT11, for some k from 1 to 16.\n\nBut this might take a lot of time, as I have to check each possible split. Alternatively, maybe I can look for the structure in the grammar to find out how the terminals are connected.\n\nLet me try to see if I can derive the string starting from NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nSo the string must be NT48's expansion followed by NT11's.\n\nLooking at NT48: Let's see its productions.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT48 is one of the non-terminals. Let me look through the rules:\n\nNT48 is used in the production: `t48 \u2192 NT49 NT6` or wait, looking through all the rules:\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\nNT48: Not directly listed, so maybe NT48 is derived from some other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT48 directly. Hmm, maybe I misread earlier. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking for NT48: Yes, the rule is `NT48 \u2192 t68`, so when S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is expanded, it becomes t68 and whatever NT11 expands to.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which then would expand into t68 and whatever NT11 expands to, but that would make a string starting with t68 followed by NT11's expansion. But the given string starts with t5, so that's a problem. So maybe I made a mistake in identifying NT48.\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar is given as a list of rules. Let me look for NT48:\n\nIn the list:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t68\n\nAh, yes, so NT48 produces a terminal t68 directly. That means if S \u2192 NT48 NT11, then S can produce t68 followed by whatever NT11 produces. But the given string starts with t5, not t68. Therefore, this would mean that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because S must start with t68 followed by NT11's string, but the string starts with t5.\n\nWait, that seems to suggest that the string cannot be in the language. But that's a contradiction because I must have made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nSo NT48 is a single non-terminal, and NT11 is another. Let me see the productions for NT48.\n\nFrom the list, I see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68\n\nSo NT48 can only produce t68. But that would mean, for S, it would expand to t68 followed by NT11's expansion.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt5 t24 t76 t48 t37 t4 t65 t24 t22 t81 t65 t59 t73 t31 t26 t31 t48\n\nWhich starts with t5, not t68. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because S's expansion starts with t68, conflicting with the given string starting with t5.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because maybe I misunderstood which non-terminal is which. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 t68, so yes, that's correct. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11 would produce a string starting with t68, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the productions. Let me make a table of all the non-terminals and their productions to see if I can find something else.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals:\n\n- NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'.\n\n- NT40 produces 't49', 't65', or 't28' (from NT28's production). Wait, actually, no, NT33, NT28, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw a dependency tree for each terminal to see how they are built.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if the given string can be generated by some combination of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5, which is a terminal. So perhaps one of the non-terminals directly produces t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 t5\n\nYes, so NT29 can produce t5. So maybe the first part of the string is generated by NT29. Similarly, t24 is another terminal. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t24.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t24\n\nYes, so NT59 can produce t24.\n\nt76 is another terminal, and NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires each production to have two non-terminals except for the terminal strings. The given grammar seems to follow this as each production on the left side is a single non-terminal that produces two others or a terminal.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens. I think each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. The goal is to see if there's a derivation path in the grammar that produces this exact sequence.\n\nI'll approach this by looking for the root production and working my way down. The start symbol is S. The only production for S is `S -> NT48 NT11`. So the entire string should start with the sequences derived from NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are `t36` and `t15`. So, NT48 must derive into something that starts with t36 and t15. Let's check what NT48 can be. Looking through the given productions:\n\nLooking up NT48's productions. Wait, in the given grammar, NT48 isn't listed as an initial non-terminal (since the main S production is S->NT48 NT11). So maybe I misread. Wait, perhaps I should list out all the non-terminals and their productions to find out what NT48 can be.\n\nWait, the given grammar has various non-terminals like NT33, NT44, etc. Let me try to list all the NTs and their possible productions, especially the ones that can produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nFor example, NT33 can produce t73 or t30 (I think). Wait, let me check the list:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73' (Yes, it has two productions, one to 't73' and another to 't30'. So NT33 can be t73 or t30.\n\nSimilarly, NT36? Wait, looking for any non-terminal that has 't36' in its production. Let me scan the list.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT7 -> 't36' (so NT7 can be t36). Also, NT27 -> 't27', NT25->'t58' but wait, looking again, I think I may have missed it. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking through the tokens, the first is t36. So perhaps NT36 is a non-terminal that produces t36. Wait, but in the grammar, I only see NT7 -> 't36'. So I think t36 comes from NT7.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because in the string, the first token is t36. If NT7 can produce t36, then NT7 is the source of that.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals that have terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT7 -> 't36' \u2192 So whenever NT7 appears, it can produce 't36'.\n\n- NT15 -> 't15' \u2192 Not sure, wait, in the given grammar, I think it's written as \"NT15\" as a non-terminal with certain productions.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll reconstruct the problem. The grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11, meaning the start symbol S directly produces NT48 and NT11. So the string must start with NT48 and end with NT11. But looking at the string, it starts with t25, which is part of NT33, I think. Wait, where's the NT48 and NT11 in the string? Let me check that.\n\nWait, the string starts with \"t25 t22 t76...\", so that might not align with NT48 or NT11. Hmm, maybe I need to parse the string into parts and see if they can build up from the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their productions to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nThe string has the following tokens in order: t25, t22, t76, t53, t31, t12, t25, t47, t72, t66, t25, t81, t53, t49, t49, t48, t83, t26.\n\nNow, let me see if these tokens correspond to any production rules.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S produces NT48 and NT11. So the string must be a combination of the symbols produced by NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t25. According to the grammar, t25 is produced by NT55. Let me check the rules:\n\nNT55-> NT21 NT59. And NT21-> NT33 NT45, NT59-> NT18 NT1, etc. Hmm, but t25 also appears in NT42's production as part of NT55-> NT21 NT59. Wait, no, looking back, in the rules, I don't see t25 as an end symbol except in NT14, NT18, NT28, NT30, NT35, NT47, NT49, NT52, etc. Wait, looking at each production, I see that nt42 -> nt55 nt25. So maybe nt25 is part of a production in NT42. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT55 -> NT21 NT59. NT21 -> NT33 NT45. NT33 has multiple options: 't76' and 't30', and in NT14, 't76'. So perhaps t25 comes from NT42's production, as NT42-> NT55 NT25. But that would mean that to get t25, I'd need to produce NT25, which might itself be a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see that some of the nt's have terminal options. For example, NT33 can be 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, NT20 can be 't26', NT9 can be 't25', etc. So perhaps some of these nt's are terminals, and others are non-terminals that need to be expanded further.\n\nSo, my plan is to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the productions step by step, replacing non-terminals with their respective terminals or other non-terminals, and see if the string can be fully consumed starting from S.\n\nLet me attempt a leftmost derivation.\n\nStart with S: NT48 NT11.\n\nWe need to generate the string, so we might need to split the string into tokens matching these. But looking at the string, the first token is t25, which is part of NT33. Hmm, maybe the initial S is producing NT48 and NT11. Let me see what NT48 and NT11 produce.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any production for NT48 except perhaps in another part. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules to see which nt's are connected to what.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT42 is defined as NT55 NT25. So if I have t25 somewhere, it might come from NT25, but I don't see NT25 in the rules. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me list all the nt's and their productions:\n\n- S is NT48 NT11.\n\nWait, I realize I'm making a mistake. The rules are given, and each rule is written as NTX-> NTY NTZ, so each rule has two non-terminals, which could either be terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking again at the rules, for example:\n\nNT33 -> 't76' or 't30'\n\nSimilarly, NT14 -> 't76', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT33 can produce 't76', which would be a terminal, or 't30'. So when parsing, whenever we see 't76' or 't30', those are leaves.\n\nSo let's list all the nt's and their possible terminals:\n\n- NT1 -> NT19 NT41\n- NT2 -> (I don't see NT2 in the rules, perhaps it's only on the left side, but all the nt's seem to be in the left-hand side).\n- NT3 -> (Not sure, maybe it's not a production)\n- NT4 -> (Looking through the rules, is there an NT4? No, but I see NT33->t76, etc.)\nWait, perhaps I need to list all nt's that have terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76', 't30'\n- NT31 -> 't20', 't8', NT8 (Wait, NT31's rule is NT31-> NT8 NT35. So NT31 can go into NT8 and NT35, so when we see t20 or t8, etc.\n- NT39-> 't40', 't11'\n- NT20-> 't26', NT9\n- NT25-> 't59', 't28'\n- NT58-> 't31', 't33'\n- NT6-> 't4', NT52\n- NT52-> 't14', 't32', etc.\n- NT48 is in the production S->NT48 NT11, but I don't see a definition for NT48, perhaps I'm missing it. Wait, looking through the rules, it's only S that starts with NT48, but no NT48 productions except that. So perhaps NT48 is a terminal? But that's strange because the string starts with t25, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The rules are all in the form of NTX -> NTY NTZ. So each rule produces two non-terminals until one of them is a terminal.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then in the given rules, some nt's are non-terminals, and when they can produce a terminal, it's a terminal, else, they're non-terminals that must be broken down further.\n\nLooking back, for example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30', so when we see those in the string, it can terminate that branch. Similarly, NT14 can produce 't76'.\n\nNow, looking at the string: \"t25 t22 t76 t53 t31 t12 t25 t47 t72 t66 t25 t81 t53 t49 t49 t48 t83 t26\"\n\nI notice that the 18th token is t26, which is a terminal. So perhaps the parsing can go up to that point.\n\nSo, let's try to parse the string step by step, starting from S: NT48 NT11.\n\nWe need to generate the leftmost symbol first, so first, what comes from NT48. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT48 being defined as anything. Because all the rules are on the left-hand side, each nt can produce two non-terminals. So, perhaps NT48 is a terminal, but that's unlikely because the string has t25, which is also a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check each step. Let me think of S as NT48 followed by NT11. Since S is the start symbol, we need to expand NT48 and NT11.\n\nBut looking at the rules, the left-hand side is always NTX-> NTY NTZ. So for example, NT48 is not in any of the rule's left-hand sides, unless I made a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-318","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string to check is `t66 t12 t10 t3 t69 t55 t72 t49 t83 t15 t3 t10 t32 t26 t47 t84 t76 t5` and the grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it possible to derive strings step by step.\n\nI notice that the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So whatever string is being generated starts with two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. But looking at the string we have, it starts with `t66 t12 t10 ...`, which are terminals. So I need to see if the initial expansion of NT48 and NT11 can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at NT48's production, I see that NT48 \u2192 NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49. Wait, let me double-check that. The grammar has:\n\nNT48 -> NT11 NT6\nWait, no, wait, actually, looking more carefully, the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So S would produce NT48 followed by NT11. But NT11 produces NT31 NT49. Hmm, but the string starts with t66, so I need to see how NT48 can generate t66.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, which then leads to NT49. NT49 appears to have two productions: one leading to NT11 and NT6, but also other productions that lead directly to terminals like 't4', 't49', 't28', etc. Wait, looking closely:\n\nLooking for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n\nThen NT49 can also produce NT11 NT6, or directly produce 't4', 't49', 't16', etc. So NT6 might eventually derive a terminal through nt49's production.\n\nBut in the string, the first terminal is 't66'. So perhaps NT6 can lead to 't66'?\n\nLooking at NT48:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nI need to see how NT48 and NT11 can produce the given string. Let's break it down.\n\nThe string is: t66 t12 t10 t3 t69 t55 t72 t49 t83 t15 t3 t10 t32 t26 t47 t84 t76 t5\n\nSo first, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two non-terminals are NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet's expand NT48. From the grammar:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nWait, that seems recursive. NT48 produces NT11 and NT6. That might complicate things because it could loop. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, looking at NT48:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nSo NT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6. But NT11 can be expanded into NT31 NT49.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 (NT11 NT6) NT11 \u2192 NT11 NT6 NT49\n\nWait, but this seems to be getting more complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this by recursively trying to match the string to the grammar, using a parser approach.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about how each non-terminal can derive a terminal. Let's list out the direct productions for each non-terminal that lead to terminals:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't3' or 't27'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't15' or 't34'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't40' or 't11'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't28' or 't1'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't28' or 't77'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't13' or 't55'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\n\nNT45 \u2192 't29' or 't1'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't48' or 't44'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't7' or 't58'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't9' or 't37'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't31' or 't33'\n\nNT59 \u2192 't18' or 't1' or 't24'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4' or 't52' or 't49'\n\nWait, no. Looking at NT6's production in the list:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n\nBut also, other NTs have terminal productions. So for NT6, the direct productions are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n\nBut then NT49 can produce terminal 't4', 't49', 't16', etc., so perhaps NT6 can eventually produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but let me look again. Each NT's productions are in the list.\n\nLooking for NT6: I see in the productions, it was listed as NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, but other NTs have terminal outputs. Wait, perhaps I should list each NT's direct terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76', 't30'\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't3', 't27'\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't15', 't34'\n\n- NT39 \u2192 't40', 't11'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't28', 't1'\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't28', 't77'\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't13', 't55'\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't66', 't73'\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't29', 't1'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't48', 't44'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't7', 't58'\n\n- NT57 \u2192 't9', 't37'\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't31', 't33'\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't18', 't1', 't24'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n\n- Hmm, NT6 doesn't directly produce a terminal; its production leads to other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 is used as a symbol in NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 NT59 NT35, and NT35 can produce 't3' or 't27', etc.\n\nSo perhaps I can start by trying to map the string backwards, seeing if the non-terminals can break down into the necessary components.\n\nThe string starts with 't66', which must come from some NT. Looking at NT44's production, which has 't66' as an option (NT44 \u2192 't66' | NT29 NT1). So NT44 can derive 't66' directly.\n\nBut in the initial step, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So how could NT48 and NT11 produce 't66' and then the rest of the string?\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't66 t12 ...'. So perhaps S expands to NT48 NT11, which then needs to expand further. For example:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nBut NT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (from the production NT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6), so then:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nSo the initial expansion is:\n\nS \u2192 NT11 NT6 NT11\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with 't66', so perhaps one of these NTs (NT11, NT6) can produce 't66'? Well, NT44 can, but NT11 and NT6 are direct non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT11's production: NT11 \u2192 NT31 NT49\n\nSo the string starts with 't66 t12 ...'. Let's think about the first part: perhaps the 't66' comes from NT44, which is produced by NT48, which is the first symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that NT48 produces a terminal 't66', but from the production, NT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So both NT11 and NT6 would need to produce terminals. But NT48 itself doesn't directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

{"custom_id":"request-347","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: \n\nt27 t4 t22 t26 t31 t15 t65 t27 t72 t10 t48 t81 t81 t19 t68 t27 t59 t77 t31.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. A grammar is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to fit this structure because all productions look like S \u2192 NT X, where NT and X are non-terminals or terminals, but sometimes X could be terminals.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar. Essentially, I need to check if each terminal in the string can be the result of a production, either directly or through other steps.\n\nLet me start by constructing the parse tree bottom-up since the string is in the order of left to right. Each step, I'll check if the current part of the string can be matched by any production ending in a specific node.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30', NT31 can produce 't8' or 't35', NT6 \u2192 't4', and so on.\n\nI'll need to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some non-terminal. Let me list the string in order:\n\nt27, t4, t22, t26, t31, t15, t65, t27, t72, t10, t48, t81, t81, t19, t68, t27, t59, t77, t31.\n\nWait, some of these might not directly appear as productions. For instance, t4 is directly produced by NT6, t26 by NT20, t22 by NT30, t81 by NT49, etc. Let me check each one.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should proceed step by step. The string is 20 tokens long. Since each production produces two terminals at a time (inCNF, each production produces two non-terminals, which then produce terminals), except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. So each step in parsing reduces the string by two or one tokens, but in CNF, it's two at each step because all productions are A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. Wait, no\u2014CNF allows for unit productions, so A\u2192a is also allowed. So each production can generate either two non-terminals (hence two tokens in the string) or a single terminal (which would be one token). But in this case, the string has even and odd-length sequences because each step adds one token if a unit production is used.\n\nWait, actually, in a typical leftmost derivation, each production either increases the length by one (unit production) or by two. But the total number of steps can vary. However, for a string in CNF, the length should be such that it can be built from S \u2192 NT... with each step either adding two tokens or one.\n\nBut this string has 20 tokens. Let's see how that works.\n\nStarting with the entire string, we need to parse it from left to right, using the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to model the parse as a list of non-terminals that need to be expanded. Let's start by grouping the terminals into pairs or individual steps.\n\nI think a better way is to work backward from the start symbol S. Let's see what S can derive. From the given grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nSo the string must start with whatever NT48 can produce and then whatever NT11 can produce. So I'll check what terminals NT48 and NT11 can generate.\n\nLooking up in the productions:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT52 (from S\u2192NT48 NT11), and then looking up NT52's productions:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT14 NT57 or NT7 or NT25 (from the given, for example, NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32, but also NT52 \u2192 NT7, NT52 \u2192 ... Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I should list out all productions for each non-terminal to see how they expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look at each terminal in the string and see if it can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nLet me make a list of productions that generate each terminal:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n- NT31 \u2192 't8' or 't35'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4' [Yes, t4 is generated by NT6]\n- NT20 \u2192 't26' [So t26 is generated by NT20]\n- NT7 \u2192 't36' [So t36 is t7]\n- NT29 \u2192 't5' or 't5' (Wait, NT29 \u2192 NT18 NT1, but also NT29 seems to have a production NT29 \u2192 't5' or 't53'?) Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT29:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't5' [Yes, from NT29 \u2192 't5'] and also NT29 \u2192 't53' (from NT29->'t5'). Wait, but I need to clarify.\n\nWait, no, the production NT29 \u2192 't5' is one option, and 't53' is another. So NT29 can produce 't5' or 't53'.\n\nSimilarly, NT18 \u2192 't69' [From NT18 \u2192 't69']\n\nNT14 \u2192 't42' [From NT14 \u2192 't42']\n\nOther terminals can be found similarly.\n\nBut the problem is, the string has many more terminals than just these. For example, t27: looking for NT27's production. However, checking the given rules, I don't see any non-terminal called NT27. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, but let me check.\n\nWait, looking back, the given productions do not have NT27. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the production list, I see NT30 \u2192 't84' and NT33 \u2192 't76' and 't30'; NT27 appears on the left-hand side of a production, as in NT27 \u2192 NT48 and NT27 \u2192 NT49, but does any NT27 exist? Wait, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT27: Not present in the given list. Wait, but the string has t27 twice. So t27 is in the string twice, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the given productions. In the list:\n\nLooking for t27. Let me see the productions:\n\nLooking at the production list, any NT with t27 in the right-hand side?\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking through NT12, NT13, etc., no. Then, I see:\n\nWait, in the productions, there's NT19 \u2192 t28, but no t27. Then NT27 appears on the left side, but not as a production for anything.\n\nWait, so is NT27 defined as something else? Let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT27 is not present on the right-hand side of any production except in NT27 \u2192 NT48 and NT27 \u2192 NT49, but NT27 itself in the left-hand side is a non-terminal. So wait, does NT27 have a definition? Because in the given grammar, NT27 is listed in the productions as NT27 \u2192 NT48 and \u2192 NT49. So, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the production in the list is:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT48 | NT49.\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules more carefully:\n\nI think I miswrote. Looking at the rules again, the productions are:\n\nLooking through the list, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT27: No, I don't think so. Let me recheck the list:\n\nLooking for NT with '27' in their production:\n\nLooking through all the production lines, for example,\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35\nNT27? Let me look.\n\nLooking through:\n\nAh, I see NT27 is actually used on the left in some productions:\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n- NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32\n- NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57\n- NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again for any non-terminal NTxx that is being produced without an end.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-344","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the string `t55 t19 t24 t27 t76 t36 t48 t83 t55 t48 t26 t47 t7 t36 t12 t5 t66 t76 t76` is generated by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The top symbol is S, and the initial step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. \n\nI'll write down the productions that involve terminals. These are the base cases because they don't split further. For example, NT33 can be 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, NT20 can be 't26', NT30 can be 't84', and so on. \n\nThe string starts with 't55', so I need to see if T55 is a terminal or derived from a non-terminal. Looking at the productions, NT55 is defined as NT21 NT59. So T55 is not a terminal; it must have been replaced by two other non-terminals.\n\nNext, I'll break down the string step by step, trying to find productions that match the sequence. Starting from the initial symbol S, which expands to NT48 NT11. NT48 is produced by NT49 NT6. \n\nLooking at NT49, it expands to NT11 NT6. Then NT11 becomes NT41 NT49, and so on. Each step involves replacing a non-terminal with its two components until we reach terminals.\n\nBut instead of following every step manually, which could take a lot of time, I'll use a strategy to see if the sequence can be parsed. Maybe I can try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string as tokens to see the order: t55, t19, t24, t27, t76, t36, t48, t83, t55, t48, t26, t47, t7, t36, t12, t5, t66, t76, t76.\n\nStarting from S, we have S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two parts must come from NT48 and NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. Then:\n- T49 becomes (t11, t6)\nBut wait, looking at the productions, NT49 is 't66' only when it's directly a terminal, but NT49 can be derived further. Let me check NT49's productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nAnd NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\nAnd NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32\nAnd others. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled. Alternatively, perhaps looking for each token in the string and seeing which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFor instance, t55 is produced by NT55 which is NT21 NT59. NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45. So T55 must come from NT21 NT59, which are then NT33 NT45 and NT59.\n\nNT33 can be 't76' or 't30'. Since the string has t76, that works. NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1. NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35, etc. But wait, this seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I should try to represent the string as a sequence of nodes and see if it forms a derivation starting from S. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for each token in the production tree.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of symbols and see if it's possible given the grammar's structure. The initial S has two symbols. Each production can increase the length by one (two symbols to two symbols) or keep it the same. Since each step is a split, the total number of symbols should match.\n\nWait, the string has 20 tokens, so when expanded, the derivation should produce 20 symbols. Starting from 2, each split adds one more symbol, so for 20, it would require 19 splits. That seems possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm, but that's more for parsers. Wait, maybe I can try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nLet's try to parse the string:\n\nToken sequence: t55, t19, t24, t27, t76, t36, t48, t83, t55, t48, t26, t47, t7, t36, t12, t5, t66, t76, t76.\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two tokens must be produced by NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48: It's NT49 NT6.\n\nNT49 is NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, that's getting too deep. Alternatively, perhaps looking at each token and seeing which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nt55 \u2192 NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59.\n\nt21 \u2192 NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45.\n\nt33 can be 't76' (yes) or 't30'. Here, we have t76.\n\nThen NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1.\n\nt29 \u2192 NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35.\n\nt7 \u2192 't53'.\n\nt35 \u2192 NT35 \u2192 NT27 NT43.\n\nt27 \u2192 't27' (terminal production).\n\nt43 \u2192 NT43 \u2192 NT44 NT46. Wait, NT46 isn't a terminal, I should check NT43 productions. Looking back:\n\n grammar has NT43 \u2192 NT44 NT46.\n\nWait, but in the grammar given, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT46, but maybe it's defined as a terminal. Or perhaps I'm missing it. Alternatively, maybe NT43 is another split that I'm not tracking correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach isn't efficient. Maybe I can create a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can check for the presence of each token in the expansion. For example, does the string contain t76 multiple times, which is a terminal? Looking at the string, t76 appears at the end twice.\n\nt76 can be from NT33 or NT20? Let me check:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76' (terminal).\nNT20 \u2192 't26'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't76' as per production.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't76' is present. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43.\n\nBut NT12 can produce NT39 or other things, and NT43 can produce NT44 NT46, which may not be terminals.\n\nWait, looking for 't76' in the terminal list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, terminals are things that appear after '\u2192' with no non-terminals, like:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76' (twice), NT30 \u2192 't84', NT20 \u2192 't26', NT9 \u2192 't25', etc.\n\nBut perhaps in the production chain, t76 can be derived.\n\nWait, earlier in the string, t76 comes early on. So starting from S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which produces t55, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for a tree where each non-terminal expands correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains some tokens that make it impossible. For example, t76 is a terminal, which can come from NT33. But looking at the production chain for t76:\n\nIf I can get to t76, does it connect to the rest of the string?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that t19 can't be derived because NT19 is only defined as NT30 NT30. Looking at the grammar, NT19 \u2192 NT30 NT30.\n\nSo to have t19, we need two NT30s. So the string must have t30 in two consecutive positions. Looking at the string, after t19 comes t24, so that doesn't fit. Therefore, this would be impossible.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the fifth token is t24. The fourth is t27, fifth is t76, sixth is t36, seventh is t48, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm conflating positions.

{"custom_id":"request-361","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is: \n\n`t68 t65 t12 t24 t66 t19 t28 t26 t65 t28 t48 t68 t4 t36 t31 t48 t55 t22 t32 t72`\n\nFirst, I should look for the start symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the entire string should be generated from this S. Let me break down the string step by step.\n\nThe first symbols are t68 and t65. So I need to see if NT48 can produce t68 and NT11 can produce t65. Looking through the grammar, NT48 has productions like NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1, and another NT48 \u2192 t4. Oh right, NT48 can produce either two non-terminals or 't4'. Since the first part is t68, which is 't68', and the second is t65 (from the start symbol), I should check which NT48 and NT11 can produce those.\n\nLooking at NT48, is there a production that starts with 't68'? Yes, I see NT48 \u2192 t68. So NT48 can produce 't68'. Then, NT11 should produce 't65'. Let me check NT11's productions. NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. I don't see an immediate production that leads directly to t65, so I might need to look deeper.\n\nNext, let's move to the next part of the string. After t68 t65 comes t12. Let's see what NT48 produces after t68. Since we've already used the production NT48 \u2192 t68, the next part should be derived from NT11. So, S \u2192 NT48 t68 \u2192 NT11 t65. Now the next symbols are t65, so NT11 should produce t65.\n\nWait, wait\u2014looking back, I might have made a mistake. Let me clarify. The string is a series of symbols separated by spaces, so the structure is step-by-step each production.\n\nWait, no\u2014the entire sequence is t68 t65 t12 t24 t66 t19 t28 t26 t65 t28 t48 t68 t4 t36 t31 t48 t55 t22 t32 t72. So, starting from S = NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, the first two symbols are t68 and t65. That suggests that NT48 \u2192 t68 and NT11 \u2192 t65. Let me check that:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68 is a production, so that's correct. Now, NT11 should produce t65. Looking at NT11, it's NT41 NT49, so I need to see if those can produce 't65' or if any of their sub-productions can reach that.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the first symbol is from NT48, which is t68. The second symbol is t65, which must come from NT11. But the production for NT11 is NT41 NT49. So, does NT41 or NT49 have a production that leads to t65?\n\nLooking at NT11's productions:\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nLooking at NT41 and NT49:\n\nNT41 \u2192 t77 is a production. So NT41 can produce t77.\n\nNT49 has productions like NT6 NT11, and also NT13. Wait, does NT49 produce any terminal directly? Let me check the grammar. Yes, I see NT49 \u2192 t49.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't4' and NT49 \u2192 t49. Oh, so NT49 can produce 't49'. So, if NT49 produces 't49', then in NT11, the two non-terminals would be NT41 and NT49. So NT41 produces t77, NT49 produces t49, so NT11 would produce t77 t49, but that's not 't65'. Hmm, that's a problem because the second symbol is t65, not t49. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first symbol is from NT48, which is 't68', and the second must be from NT11. For NT11, in the grammar, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So what can NT41 and NT49 produce?\n\nNT41 can produce t77, NT49 can produce t49. So the combination would be t77 t49, but the next symbol in the input is t65, not t49. So this path isn't giving us t65. Maybe I need to re-examine whether NT11 can produce 't65' via another production, but I don't see one. So perhaps this is a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that after NT48, it's not just a terminal, but perhaps the next NT11 can derive a string that starts with t65. Let me look again at NT11.\n\nLooking through NT11's productions: it's always NT41 NT49, and that's it. So, the only way for NT11 to produce a terminal string is if both NT41 and NT49 produce terminals. So the production for NT11 is producing two non-terminals, which in turn will produce two terminals. So the first symbol after NT48 is 't68' (from NT48), and the next should be whatever NT11 produces, which is two symbols. But in the input, after t68 is t65, which is a single symbol, so this suggests that perhaps we're missing something.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the input string has 21 symbols, so S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Each of these can produce more symbols, right? So perhaps NT48 and NT11 are each producing multiple symbols, so the entire string is built by expanding NT48 and NT11 step by step.\n\nSo let's think recursively. The string is t68 t65 t12 t24 t66 t19 t28 t26 t65 t28 t48 t68 t4 t36 t31 t48 t55 t22 t32 t72.\n\nSo, S \u21d2 NT48 NT11. Let's expand NT48 first. As per the grammar, NT48 \u2192 t68, so S \u21d2 t68 NT11.\n\nNow, we need to expand NT11. The only production for NT11 is NT41 NT49. Sont11 \u21d2 NT41 NT49.\n\nNow, we need to expand NT41 and NT49. Let's see.\n\nNT49 has a production: NT49 \u2192 't49'. So, NT49 can be expanded to 't49'. \n\nWait, but in the string, after t68, the next is t65, not 't77' and t49. So perhaps that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps we're looking at the NT41 and NT49 as non-terminals that can produce longer sequences. So perhaps NT41 and NT49 are each breaking down further.\n\nLet me check NT41. NT41's productions are:\n\nNT41 \u2192 t77 or NT29 NT1.\n\nSo, NT41 can be either a terminal t77, or a combination of NT29 and NT1.\n\nIn the string, after t68, the next symbol is t65, which doesn't match t77 or start of NT29 and NT1. So that might not be the correct path. Alternatively, perhaps we're not directly expanding NT48 first, but looking for other possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the given grammar. Let me consider the entire string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt68 t65 t12 t24 t66 t19 t28 t26 t65 t28 t48 t68 t4 t36 t31 t48 t55 t22 t32 t72.\n\nThat's 21 symbols.\n\nStarting with NT48 \u2192 t68, then NT11 which should produce the remaining 20 symbols.\n\nBut let's see.

The grammar has a lot of rules, and the string to check is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That might make it easier for parsing, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nThe given string is: `t65 t48 t27 t59 t22 t5 t84 t10 t37 t30 t15 t26 t49 t48 t76 t37 t66 t55 t7 t59`. Each word seems to be a terminal symbol, either a 't' followed by a number or just a number, but let me check the grammar rules to see what terminals they produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some rules produce specific terminal strings. For example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, NT40 can produce 't65', NT9 can produce 't25', and so on. So, each non-terminal can expand into a terminal or another non-terminal, and the string is built by replacing non-terminals with their terminals.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to build the string by tracing back through the grammar, starting from the start symbol S, and see if we can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11.

{"custom_id":"request-382","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side or a terminal symbol. That should make parsing easier because each step in the derivation is a single production.\n\nLooking at the string: `t27 t30 t48 t81 t72 t69 t55 t24 t69 t36 t65 t24 t27 t73 t26 t26 t77 t81 t12 t49 t24`.\n\nI notice that many of these are terminals, and some are non-terminals. In the grammar, certain non-terminals have productions that produce terminals, so I can work backward from the string, trying to match the productions.\n\nLet me list out some key non-terminals that correspond to terminals in the string:\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT58 -> 't73'\n- NT33 can produce 't30' or 't76'\n- NT48 -> 't68'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT49 -> 't81'\n- NT30 -> 't22' or 't27'\n- NT55 is not directly in the string, but some rules might lead to it\n- NT44 -> 't73'\nWait, in the string, I see 't73' which corresponds to NT44's production. So, perhaps NT44 was used somewhere.\n\nBut looking further, the string starts with t27, which can come from NT30 (if NT30 has a production that starts with t27). Wait, looking at NT30: NT30 -> NT35 NT35. Hmm, wait, the rules might be split into different parts.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to parse the string as a sequence of non-terminals and see how they can derive the given string. But since some non-terminals correspond directly to terminals, perhaps I can start from the beginning of the string and see if the first terminal matches any production.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't27'. Looking at the grammar rules, 't27' is produced by NT52. So, the leftmost non-terminal would be NT52, which can produce 't27'. So, the first part of the string is matched by NT52 -> 't27'.\n\nSo, after 't27', the next part of the string is 't30'. Now, looking at the grammar, the next token after 't27' is 't30'. So, the next non-terminal must be such that it can produce 't30'. Looking at the rules, 't30' is produced by NT30. But how?\n\nWait, NT30's production is NT35 NT35. So, NT30 can't directly produce 't30'. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, no\u2014looking again, I see that NT30 has two options: NT35 NT35 or 't30'. So, if 't30' is directly produced by NT30, then the sequence would be NT30 -> 't30'. But that would make the string so far 't27 t30', which is what we have after the first two t's.\n\nWait, but in the given string, after 't27', the next token is 't30', which is 't30' being produced by NT30. So, perhaps after NT52, we have NT30. So, the derivation would be S -> NT48 NT49; wait no, the initial grammar is S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure. The initial grammar is S -> NT48 NT49. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the first production is S -> NT48 NT11. But in the string, the first t is 't27', which is from NT52. Hmm, that seems conflicting because S starts with NT48, which would have to produce t27.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing non-terminals with terminals. Let me list the known terminal productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT44 -> 't73'\n- NT33 -> 't30' or 't76'\n- NT58 -> 't73'\nWait, but in the string, there are multiple t73's: t73, t73, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string using a recursive descent approach, starting from the initial symbol S.\n\nWait, but the initial production is S -> NT48 NT11. So, the first two symbols in the string should come from NT48 and NT11.\n\nBut the string starts with 't27 t30...', which would imply NT48 produces 't27' and NT11 produces 't30'. But looking at the NT48 production: does any rule produce 't27'? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT52 -> 't27', but not NT48. So, NT48 can't produce 't27' on its own. That suggests a problem because the initial derivation would require the first part of the string to be generated by NT48 and NT11, but the first token is 't27', which isn't directly produced by NT48.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check more carefully.\n\nThe string is t27 t30 t48 t81 t72 t69 t55 t24 t69 t36 t65 t24 t27 t73 t26 t26 t77 t81 t12 t49 t24.\n\nStarting with S -> NT48 NT11. So, the first two symbols should be derived from NT48 and NT11.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't27'. So, NT48 must derive to 't27'. Let me check NT48's productions: looking through the rules, I don't see NT48 producing any terminals except via longer chains. So, maybe I'm wrong about how NT48 is structured.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I should reverse-engineer the string by breaking it into components that match the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the string is a sequence of terminals. Let me see possible ways to split it into productions.\n\nLooking for 't27': which non-terminals produce 't27'? NT52 has a production to 't27'.\n\nSo, perhaps 't27' comes from NT52. Now, how can the production of NT52 lead to 't27' followed by 't30'?\n\nBut in the initial rule, S is NT48 followed by NT11. So, I'm confused because the string starts with 't27', which would suggest NT52 as the first non-terminal, but that contradicts S's initial production.\n\nWait a minute! Maybe I misread the grammar's initial production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first production is S -> NT48 NT49. So, S is divided into NT48 and NT49.\n\nIn the string, the first t is 't27', which comes from NT52. So, that suggests that the first part of the string, 't27', is from NT52. But NT52 is part of a larger structure, perhaps introduced through another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar's initial production is S -> NT48 NT11, and each of these can themselves be complex non-terminals. So, perhaps NT48 can be something like A, and NT11 is B, where A and B are further derivations.\n\nBut the string starts with 't27', so if NT48 can't produce t27, that might be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the given string isn't in the language generated by the grammar because the initial symbol S can't produce 't27' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but let me check if NT48 has any production that directly includes 't27'. Looking through the rules for NT48, I don't see any direct production for t27. Each production for NT48 seems to be a combination of other non-terminals. For example, NT44: wait, looking up: NT44 is part of the grammar, but none of its rules produce a terminal except maybe through other expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the given string is t27 followed by t30, and I need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nBut according to the initial production, S is NT48 NT11. So, the first two symbols must be derived from NT48 and NT11. But if the first symbol is 't27', which comes from NT52, then perhaps the initial production isn't being followed, which would"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply algorithms like CYK, though since the problem is about a single string, I can approach it manually or algorithmically.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t26 t32 t49 t32 t22 t26 t73 t25 t7 t36 t19 t26 t10 t4 t22 t53 t36 t22 t65 t4 t25`.\n\nI notice that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT44 NT11, which suggests that every string generated by the grammar starts with NT44 followed by NT11.

So each of these is a non-terminal, so the entire string must be the concatenation of the strings derived from NT44 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t26.

{"custom_id":"request-403","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT33 can produce 't73' or 't30'. Similarly, other NT symbols have specific terminal productions. These terminals seem to form the 'vocabulary' of the language.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t73 t30 t73 t7 t76 t30 t27 t65 t37 t48 t5 t76 t49 t30 t65 t36 t27 t76 t4 t15 t12 t59.\n\nI'll need to construct a leftmost derivation starting from the start symbol S, following the production rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11 (from the grammar). So, the first two symbols in the string should come from NT48 and NT11's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t73. Let's see if NT48 can produce t73. From the grammar, under NT48, I don't see a direct production. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nOh, under NT48: I don't see any production. Wait, that can't be right. The grammar doesn't have a production for NT48, but the string starts with t73, which comes from NT33. So maybe S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is not the right path. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must start with the first symbols from NT48 and NT11. But in the string, the first symbol is t73. So if NT48 can't produce t73, then maybe the grammar doesn't generate this string. But I must check all possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe S can expand differently. Let me check if any production of S can start with t73. Looking through the grammar, I don't see S producing t73 directly. So the first step must use the S \u2192 NT48 NT11 production, but then S will expand to two non-terminals, and the string must start with their first symbols.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t73, which isn't produced by either NT48 or NT11 directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t73, so perhaps the first production is from NT48 \u2192 t73, but looking through the grammar, NT48's productions are not explicitly present except in some other context. Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT48 in the grammar, I see: NT45 -> NT29 NT1, NT49 -> NT11 NT6, NT33 -> 't73', etc. There's no direct production for NT48, which means to get t73 from NT48, it's impossible. So if the string starts with t73, then maybe S cannot produce it through NT48. Therefore, the string is not part of the language.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily be true. Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express the grammar more clearly.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nNT48 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any production for NT48 except in one of the rules as NT48 \u2192 something. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\n\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\n\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\n\nAnd so on. Hmm, no, there's no production for NT48. So that means NT48 doesn't have any production to terminal symbols; it only produces more non-terminals, implying that the leftmost derivation from S would produce all NT symbols until terminals are reached.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t73, which must come from some NT production. Since S starts with NT48 NT11, the first symbol must come from NT48. But looking at the productions for NT48, there's no terminal symbol listed, so NT48 must produce something else, which would require more non-terminals, implying that the first symbol can't be a terminal, which contradicts the string starting with t73.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol, t73, cannot be produced by NT48, as there's no direct terminal production for NT48.\n\nSo the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't73', but the grammar does not produce 't73' from 'S' directly, and 't73' is only produced by NT33. Since S's only expansions (NT48 and NT11) cannot directly produce 't73', the string cannot be generated.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's on the left-hand side. But wait, perhaps the productions for other non-terminals can derive to 't47'.\n\nWait, let me think about the production NT44. One of its productions is NT44 -> NT29 NT1. NT29 -> NT7 NT35, and NT7 -> NT12 NT43. This might go on, but I'm not seeing 't47' here.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the only production that ends in 't47' is NT35 -> 't47'? No, wait, no.

Let me see which non-terminals derive to 't53'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT20 -> 't26', 't53', 't84'\n\nSo 't53' is derived from NT20.\n\nSo the last symbol is 't53' which comes from NT20. So before that, we must have NT20.\n\nNow, the string is [...] t53.

Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT37 -> NT35 NT37\n- NT8 -> 't69'\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to write out the entire derivation step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see that 't47' appears in the string, so I can check if 't47' is a terminal in any production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only production that includes 't47' is NT47, but it's not a terminal\u2014it's on the left side. Wait, no, wait\u2014looking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT44 -> NT29 NT1\n\nBut, the production for NT35 is NT35 -> 't3' or 't27'...

Let me start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal, two non-terminals, or one non-terminal expanding into two others. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing and deciding whether a word is in the language.\n\nThe grammar has non-terminals like S, NT1, NT2, etc., and both terminals and non-terminals appear on the right-hand side of the productions. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t58 t5 t24 t19 t31 t3 t24 t81 t58 t32 t31 t36 t76 t73 t27 t77 t42 t84 t47 t69 t55 t7 t24. \n\nMy goal is to see if there's a way to derive this string step by step using the productions until I end up with all symbols being terminals and matching the string exactly.\n\nI'll start by looking at the initial production in the grammar: S -> NT48 NT11. That means the entire string must start with whatever NT48 produces and followed by whatever NT11 produces. So the first step is to see if the string starts with a production from NT48 and if the rest follows from NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t58, so I need to find what NT48 can produce that starts with t58. Looking through the grammar rules for NT48, I find:\n\nNT48 -> NT13 NT49 \n\nSo, NT48 produces two non-terminals: NT13 and NT49. So the string must start with either NT13 or NT49. But the string starts with t58, which is a terminal. So which of these produces a terminal?\n\nLooking at NT13, I see:\n\nNT13 -> t5 (direct production), so that's a terminal. So if NT13 is on the left, it can produce t5 directly.\n\nLooking at NT49, I see:\n\nNT49 has a production: NT11 NT6. Wait, that's not a terminal yet. So NT49 needs to be broken down further.\n\nSo, from S -> NT48 NT11, the first part is NT48 -> NT13 (which produces t5) and NT49, but the next in the string after t58 (t5) is t5, but wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the string starts as t58 t5 t24... So after t58, it's t5. So perhaps I need to see if after t58 comes something that leads to t5.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it step by step.

So the first production is S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the first two non-terminals are NT48 and NT11. Let's see what they can produce.\n\nNT48 can produce NT13 and NT49.\n\nNT11 can produce either NT41 NT49 or NT31 NT32 or NT13 NT52, etc. Wait, I need to see all possible productions for NT11.\n\nLooking back, the grammar for NT11: \nNT11 -> NT41 NT6 | NT31 NT32 | NT13 NT52.\n\nSo possible productions after NT11.\n\nBut since the string starts with t58 t5..., perhaps I should see if NT48 can produce t58.\n\nWait, looking at the NT48 rules:\nNT48 -> NT13 NT49.\n\nAnd NT13 can produce t5, but t58 is the first symbol. So that can't be from NT13. So perhaps NT48 is producing something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Maybe NT48 has another production I didn't see.\n\nLooking again, the grammar rules:\n\nNT48 only has one production: NT48 -> NT13 NT49.\n\nSo NT48 must produce NT13 and NT49, which both are non-terminals. So the first two symbols in the string must be the terminals produced by NT13 and NT49.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t58. So that would mean that the first part, NT48, must produce t58, but it's a non-terminal, so how?\n\nAh, maybe I got the order wrong. Because in CNF, productions are trees, so maybe I need to see how the string can be built from the leaves up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem, trying to split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so the parse tree is a binary tree. The height of the tree corresponds to the maximum number of symbols in any derivation.\n\nGiven the string length is 22 symbols, the number of steps would be log2(22) or something. But maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLet me try to find the entire parse tree. Let's see.\n\nThe given string is 22 symbols long. S -> NT48 NT11. So the entire string is a result of NT48 producing something followed by NT11 producing something.\n\nSo the string starts with NT48's expansion and ends with NT11's expansion.\n\nNT48 -> NT13 NT49. So the first part is NT13, then NT49, followed by NT11's expansion.\n\nSo the string is divided into three parts: NT13's expansion, then NT49's (which is a production of NT13 and NT49 themselves?), wait, no: NT49 is itself a non-terminal, so I need to split the string accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to split the string into parts that match the productions. Let's attempt this recursively.\n\nLet me represent the string as S, and see how it can be split.\n\nFirst, S must be divided into two parts: part1 from NT48 and part2 from NT11.\n\nSo the string starts with NT48. NT48's production is NT13 NT49, which must produce some sequence, and then NT11 must produce the remaining symbols.\n\nSo let's split the string into part1: [t58, t5, t24, t19, t31, t3, t24, t81, t58, t32, t31, t36, t76, t73, t27, t77, t42, t84, t47, t69, t55, t7], and part2: [t24].\n\nWait, but NT49 is a production, so it's another split. Let's see: NT49's production is:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT49 -> NT11 NT6. So NT49 produces NT11 and NT6. So part1 is NT48 producing NT13's part (t58, t5, t24, t19, ..., t27?) and then NT49's part (t32, t31, ... t7?).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, split the entire string into NT48 and NT11. So the entire string would be divided into two parts, say, part1 from NT48 and part2 from NT11.\n\nGiven that S->NT48 NT11, the string is formed as the concatenation of NT48's derivation and NT11's derivation.\n\nSo the first split is to split the string into two parts where the first part is the derivation of NT48 and the second part is the derivation of NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, I can try different split points to see if either part matches a production.\n\nWait, but NT48's production is fixed: NT48->NT13 NT49, so the first part of the string must be NT13's expansion, followed by NT49's expansion.\n\nSimilarly, NT11 has multiple productions, so I have to split the remaining string after NT48 into parts that match NT11"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S, so I should see which rule starts with S.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, the first production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the grammar starts with S, and that's the initial expansion. The string starts with t30, which is a terminal, so that's part of the process.\n\nI think I need to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into non-terminals using the production rules. Since each production is in CNF, each step of the parse should consist of combining two symbols (which could be non-terminals or terminals) to form another.\n\nLet me start by listing all the productions and terminals involved:\n\nThe terminals in the grammar are all the t-something and numbers that end with 't', like t30, t77, t65, etc. From the grammar, it seems that each production leads to certain terminals. For example, NT33 can be t30 or t35. NT37 can be t13 or t34. And so on.\n\nSince the string starts with t30, let me look at where 't30' appears as a terminal. From the grammar, the NT30 production has two options: NT40 NT11, which becomes t22 or t10, or NT7 NT35, which becomes t53 or t22, but in the provided grammar, looking at NT30's rules, it seems NT30 can produce t84 or t22. Wait, actually, checking the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at each NT's productions:\n\nLet me scan the grammar for 't30' first. In the given grammar, the terminal cases are:\n\n- NT33 can be t30 or t35\n- NT30 can be t84 or t22 (Wait, checking the grammar: Let's see, NT30's productions are: NT7 NT35 \u2192 t53 OR t22. Wait, in the grammar provided, looking for NT30:\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see an explicit rule for NT30 that produces 't30' or 't22'. Instead, looking for where NT30 is used, for example, NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32, which in turn has NT32's rule: NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all the terminals. Let me scan through the grammar and note which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are some terminals:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't30' or 't35'\n- NT30 \u2192 ? Looking through the provided grammar, I don't see NT30.

It seems that NT33 can produce two terminals: 't76' and 't30'. Similarly, NT30 might have some production. Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, looking for NT30: It's not listed as a starting point, but in the productions, perhaps other NTs can produce t30. For example, NT30 is part of some NT's productions.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35 (so if this is allowed, perhaps NT30 is a non-terminal that can be further expanded. But in the given grammar, I don't see NT30 directly. Did I miss that in the production list?\n\nWait, looking through the list, I don't see an explicit production for NT30 except in the context of other rules. So perhaps NT30 is not a starting symbol and only appears in the production of another symbol. Hmm, that's confusing because in Chomsky normal form, each production is a single non-terminal. So if NT30 is a non-terminal, it must have its own production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't26' or 't53'?\nWait, looking at NT20: the rule is NT20 \u2192 NT9 NT35. Then NT9 is 't25'. So NT20 \u2192 t25 NT35. Then NT35 can be t35 or t30. Wait, no, NT35's production is: NT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44. From the rules, so that can be further expanded.\n\nWait, but in the string, I have t30, which is a terminal, so it must come directly from a NT that can produce 't30' or from a NT that can only produce that.\n\nLooking again, I see NT33 can produce 't30' or 't35'. So 't30' is a terminal, so perhaps the parsing starts at NT33.\n\nSimilarly, NT30 appears as a result of NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35, but unless NT30 has a production that leads to a terminal, perhaps we can't get to t30 as a terminal unless it's directly produced by NT30.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, I don't see NT30 having any rules. Let me check:\n\nThe list goes up to NT66. Wait, let me list all NTs to see if NT30 is present.\n\nLooking through the NTs: S; NT48, NT44, NT12, NT6, NT58, NT57, NT49, NT59, NT32, NT45, NT34, NT39, NT35, NT1, NT31, NT7, NT37, NT11, NT52, NT29, NT12 (again), NT55, NT42, NT37 (again), NT21, NT40, NT49, NT31 (again), NT33, NT55, NT42, etc.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed NT30 in the given grammar.

So in this grammar, there is no NT30 production. Hmmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the production is given in a different order, and I might have skipped some.

{"custom_id":"request-445","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except possibly the start symbol, which can have a single non-terminal. In this grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions seem to be in CNF since each production has exactly two non-terminals except for some on the right side, which might actually be terminals. Wait, no, looking closer, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals, and C is a terminal. So all the productions in this grammar either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, actually, some of the productions listed end with a terminal character like 't76', 't30', etc. So maybe the grammar uses the first alternative of CNF where some productions can have a terminal on the right side. Hmm, but in the standard CNF, productions must have exactly two non-terminals. Wait, perhaps the grammar is using a mix, but I need to check that. \n\nLooking at the grammar productions, they are mostly of the form NTXY \u2192 NTAB, where each production has a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, etc. However, some right-hand sides have terminals, like NT33 \u2192 't76' and NT33 \u2192 't30', so those are terminals. But wait, in CNF, the right-hand side should consist of two non-terminals, not terminals. So perhaps this grammar isn't strictly in CNF, but the user said it is. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the terminals are considered as separate productions. In any case, for the purpose of parsing, any production that includes a terminal makes it a single-step production. So, the grammar seems to have both types of productions: those that produce two non-terminals and those that produce a terminal. That's okay because in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, which this grammar meets.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t49 t59 t47 t77 t72 t47 t37 t10 t31 t27 t22 t49 t10 t22 t37 t69 t37 t53 t48 t36 t59 t27 t10 t12`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting with S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is quite complex, I should create a parse tree or check if the string can be broken down into the productions. Since each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, the string is a sequence of terminals, so the parse tree must use the productions that result in terminals whenever a terminal appears.\n\nFirst, I can break down the string into individual symbols and see if each can be generated by a production from the start symbol or the non-terminals. Alternatively, since many non-terminals have productions that include both terminals and non-terminals, it might be easier to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to identify possible subparts of the string that can match the productions. The string starts with t49, so I need to see if t49 can be derived from any non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminals that can produce 't49' are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT49 \u2192 t81, t49 \u2192 t68, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT's that have 't49' as a production:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, but also NT6 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, looking through the given productions:\n\nWait, the grammar shows:\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\nNT52 -> 't7' in one production, 't58' in another, etc. Wait, but NT6 is also a non-terminal. So, looking for 't49' in the right-hand side of any production:\n\n- Checking each production, I see:\n\nLooking for 't49' as a terminal:\n\nIn the given productions, I see NT33 -> 't76' and 't30', but 't49' is produced by:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't immediately see an 'nt' production that produces 't49'. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, I see that NT49 is defined as:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nAnd NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n\nSo it's a recursive definition. Wait, but I also see NT49 \u2192 't68' and 't47'?\n\nWait, in the given productions, under NT49, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT49 -> 't68'\nNT49 -> 't47'\n\nSo yes, NT49 can produce 't68', 't47', and also the combination NT11 NT6. \n\nSo the first 't49' in the string. Wait, the string starts with t49, which would need to be produced by NT49\u2019s production. The options are:\n\n1. NT49 \u2192 't68'\n2. NT49 \u2192 't47'\n3. NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nNone of these directly produce 't49', which makes me question if I might have misread the productions. Wait, looking back, perhaps I missed it. Let me check the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT49 -> 't68'\nNT49 -> 't47'\n\nNo 't49' as a terminal. So NT49 cannot directly produce 't49'. That's a problem because the string starts with 't49', which can't be produced by any production from NT49. Unless there's a mistake in the grammar or my analysis.\n\nWait, wait\u2014am I mislooking? Let me check each entry:\n\nLooking for 't49' as a terminal in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the entries, I don't see any production that directly produces 't49'\u2014so this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and there's a production that includes 't49', but I overlooked it.\n\nWait, looking again, let me check:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76' and 't30' \u2014 not relevant.\n- NT35 -> 't27' \u2014 nope.\n- NT12 -> 't37' and 't32' \u2014 nope.\n- NT6 -> 't4' \u2014 nope.\n- NT49's productions are as above.\n\nWait, is it possible that a 't49' comes from another non-terminal? Maybe NT25 or something else. Wait, the grammar is a bit confusing, perhaps I missed a production.\n\nWait, looking through all the NT productions:\n\nLooking for any production that includes 't49' as a terminal:\n\nHmm, looking through all of them, I don't see any 't49' as a terminal. So that means that the first symbol 't49' in the string cannot be derived by any production. Therefore, the string is not possible to be generated by this grammar, right?\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check if I overlooked any production where 't49' appears. Scanning each line, I don't see it. So unless there's a production that I missed which produces 't49', the string starts with a symbol that isn't possible to generate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol's productions include something, but looking at the start symbol S, its production is:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nSo the entire string must eventually derive from S, which will start with NT48 and NT11. Let's see what those can produce.\n\nNT48 is defined as:\n\nNT48 -> 't49'\n\nWait, yes! NT48 has a production NT48 \u2192 't49'. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 't49' [something], because NT48 \u2192 't49' and NT11 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so when we expand S, the first symbol is 't49' since NT48 produces 't49'. The second part is NT11, which needs to produce the rest of the string starting after 't49'.\n\nSo let's break it down: The string starts with 't49', which is from NT48, and then the rest of the string is from NT11. So the next part of the string after 't49' should come from NT11.\n\nLooking at the string: `t49 t59 t47 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because I know that means each production is either a single terminal, two non-terminals, or something like that. The string is a series of symbols, and I need to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form requires. Each production is either A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So all the productions here look correct\u2014each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are either terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terms like t47, t4, t66, and so on. I need to see if this sequence can be built up by the grammar. Since the grammar builds strings from the start symbol S, I should trace back from the start to see how each symbol in the string can be generated.\n\nLet me list the productions again to make sure I understand them:\n\n1.

Looking back, yes, line 30 says NT33 can produce t76 or t30, and line 33 says NT33 can produce t73. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or perhaps I'm miscounting.)\n\nWait, looking at the initial production of NT33, it's listed twice. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back, the user listed the productions as:\n\nNT33: `t76` and `t30` (line 30) and then line 33 says `t73`. That's conflicting, which is unusual. Maybe I misread the user's input. Wait, looking at the original input again:\n\nNo, line 33 is NT33 \u2192 t73, but in the initial list, line 30 says NT33 can produce t76 or t30, and line 33 says it can produce t73. That's three options. That's conflicting, so perhaps there was a mistake in the user's input. For the purpose of solving this, I'll assume that the correct productions are the ones given, so maybe line 33 is incorrect, or perhaps it's a separate production. Alternatively, perhaps the user accidentally duplicated the production. For now, I'll consider NT33 can produce t76, t30, and t73, which is a bit confusing. Maybe that's a typo, but perhaps in the original grammar, NT33 can only produce t73, or it's another production. Alternatively, perhaps line 33 is correct, but line 30 is redundant, so I'll go with NT33 being able to produce t76, t30, and t73.\n\nBut that's a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and the user meant to write NT33 \u2192 t73, and the line 30 was meant to be another production but was incorrectly duplicated. For the sake of progress, I'll proceed, keeping in mind that it's unclear, but it's more likely that it's a separate production.\n\nWait, perhaps line 33 is NT33 \u2192 t73 and line 30 is NT33 \u2192 t76 or t30, and line 33 is another production, which would make NT33 have three productions: two terminal and one non-terminal, which is allowed. But in the context of Chomsky normal form, we need each production to have two non-terminals or one terminal. So if NT33 has a production leading to t73, that's fine, and the others are as well. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nNow, looking at the string. Let's break it down into individual symbols:\n\nt47, t4, t66, t55, t24, t77, t22, t73, t42, t36, t32, t10, t49, t26, t26, t73, t37, t69, t76, t19, t58, t19, t37, t31.\n\nI need to see if each of these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me start with the first part. The string starts with t47. Let me look at the productions to see what can generate t47.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT49 \u2192 t16 t7, but I'm looking for t47. Hmm. Wait, maybe other productions.\n\nWait, I see NT25 is used in NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25, and look at NT25: line 26 is NT25 \u2192 t35. Wait, line 26: NT25 \u2192 t35? No, line 25 says NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25, line 26 is NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45, line 24 is NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25, line 26 is NT21 being defined, and line 27 is NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1, which is about 40.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express all the productions to make sure I have them correct.\n\nWait, the user listed the productions after the grammar as separate items. Actually, the grammar itself is given as S -> NT48 NT11 and the rest are productions. Then the string is given. So the user provided a mix of grammar and productions, perhaps an error.\n\nWait, the initial part is the grammar, which is the sequence starting with S -> NT48 NT11, followed by various NT (non-terminal) productions. Then the string is given.\n\nSo the NT productions are:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t49, but looking back: line 13: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should separate the grammar and the productions correctly.\n\nThe initial line is \"Grammar: S -> NT48 NT11 NT44 -> NT42 NT13 NT12 -> NT31 NT58 ... etc.\"\n\nSo the grammar is all the productions starting with \"S ->\", \"NT44 ->\", etc., each up to the last one.\n\nThen, the string is given below, which is \"t47 t4 t66 t55 t24 t77 t22 t73 t42 t36 t32 t10 t49 t26 t26 t73 t37 t69 t76 t19 t58 t19 t37 t31.\" without spaces, so each token is separated by a space.

For example, NT33 -> 't73' is a single terminal. But in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right. So perhaps this grammar is not in strict CNF, but maybe it's given as such with some productions producing terminals. Alternatively, perhaps each production is allowed to produce a terminal, which is fine because in CNF, the start symbol can produce terminals directly. Wait, but in CNF, each production must be left as two non-terminals, unless it's the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Hmm, I might need to clarify this, but perhaps the productions as given include both non-terminals and terminals, so it's acceptable.\n\nAnyway, moving on. The given string is: `t72 t83 t58 t76 t66 t7 t42 t77 t66 t49 t25 t83 t55 t55 t7 t69 t81 t66 t48 t26 t19 t37 t59 t36 t77`.\n\nFirst, I think the approach is to parse the string using the given grammar, checking if it can be derived step by step starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT48 and NT11.\n\nSo let's break the string into two parts: the first half (up to NT11's derivation) and the second half.\n\nWait, actually, since S is NT48 followed by NT11, the string must be NT48's derivation concatenated with NT11's derivation.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 26 tokens long. So maybe each part is about 13 tokens each? Let me check the given grammar to see how these non-terminals expand.\n\nLet me list the productions:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\nNT41 \u2192 NT77\nNT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7\nNT16 \u2192 NT26\nNT7 \u2192 NT53\nNT26 \u2192 NT59\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1\nNT1 \u2192 NT19 NT41\nNT19 \u2192 NT31 NT43\nNT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25\nNT37 \u2192 NT13 NT34\nNT13 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 Wait, NT13 \u2192 t5? Or in the grammar, looking back, the productions for NT13 are:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT13 -> 't5'. So it's a terminal.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the grammar might not be in CNF, because some rules produce terminals, but in CNF, all non-terminals must produce non-terminals. So perhaps the given grammar is incorrect or somehow allows some terminals, which is not typical. Maybe it's a mistake, but for the purpose of solving the problem, I will proceed as given.\n\nSo starting from NT48:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nSo the first part of the string should be NT48's expansion, which includes NT11 and NT6, followed by NT11's expansion.\n\nNow, let's look at NT48's expansion:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nWe need to see if the beginning of the string matches this.\n\nThe first token is 't72'.

{"custom_id":"request-485","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is either another non-terminal or a terminal symbol. The grammar itself consists of several production rules, all structured in CNF, which means each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can have one non-terminal leading to terminals.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, a grammar's productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The given grammar follows this structure, so that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t55 t27 t77 t30 t22 t5 t76 t65 t49 t28 t31 t77 t4 t24 t77 t3 t25 t15 t30 t32 t25 t84 t37 t3 t65 t84`. I need to check if this string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use a parse tree method or a top-down parsing technique, perhaps using the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm a bit rusty on CYK, maybe building a parse tree step by step would be easier, starting from the top symbol S and seeing if the string can be constructed.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT48 and NT11. So, the first two symbols in the string should be derived from NT48 and NT11, respectively. Looking at the string: t55 t27... Wait, the first two tokens are t55 and t27.\n\nBut according to the rules, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So NT48 should produce t55, and NT11 should produce t27? Wait, let's check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nFor NT48: It's not in the production rules given. Wait, let me check. Wait, the rule S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals. But looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule for NT48 or NT11 beyond their direct uses.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the grammar, the non-terminals beyond the initial step don't seem to have their own productions except for the ones explicitly given. Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the initial part.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nThe first rule is S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nThen, the other rules are like NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, etc. Wait, but in the list, I can see many rules, but some are terminal symbols like 't76', 't5', 't26', etc. So, to resolve this, perhaps the non-terminals eventually lead to terminals.\n\nSo, the process is as follows: starting from the start symbol, which is S, we need to see if S can derive the given string.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the first two symbols in the string must come from NT48 and NT11, respectively. So, the string starts with t55 t27..., so the first two tokens should be the results of NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t55. So, does NT48 produce t55? Let me check the grammar rules for NT48. Wait, looking through the list, I don't see a rule for NT48 except that it's part of the production from S. So, perhaps NT48 has a production that eventually leads to t55.\n\nWait, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any explicit rule for NT48. So NT48 is only in the production S \u2192 NT48 NT11. That means that to resolve NT48, we need to find its own production. However, in the given rules, the only production for NT48 is as part of S, so perhaps NT48 doesn't have any further productions. But that would mean that NT48 must be a terminal symbol, which contradicts because it's a non-terminal. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm looking at the grammar. Maybe I need to check all possible rules that could lead to the string.\n\nWait, another approach: for each non-terminal, list all possible ways it can be expanded. Then, see if we can reach the string by expanding the symbols step by step.\n\nLet me start by noting the structure of the string. The string has 30 tokens, each separated by a space. So, the string is of length 30.\n\nIn the grammar, each production either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. In CNF, each non-terminal can only have two symbols in front of it when expanding. However, in the case of single terminals, that's the base case.\n\nSo, starting with S, which expands to NT48 NT11. Each of these must be either terminals or non-terminals that can be expanded.\n\nBut looking at the given string, the first token is t55, which is a terminal. So, NT48 must produce t55. But in the grammar, do any of the rules for NT48 lead to a terminal? From the rules provided, I don't see any. All the rules for NT48, etc., are two non-terminals. So maybe NT48 is a terminal that just is t55, but that can't be, because NT48 is a non-terminal. Unless, perhaps, some of these rules indirectly lead to terminals.\n\nWait, looking deeper, I see rules like NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1, NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57, etc. And some of these rules may eventually resolve to terminals. For example, NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'.\n\nSo, perhaps NT48 can be expanded via a chain of productions until it reaches a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, I don't see a rule for NT48 beyond S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So perhaps NT48 doesn't have any production rules beyond that, which would mean that NT48 is a terminal symbol. But in that case, if the string starts with t55, that would mean NT48 is t55. But that would make NT11 to produce the second token, t27. But looking at the production for NT11: NTL11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Those are both non-terminals. Then, NT41 \u2192 t77, and NT49 \u2192 t47. So, if NTL11 is t41 t49, which are terminals, then NTL11 would produce t77 t47, but wait, looking at the string, the second token is t27, which doesn't match t77 or t47.\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps my initial approach is wrong because NT11 must expand into two terminals, but in the string, the second token is t27, which isn't matching the possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the rules. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the rules are given in a long list, so perhaps I should map each non-terminal to its possible expansions.\n\nHere's a list of non-terminals:\n\nNT48, NT44, NT12, NT6, NT58, NT57, NT49, NT11, NT32, NT45, NT34, NT39, NT35, NT1, NT31, NT7, NT37, NT13, NT52, NT44 (duplicate?), wait no, some might have multiple rules.\n\nWait, let's list each non-terminal and its productions:\n\n1. NT48: Only in S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, does NT48 have any other productions? Looking through the rules, I don't see any. So NT48 is a non-terminal that must be expanded in some way, but in the given rules, it's only used in S and doesn't have its own productions.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if NT48 doesn't have any production, then it can't be derived, meaning that the grammar can't produce any string starting with t55 because S \u2192 NT48 NT11 would require NT48 to produce t55, which can't happen if NT48 is a non-terminal without any rules.\n\nBut wait, maybe NT48 is a terminal. But in the context of CNF, non-terminals are those that can be split further, so NT48 should have some production. But according to the rules given, it's only appearing in the production S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so no production exists for NT48. That seems like a mistake because NT48 must have some production to be part of the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules.

It looks like it's in CNF because each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. That should make parsing manageable. The start symbol is S, which is rewritten as NT48 NT11. So, the top-level production is two non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a series of terms separated by spaces. Each term is either a symbol (like 't55', 't27') or a non-terminal (like NT48, NT11). Since the grammar only has non-terminals on the right side, each step in the derivation must expand a non-terminal into two others. \n\nLet me try to break down the string into the sequence of nodes that would have expanded it. The string starts with 't55'. Looking at the productions, I see NT55 produces NT21 NT59. So, 't55' could be the result of expanding NT55 at some point.\n\nSimilarly, the second term is 't27'. NT35 can expand to NT27 NT35. But that's recursive; maybe NT35 is another way. Wait, let's look at NT37: NT37 can expand into NT32 NT44 or NT13 NT34. Hmm, but in the string, we have 't27' next. Maybe I need to map each 't' back to the corresponding NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each 't' term and see which NT it's part of. For example, 't55' is the terminal from NT55. So, wherever NT55 is in the expansion, it becomes 't55' in the string.\n\nSimilarly, 't27' is part of NT35, because looking at NT35: NT27 NT57. Wait, no, NT35 expands to NT27 NT57, but the 't27' in the string must come from NT27, which is a non-terminal. But looking at the grammar, NT27 isn't one of the non-terminals listed. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the non-terminals are listed as NT33, NT34, etc. Let me check NT35 in the productions. NT35 -> NT47 NT44. And NT47 -> t48. Wait, no. Let's look again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT47 -> t48. So, if NT47 expands to 't48', that's a terminal. Similarly, NT35 expands to NT47 NT44. So, if I have a string that starts with 't47', that must come from NT47, which is a terminal. But in our string, 't48' isn't present. Wait, no, in the string, the first term is 't55', so let's look for where t55 comes from.\n\nLooking at NT55's production: NT55 -> NT21 NT59. So, the terminal 't55' comes from NT55. Let's see if NT21 and NT59 also produce t's. Checking NT21: NT21 -> NT33 NT45. Oh, wait, NT21 is a non-terminal. It produces NT33 and NT45. Do those produce t's? Let's see. NT21 -> NT33 NT45, so each of those must lead to terminals. Wait, but in the string, after 't55' comes 't27', which could be from NT27, but NT27 isn't directly listed. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string step by step. Let's start with the entire string. Each step would involve replacing a non-terminal with its two children. The string is a list of terminals, so we're looking for a way to decompose it into a series of expansions starting from S.\n\nSo, S produces NT48 NT11. Let's see if those can be matched to the start of the string. The first two terms are 't55 t27'.\n\nWait, NT48. Looking at the productions, is there an NT48? Let me check the list. Yes, NT48 -> t68, which is a terminal. Wait, but NT48 is a single terminal. So, if NT48 produces t68, then in the string, if we have 't68', that could come from NT48.\n\nBut in our string, the first two terms are 't55 t27', which don't match NS48 and NT11. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the original grammar is in CNF, so everything starts with the start symbol, which is S. S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, the string should start with the concatenation of what NT48 and NT11 expand into. Let's see what NT48 and NT11 produce.\n\nLooking at NT48: NT48 -> t68. So, NT48 produces a single terminal, 't68'. Similarly, NT11: looking at the productions, NT11 expands to NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, S \u2192 t68 (from NT48) followed by NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, the expansion would be t68 followed by the expansion of NT11.\n\nBut in our string, the first term is 't55', which doesn't match t68. That suggests that either the string doesn't start with what S expands to, which would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the productions more carefully. NT48's production is: NT48 -> t68, a single terminal. Similarly, NT11 is NT41 NT49. So, the initial expansion from S is t68 followed by NT41 and NT49.\n\nSo, for the string to start with 't68', followed by the expansion of NT41 and then NT49. However, our string starts with 't55', which isn't t68. That suggests that the string doesn't match the derivation starting from S.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check all the possible ways. Alternatively, perhaps the string doesn't start with the initial expansion, which would mean it's not generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to see if the entire string can be broken down into a series of expansions that starts from S and ends with the given string.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string backward. Starting from the end and seeing if each terminal can be matched to a production. \n\nLooking at the string: the last term is 't77'. Looking at the productions for NT77: I don't see any in the given list. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT31, NT7, etc., but no NT77. So, 't77' is not part of any production. So, perhaps 't77' is not part of the language generated by the grammar. That would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me scan the productions again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT48 -> t68, NT44 -> t66, NT6 -> t4, NT14 -> t42, NT43 -> t55, etc. Wait, looking at NT43's production: NT43 -> t55. Oh, wait, does NT43 produce t55?\n\nYes, looking again: NT43 -> t48? No, wait, checking the list: \n\nIn the productions, NT43 -> t55. So, NT43 produces 't55'. That's a terminal.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought NT43 produces 't55', which is a terminal. So, if we have a terminal 't55' in the string, that's okay if it comes from NT43.\n\nSimilarly, NT27: looking at NT35 -> NT27 NT57. So, NT27 can produce t27 if it's a terminal. But in the list, do we have any production for NT27? No. So, perhaps NT27 is a non-terminal that must expand further. So, for example, NT27 could produce t27 directly if it has a production, but in this case, looking at the rules, I don't see NT27 having a production. Wait, no, in the rules, NT35 produces NT27 NT57.

{"custom_id":"request-502","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar seems a bit complicated with a lot of non-terminals, each expanding into two other non-terminals. The string to check is: `t30 t42 t65 t10 t32 t55 t55 t58 t76 t26 t19 t5 t42 t81 t3 t12 t7 t73 t65 t19 t3 t68 t58 t76 t37 t66 t7`.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So each production rule in the grammar ends with either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to map each non-terminal to their productions. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so S can only expand into NT48 and NT11. Each of those NTs has their own productions, and so on until we reach the terminals. So the idea is to parse the given string from the start symbol S by replacing the non-terminals step by step until we reach the terminals, matching the given string.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to reconstruct the derivation that leads to the string. Since the string is all terminals, it must be the result of a sequence of productions that fully expand the non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar, there are a lot of non-terminals, and each rule is in CNF, it's not feasible to parse manually without a structured approach. Maybe I can look for the given string's structure and see if it can be broken down into the possible non-terminal expansions.\n\nThe string has 30 tokens, which is rather long, but perhaps some patterns emerge. Let me try to look for the presence of the terminals and see if they match any right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nI should start by identifying which terminals correspond to which non-terminals. For example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30', NT37 can produce 't32' or 't35', and so on. So each time a terminal appears, I can check if it's the terminal of any NT production.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step. Start with the beginning of the string: t30. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t30? Checking the rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 t76 or t30\n- NT37 \u2192 t32 or t35\n- Others don't directly produce t30.\n\nSo the first token is t30, which must come from NT33. Thus, the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11 (since S's first production)\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and first we have NT48 which must expand into something. But let's focus on the first token t30. How did that come?\n\nWait, the string starts with t30, which is from NT33's production. So perhaps the entire derivation starts with NT33 expanding into t30.\n\nBut S doesn't directly produce t30. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the start of the string is part of the expansion from some non-terminal. Let me think.\n\nWait, S can produce two non-terminals, so the first step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string should start with NT48 and NT11 expanding. Let's see what NT48 and NT11 produce.\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\nNT48: I don't see NT48 defined. Wait, in the given grammar, NT48 is actually used in the production for NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and also appears in NT48 \u2192 something. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and NT49 \u2192 NT65 (wait, no, NT65 is a terminal. Wait, the rules provided don't have NT65 as a production. Wait, the list of rules shows NT6 \u2192 t4, but NT26 and others. Wait, it's getting complicated.\n\nWait, the given grammar has rules like NT33 \u2192 't76' and 't30', which are terminals. Similarly, others produce terminals. So each non-terminal's production ends in a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each non-terminal in the grammar either produces two non-terminals (as in their production) or a terminal.\n\nSo the given start is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So both NT48 and NT11 must be further expanded into terminal strings.\n\nSo let's think about the string starting with t30, which is produced by NT33. So perhaps one of the NTs in the expansion leads to t30.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this by building the parse tree for the string. Let's see.\n\nThe string is: t30 t42 t65 t10 t32 t55 t55 t58 t76 t26 t19 t5 t42 t81 t3 t12 t7 t73 t65 t19 t3 t68 t58 t76 t37 t66 t7.\n\nThat's 30 tokens. The grammar is designed in such a way that each production either leads to a terminal or two non-terminals, so it's a binary tree.\n\nBut with so many tokens, it's tricky. Maybe I can check if the string can be constructed by the grammar's rules by traversing the possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a rough parse using the grammar:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n2. So we have [NT48, NT11]. Let's see what they produce.\n\nLooking up NT48: in the rules, I don't see NT48 listed, but wait, the rules provided are a long list. Let me scan for NT48:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT44, NT49, etc. Wait, I don't immediately see NT48 defined. Wait, the rules are:\n\nFor example, rule NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, and NT49 \u2192 NT65? Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, the given rules don't have NT48, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. ThenNT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, etc. So NT48 must be a non-terminal that's defined somewhere else in the grammar, but in the given list, I don't see NT48's production. That's unusual because in a properly defined CNF grammar, every non-terminal should have a production.\n\nWait, perhaps NT48 is in the list elsewhere. Let me check the full list:\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nNT48 \u2192 ...? I don't see it here. The rules provided are from NT33, NT44, NT55, etc. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, or maybe NT48 is defined elsewhere. Let me scan the entire list for NT48. No, I don't see it anywhere. That seems odd. Wait, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but NT48 isn't listed, which would mean it's undefined, which can't be. So perhaps it's a mistake, and I should check the NT rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps the user provided the NT rules incorrectly. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the rules provided, I don't see any starting with NT48. Wait, perhaps the first NT is NT45: NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1. Wait, maybe I misread the list.

Hmm, that's a bit complex, but I can try breaking it down.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) typically has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side consists of two non-terminals or terminals. But looking at the given grammar, I see some rules like S -> NT48 NT11, which are two non-terminals. So it's in CNF because both the left and right sides have non-terminals or terminals, but not more than two symbols.\n\nMy goal is to see if each token in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. So I'll try to parse the string from the beginning or maybe look for possible derivations.\n\nLet me list out the string tokens in order: t58, t59, t31, t7, t69, t15, t4, t59, t7, t24, t10, t22, t49, t32, t12, t26, t69, t26, t5, t58, t30, t65, t49, t26, t4, t68, t24.\n\nI think starting from the non-terminals and seeing if the string can be built up. Let me see the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT48 NT11. So S is the root, leading to NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 -> NT49, which then goes to NT11. Let's see what NT49 can produce. NT49 is in the rules as NT49 -> NT11 NT6. So that's NT49 --> NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, but NT41 is another place NT49 is used. Hmm. Let me try to track how each terminal might be derived.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to reconstruct a parse tree. Let me think about the string.\n\nThe first token is t58. Looking at the grammar, t58 is a terminal. So I need to find a production that can derive t58. Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT33 -> 't73' and NT33 -> 't76'. But t58 is not among those. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT33 has two options: 't73' and 't76'. Hmm, t58 isn't directly a terminal, but looking through the rules, I see NT40 -> 't65', which is a t65. Wait, let me check all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the direct terminals:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73' or 't76'\n- NT35 -> 't3' but that's not a terminal; wait, no, NT35 is a non-terminal unless it's a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT35 is on the left side, and on the right side, it has NT13 (another non-terminal?) or NT34? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each rule is a production. For example, S -> NT48 NT11. NT48 is a non-terminal, as it's in the left side. The right side is another non-terminal and maybe a terminal, but in this case, both are non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, each rule has either two non-terminals or a combination of non-terminals and terminals. Wait, for example, NT44 -> NT29 NT1? No, wait, the right side is NT29 (non-terminal) and NT1 (another non-terminal, since NT1 is on the left side elsewhere like NT1 -> NT19 NT41).\n\nWait, so in the given grammar, all the rules have two non-terminals on the right side, which suggests it's in Chomsky normal form because in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but some of these rules have a mix. For example, looking at NT29: NT29 -> NT7 NT35 (both non-terminals) or on another rule, NT29 -> 't69'. Wait, no, hold on. The rule is NT29 -> NT7 NT35, so that's a production with non-terminals. Wait, but in another part, does NT29 have a terminal? Let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT29, the rule is NT29 -> 't69' in one of the lines. No, wait, let me scan:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nLooking for any line that is NT29 -> ... ?\n\nAh, looking at line 22: \"NT29 -> NT7 NT35\" and line 28: \"NT25 -> 't58'\". Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the rules start with \"S -> NT48 NT11\", then \"NT44 -> NT42 NT13\", etc.\n\nLooking for NT29: There's a rule for NT29 -> NT7 NT35 (line 22) and another rule \"NT29 -> 't69'\". Wait, is that accurate? Let me check:\n\nWait, in line 20: \"NT20 -> 't26'\". In line 19: \"NT19 -> 't28'\". Line 18: \"NT18 -> 't69'\", line 5: \"NT58 -> NT31 NT33\". Line 6: \"NT57 -> NT9 NT37\". Line 7: \"NT47 -> NT13 NT34\". Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the given grammar, line 25: \"NT25 -> 't58'\". Line 6: \"NT57 -> NT9 NT37\". Line 54: \"NT33 -> 't73' or 't76'\". Line 16: \"NT16 -> 't26'\". Line 25: \"NT25 -> 't58'\". Line 7: \"NT47 -> NT13 NT34\". Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing the rule for NT29 correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a typo or I'm miscounting lines. Let me approach it differently.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a standard form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to understand how the non-terminals can be expanded into terminals. It might help to create a dependency tree to see how the starting symbol S can ultimately expand into the terminals in the string. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the only production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, S directly expands into two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. \n\nNow, I'll check the productions for NT48 and NT11:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT58 NT31 (from the given grammar)\n- NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n\nSo, S expands to NT48 and NT11, which each further expand into NT58 NT31 and NT41 NT49, respectively.\n\nThis gives the sequence NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT57, and NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT41? Wait, no, looking at the production for NT41: NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT41. Wait, that would be an issue because NT41 can produce itself indefinitely unless it terminates. But that seems incorrect because NT41's production should not refer to itself unless it's in the correct form and can eventually reach a terminal. \n\nWait, checking the production for NT41: NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT41. That's a recursive production. But in CNF, recursive productions can sometimes be problematic unless they have an exit. Let's check the other productions:\n\nLooking further:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT42 NT36\n- NT26 \u2192 NT59 NT24? Wait, NT26 isn't listed. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar provided only lists certain non-terminals and their productions. Let me make sure I'm looking correctly.\n\nI notice that NT26 isn't a non-terminal in the given grammar. Wait, actually, the grammar only has certain non-terminals, and the rest (like NT26) are not present, which is odd. Maybe it's a typo or I misread. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT48, NT44, NT12, etc. But nowhere do I see NT26. Wait, looking at the initial string, I see 't26' appearing, which must correspond to a terminal. So, perhaps NT26 is a production that eventually leads to 't26'. Let me check if any non-terminal ends up producing 't26'.\n\nLooking for where 't26' is defined: It appears in the productions for NT20 \u2192 NT7 NT36, and NT72 and others, but wait, looking through all the grammar, I see NT8 is defined as 't69', NT16 as 't26', so NT8 \u2192 't69', NT16 \u2192 't26'. But NT26 isn't present in the grammar, so perhaps 't26' is defined by another rule. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, actually in the given grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't69', and NT16 \u2192 't26'. So, any non-terminal that eventually expands to NT8 or NT16 can produce 't26'. Let me make sure. So, for example, if a production leads to NT16, which then can produce 't26'.\n\nSo, if I have a production like A \u2192 NT16, then A can derive 't26'. Similarly, if there's a production leading to 't26', that's terminal.\n\nBack to the string: The string has 't26' as the 12th token. So somewhere in the derivation, we need to have a production that leads to 't26'. Let's see.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT58 NT31.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33.\n\nNT31 (from NT58's production) is NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT7 NT36.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of tracing the entire string, I can try to break it down into smaller parts or look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be produced by the grammar by breaking it down into the correct non-terminals leading to the terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, let's break it down:\n\nThe string is: t19, t59, t53, t72, t42, t36, t72, t58, t12, t22, t22, t26, t7, t36, t42, t65, t30, t19, t59, t53, t4, t32, t15, t42, t36, t58, t81, t49.\n\nSo, after 't26', the next is 't7', which is NT7 \u2192 't53' (from the grammar). So, NT7 \u2192 't53'.\n\nLooking in the grammar, NT53 is not present, but wait, I need to check if any non-terminal expands to 't53'. Wait, 't53' is not directly a terminal in the grammar, but let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT28 \u2192 't59', but that's terminal. The production NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43. Then NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32, and NT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11, etc. Wait, maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the string as being generated by the grammar if it can be split into a series of non-terminals that correspond to the productions. Since CNF is about splitting into two symbols at each step.\n\nWait, the string has 31 tokens, which is a lot. Let me count:\n\n1. t19\n\n2. t59\n\n3. t53\n\n4. t72\n\n5. t42\n\n6. t36\n\n7. t72\n\n8. t58\n\n9. t12\n\n10. t22\n\n11. t22\n\n12. t26\n\n13. t7\n\n14. t36\n\n15. t42\n\n16. t65\n\n17. t30\n\n18. t19\n\n19. t59\n\n20. t53\n\n21. t4\n\n22. t32\n\n23. t15\n\n24. t42\n\n25. t36\n\n26. t58\n\n27. t81\n\n28. t49\n\nThat's 28 tokens. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount: from the user, the string has the following, splitting by spaces: 28 tokens. Hmm.\n\nSo, perhaps building a derivation tree starting from S and trying to parse the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language, but since the grammar is small, maybe I can do this manually.\n\nBut that might take too long. Maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal appears in the grammar as a terminal or can be derived through the productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many of the terminals are 'tN' where N is a number. Let me list the terminals present in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see terminals like 't19', 't59', 't53', 't72', 't42', 't36', 't72', 't58', 't12', 't22', 't22', 't26', 't7', 't36', 't42', 't65', 't30', 't19', 't59', 't53', 't4', 't32', 't15', 't42', 't36', 't58', 't81', 't49'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, each rule either produces terminals or combinations of non-terminals. So, the terminals in the grammar are those 't' followed by a number.

{"custom_id":"request-524","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form grammars have productions where each non-terminal on the left side of the arrow expands into two non-terminals. And importantly, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side except as a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, each production seems to follow that structure, so that's good.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t27 t36 t4 t59 t37 t28 t31 t65 t81 t58 t5 t59 t28 t76 t37 t73 t36 t22 t59 t65 t26 t10 t42 t5 t12 t32 t15 t31`.\n\nIt's a series of tokens separated by spaces, so I think each token is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, some of these strings are terminals, like 't76', 't45', etc. Others might be non-terminals, but in this case, the non-terminals would have two outputs.\n\nWait, the grammar is in CNF, so every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, for the string to be generated, it must be a result of expanding the start symbol through these productions, ending up with all terminals.\n\nLet me try to approach this by building the derivation. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Both NT48 and NT11 need to be expanded.\n\nLet's check the given string. The first part is 't27', but in the grammar, NT48's production isn't directly given as a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT48 isn't a non-terminal. Hmm, no, actually, the string must be generated by expanding the grammar until only terminals are left.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check the grammar again. The start symbol S produces NT48 and NT11. Looking up NT48 in the grammar, I see that there's no production for NT48 except perhaps indirectly. Wait, the grammar doesn't list NT48; perhaps I misread the initial part.\n\nWait, the initial grammar is:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nBut looking through all the rules provided, I don't see NT48 being expanded. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the actual Start symbol's production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but in the grammar, perhaps it's another structure. Alternatively, maybe I'm misreading the initial grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, the initial grammar is:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nBut then NT48 isn't listed as another non-terminal. Wait, maybe 'NT48' is actually a typo and should be NT45 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the production is S \u2192 NT48 NT44, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the initial S's production is being misread.\n\nWait, no, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\nNT58 -> NT31 NT33\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\nNT34 -> NT9 NT14\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11\nNT35 -> NT47 NT44\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\nNT37 -> NT13 NT34\nNT21 -> NT33 NT45\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\nNT33 -> 't76'\nNT33 -> 't30'\nNT40 -> 't65'\nNT20 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't25'\nNT41 -> 't77'\nNT20 -> 't53'\nNT52 -> 't7'\nNT25 -> 't58'\nNT59 -> 't24'\nNT14 -> 't76'\nNT8 -> 't69'\nNT16 -> 't26'\nNT47 -> 't48'\nNT13 -> 't5'\nNT52 -> 't37'\nNT55 -> 't72'\nNT43 -> 't15'\nNT44 -> 't73'\nNT6 -> 't4'\nNT59 -> 't12'\nNT49 -> 't81'\nNT13 -> 't19'\nNT52 -> 't10'\nNT37 -> 't32'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT11 -> 't31'\nNT30 -> 't84'\nNT7 -> 't36'\nNT29 -> 't5'\nNT30 -> 't22'\nNT19 -> 't28'\nNT30 -> 't10'\nNT7 -> 't53'\nNT12 -> 't37'\nNT52 -> 't55'\nNT18 -> 't69'\nNT52 -> 't25'\nNT33 -> 't73'\nNT55 -> 't83'\nNT6 -> 't49'\nNT44 -> 't66'\nNT7 -> 't28'\nNT28 -> 't59'\nNT14 -> 't42'\nNT43 -> 't55'\nNT35 -> 't27'\nNT48 -> 't68'\nNT49 -> 't47'\n\nWait, I see that NT48 is not listed as a non-terminal. Instead, S \u2192 NT48 NT11 must be a typo, perhaps. Alternatively, the initial S production might be using another non-terminal that I'm not seeing correctly. Alternatively, maybe the initial S is supposed to be NT48 NT44 or similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's S \u2192 NT48 NT44, which would make sense as NT48 is an established non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the initial grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but in the rest, I don't see any NT48 or NT11 except in other productions. Wait, is that possible? Because if S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and both NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals, they must have expansions.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, there's no production for NT48 or NT11 beyond their appearances in other productions. That can't be right. Unless I'm miscounting or something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a typo and the initial production is S \u2192 NT44 NT11? Let me check: NT44 is listed with NT42 and NT13, and it's being expanded. Similarly, NT11 is present in production S \u2192 NT41 NT49, etc. Maybe the initial S is S \u2192 NT44 NT11. That would make sense because it's a common non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT44 NT11. Because without that, it's unclear how S would expand since NT48 isn't defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake and the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT44, which would then follow the grammar.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed assuming that S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is correct, and perhaps that NT48 and NT11 have their own productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT48 is supposed to be 't' followed by a number, but since I don't see it in the grammar, maybe the initial S has a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the string, the tokens are actually symbols that correspond correctly. Let's look at the string again: it starts with 't27', which corresponds to NT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44, and NT47 \u2192 't48', and NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57.

{"custom_id":"request-539","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is produced by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to structure context-free grammars. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, I need to check if all the productions follow this structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- The first rule is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. That's two non-terminals, so that's fine.\n- Then NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13. Again two non-terminals.\n- NT12 \u2192 NT31 NT58: same thing.\n- And so on. I see that most of the rules are non-terminals producing two non-terminals. But wait, I notice some rules like NT33 -> 't76' and NT33 -> 't30'. Oh, right! Those are terminal productions, so they're fine too because they produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, the grammar seems to be in Chomsky Normal Form because all the production rules are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nNow, I need to check if the given string can be generated by this grammar. The string is: `t28 t19 t28 t53 t36 t42 t66 t47 t22 t28 t31 t69 t31 t3 t7 t4 t7 t31 t77 t5 t27 t32 t26 t59 t25 t5 t73 t69 t69`.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to either parse the string backward or forward, following the grammar's rules. Parsing can be tricky, especially for a grammar this complex.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, it's equivalent to a pushdown automaton, and perhaps we can use a recursive descent parsing method or handle it using a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm. But I'm not too familiar with the CYK algorithm, and given the time, maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nWait, another idea: I can construct the parse tree step by step. Starting from the start symbol S, which is NT48 NT11. So the string should be built by first generating these two parts: the first part from NT48 and the second from NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t28. Let's see what NT48 can produce. From the grammar, NT48 has a production: NT48 \u2192 NT47 NT47. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar rules:\n\nNT48 is not directly listed except perhaps in the end with 't68' because I see NT48 \u2192 t68. Wait, no, looking again, the last rule is NT48 \u2192 t68. Hmm, so NT48 is a terminal rule: NT48 \u2192 t68.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar carefully:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT48 appears in NT42 \u2192 NT47 NT47, but that's not the case here. Wait, no. Let me scan each NonTerminal:\n\nLooking for NT48:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t68 (last rule for NT48).\n\nYes, so NT48 produces the terminal 't68'. So the first part of S is NT48, which gives us 't68', and the second part is NT11.\n\nHmm, but the given string starts with 't28'. So that doesn't match. Wait, that can't be right because the first production of S is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would produce something like 't68 ...'.\n\nBut the string starts with t28, not t68. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is NT48 NT11. So the start string must begin with whatever NT48 produces, which is 't68', followed by whatever NT11 produces.\n\nBut the given string starts with t28. Since t68 is a terminal, but it's not the same as t28, this suggests that either S is not producing t28 as the first symbol, or perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Looking again at the grammar:\n\nAfter S, NT48 is present, but looking through all the rules, the only NT that directly expands to a 't' is:\n\n- NT33 can expand to t76 or t30.\n\n- NT37 \u2192 t15.\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t47.\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t5.\n\n- NT52 \u2192 t7.\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t73.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t4.\n\n- NT14 \u2192 t76.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t36.\n\n- NT29 \u2192 t5.\n\n- NT30 \u2192 t84, t22, t10, t28.\n\nWait, hold on: looking for non-terminals that expand to terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT30 \u2192 t84, t22, t10, t28.\n\nYes, so NT30 can produce 't28'. So perhaps the string is built starting from a different part of the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that S is NT48 NT11. Let me check the production again.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11. So yes, S expands into two non-terminals, NT48 and NT11.\n\nBut NT48 \u2192 t68, which is not 't28'. Therefore, the string cannot start with 't28' if it's generated by S. So that would mean the string is not part of the language generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a way to parse the string such that NT48 produces a different sequence that includes 't28'? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the production.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo in the grammar. Let me double-check the grammar to see if NT48 has another production beyond 't68'.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nWait, no, only NT48 \u2192 t68 is present. So NT48 can only produce 't68'. So the first symbol of any string derived from S must be 't68' followed by whatever NT11 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with 't28', which does not match 't68', so that would immediately disqualify it. Therefore, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe there's a way for the NT48 part to derive a longer string that includes 't28' later on, but that doesn't make sense because NT48 is a terminal symbol; it can't expand further. Each NT48 is just a single terminal, so the first symbol must be t68.\n\nWait, wait, but perhaps I misread the S production. Let me check again.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the entire string must start with t68, but the given string starts with t28. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nHmm, unless I'm making a mistake in understanding the grammar. Let me check whether any NT can derive a t28.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't28'. From the rules, in the non-terminals, NT30 can produce 't28' as one of its options.\n\nWait, but in the strings, the start is S, which is NT48 and NT11, so how would the string begin with NT30?\n\nAh, perhaps the string is generated in a way that the initial expansions are more complex, but given that the S production directly requires NT48 and NT11, the start must begin with their expansion. So unless there's a way for the NT48 or NT11 to expand into other non-terminals that could eventually produce 't28', but given that NT48 is a terminal, it can't. NT11 could, maybe?\n\nWait, NT11's production: Looking back, in the list:\n\nLooking for NT11's rules:\n\nWait, the rules list:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nHmm, so NT11 is a non-terminal that expands into NT41 and NT49. Both of these are non-terminals, so we can follow them further.\n\nSo perhaps the initial part of the string is generated by NT11, which could be split into NT41 and NT49.\n\nWait, perhaps the string's start isn't directly from S.

{"custom_id":"request-546","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right. Each production either is a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the analysis and makes it suitable for algorithms like the CYK parser.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that it has a mix of non-terminal symbols (like S, NT44, NT12, etc.) and some production rules that directly produce terminal strings (like 't76', 't30', etc.). Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions should be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But in the given grammar, I see some rules like NT33 \u2192 't76' or NT33 \u2192 't30', which are direct terminals. That's a bit unusual because CNF typically deals with non-terminals. However, since they're allowed to produce terminals, maybe that's part of the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t25 t69 t68 t77 t65 t72 t83 t49 t15 t30 t58 t31 t28 t48 t28 t15 t36 t22 t72 t73 t73 t15 t5 t69 t81 t72 t10 t66 t28`.\n\nI need to check if there's a derivation from the start symbol S that results in this string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string should be a leftmost derivation in steps that double the number of non-terminals each time, leading to a parse tree where each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, eventually terminals.\n\nThe approach could be to parse the string using the grammar and see if it can be built step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to work backwards by seeing if each part of the string can be derived from the rules.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts and see if I can match them to the rules.\n\nFirst, the string starts with `t25`. Looking at the grammar, I see NT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37, which sometimes produce 't25' when NT9 \u2192 't25'. Also, NT14 \u2192 't76' isn't helpful here. So, perhaps NT57 is the one because it can take the terminal 't25' if NT9 is 't25' and NT37 is something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for rules that produce 't25' directly. Checking the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 't69', NT14 \u2192 't76', NT25 \u2192 't58' perhaps (wait, NT25 is in the grammar: NT25 \u2192 NT58?), but that might not produce 't25'.\n\nWait, looking again, I notice that the grammar has some non-terminals that produce specific terminals:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't84' or 't3'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't81'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't8' or 't35'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't59'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't55'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't59'\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should make a list of all the non-terminals that have rules producing a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' (once)\n- NT33 \u2192 't30' (another rule for NT33)\n- NT9 \u2192 't25' (once)\n- NT40 \u2192 't65' \n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n- NT11 \u2192 't31'\n- NT31 \u2192 't8' or 't35' (but those are non-terminals leading to 't8' when certain conditions are met)\n- Wait, no, actually, NT31's rules produce other non-terminals, so how does it end up as a terminal? Oh, because some of those non-terminals might lead to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the string step by step, trying to match the leftmost symbols and seeing if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start with the first symbol: t25.\n\nLooking at the grammar to see which non-terminals produce 't25':\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't25' directly.\n\nSo, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT44 NT11. So, S becomes NT44 NT11.\n\nNow, NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, and NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT44 NT11 \u2192 (NT42 NT13) (NT41 NT49).\n\nNow, I need to see if the string starts with t25, which would require that one of these non-terminals produces t25. Looking at the rules, only NT9 does. So, perhaps NT49 can produce t25? Wait, check NT49: NT49 appears in the grammar as:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.\n\nSo NT49 is composed of NT11 (which is NT41 NT49) and NT6 (which is NT52), and NT6 is NT52, which is NT14. NT14 is 't76' or something else?\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Let me think alternatively.\n\nSince the string starts with t25, let's look for a part of the string that could be derived from a non-terminal that directly produces 't25'. From the grammar, only NT9 does that with NT9 \u2192 't25'.\n\nSo, let's look for 't25' in the string, which is the 8th symbol, but wait that's not correct\u2014the string starts with t25, so position 1 is 't25'.\n\nWait no, the full string is:\n\nt25, t69, t68, t77, t65, t72, t83, t49, t15, t30, t58, t31, t28, t48, t28, t15, t36, t22, t72, t73, t73, t15, t5, t69, t81, t72, t10, t66, t28.\n\nI think I should process the string step by step, trying to match each terminal and see if we can form a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree bottom-up or using a recursive descent approach.\n\nAnother method is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar by seeing if each terminal can be part of some production's derivation.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the given grammar's productions to see if each terminal can be linked through the required steps.\n\nLet me list the possible ways each terminal could be produced:\n\n- t25: From NT9 \u2192 t25.\n\n- t69: From NT14 \u2192 t76? No, wait no. Wait, looking for which non-terminals have rules that produce 't69'. Hmm, the rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't69'\n\nIs any non-terminal linked to NT18? Let's check the grammar.\n\nLooking for where NT18 appears. In the first set of rules, I don't see NT18 as a left-hand side. But looking further down:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT18 \u2192 't69'.\n\nBut wait, in the initial grammar list, I see:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't69'\n\nSo, NT18 can produce 't69'.\n\nSimilarly, t68 is produced by NT48 \u2192 't68'?\n\nLooking through the rules, NT48 \u2192 't68'.\n\nt77: From NT41 \u2192 't77'.\n\nt65: From NT40 \u2192 't65'.\n\nt72: From NT57 \u2192 't73'? Wait no.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37. If NT9 \u2192 't25' and NT37 \u2192 't72' or perhaps NT37 can be further broken down.\n\nWait, looking for rules that produce 't72': In the rules, I see NT57 \u2192 't73' isn't there.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must start with NT48 and then NT11. Let me parse the string:\n\nThe first two tokens are t58 and t84. I need to see which NT rules produce t58 and t84.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' and 't30'\n- NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33\n- NT84 doesn't directly appear, but maybe through a production that leads to t84.

Hmm, actually, looking at the productions, none of the NTs produce t84 directly. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each production for 't84':\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't26', 't53'\n- NT7 \u2192 't12', 't36'\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'\n- NT30 \u2192 't84', which is one of the options, so NT30 \u2192 't84'\n\nAh, so NT30 \u2192 't84'. That's the production. So in the string, the first token is t58, which must come from an NT production that results in t58.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, NT48 and NT53 appear in the string, so let's see which NTs produce t58.\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57\n- NT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37\n- NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\n- NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57 (again)\n- Also, looking through other NTs: NT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44\nWait, but t58 is a terminal. Looking at the list, the NTs that have a terminal in their productions:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the NT productions are all of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 terminal. For example, NT33 \u2192 t76 and t30. So to get t58, it must be produced by an NT rule where a terminal is t58. Scanning through the grammar, I don't see any NT \u2192 't58' directly. Hmm, that seems like a problem. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar, NT58 is defined as NT31 NT33. So NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33. Each of those NTs must produce a terminal or another non-terminal. For example:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8 and NT30 \u2192 t84. So NT31 can produce t20 and t8, or t84 if NT30 is used.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me step back and try to parse the string using the top-down approach, starting from S and trying to break down the string into the required NTs and terminals.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt58 t84 t48 t37 t27 t30 t53 t49 t66 t53 t26 t77 t77 t83 t59 t73 t28 t42 t15 t30 t3 t22 t30 t83 t81 t5 t73 t58 t30 t81\n\nI'll list them as tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t58\n2. t84\n3. t48\n4. t37\n5. t27\n6. t30\n7. t53\n8. t49\n9. t66\n10. t53\n11. t26\n12. t77\n13. t77\n14. t83\n15. t59\n16. t73\n17. t28\n18. t42\n19. t15\n20. t30\n21. t3\n22. t22\n23. t30\n24. t83\n25. t81\n26. t5\n27. t73\n28. t58\n29. t30\n30. t81\n\nThe goal is to match this sequence starting from S.\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first part of the string should be NT48, then NT11.\n\nLooking at token 1: t58. Does any NT produce t58? Checking the productions, I don't see any NTs that directly produce t58. The closest is NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33. So unless NT31 and NT33 produce terminals, t58 itself isn't a terminal, but a combination. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the NT production rules again to see if any of them produce t58 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 t76 or t30\n- NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33 (so it's a two-symbol terminal if NT31 and NT33 produce t)\n- Similarly, other NTs may produce combinations.\n\nWait, but no NT directly produces a single 't58'. So if the first token is t58, it must come from an NT production that produces t58 as part of a combination, but that's not possible because t58 is a single terminal. So perhaps I need to check if any of the NTs can produce t58 as a result of their own productions.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1, which would produce 't42' and 't' or similar, but not t58.\n- NT7 \u2192 't36', not t58.\n- None of the NTs directly produce t58 as a terminal. So this suggests that the string cannot be derived because the first token is t58, but there's no NT that directly produces t58. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me cross-verify. For example, NT58 is NT31 followed by NT33, so the production is a combination. But for t58 to appear as a single token, it would have to be either a terminal (which none of the NTs are) or a two-symbol production. But in the string, each token is a single symbol, so t58 must be produced directly by an NT rule. Since none are, this suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should try another approach, like seeing if the string can fit into the grammar's productions step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 must be a production. Looking for NT48 in the grammar:\n\nSearching the NT rules, I don't see NT48 as a rule, but maybe it's a typo elsewhere. Wait, looking through, I see NT48 is one of the terminals. Wait no, NT48 is an NT, but in the grammar, is there a production for NT48? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT48 being produced by anything. So if the grammar doesn't have a production for NT48, then it can't generate anything with t48.\n\nWait wait, that's a problem. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT with NT48. For example, NT31 is produced by NT20 and NT8, but nowhere is NT48 a product of any NT.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. My string is a sequence of t and numbers, and I need to see if I can derive it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the first production is S -> NT4 t48 NT11. So S starts with NT4 and followed by t48, then NT11. Wait, no, looking again, S is NT48, but in the string, it's t4, t49, t81, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is written with capital letters, but the string starts with lowercase t's. That indicates lowercase symbols are terminals. So the first symbol after S is NT48, which then splits into two non-terminals: NT4 and T48, but in the string, it's t4, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should check the productions. Let me look at the productions for NT48. Oh, I see NT48 -> NT31 NT6. So NT48 is two non-terminals, each of which needs to be expanded until all are terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t4, t49, t81, t3, etc. Let me try to reconstruct the parse tree. Starting from S: NT48 and NT11. Each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nNT48 is NT31 NT6. NT31 is NT20 NT8. NT20 -> t26 (terminal). NT8 -> t69 (terminal). So NT31 is t26 t69. Then NT6 is NT52 NT49. NT52 -> NT14 NT32. NT14 is t76, NT32 is NT39 NT57. NT39 is NT40 NT11. NT40 is a terminal (t65), NT11 is a terminal (t31).\n\nPutting that together, NT6 (t76, t76, t40, t31)? Wait, no, wait: NT6 is NT52 and NT49. NT52 is t7 (terminal), NT49 is t1 (terminal)? Wait, no. Let me check the productions for NT52 and NT49.\n\nLooking at NT52 -> NT14 NT32, and NT14 is t76, NT32 is NT39 NT57. NT39 -> NT40 NT11, which are t65 and t31 respectively. So NT32 is t65 t31. Then NT52 is nt14 (t76) and nt32 (t65 t31), so NT52 becomes t76 t65 t31.\n\nMeanwhile, NT49 is NT11 NT6. NT11 is t31, and NT6 is t76 t65 t31. So NT49 is t31 t76 t65 t31.\n\nSo S is NT48 (t76 t65 t31) and NT11 (t31). So the entire string would be (t76 t65 t31) followed by (t31). But wait, in the string, the first part is t4, t49, t81, etc. So maybe I'm getting t76, t65, t31, t31, but the string starts with t4. That doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the NT symbols. Let me start fresh. The string is t4 t49 t81 t3 t53 t26 t49 t84 t28 t83 t7 t66 t48 t3 t73 t68 t53 t10 t19 t4 t15 t5 t32 t10 t22 t59 t24 t53 t77 t36.\n\nWait, S is NT48 NT11. NT48 is NT31 NT6. So first, let's expand NT48 and NT11.\n\nNT48: NT31 NT6. NT31 is NT20 NT8, which is t26 and t69. So NT31 is t26 t69. NT6 is NT52 NT49. Now, NT52 is NT14 NT32, which are t76 and NT32. NT32 is NT39 NT57. NT39 is NT40 NT11, which are t65 and t31. Then NT57 is NT9 NT37. NT9 is t25, and NT37 is NT30 NT35. NT30 is t84, and NT35 is NT3 t3. Wait, looking back, NT35->t3. Wait, in the productions, NT35->t3. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me go step by step again.\n\nStarting with S: NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 -> NT31 NT6.\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8. Both are terminals: t26 and t69. So NT31 = [t26, t69].\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32.\n\nNT14 -> t76 (terminal). So NT14 is [t76].\n\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57.\n\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11.\n\nNT40 -> t65 (terminal). So NT40 is [t65].\n\nNT11 -> t31.\n\nSo NT39 = [t65, t31].\n\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37.\n\nNT9 -> t25 (terminal). So NT9 = [t25].\n\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35.\n\nNT30 -> t84 (terminal). So NT30 = [t84].\n\nNT35 -> t3 (terminal). So NT35 = [t3].\n\nThus, NT37 = [t84, t3].\n\nSo NT57 = [t25, t84, t3].\n\nTherefore, NT32 = [t65, t25, t84, t3].\n\nSo NT52 = [t76, t65, t25, t84, t3].\n\nThen, NT49 is NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, NT49 is NT11 NT6. NT11 -> t31. NT6 we already expanded as [t76, t65, t25, t84, t3]. So NT49 = [t31, t76, t65, t25, t84, t3].\n\nSo putting it all together, S is NT48 (which is [t76, t65, t25, t84, t3]) and NT11 (t31). So the derived string is t76, t65, t25, t84, t3, t31.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with t4, t49, etc. That doesn't match my derived string. So either I'm wrong, or the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in expanding NT48. Let me check NT48 again. NT48 is NT31 NT6. Expanding NT31 as [t26, t69], and NT6 as [t76, t65, t25, t84, t3]. So combining, S would be [t26, t69, t76, t65, t25, t84, t3, t31]. But the string starts with t4, which isn't in any of these, so it's different.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar and the string. The string is `t19 t4 t81 t48 t66 t24 t30 t69 t7 t28 t81 t68 t3 t10 t66 t37 t26 t48 t81 t22 t7 t55 t4 t58 t19 t10 t66 t30 t47 t31 t58`. So it's a sequence of t's followed by numbers. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many non-terminals expand into pairs of non-terminals, except some that expand into terminals. Since all rules have two non-terminals on the right, I need to see if the string can be split into a series of these productions without any leftover symbols.\n\nBut instead of expanding, maybe it's easier to see if the string can be broken down step by step starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string should start with whatever NT48 expands to and then NT11. Let me check the string. It starts with t19, so perhaps NT48 expands to t19 or some combination leading to t19.\n\nLooking at the NT48 rule: NT48 \u2192 t48. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT48: I see NT48 \u2192 t48, actually. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t48\n\nSo that's a terminal. So the first part is NT48 \u2192 t48. But in the string, the first token is t19, not t48. Hmm, that's a problem. So either I'm misunderstanding the grammar rules or maybe the production for NT48 is different.\n\nWait, looking again, under NT48, the production is probably not direct. Because in the given grammar, I see for example:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nBut also:\n\nNT47 -> t48\n\nAh, so I might have misread. Let me check each production one by one.\n\nLooking for NT48 in the grammar. Scanning through, I see:\n\nNT48 -> t48\n\nWait, yes, the production for NT48 is directly t48. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would expand to t48 (from NT48) followed by whatever NT11 expands to. But in the string, the first token is t19, not t48. So that suggests that either the string isn't generated by this grammar or perhaps NT48 can expand in a way that leads to t19. But since NT48 directly produces t48, it can't expand further. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the NT48 production. Let me look again:\n\nLooking down the list, here's the NT48 line:\n\nNT48 -> t48\n\nYes, that's right. So S starts with NT48 which becomes t48, and NT11 which, from the grammar, is S's second part. Let me check NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11: NT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nAnd NT41 \u2192 t77, NT49 \u2192 t81. So NT11 \u2192 t77 t81. Therefore, S \u2192 t48 t77 t81.\n\nBut the string starts with t19. So unless my initial assumption is wrong, the string can't be generated because the first symbol requires t48 but the string starts with t19.\n\nWait, is there another path? No, because NT48 directly produces t48. There's no rule that connects NT48 to other non-terminals that might derive to t19 through expansions. So the first symbol t19 can't be generated from NT48.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again, maybe the production for NT48 is something else. Scrolling through all the NT lines, the only NT that directly produces a terminal and leads to a t is NT48 \u2192 t48, NT47 \u2192 t48, but that's it. So unless there's a non-terminal that can produce t19, which I don't see, the string can't start with t19.\n\nMoreover, the string doesn't end with the required symbols either. But even if that weren't the case, the first symbol issue is a showstopper.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t19, which cannot be derived from NT48 in the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-583","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. My goal is to determine if the string can be generated by the grammar. The string given is:\n\nt72 t84 t36 t22 t28 t22 t47 t24 t53 t73 t32 t59 t73 t53 t65 t83 t42 t83 t53 t27 t10 t3 t77 t59 t42 t83 t7 t55 t66 t32 t10.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11. Each production is a combination of two non-terminals, except some that directly produce terminal symbols. My task is to parse the string and see if it can be derived from S using the productions.\n\nI notice that NT11 appears in the start production. Looking at NT11's productions, I see NT11 -> NT41 NT49 and NT11 -> NT30 NT32. So I can split the parsing into branches based on these options.\n\nLet's split the string into possible branches at NT11. The string starts with t72 t84 t36 t22 t28 t22 t47 t24 t53 t73 t32 t59 t73 t53 t65 t83 t42 t83 t53 t27 t10 t3 t77 t59 t42 t83 t7 t55 t66 t32 t10.\n\nBut this approach might be too broad; maybe I should look for matching terminals first. Let's go step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t72. I need to find where t72 comes from in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see NT55 -> t21 t59 and NT55 -> t72. So t72 can come from NT55. So the first production is NT55 -> t72. That means the first part of the string must start with NT55.\n\nSo, the string starts with t72, so that would mean the first part is NT55 -> t72. Now, what's the structure of NT55? Looking back, the grammar doesn't have a rule for NT55, except in the terminal cases. Wait, actually, no production for NT55 as a non-terminal; all the given rules have non-terminals on the left side except the terminal symbols. Wait no, the initial grammar might have only a few non-terminals and rules, but perhaps some are missing here. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, NT55 is listed as a terminal: NT55 -> t21 t59 and NT55 -> t72. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, NT55 is a non-terminal only if it's on the left side. Looking back, I don't see any production starting with NT55. Oh wait, actually, the user provided a long list of productions. I need to check each rule where NT55 appears as the left-hand side. Going through the list:\n\nLooking for NT55 -> ... Yes, there's NT55 -> t21 t59 and NT55 -> t72. So NT55 can produce two terminals: t21 t59 and t72. So t72 is the second option for NT55.\n\nSo the first symbol is t72, which corresponds to NT55 -> t72. Now, the next symbols after t72 are t84, t36, t22, etc. So after t72, we need to see if there's a production that uses NT55. Wait, no, because NT55 is a terminal now, so it's the end of that path. So the parse tree would have to branch from S to NT48 and NT11, then one of them leads to NT55 leading to t72, and the other part would need to produce the remaining symbols. But this might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is split into parts where each pair of symbols corresponds to a production. Like, S produces two non-terminals, so the string is a concatenation of the expansions of these non-terminals in order.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 36 symbols long. Since S produces two symbols, each step would double the length. However, because some non-terminals produce multiple symbols, this could complicate things. Alternatively, the string could be split into parts where each part is a concatenation of the expansions of the left-hand sides of the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to work backward: start from the string and try to reduce it using the grammar rules. This is known as a top-down or bottom-up parse, but since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (each production has two non-terminals or terminals), perhaps a recursive descent parser or looking for the structure.\n\nBut in any case, perhaps a better way is to try to see if the string can be broken down into the products of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t72, t84, t36. Is there any production that has these as parts?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken into the parts generated by NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 36 symbols. If S produces NT48 and NT11, each of these may generate a number of symbols. The total would be the sum of the lengths of the expansions of NT48 and NT11.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to split the string into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT48 and the second by NT11.\n\nBut wait, the string is 36 symbols. So if each non-terminal expands into a certain number of symbols, perhaps this can be checked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to each step in the grammar.\n\nWait, another idea: check whether the string starts with t72, which is NT55, and then see what comes next.\n\nSo starting with t72 (NT55), the next term is t84.\n\nLooking at the NT55 rules, it can only produce two possibilities: t72 or t21 t59. So after NT55, depending on which production is used, the next symbols would vary.\n\nIf NT55 -> t72, then the string after t72 would need to come from another NT55 or something else? Wait, but after t72, the next symbol is t84, which is a terminal, so it has to be part of another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, starting with the initial symbols.\n\nThe string starts with t72. As established, that comes from NT55 -> t72.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t84. So after NT55 producing t72, the next symbol should be produced by another non-terminal. Wait, but NT55 can only produce t72, so perhaps this approach isn't correct. Maybe the initial assumption is wrong, and the string isn't derived correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parse starts with S -> NT48 NT11, so the string is split into two parts: the first part generated by NT48, and the second by NT11.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt72 t84 t36 t22 t28 t22 t47 t24 t53 t73 t32 t59 t73 t53 t65 t83 t42 t83 t53 t27 t10 t3 t77 t59 t42 t83 t7 t55 t66 t32 t10.\n\nIf we split this into two parts, say, before and after a certain point, perhaps at the middle. But perhaps NT48 expands to the first part and NT11 to the second.\n\nNT48: Let's look at the production rules. Looking for NT48, in the list provided, I see:\n\nNT48 -> t68 NT49 (I don't see NT48 as a non-terminal on the left; perhaps it's a terminal. Wait, looking through the list, I see NT7 -> something, NT28 -> t59, etc., but I don't see NT48 as a non-terminal. So perhaps NT48 is a terminal symbol. But wait, that's not possible in a context-free grammar; non-terminals can only be on the left side.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let me check each rule again to see if any have NT48 as the left-hand side. Scanning through:\n\nNT48 appears nowhere on the left side. So NT48 is not a non-terminal. Therefore, perhaps it's a typo, and it's meant to be another non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT6 -> t4, NT49 -> t47, etc., but no NT48.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the rules.

Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its first production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the initial step is to expand NT48 and NT11.\n\nNT48 has a production: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. Let me note those:\n- NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49 (from another rule)\n\nSo, expanding NT48 gives us NT49 and NT6. Then, NT6 expands to NT52 and NT49. Now, NT52 has a production: NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32.\n\nContinuing this way, each non-terminal should eventually produce a terminal string. I need to see if the given string can be generated by following these productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t66 t73 t24 t55 t7 t68 t26 t48 t22 t76 t81 t31 t68 t69 t19 t76 t65 t68 t19 t47 t84 t31 t49 t49 t27 t84 t73 t37 t22 t22 t30 t32.\n\nI see that t66 is a terminal. Let me check where t66 comes from. Looking through the grammar rules, I see NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1. However, NT29 has a rule: NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35, and looking further, NT29 \u2192 't69'. Wait, but in the expansions, I might need to trace how t66 is formed.\n\nWait, the grammar has a rule NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1, but NT29 also has another production to 't69'. That's a bit confusing because NT44 can't expand to t66 directly. Let me check all the rules to see where t66 comes from.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1. But NT29 is defined as NT7 NT35 or 't69'. Wait, no\u2014NT29 seems to have two rules: one to NT7 NT35 and another to 't69'. So, NT29 can produce 't69' and also other non-terminals. So, if NT29 becomes 't69', then NT44 would produce 't69' and NT1.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t66 as the first symbol. How does that happen? Let me look for where t66 comes from. From the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 't4' and NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6, which is 't6' in the string.\n\nWait, let me go step by step. The first symbol is t66. Wait, but looking at the grammar, the initial symbol is S, which expands to NT48 NT11. So, the string should start with the expansion of NT48 followed by NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So, NT48 would produce 't66'? Because in the rules, NT49 \u2192 't81' or is there another rule for NT49? Wait, let me find all NT49 rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nAnd then NT49 \u2192 't66'? No, wait, I need to check all the NT49 rules.\n\nWait, let me list NT49's productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (appears twice, I think)\n- NT49 \u2192 't66'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n\nSo, NT49 can produce 't66' or 't81'. \n\nSo, if NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6, and NT49 can produce 't66' or 't81', and NT6 can produce 't4', then the expansion would start with 't66' or 't81' followed by 't4'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first symbol is t66. So, perhaps in the first step, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, then NT48 \u2192 't66' (from NT49) and NT6 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, but NT48's first production is NT49 NT6, so NT48 would expand to NT49 and NT6. So, NT49 can produce 't66' or 't81', and NT6 can produce 't4'. So, combining this, the first two symbols would be 't66' followed by 't4' because 't66' is produced by NT49 and 't4' by NT6.\n\nBut looking at the string, the second symbol is 't73', not 't4'. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, maybe this path is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT49 produces 't81', which would make the first symbol 't81', but that's not the case here either. Wait, no, the string starts with 't66', which is correct if NT49 \u2192 't66' and NT6 \u2192 't4'. But the string's second symbol is 't73', so that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion order. Let me think again.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Then, NT48 expands to NT49 NT6, which is 't66' and 't4' as above. Then, NT11 expands to NT41 NT49. Now, NT41 can produce 't77', and NT49 \u2192 't66' or 't81'. So, the third symbol would be 't77' and then either 't66' or 't81'.\n\nBut in the given string, the third symbol is 't73', not 't77'. That's a problem. This suggests that the first production path might not be correct, or there might be a different way to expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT48 is expanding differently. Wait, perhaps I'm missing other NT48 rules. Let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar, the only production for NT48 is NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. Is there another production for NT48? No, it only has that one. So, I can't avoid NT49 and NT6. So, the first two symbols should be the expansions of NT49 and NT6.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbol is 't66' (from NT49), and the second is 't73' (from NT6)? But NT6 only produces 't4', so that can't be. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion of S. S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, expanding both NT48 and NT11 one after the other. So, NT48 produces some string, and NT11 produces another string, concatenated together.\n\nGiven that, the string after NT48 would be NT49 NT6. Wait, no, NT48 expands to 't66' and 't4' as above, but the next part is NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, which expands to 't77' and 't66' or 't81'.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the initial expansion would result in some sequence starting with 't66 t4 t77 ...' but the given string starts with 't66 t73 ...', so 't4' isn't there, which suggests that perhaps this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing another production for NT48. Let me look again at the grammar. Yes, looking back, NT48 only has one production: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So, that's the only way to expand NT48.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently by building a parse tree from the string.

Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring the production rules where every left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side has either one non-terminal or two terminals. Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo looking at the given grammar, it seems that each production right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.

The string has 35 symbols, all of which are terminal symbols, so each of them must be matched by some production in the grammar.\n\nEach production in CNF can generate either a single terminal or expand into two symbols. Since our goal is to generate the string, each production used during the derivation must match the next symbols correctly.\n\nTo simplify, maybe I can reverse the string because the way the grammar works, the derivations start from the start symbol and expand outward. By processing the string from the end backward, I can try to see if each production can correspond to the next two symbols.\n\nLet me list the string again: t69, t48, t65, t4, t73, t69, t24, t15, t36, t28, t68, t4, t66, t77, t4, t69, t53, t49, t5, t30, t31, t76, t76, t12, t19, t72, t26, t15, t5, t25, t5, t27, t4, t30.\n\nLet me denote this as a list: [t69, t48, t65, t4, t73, t69, t24, t15, t36, t28, t68, t4, t66, t77, t4, t69, t53, t49, t5, t30, t31, t76, t76, t12, t19, t72, t26, t15, t5, t25, t5, t27, t4, t30].\n\nI'll reverse this to process it backward: [t30, t4, t27, t5, t25, t5, t15, t26, t72, t19, t28, t68, t4, t77, t76, t31, t30, t69, t53, t49, t5, t9, t66, t7, t48, t65, t69, t48, t65, t4, t73, t69, t48, t65, t4].\n\nWait, in the original grammar, looking at the productions, some are terminals. For example, some entries have 't76' as a terminal, others 't24', 't15', etc. So I'll need to check each step to see if a production matches.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some terminals are mapped to specific NTs. For example, `NT33 -> 't76'`, `NT30 -> 't84'`, but also, NT30 has another production, right? Wait, looking back: In the grammar, I see NT33 has two productions: -> 't76' and -> 't30'. Hmm, that's unusual because each non-terminal in CNF should produce exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, some entries like `NT33 -> 't76'` and `NT33 -> 't30'`. That's each NT33 has two productions, each producing a terminal.\n\nWait, but according to CNF, each production for a non-terminal should be in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each non-terminal should have one production. But here, for NT33, there are two productions: one producing 't76' and another producing 't30'. That probably isn't correct. Maybe it's a mistake, or maybe the grammar is not properly formatted.\n\nBut I guess I should go with the given grammar, assuming that each NT has multiple productions, perhaps branching into different possibilities. So, for example, a non-terminal may produce multiple sequences, and the parser will choose which one to take when expanding.\n\nSo, starting from the reversed string, step by step:\n\nThe string in reverse is [T30, T4, T27, T5, T25, T5, T15, T26, T72, T19, T28, T68, T4, T77, T76, T31, T30, T69, T53, T49, T5, T9, T66, T7, T48, T65, T69, T48, T65, T4, T73, T69, T48, T65, T4].\n\nLet me process this step by step.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is t30. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t30?\n\nLooking at the given entries: I see NT15 -> 't30', and perhaps others? Let me search through the entries for t30.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT -> t30:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the entries, I see NT15 -> 't30', and NT30 -> 't84', which is a terminal.

Let me check again. The grammar entries are in the provided code. Looking through them:\n\n- NT42 -> NT55 NT25\n\nWait, some of them are terminals, others are non-terminals. Wait, this is getting time-consuming.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because it's straightforward for certain parsing methods and makes it easier to apply algorithms to derive the string.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a CFG in CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and one non-terminal or a terminal on the right. The start symbol here is S, and the productions recursively define how symbols can be expanded until all are terminals.\n\nThe approach to check if the string is generated by the grammar is to use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose. Alternatively, I could try to manually derive the string step by step, but with such a long string, that would be cumbersome. The CYK algorithm systematically checks each substring of the string to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nHowever, since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can look for patterns or specific rules that might quickly lead or fail to generate the string. Let's see.\n\nThe string consists of t's and numbers. Each non-terminal in the grammar either expands to two non-terminals (as it's in CNF) or a terminal. So, each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that directly produces that symbol. Looking at the grammar, many non-terminals expand into two non-terminals, but some directly to terminals, like NT33 \u2192 't73', NT35 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of these terminals, and I need to see if there's a way to follow the derivations that result in this sequence.\n\nGiven the length of the string (41 symbols), using the CYK algorithm would involve creating a table where each cell (i, j) represents the range from symbol i to j. The idea is to check for each possible substring whether there's a non-terminal that can produce it, considering that each production has two symbols on the left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps breaking down the string into parts and seeing if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. Start with the first symbol, 't65'. Looking at the grammar, NT52 \u2192 't7' and 't35' (line 55: NT52 -> NT14 NT32; NT32 can go to 't57', but 't7' is also an option.

{"custom_id":"request-667","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is pretty large with a bunch of rules, and the string is a sequence of symbols, many of which are 't' followed by numbers, but some are just letters like NT11, NT48, and so on. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule is either a single terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. The grammar given fits this, as each rule has exactly two parts on the right, except for those that produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals (NT) eventually produce a terminal string. For instance, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'. This suggests that some paths in the grammar lead directly to terminal symbols, while others may require more steps.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terms: `t15 t47 t10 t65 t59 t65 t27 t72 t27 t73 t73 t76 t84 t26 t10 t19 t84 t77 t81 t76 t76 t7 t76 t48 t12 t7 t37 t68 t12 t25 t5 t47 t48 t10`. \n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. However, considering the size of the grammar and the string, that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nLooking closer, the string has multiple 't's with numbers, but also some NT symbols. I notice that some of the NT rules produce combinations that might form parts of the string. For example, NT12 -> NT31 NT58, and NT31 can produce t8 or t35, and NT58 can produce t31 or t33. This seems a bit convoluted, so perhaps I should think of the string as being constructed in parts.\n\nAn important point is that in CNF, each production alternates between symbols and terminals. So, each step in the derivation alternates between adding non-terminals and terminals. But in this case, the string starts with 't15', which is a terminal, so the first step would have to be a production that starts with a non-terminal that can produce a terminal. But wait, the top-level grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT48, and NT48 isn't a terminal, so if the string starts with a terminal, that might be a problem. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rules that produce 't15' directly or through some chain. Wait, I see NT47 -> t48, but maybe I can find where 't15' comes from. Let me scan the rules.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, I see NT20 -> 't26', NT37-> t48, NT13-> t5, etc. But 't15' isn't directly produced by any NT rule. Hmm, that might be a red flag. If the string starts with 't15', but no NT rule produces 't15', that could mean it's not part of the language. So maybe the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe it's possible via some composition. Let me see if any NT rules can produce 't15' through a chain of productions. Let's look for NT rules that could lead to 't15'. \n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT49 has production rules like NT49 -> NT11 NT6, NT11-> NT41 NT49, and NT6-> t4. So this could lead to a chain, but 't15' isn't in that subtree.\n\n- NT14 has rules like NT14 -> t76, NT8-> t69, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think if 't15' is even present in any of the strings that the grammar can generate. Let me check which NT rules have 't15' in their productions. Scanning through, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't15'.

CNF is useful for parsing because you can apply the CYK algorithm or other methods to check if a string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals like 't83', 't10', etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is a binary split, and the string should be a series of binary splits, meaning the length should be 2^n for some n. Let me count the tokens: t83, t10, t25, t7, t58, t4, t58, t53, t28, t3, t7, t77, t5, t49, t81, t69, t5, t15, t76, t22, t65, t7, t10, t28, t7, t77, t73, t15, t65, t77, t12, t3, t36, t59, t76. That's 35 tokens. Wait, 35 isn't a power of two. The nearest powers are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). So that suggests the string might not be a full binary tree, which could be a red flag, but not necessarily a 'No' answer. Maybe it's just a string with some extra symbols, but I don't think the grammar would generate strings that aren't binary trees.\n\nNext, I need to see if the grammar can derive this string step by step. Each production either combines two non-terminals or emits a terminal.\n\nLet me start at the top of the grammar: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first step is to split into NT48 and NT11. Each of these needs to derive parts of the string.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6. Wait, that would mean S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 NT11 NT6 NT11. Then, each of those NTs needs to be expanded further. But this might get too complicated quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward approach. Each production in the grammar resolves to a terminal or another non-terminal. So starting from S, it branches into NT48 and NT11. Let's see what NT48 can do.\n\nLooking at NT48, it has a production NT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So S \u2192 NT11 NT6 NT11. Then, each NT48 splits into NT11 and NT6. Now, let's look for how NT11 and NT6 can expand.\n\nNT11 has a production NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So S's first split becomes NT41 NT49 NT6 NT11. Now, NT41 \u2192 NT77, according to some production. NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7, and NT6 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, I might be overcomplicating it. Maybe the tokens correspond directly to the non-terminals in a specific way. Let's map the string tokens to possible non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't83'. Looking at the productions, 't83' appears in NT55. NT55 can produce 't72' or 't83'. So if NT55 is part of the derivation, it could produce 't83'.\n\nWait, but how does NT55 get involved? Let me check the productions again. NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59. NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45, and so on. It might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should trace the string from the leaves up. Let's see if the string can be broken down into non-terminals that can be produced.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps looking for terminals that can't be further split. For example, if a non-terminal is supposed to expand into two other non-terminals or a terminal. So if a term like 't72' isn't a terminal but a production, but in this case, the string has 't83', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, some NTs map directly to terminals. For example, NT14 \u2192 't76', which appears multiple times in the string. Similarly, NT12 \u2192 't37' and others.\n\nBut the string is quite long. Maybe it's better to see if the grammar can produce a string of this length by checking the possible binary splits.\n\nGiven that the string has 35 tokens, which isn't a power of two, but the grammar might accept it if it's not a complete parse tree. However, in Chomsky Normal Form, the string length must be a power of two, as each split produces two symbols. So a string of length 35 isn't a power of two, which suggests the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. The grammar's structure could allow some symbols to be terminals, effectively changing the structure. Wait, no. Because in CNF, each rule produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So if a symbol is a terminal, it's a leaf, and non-terminals have two children.\n\nSo the entire sentence must have a derivation tree where each non-terminal splits into two nodes, either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But since the start symbol is S, the derivation tree must have a binary structure, leading to a string with length 2^n.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the number of nodes in the parse tree is 2^k -1, but the string length would be the number of terminal nodes, which is 2^{h} where h is the height. Hmm, perhaps not exactly, but the length of the string must be a power of two if all symbols are non-terminals. But if some symbols are terminals, perhaps the length isn't necessarily a power of two. For example, if some non-terminals produce a terminal and a non-terminal, the string can have varying lengths.\n\nWait, no. Each production is binary. So starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each step of the derivation doubles the number of symbols. For example, S \u2192 A B (each A and B are non-terminals). Then each of A and B can split into two, giving four symbols, then eight, etc. So the length of the string must be a power of two because each split doubles the number of terms. So if you start with one non-terminal, after k splits, you have 2^k terminal symbols. So the string length must be 2^k for some k. 35 is not a power of two, so the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So when you derive, each non-terminal step increases the number of symbols by a factor of two. Starting from 1 (S), then 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. So any string length that's not a power of two can't be generated. Since 35 isn't a power of two, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wow, that's a long string with all these 't' tokens. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means every production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at it, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT48 NT11. So the entire string will eventually be a combination of the terminals from these non-terminals. \n\nI should probably list all the non-terminals and the terminal symbols they can produce. Let me go through each production rule and note if they lead directly to a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nStarting with S:\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nThen, NT48 -> NT12 NT49 and NT49 -> NT11 NT6. So NT48 can be NT12 NT49 or NT11 NT6. Let me check NT12: NT12 -> NT31 NT58, and NT58 -> NT31 NT33. NT31 has two options: NT20 NT8 or NT8 NT35. NT20 -> 't26' or NT52 -> 't7'. NT8 is another branch: 't69' or NT35. Wait, this seems complicated. Each non-terminal has multiple branches, so I might need to track the possible paths.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't76'. Let me see where 't76' comes from. Looking through the production rules, I see NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'. Also, NT41 -> 't77', NT14 -> 't76', etc. So maybe the string starts with t76.\n\nLooking at NT14: NT14 -> 't76', so that could produce t76. So if I can trace back, maybe NT33 is part of the chain, but wait NT33 is a non-terminal with two options. But in the string, first t76, so maybe looking for where t76 comes from.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT14 -> t76, so if I have a path that leads to NT14, that can produce t76. Then, let's see how NT14 is derived.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string step by step. Let's try to see if we can build the string backwards or find a way the string can be formed.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is t69. Hmm, looking through the productions, NT13 -> t5, NT43 -> t15, but wait, t69 comes from where? Wait, looking at the productions, I don't see a production that directly gives t69 unless it's part of NT59 -> t59? No, wait. Let me check: NT39 -> NT40 NT11, and NT40 -> 't65'. Also, NT18 -> t69. So t69 is produced by NT18 or NT40.\n\nWait, in the string, the token t69 appears near the end. So maybe the last part of the string comes from NT40, which is 't65' or 't18' or somewhere else? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, the string should have a length that is 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the number of non-terminals. But given the string has 40 tokens, that might not be the case. Alternatively, each production step increases the number of symbols by one. So for example, S is S (two symbols if we break it down more). It might not be straightforward, but perhaps I can look for the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see if all the t tokens in the string can be derived from the grammar. Since each production rule eventually resolves into terminals or non-terminals, perhaps I can check if each 't' token in the string is produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt76 t73 t19 t36 t53 t27 t4 t69 t73 t65 t48 t76 t48 t7 t84 t4 t19 t36 t53 t59 t28 t28 t28 t59 t42 t31 t3 t7 t68 t7 t3 t28 t47 t5 t72 t69.\n\nI'll check each token:\n\n1. t76: Available in NT14 and NT41.\n2. t73: Look for where t73 comes from. Maybe NT27 or NT47? Wait, looking at the productions, NT14 -> t76, NT41 -> t77. Hmm, where is t73 produced? Wait, in the rules, I see NT44 -> t73? No, wait, in the production of NT44: it's broken into NT29 NT1. Let me check all the rules. Wait, looking through all the production rules, I don't see any direct t73 being produced. Wait, this is critical. So if the string has t73, but no production rule gives t73, then that's a problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, I see NT47 -> 't48' and NT44 -> 't73'? Wait, no. Let me check the rules again. Oh, I see NT44: NT44 -> NT29 NT1. And in another rule, NT44 -> NT12 NT57. Wait, does any rule produce t73?\n\nWait, let me look again. Are there any NT productions ending in t73? Looking through, I think I see NT7 -> 't36', NT29 -> 't5','t53'. Hmm, but I don't see any production directly giving t73. For example, NT47 -> t48, which would be t47 becomes t48.\n\nWait, in the string there's a t73 token at position 2. So, where could t73 come from? If there's no rule that produces t73, then that token is invalid, so the string is not in the language. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

Alternatively, I can think of the string as a series of terminals and see if each can be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a sequence that can be broken down into non-terminals that expand into the terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t25 t47 t28 t5 t22 t59 t66 t77 t3 t25 t32 t73 t7 t37 t77 t77 t31 t65 t58 t81 t42 t77 t73 t24 t22 t36 t48 t73 t77 t36 t26 t76 t59 t48 t81 t32\n\nI notice that it's a series of t... sequences, which are likely the terminals in the grammar.\n\nNow, let's see what the start symbol S can produce. The initial production for S is:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nSo, the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. Each of these needs to produce a sequence that when combined, forms the input string.\n\nSo, let's break it down into two parts: the left part NT48 and the right part NT11.\n\nStarting with NT48, what are the productions? Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT48 -> 't68'\n\nWait, NT48 has a production to a terminal 't68', so that's straightforward. But in the string, after S, the first part is NT48, which should derive to 't68'. Looking at the string, the first token is 't25', not 't68', so this seems off. Wait a minute, maybe I got the order wrong.\n\nWait, the first token in the string is t25, but according to the production S -> NT48 NT11, the first part should be NT48 and then NT11. If NT48 reduces to 't68', but the string starts with t25, that would mean that t25 should be the first terminal generated by NT48. But looking at the grammar, does NT48 ever produce t25?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT48 is only produced by 't68'. So NT48 cannot produce any other terminal. So if S -> NT48 NT11, then the first part is t68. But the string starts with t25, so that's a discrepancy. Therefore, maybe the initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps the parse tree is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar rules have other non-terminals that can produce t25.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT20 -> 't26' and another NT20 -> 't53'. But I'm getting off track.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the productions. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT that expand to 't25'. Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\nNT20 -> 't53'\nNT19 -> 't28'\nNT37 -> 't25'\nAh, there it is. NT37 has a production NT37 -> 't25'. So perhaps the first part of the string starts with NT37.\n\nWait, but S starts with NT48. So if NT48 produces 't68', and the string starts with t25, which is another terminal, maybe the parse tree is more like S -> NT48 NT11, and then NT48 somehow produces a string that includes t25.\n\nBut wait, NT48 produces a single terminal, so if NT48 is 't68', then the first token should be 't68', not 't25'. Therefore, the initial assumption that S is NT48 NT11 leading to 't68' followed by something else might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misread the grammar. Let me double-check the productions:\n\nLooking for where NT48 is defined. Checking through the productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the production NT48 isn't shown because all rules are given. Instead, looking through each rule: some are NT33, NT33... Wait, perhaps I'm missing NT48.\n\nWait, no, in the rules provided, it's possible that NT48 is being defined in another way. Let me look carefully.\n\nWait, in the given rules, some lines are duplicated, like NT57, NT44, etc. Wait, I see that for NT44, there's a rule NT44 -> NT29 NT1, but looking for NT48, I think I might have overlooked it.\n\nWait, perhaps the lines are presented in a way that some are commented. Wait, no, it's hard to see. Let me recount the rules.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, I need to find if NT48 is present.\n\nLooking at each production line:\n\nYes, the lines include:\n\nNT48 -> 't68' (I think this is the case because I see earlier lines like NT48 -> 't68'). So NT48 -> 't68' is a production.\n\nSo, if NT48 produces 't68', then the first token in the string should be 't68', but in our case, it's 't25'. Therefore, S cannot start with NT48 if the first token is 't25'. So that suggests that either I'm misunderstanding something, or perhaps the parse tree is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial NT48 is actually part of a larger structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT48 NT11, which are two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can further expand.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial NT48 is not just a terminal, but can itself expand into a sequence that starts with 't25'.\n\nWait, NT48 -> 't68' is the only production, so it can't expand. So S -> NT48 NT11 would produce 't68' followed by whatever NT11 produces.\n\nBut in the string, after t25, perhaps the NT48 part is a subtree that starts differently.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt25 t47 t28 t5 t22 t59 t66 t77 t3 t25 t32 t73 t7 t37 t77 t77 t31 t65 t58 t81 t42 t77 t73 t24 t22 t36 t48 t73 t77 t36 t26 t76 t59 t48 t81 t32\n\nSo it's a series of tokens.\n\nLooking at the beginning: the first token is t25.\n\nSo perhaps the first non-terminal in S's expansion is a subtree that produces t25. But in S's production, it's NT48 NT11. So perhaps NT48 is not just a terminal, but can lead to a longer path. But in the grammar, NT48 is only a terminal, so that would only produce 't68'.\n\nWait, unless NT48 can somehow be part of a larger expansion. But in the grammar, NT48 is defined only once, so it can't do that.\n\nWait, this is confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-699","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it has two non-terminals on the right-hand side of each production, except for the start symbol which can have only one non-terminal sometimes. Wait, actually in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that each rule on the left starts with 'S' or an 'NTx' where x is a number. The start symbol is S, which produces NT48 and NT11. So, the process starts with NT48 and NT11, and each of them branches out.\n\nBut the key step is to see how the string is built up by the productions. The string given is a sequence of terminal symbols, each separated by spaces. I need to parse this string according to the grammar to see if it can be derived.\n\nFirst, let's list the production rules for clarity. For example:\n- S -> NT48 NT11\n- NT44 -> NT42 NT13\n- NT12 -> NT31 NT58\n- And so on.\n\nEach NT is a non-terminal symbol. The left side is always a single NT, and the right side is two other NTs. Except for the very first step where S produces NT48 and NT11, after that, all productions are non-terminals.\n\nThe string has 28 tokens: t26, t58, t55, t10, t76, t77, t22, t73, t68, t3, t5, t3, t32, t37, t81, t58, t83, t10, t65, t47, t36, t27, t68, t77, t72, t66, t3, t25, t19, t26. That's 27 tokens?

Oh, I think I missed some earlier. Hmm.\n\nNow, starting with S, which produces NT48 and NT11. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to derive the respective tokens.\n\nLooking at the right-hand side tokens, the first two are t26, t58, but NT48 and NT11 produce their own sequences. So, the entire string needs to be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT48 and NT11.\n\nSo, let's analyze each non-terminal.\n\nStarting with NT48: From the rules, NT48 -> NT49 NT6.

I think I missed NT48.\n\nWait, in the given rules, perhaps I didn't list all.

Let's see.\n\nIs there any rule for NT48?\n\nWait, perhaps NT48 is generated from other NTs. Let's see if any production leads to NT48.\n\nLooking at the rules, do we have any NT where the right-hand side includes NT48?\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides:\n\nFor example, NT40 \u2192 't65' (terminal)\nNT49 \u2192 't47'\nNT33 \u2192 't73', 't5'\nNT33 again has another production: another 't73'? No, wait, in the given rules, I see:\n\nLine 36: NT33 \u2192 't73'\nLine 37: NT33 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, so NT33 can produce either 't73' or 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't3' and 't27'\nSo, perhaps it's a matter of chaining these.\n\nBut for NT48, let's try to see if any of the NT rules have NT48 on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\nLine 3: NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13\nLine 4: NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1\nLine 5: NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57\nAnd so on.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any production where a production's RHS has NT48 except in the S rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing NT48 as a terminal, but in the given rules, the terminal productions don't include 't48' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a form where each production rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right-hand side. CNF is useful for certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I need to use that here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t77 t32 t42 t55 t58 t12 t5 t22 t4 t5 t22 t55 t7 t5 t42 t42 t81 t69 t47 t3 t32 t58 t42 t5 t83 t37 t25 t32 t84 t66 t15 t55 t22 t42 t27 t53 t47`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of tokens starting with 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, it seems many non-terminals directly produce these 't' tokens followed by numbers, such as NT33 -> 't73', NT35 -> 't3', etc. So, each 't' token is linked to a specific production rule.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string step by step using the grammar, trying to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the production rules and see how they can generate 't' tokens.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT40 -> 't65', 't28', etc.\n- NT11 -> 't31' etc.\n- NT30 -> 't84', 't10', 't22', 't37', 't55', etc.\n- NT7 -> 't36' etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't77'. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a production rule that directly produces 't77'. Hmm. Let me check all rules. Looking through the list, I see NT49 -> 't81', NT13 -> 't5', NT52 -> 't7', 't37', etc. But where is 't77' coming from?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a rule that directly produces 't77'. Let me scan the rules again. Oh, here's NT55 -> 't83', 't72', etc. But 't77' isn't directly produced by any rule listed here. So, this might be a problem because 't77' isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules provided.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't77'. Only NT49 produces 't81', but not 't77'. So, does that mean that the string contains a token that the grammar can't generate? If that's the case, then the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but is it possible that 't77' is part of a non-terminal's production? Let me look again. All the rules are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. For example, S -> NT48 NT11. So, each production has two parts.\n\nSo, for 't77' to be in the string, it must be generated by a production that directly has 't77' on the RHS. Looking at all the rules provided, I don't see any production that results in 't77'. Therefore, the string contains a token ('t77') that isn't allowed by any rule, meaning it can't be derived from the grammar. So, the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nThe rules go up to NT53 and some others, but I don't see 't77' in any production. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the given grammar. So, the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't77' is a combination of two terminals. Wait, but looking at the rules, each terminal is followed by a number, like NT33 -> 't73', so 't73' is a single token.

{"custom_id":"request-727","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and it's already in a specific form where each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That might help because I can use the CYK algorithm for parsing, which works efficiently with CNF grammars. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if I remember the exact steps of the CYK algorithm. Maybe I should look up a quick recap in my mind.\n\nThe CYK algorithm takes a string and a grammar and determines whether the string can be generated by the grammar. It does this by creating a table where each cell represents a substring of the string and checks if there's a non-terminal that can directly produce that substring. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That should simplify the checks because I don't have to deal with more than two symbols in a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that there are several non-terminals that directly produce terminals. For example, NT33 can be 't76' or 't30', NT40 can be 't65', and so on. These are the leaf nodes of the parse tree. The other productions involve combining non-terminals, which suggests that the string is built up by combining symbols from the start symbol S = NT48.\n\nThe given string is: `t84 t49 t76 t81 t55 t15 t4 t49 t12 t68 t5 t73 t59 t31 t77 t73 t25 t55 t53 t7 t25 t55 t12 t24 t47 t72 t47 t77 t68 t30 t65 t53 t15 t27 t32 t68 t22 t36`.\n\nSo, I need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar starting from NT48.\n\nLet me first list out the symbols to see the length. The string has 43 symbols. Since each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the derivation tree must have a structure that allows for this length. \n\nLet me start by considering the start symbol NT48. According to the grammar, NT48 can only produce NT49 and NT6. Because the string starts with 't84', which is a terminal. So, I need to see if there's a production where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that can derive 't84'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT7 -> NT12 NT43. Wait, but that might not help directly. Let me check the productions for terminals.\n\nLooking for 't84', I see a production: NT30 -> 't84'. So, 't84' corresponds to NT30. So, perhaps the derivation starts with NT30. But how does NT30 relate to the start symbol?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a result of expanding the grammar starting from NT48. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of production will replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals. So, the entire string must be a leftmost derivation where all the non-terminals are replaced by the respective terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that each production in the grammar produces either two non-terminals or a terminal, so the top-down approach involves pushing symbols onto the stack and trying to match the input string.\n\nWait, but with CYK, I need to create a table. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each terminal in the string can be reached by some non-terminal's productions.\n\nLet me try to see each symbol and see if there's a non-terminal that can directly produce it.\n\n1. t84: NT30 \u2192 t84, so NT30 can be expanded to t84. So, t84 is part of NT30.\n\n2. Next symbol is t49. How is t49 generated? Looking for a production that directly produces t49. From the grammar, I see NT49 can produce t16 or t7. Wait, maybe not. Let me check all productions where the right-hand side includes t49.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT19 \u2192 NT28 NT41, but that doesn't include t49. Wait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me check each rule until I find t49.\n\nWait, the rules are in a list. Let me scan through the productions:\n\n- NT1: NT19 NT41\n- NT31: NT20 NT8\n- NT7: NT12 NT43\n- NT37: NT30 NT35\n- NT11: NT41 NT49\n- NT52: NT14 NT32\n- NT44: NT12 NT57\n- NT29: NT7 NT35\n- NT12: NT39 NT32\n- NT55: NT21 NT59\n- NT42: NT55 NT25\n- NT37: NT13 NT34\n- NT21: NT33 NT45\n- NT40: NT28 NT1\n- NT49: NT16 NT7\n- NT31: NT8 NT35\n- NT33: 't76' or 't30'\n- NT35: 't3'\n- NT11: 't31'\n- NT30: 't84' or 't22' (Wait, no, looking back: NT30 has two rules? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT30 -> t84 and also NT72 which is t22? Or maybe I misread. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT30 -> t84 (line in grammar)\n\nAnd also another production for NT30: NT30 -> t22 (maybe not, perhaps the list includes multiple rules for the same non-terminal).\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT has several productions. For example, NT30: \n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT30 -> t84\n\nand perhaps another production? Wait, no, let me double-check:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT33 -> 't76' and 't30'\n\nNT30 -> t84\n\nWait, is there another rule for NT30? I don't see it; maybe I'm wrong. Let me count the grammar lines.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, after NT30 -> t84, there's NT7 -> t36, and other rules. So, perhaps NT30 only has one production, t84. Hmm, wait, but other lines have NT30 appearing as the left-hand side; let me check.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT30 -> t84 is one of the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps another rule for NT30, maybe NT30 can produce two non-terminals, so that in a production. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have multiple rules for each NT, but some may have terminals and others have non-terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at NT33: two productions, t76 and t30.\n\nNT30: perhaps just one production, t84. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, in the grammar, looking at NT30, the only production is NT30 -> t84. So, NT30 can only be replaced by t84, no further steps needed.\n\nSo, the second symbol, t49, must be produced by another non-terminal. Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT49 can produce 't16' or 't7' via the production NT49 -> NT16 NT7. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT49 in the productions:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT49 with other non-terminals. Let me check the productions for each NT.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the productions for each non-terminal and see which terminals they can produce.\n\nFor example, NT30: production is t84.\n\nSimilarly, NT33 has two terminals: t76 and t30.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all the non-terminals and their possible productions (both non-terminals and terminals).\n\nLet's try that:\n\n- NT33: can produce t76 or t30.\n\n- NT29: produces t5.\n\n- NT14: t76.\n\n- NT37: t13 or t34.\n\n- NT7: t12 or t43.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT7, the production is NT12 NT43, but wait, no, in the grammar:\n\nNT7: NT12 NT43.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules and the terminal symbols. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT44, NT12, etc. The terminals start from 't' followed by numbers, such as 't22', 't73', and so on. Some of these terminals match exactly with the string's tokens, so that's a good sign.\n\nThe given string is: `t22 t73 t72 t4 t12 t73 t55 t69 t76 t25 t69 t55 t59 t36 t76 t72 t10 t58 t48 t24 t4 t81 t24 t32 t65 t4 t3 t72 t12 t15 t73 t47 t26 t28 t30 t19 t24 t59`.\n\nI notice that each token in the string must be produced by a production rule, and the structure of the string should follow the grammar's derivation.\n\nI'll start by looking for possible starting points. The top-level string starts with 't22', 't73', etc. But the first symbols in the grammar are S -> NT48 NT11, which means the first symbols should come from NT48 and NT11. Let's see what NT48 and NT11 produce.\n\nLooking up NT48: From the grammar, NT48 is 't68'. Wait, that can't be right because in the string, the first token is 't22', not 't68'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar is S -> NT48 NT11. So NT48 is a non-terminal, but in the rules, I see NT48 -> 't68'. Oh, okay, so S is initially split into NT48 and NT11. Let me check what NT48 and NT11 produce.\n\nSo the first part is NT48, which produces 't68' and the second part is NT11, which from the rules is NT11 -> NT41 NT49. Then NT41 is 't77' and NT49 is 't81'. So S would generate 't68 t77 t81'... Wait, but the string starts with 't22 t73...', so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break down the string into parts based on the grammar's structure. Since each rule is binary, the string is a concatenation of these rules. So the string can be parsed by recursively applying the rules.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be divided. Starting from the beginning: 't22 t73 t72 t4...'\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several rules that produce 't' followed by numbers. I'll list some of them to see which might fit.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73' or 't30'\n- NT35 -> 't3' or 't27'\n- NT21 -> 't25' or 't35'\n- NT44 -> 't73' or 't72'\n- NT45 -> 't29' or 't1'\n- NT15 -> 't19' or 't73'\n- NT12 -> 't37' or 't32' or 't18'\nWait, no, NT12's production is actually broken down into subrules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NT12 subrules are in the initial part. For example, NT12 has subrules like NT12->NT31 NT32, NT12->NT37->... Wait, it's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but since this is a thought process, I'll try to visualize it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see which parts of the string can fit into the leftmost derivations of the grammar.\n\nLet me take the string and see if it can be split into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string starts with 't22 t73 t72 t4 t12 t73 t55 t69 t76 t25 t69 t55 t59 t36 t76 t72 t10 t58 t48 t24 t4 t81 t24 t32 t65 t4 t3 t72 t12 t15 t73 t47 t26 t28 t30 t19 t24 t59'.\n\nLooking for the production rules that produce 't22'.

Wait, no, in the list, I see NT20->'t26', NT22 has to be checked.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT30 -> 't84', 't22', 't10'\n- NT7 -> 't36', 't53', 't28', 't57'?\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLet me list the rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT20 -> 't26', 't53', 't52' wait no:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> 't26', 't53', 't7' (Wait: NT7 -> 't36', 't53', 't28', 't43').

But the terminal 't22' comes from NT30, which is produced from NT30.\n\nSo, in the string, 't22' must come from NT30, which has 't22' as one of its options.\n\nSo, the first token is 't22' -> from NT30. Then the next is 't73', which is T73.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't22 t73...'.\n\nNow, considering that S is S-> NT48 NT11.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't22', which is from NT30. So maybe that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the initial derivation needs to have S split into NT48 and NT11. Then NT48 is 't68' and NT11 is, say, 't77' and 't81', as I thought earlier, leading to 't68 t77 t81', which doesn't match the first token 't22'.\n\nHmm, that suggests maybe S can't directly start with 't22' because its first production is into NT48 and NT11.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper. Maybe the string is built deeper into the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be built up step by step from the bottom.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm approach. But since this is a thought process, I'll try a different approach.\n\nAnother idea is to see if the string can be split into rules as per the grammar. Let's consider each token and see how it can be generated.\n\n1. The first token is 't22', so possible rules are those that produce 't22' directly or via subrules.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal, do they produce 't22'?\n\nLooking at all the production rules:\n\n- NT30 -> 't22', 't84', 't10'\n- So, the only way to get 't22' is from NT30.\n\nSo, the first symbol must come from NT30.

{"custom_id":"request-743","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is in the language defined by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a good structure for parsing. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I'll need to process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the string for clarity:\n\nt76 t32 t25 t73 t30 t81 t48 t47 t4 t36 t84 t83 t12 t27 t68 t22 t3 t68 t30 t26 t26 t24 t84 t42 t10 t53 t81 t66 t19 t84 t22 t5 t76 t72 t36 t72 t28 t42 t72.\n\nI'll approach this problem by building the parse tree from the string and seeing if it can be derived using the given grammar rules.\n\nThe grammar consists of a set of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT48, etc.) can be rewritten as two other non-terminals or a terminal (like t1, t2, etc.). Each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A and B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each rule produces exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal. This structure makes it suitable for a recursive descent parser, where each production rule can be matched top-down.\n\nMy plan is to start from the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be derived. The start symbol is S -> NT48 NT11. So, the string should start with the symbols generated by NT48 followed by NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t76. Let me check what NT48 produces. Looking at the grammar rules, NT48 -> t68. So, NT48 -> t68. That's a terminal.\n\nNext, after NT48, we have to have NT11. Let's look at NT11: NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So, NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49.\n\nThe string's second token is t32. Let's see what NT41 produces. NT41 -> t77. So NT41 -> t77. Next, NT49's rule is NT49 -> t81. So, NT49 -> t81.\n\nWait a minute, the string after the first t76 is t32, t25, etc. But after t76, we have t32 as the next token, which should be the result of NT41 (t77) and NT49 (t81). But the string shows t32 after t76, which doesn't match either t77 or t81. So this might indicate a problem.\n\nWait, no, the production for NT48 is t68, so the first token should be t68, which it is. Then, after that, NT11 should produce t77 and t81. So the next tokens should be t77 and then t81. However, the second token is t32, which doesn't match t77 or t81. That seems off.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. The start symbol is S -> NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols should be NT48 followed by NT11. NT48 is t68, so the first token is t68. Then NT11 -> NT41 NT49, which should produce two symbols: NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at the string again: after t68 (which is the first token), the next tokens are t32, t25, t73, t30, etc. So t32 should be the next symbol after t68. But t32 is supposed to be the result of NT41 (t77) and NT49 (t81), which are both different. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after S, the first symbol is t68 (from NT48) and the second symbol is t77 (from NT41) from NT11, but the string shows after t68 comes t32, which doesn't match. So that suggests that the string might not be valid. But maybe I'm missing something in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial NT48 is t68, and the next NT11 should produce the next two symbols. Let me try mapping this out:\n\nS: NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 [NT11]\n\nNT11: NT41 NT49 \u2192 t77 t81\n\nSo the initial tokens should be t68, t77, t81. But the given string starts with t76, t32, etc., which doesn't align. That suggests that either the start is different or the string doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any other rule could start with t76 t32... Let me look for NT48 somewhere else. Looking at the grammar, NT48 appears in two places: once in NT49's rule and once in NT7's rule. Wait, no, NT49's rule is NT49 -> t81, so that's a terminal. Let me check other non-terminals.\n\nLooking for where the string starts with t76 t32... Let me see. The first two tokens are t76 and t32. Let's see if there's any production that starts with NT48 producing t76 and t32. But looking at the rules, NT48 -> t68. There's another NT33: NT33 -> t76 or t30.\n\nWait, no, the production rules for NT48 are: NT48 is only in the production for NT6. Let me check NT48. Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT48 as a left-hand side (LHS) of any production except in NT6's rule: NT6 -> NT52 NT49. So NT48 is a terminal, which means it's directly expanded.\n\nSo, the start symbol S is NT48 NT11, producing t68 and t11 (which is part of NT11).\n\nWait, perhaps the first token is t32, which would mean that NT11 produces t32 and something else. Let me check NT11's rules. NT11 -> NT41 NT49, so both are non-terminals. So the next two symbols should be the result of NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at NT41: NT41 -> t77, and NT49 -> t81. So the next two tokens should be t77 and t81. But the given string starts with t76, t32, etc., which doesn't match. So maybe the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the initial NT48 is actually something else. Let me check NT48 rules again. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT44 -> t66 (but I think earlier I misread. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again, I might have made a mistake earlier. For example, NT44 is defined as:\n\nNT44 -> NT29 NT1.\n\nBut looking more carefully, in the list provided earlier, I see:\n\nNT44 -> NT29 NT1.\n\nBut also, another production for NT44? Let me scan the entire list.\n\nLooking through the provided productions:\n\nNT44 -> NT29 NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some entries. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT44 -> NT29 NT1.\n\nYes, only that production. Other non-terminals:\n\n- NT33 can produce t76 or t30.\n- NT40 -> t28 t1.\n- NT47 -> t48.\n- NT7 -> t36.\n- NT27 -> t3.\n- NT14 -> t42.\n- NT43 -> t55.\n- NT35 -> t27.\n- NT11 appears in multiple places but in the given list, it's defined as NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nLooking at the string again: the first two tokens are t76 and t32. Let's see if any NT could produce t76 and t32.\n\nLooking for NT->A B where A and B are either terminals or non-terminals that produce t76 and t32.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT33 has two terminals: t76 and t30.\n- NT42 -> t55 and t25.\n- NT44 -> NT29 and t1 (but t1 is a terminal? Wait, looking back: NT44: Right-hand side is NT29 and t1, or is it? Looking back, the entry is:\n\nNT44 -> NT29 NT1.

{"custom_id":"request-738","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t31 t68 t27 t19 t36 t84 t32 t55 t26 t36 t5 t5 t59 t5 t36 t53 t83 t72 t47 t47 t47 t37 t30 t77 t42 t30 t68 t36 t55 t7 t49 t72 t59 t5 t73 t47 t76 t31 t25`. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, so every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. That means each non-terminal can generate two non-terminals or a terminal directly. The start symbol is S, which produces NT48 and NT11. So the initial string starts with NT48 NT11.\n\nI need to see if the given string can be derived from S through a series of these productions. Let me break down the string into components and see how it might fit.\n\nThe string starts with 't31 t68 t27 ...'. I need to see if these tokens correspond to terminals that can result from applying the grammar rules. Let me look at the productions for terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that many symbols are terminals, like t31, t68, etc., while others are non-terminals like NT48, NT31, etc. The non-terminals eventually must produce the terminals. So I need to trace how each token in the string could be derived from these rules.\n\nLet me list some key points from the grammar:\n\n- NT48 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT11 -> NT41 NT49\n- NT41 -> NT77\n- NT77 is a terminal, which in the string, I don't see t77. So maybe not a direct match, but maybe part of a derivation.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t31. Looking at the grammar, NT31 has productions:\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\nNT20 -> t26\nNT8 -> t69\nSo NT20 is t26 and NT8 is t69. So NT31 would produce t26 t69. But in the string, the first token is t31, not t26. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. 't31' is a terminal in the string, but looking at the grammar, I don't see 't31' as a terminal. Instead, 't31' is derived from NT31, which can split into NT20 and NT8. NT20 becomes t26, and NT8 becomes t69. So NT31 would produce t26 t69, which are terminals. But the string has a 't31', which is a terminal, so it must be derived directly. But looking at the grammar, it seems that 't31' is only a terminal if NT31 produces it directly. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, 't31' is actually a production from NT33: NT33 -> t73 or t31, but in the given grammar, 't31' is also a production of NT33. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NT33, there are two productions: NT33 -> 't73' and NT33 -> 't31'. So 't31' is a terminal that NT33 can produce. But wait, in the given string, the first token is 't31', so that suggests that the first part of the string comes from NT33.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol, S, it's NT48 NT11. So the first part would be NT48 generating something and NT11 generating something else. NT48 -> NT11 NT6, and NT11 -> NT41 NT49. NT41 is t77, and NT49 is t47. So the derivation for S would start off as t77 t47, but that doesn't align with the string starting with t31. Hmm, maybe the string doesn't start with S's immediate expansion.\n\nWait, no. The grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11, so the first expansion is definitely NT48 and NT11, which produce t77 and t47, respectively. But the string starts with t31, which is different. Therefore, perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with t31, whereas the start symbol S directly leads to t77 t47.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misapplying the parsing. Perhaps the entire string is being considered as a single sentence, not just the immediate expansion. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains elements that are part of the grammar derived through different expansions. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sentential form, and I need to see if it can be derived by applying the grammar rules step by step. The start symbol S is NT48 NT11, so the initial string would derive from that. So the first step would be t77 t47 (from NT48 and NT11), but the given string starts with t31.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the given string is not starting with S but with some non-terminals that can expand into the t31.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string starting from the beginning, seeing how each token can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt31 t68 t27 t19 t36 t84 t32 t55 t26 t36 t5 t5 t59 t5 t36 t53 t83 t72 t47 t47 t47 t37 t30 t77 t42 t30 t68 t36 t55 t7 t49 t72 t59 t5 t73 t47 t76 t31 t25\n\nLet me process each token to see if it's a terminal or non-terminal and where it might appear in the grammar.\n\nt31 is a terminal that is produced by NT33 (NT33 -> t31). So somewhere in the derivation, a NT33 must produce t31.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT33 also produces 't73', but that's not in the string.\n\nThen, looking at the initial S, it's NT48 and NT11. So I need to see if NT48 and NT11 can somehow eventually produce t31 somewhere in the string. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is a sentential form, and the t31 is not directly derived from S but from some nested expansion.\n\nBut if S starts the derivation with t77 and t47, then the string can't start with t31. So perhaps the given string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with t31, which would require a different starting point.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, so the first expansions must be from S, producing NT48 NT11, which then expand into t77 t47, etc. Therefore, the string starting with t31 would not be part of S's derivations unless there's a different way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not a correct sentence of the grammar because it starts with a different terminal than S produces.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me check: if there's a way to derive a string where an NT33 is used to generate the t31, but then how does that sit in the context of the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is part of a longer derivation where S first produces some parts, then within that, a part produces t31 and others, but S itself can't start with t31.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the first few tokens and see if they can be part of a derivation from S.\n\nThe first token is t31, which comes from NT33. But the start symbol S is NT48 NT11, so the first step is to derive t77 t47 from S, which are different from t31.

{"custom_id":"request-758","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember CNF has all productions with either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given as a series of productions. The start symbol is S, which produces NT48 NT11. So, the string we're testing must start with these two parts. The string provided starts with \"t59 t7 t84...\". Wait, the first two parts of the string are \"t59\" and \"t7\". Looking at the grammar, let's see where these appear.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT33 can produce \"t73\" or \"t30\". But nowhere does NT48 or NT11 directly produce t59 or t7. Wait, let me check NT48 and NT11. Oh wait, NT48 is part of the initial S, which produces NT48 NT11. Now, in the given string, after S, it's t59 t7. Hmm, so I think I need to see how NT48 and NT11 can break down into t59 and t7.\n\nWait, let me look back. The initial S produces NT48 NT11. So the string should generate from NT48 and NT11. Let's look at NT48. Scanning the grammar, NT48 -> 't68' is a production. Wait, but t68 is not in the string. The string starts with t59, which isn't t68. Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. The initial S is NT48 NT11, which according to the production, could produce t68 (since NT48 -> 't68'). But the string is \"t59 t7...\" which doesn't match. That suggests that maybe the initial S isn't directly producing t59 and t7. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread NT48. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, wait, looking deeper, I see NT48 has a production \"-> 't68'\". So if S is NT48 NT11, then S would produce \"t68 NT11\" or \"t48 NT11\" if that's another production. Wait, no, that depends on the exact rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to analyze step by step. Let's try to parse the string using the grammar. The string is: t59 t7 t84 t83 t37 t42 t27 t53 t68 t30 t25 t10 t32 t7 t28 t7 t69 t77 t55 t24 t65 t49 t26 t12 t42 t36 t32 t31 t66 t36 t47 t65 t47 t72 t12 t10 t68 t77 t19 t15.\n\nFirst, the initial S is NT48 NT11. So, the first two symbols of the string must be the results of NT48 and NT11. Let's see if either of these can produce t59 or t7.\n\nLooking at NT48's productions: I see NT48 -> 't68'. So NT48 produces t68. But the string starts with t59, which isn't t68. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, does NT48 produce something else? Wait, looking again: the production for NT48 is only '-> 't68''. So it must produce t68, not t59. Therefore, the first symbol being t59 is impossible. So that would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've missed any NT48 productions. Let me go through the grammar rules more carefully. The NT rules listed are all the non-terminals: NT33, NT58, etc., and I don't see NT48 having any other productions except NT48 -> 't68'. So, unless I'm miscounting, S produces NT48 and NT11, which produce 't68' and 't25' maybe? Or is S producing 't48'? Wait, no, S's production is nt48 nt11, which each are non-terminals except when they produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial structure. Let me double-check the grammar. S: S -> NT48 NT11. So S breaks down into two non-terminals, NT48 and NT11. Each of these non-terminals must produce a terminal symbol or another non-terminal. But if both NT48 and NT11 can only produce terminals, then S would produce a string of terminals. However, in our case, both NT48 and NT11 have productions only to terminals, as I can see from the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at NT48: only '-> t68'? Yes. And NT11: according to the grammar, NT11 -> 't31' or 't41' or something? Wait, let me check. Looking through the rules, I see NT11 -> 't31', but also another production? Let me see: looking at the grammar, indeed, under NT11, it says NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So NT11 can be a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals, which can then produce more.\n\nWait, so S -> NT48 NT11. So first, NT48 produces 't68' (since only production is 't68'). Then NT11 can either produce 't31' or 't41' or 't49'. Because in the grammar, I think there are other rules for NT11: NT11 -> 't31', NT11 -> 't41', or NT11 -> 't49'. Wait, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar list, under NT11, it's written as: NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So actually, NT11 is a non-terminal that can't produce a terminal directly and instead splits into NT41 and NT49. So NT41 is 't77', and NT49 can produce t6, t7, etc., but wait, looking at the grammar again, under NT49, there's a production: -> 't49' ?\n\nNo, I'm maybe mixing things up. Let me re-examine. Oh, perhaps I should make a tree or a parse structure. Alternatively, let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t59, t7, t84, etc. So, perhaps the first step is to find a way to produce t59. Looking at the grammar, I'm scanning each non-terminal to see if they can produce t59. For example, NT55 -> t72 and other things, but nothing directly to t59. Wait, no, looking through, none of the non-terminals directly produce t59, except maybe NT59? Wait, NT59's only production is NT18 and NT1, because looking at the grammar, for NT59: NT59 -> NT18 NT1. So no, that doesn't help.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's check NT59: it's under NT59 as \"NT59 -> NT18 NT1\". Wait, that would break down into NT18 and NT1. Then NT18's production is '-> 't69'', and NT1's production is '-> 't25''? Or wait, I need to check the grammar's rules again.\n\nLooking back: Under NT59, it's \"NT59 -> NT18 NT1\".\n\nUnder NT18: -> 't69'.\n\nUnder NT1: -> 't25'.\n\nSo NT59 produces t69 and t25. But the string starts with t59, so unless there's a way to produce t59 from some other non-terminal, this string can't be generated.\n\nWait, so where does t59 come from? Checking the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t59. Let me make sure: under NT33, there's a production '-> 't73'' and '-> 't30''.\n\nWait, NT33 -> 't73' or 't30'. Could the string include parts produced by NT33?\n\nThe string starts with t59, which would need to come from some NT that can produce t59.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S can produce a string that's longer. Let me try to see the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express the idea:\n\nThe initial S is NT48 NT11, each of which can be expanded.

{"custom_id":"request-781","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. It's given in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and exactly one non-terminal or terminal on the right. Looking through the rules, I see that the starting symbol is S, and the productions are all either two non-terminals or one non-terminal leading to terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. Let me list out the string: t26 t77 t72 t36 t72 t32 t73 t81 t36 t32 t69 t15 t73 t15 t15 t49 t5 t3 t81 t28 t58 t3 t7 t27 t58 t73 t59 t27 t48 t27 t42 t47 t58 t66 t7 t25 t84 t7 t68 t59 t22.\n\nSo, I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since it's a CFG, I can approach this using the CYK algorithm or parse it step by step by finding appropriate productions. But given the size, maybe a step-by-step approach would be manageable.\n\nLet me start by looking at the possible starting point. The top-level production is S -> NT48 NT11. So the string should start with a production that leads to NT48 and NT11. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t26. So, I need to see if t26 can come from NT48 or NT11. Looking at the productions for NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48, from the grammar: NT48 -> NT49 NT6. So, t48 would be an intermediate step. But in the string, I don't see t48 or t6. Alternatively, does any production directly result in t26? Looking at the productions for NT41: NT41 -> t77 t... Wait, wait. Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT33 can produce 't73' or 't30'. Similarly, NT20 can produce 't26'. Wait, so NT20 -> 't26' (looking back at the grammar). Okay, so NT20 is a non-terminal that produces 't26'. \n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is t26, which must come from NT20. So how does S produce t26? Let's see. S -> NT48 NT11. Wait, but how do we get t26 from NT48 and NT11? Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the structure of the string. The string has 44 symbols. That's a lot, but each production in CNF either gives two symbols or a terminal. So the parse tree would have a binary structure.\n\nMaybe I should approach this by trying to find where the symbols could come from in the grammar. Let me look for where each symbol in the string can be derived.\n\nStarting with t26: From grammar, NT20 -> t26. So t26 must come from NT20. Then, NT20's production is... Wait, I don't see a production for NT20 that starts with NT directly, because in the grammar, I only see NT20 -> 't26' or NT20 -> 't53'. Wait, no, looking again: Yes, I see NT20 has two productions: -> 't26' and -> 't53'. So t26 comes from NT20.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol t26 must be the result of NT20. So now, I need to see how S and other non-terminals might lead to this.\n\nBut wait, S -> NT48 NT11. How does that lead to t26? Let's see: S is replaced by NT48 and NT11. So, the string must be built by combining the results of NT48 and NT11.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t26, which comes from NT20. So unless NT48 or NT11 produce something that includes NT20 somewhere, this might not fit. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string as a leftmost derivation. Let me try to reconstruct the parse tree from the beginning.\n\nS starts as NT48 NT11. So, the string is the combination of NT48's expansion and NT11's expansion. So, the first part of the string comes from NT48, and the second part comes from NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48's production, it's NT49 NT6. So, the first symbol in the string should come from NT49 or NT6? Wait, NT48 -> NT49 NT6. So, the first part (up to some point) must come from NT49 and NT6.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t26. From NT6, we have NT6 -> 't4' and NT6 -> 't49'. So NT6 can produce 't4' or 't49'.\n\nAlternatively, NT20 is another non-terminal that produces 't26' and 't53'. Wait, perhaps the string starts with NT20. But according to the grammar, S produces NT48 and NT11. So, unless NT48 or NT11 can produce NT20, which I don't think is possible. Because looking at the rules, NT49, NT48, etc., don't seem to go anywhere except possibly to terminals.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the NT20 productions: NT20 -> t26 or t53. So, t26 is a direct terminal. So in S's expansion, how does it generate t26?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that S is NT48 NT11, and each of those produces a sequence of terminals. So, S is the root, and the entire string must be generated by NT48 and NT11. Let's see.\n\nSo, NT48 -> NT49 NT6. So NT48's expansion is whatever NT49 followed by whatever NT6 produces.\n\nSimilarly, NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So NT11's expansion is whatever NT41 produces followed by whatever NT49 produces.\n\nSo, the string must be the concatenation of NT49's result and NT6's result, followed by the concatenation of NT41's result and NT49's result.\n\nWait, so let's split the string into parts. The first part is up to the end of NT48's expansion, and the second part is NT11's expansion.\n\nSo, S is NT48 NT11.\n\nThus, the string is (result of NT48) + (result of NT11).\n\nNow, let's see what NT48 produces: NT49 followed by NT6.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is the result of NT49 NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT11 is NT41 NT49, so the second part is the result of NT41 followed by NT49.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t26 t77 t72 t36 t72 t32 t73 t81 t36 t32 t69 t15 t73 t15 t15 t49 t5 t3 t81 t28 t58 t3 t7 t27 t58 t73 t59 t27 t48 t27 t42 t47 t58 t66 t7 t25 t84 t7 t68 t59 t22.\n\nI can try to split this into two parts, where the first part is the result of NT49 NT6, and the second part is the result of NT41 NT49.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for how t26 comes into play. Since t26 comes from NT20, which is a non-terminal, perhaps t26 is part of either the first or second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this too much. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother method is to represent the entire process as a table and use the CYK algorithm. But given the time constraints, maybe a top-down approach works better.\n\nSo, starting with S, and trying to match the string.\n\nS: NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, the string must be the concatenation of the first expansion of NT48 and the second expansion of NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48: NT49 NT6. So the first part of the string is the expansion of NT49 followed by the expansion of NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT11 is NT41 NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-777","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can also produce a terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, all the productions seem to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and others like NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13. So yes, each production has two non-terminals, which fits CNF.\n\nNow, the given string is: t3 t47 t42 t3 t25 t24 t24 t59 t26 t77 t24 t48 t76 t73 t76 t15 t68 t59 t68 t5 t73 t32 t76 t24 t53 t4 t58 t84 t19 t26 t27 t36 t55 t81 t49 t53 t25 t81 t49 t15 t15.\n\nWow, that's a long string. I think each 't' followed by a number represents a terminal symbol, and the non-terminals are in uppercase. So, to figure out if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if it can be derived starting from S, expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the method of parsing with a stack or use the fact that it can be represented as a parse tree where each node has exactly two children. Each production rule is two non-terminals, so each node in the parse tree splits into two children. \n\nI think the approach here is to try to construct a parse tree for the given string using the grammar. Alternatively, maybe use a recursive descent parser or the Cocke-Younger- kasilingamp (CYK) algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, it's going to be a bit tedious.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the top-level production is NT48 and NT11. So the string should be generated as t76 (from NT48) and t31 (from NT11), right? Wait, no, because NT48 is in the grammar, but looking at the right-hand side, NT48's production isn't given. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me double-check the grammar rules.\n\nWait, look at the grammar: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. But looking at the non-terminals, I don't see a production for NT48 or NT11 except where they appear as, for example, NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nThe start symbol S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Now, looking through the production rules for non-terminals, I don't see NT48 or NT11 having any definitions. Hmm, that could be a problem. Maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT48 is actually used in S's production, but I don't see any line like NT48 \u2192 something. Similarly, NT11 appears in S \u2192 NT48 NT11 and in another production like NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT6. So, perhaps I need to find the top-down expansion starting from S.\n\nWait, but without knowing how NT48 and NT11 are produced, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the string ends up being built from the bottom up. Maybe I need to see if the given string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe the string is a sequence of terminals that can be generated by the grammar starting from S. Since it's a long string, I should check if the grammar can produce this sequence step by step.\n\nAnother approach: each production in the grammar is two non-terminals, so each step of expansion will produce two terminals or non-terminals. The string starts with t3, then t47, t42, etc. So the string itself is a sequence of terminals, so it's like a linear sequence. Parsing such a string using a two-symbol stack (since each production has exactly two symbols on the right) would be similar to using the Earley parser or similar.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can try breaking the string into chunks that match the possible productions.\n\nWait, let's think about the root production: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the entire string must be the result of expanding these two non-terminals. So the first production would be NT48... something and NT11... something, concatenated together. But without knowing how NT48 and NT11 are defined, it's tricky.\n\nWait, looking again, I might have misread the grammar. Let me check for NT48: is there a production for it? From the given list, I don't see any rule for NT48. Hmm, perhaps that means that NT48 is a terminal itself, but in the grammar, NT48 is in the production of S, so maybe NT48 doesn't have a production and is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps NT11 has a production: I see NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, maybe the entire string is a series of terminals, and the non-terminals in the grammar are used to split the string into parts. So, the idea is to see if the string can be divided into chunks that match the productions starting from S.\n\nLet's look at the start: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string should have t48 followed by t11 if both are terminals. But in the given string, the first token is t3, which doesn't match t48 or t11, so perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals that can produce sequences of terminals, and perhaps the given string is built from them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except the start symbol can go to a terminal, but in the given grammar, all non-terminals are producing two non-terminals except maybe the leaves (terminals). So, the string is a series of terminals, each of which is either a known terminal or generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see several lines where a non-terminal is equal to a terminal:\n- NT33 \u2192 't73'\n- NT33 \u2192 't30'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT30 \u2192 't84'\n- NT25 \u2192 't58'\n- NT25 \u2192 't22'\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT37 \u2192 't32'\n- NT47 \u2192 't48'\n- NT44 \u2192 't66'\n- NT44 \u2192 't73'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT7 \u2192 't53'\n- NT27 \u2192 't8'\n- NT77 \u2192 't77' (is this a terminal? Wait, let me check: yes, 't77' is a terminal.\n- NT65 is a production, but wait, looking at the grammar, NT20 \u2192 't26', NT52 \u2192 't7', etc.\n\nSo, several non-terminals produce single terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 't4', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT52 \u2192 't7', 't58', 't73', etc.\n\nSo, the string consists of a list of terminals, each of which is either a known terminal or generated by the grammar. But in this case, the given string is a sequence of terminals, none of which are non-terminals like S, NT48, etc.\n\nTherefore, each symbol in the given string must be a terminal or must be generated by expanding a non-terminal into terminals.\n\nSo, the approach is to see if we can split the string into a sequence of expansions starting from S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and then expand each of these non-terminals recursively into their respective sub-expressions.\n\nBut since S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT48 and NT11.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the entire string can be split into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT48, and the second part is the expansion of NT11.\n\nBut looking at the given string, the length is 49 terminals, which is quite long.

{"custom_id":"request-797","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. The string given is: `t31 t5 t47 t77 t28 t12 t81 t36 t27 t84 t28 t77 t4 t25 t65 t55 t58 t47 t77 t30 t10 t30 t37 t69 t55 t5 t32 t26 t42 t37 t77 t5 t12 t5 t49 t53 t59 t47 t28 t36 t10 t5`. I notice it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, so each token is a terminal. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must start with the non-terminals NT48 and NT11. Let's check the beginning of the string: the first token is t31. Wait, in the grammar, NT31 is a non-terminal, but in the string, it's written as t31. Similarly, all tokens that are non-terminals in the grammar come after a specific number of digits. For example, NT48 in the grammar would produce a terminal string, but in the string, the actual terminal is t48. Wait a second, looking at the grammar, for example, NT48 \u2192 t48 (since in the grammar there is a production NT48 -> 't68'? Wait, let me check the grammar properly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT33 has productions to 't73' and 't73' again, which might be correct. But I need to parse the string correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, for example, NT48: There's a production NT48 -> 't68'. So in the string, t68 would be represented as a terminal. But in the string given, we have t31, t5, etc. Let's make sure that each token in the string corresponds correctly to the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, the token 't77' appears a few times in the string. Looking at the grammar, I see NT77: Is there a production for NT77? Hmm, I don't see NT77 directly in the provided grammar. Wait, the grammar entries are:\n\nLooking for NT77: There's NT77 in the list of non-terminals, but I don't see a production for it. Wait, maybe it's a typo, but in any case, let's map each token to the grammar.\n\nEach token in the string is either a 't' followed by two digits, like t31, t5, etc. These correspond to the terminals generated by the non-terminals. For example, NT31 in the grammar \u2192 t31? Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\n\nWait, that's a production rule, not a terminal. So NT31 can produce another non-terminal. So to get a terminal, we need to trace the expansion down.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complex. Let me think: each occurrence of a terminal in the string must match a production in the grammar. So, for example, t31 must come from a production of NT31, but in the grammar, NT31 is defined as NT20 NT8, which are non-terminals. So how do we get t31 from NT31?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map each terminal in the string to a non-terminal. Let's take the first token, t31. In the grammar, the non-terminal NT31 produces NT20 NT8. So, to get t31, we must have a production that eventually produces t31. Let's look at the grammar for NT31:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8.\n\nLooking at NT20: The grammar says NT20 \u2192 't26' or NT9. So if NT20 is a terminal 't26', or it can produce NT9. NT9 produces 't25'. So, NT20 can produce t26, but in the string, the first token is t31, so that might not be a direct match. Hmm, this might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token in the string corresponds directly to a non-terminal. Wait, the grammar's non-terminals produce terminals. So for example, NT31 in the grammar is defined as NT20 NT8, but those NT20 and NT8 must lead to terminals for us to have t31. Alternatively, the string's tokens are the results of the grammar's non-terminals being expanded as terminals. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: in the context-free grammar, each symbol (terminal or non-terminal) in the production represents a production rule. So, for example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11: S is a non-terminal, and the production is two non-terminals, NT48 and NT11. Each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, the string given is a series of terminals, which must be the result of expanding the grammar's rules. Therefore, the string should be the result of replacing S with a sequence of terminals via the production rules.\n\nLet me try to parse the string. Since S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the string must start with NT48 and NT11. Looking at the string, the first token is t31. So, let's check if NT48 produces t31. In the grammar, does NT48 produce t31? Looking at the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT48 to t31. Instead, looking at the rules, for example, NT48 \u2192 t68, as per the grammar, but the string starts with t31, so that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT.\n\nWait, perhaps the first NT48 in the expansion corresponds to a different terminal. Wait, no. Let me look more carefully. The first two tokens in the string are t31 and t5. Hmm, perhaps the expansion would be S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would produce t31 t5 ... but that would require NT48 to produce t31 and NT11 to produce t5. So does NT48 have a production that results in t31? Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT48: I don't see a production for NT48 \u2192 t31. The closest I see is NT33 \u2192 t73 or t73 again, and NT14 \u2192 t42. But for NT48, the only production is NT48 \u2192 t68. So that would mean the string's first token, t31, does not match any production from NT48, which is supposed to produce t68. Hmm, that suggests that the string might not be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I misassigned the non-terminals. Let me double-check. The production S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, for the string to start with t31, that would require NT48 \u2192 t31, but in the grammar, NT48 only produces t68. So the first token t31 doesn't match. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe the expansion is longer, like NT48 expanding into more non-terminals that eventually produce t31. Let's see: NT48 in the grammar is a terminal? No, because in the grammar, NT48 is a non-terminal only in the production, but in the actual terminals, NT48 is expanded into a terminal string. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I notice some of them are terminals. For example, NT33 \u2192 't73' or 't73' again. So in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. So, for example, NT48 \u2192 t68. Similarly, NT25 \u2192 t58, etc. So, if NT48 is a non-terminal, then when we expand it, it would produce the terminal t68. So, in the string, if the first token is t31, it would require NT48 to produce t31, but in reality, NT48 produces t68. Therefore, the string starts with t31, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, the first token is t31, but the grammar's NT48 only gives t68. Therefore, the string cannot start with NT48's expansion because it produces t68, not t31. So this suggests that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the rules. Maybe the string is a sequence of expansions that produce t31"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-799","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful. I remember that each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.

So that's fine.\n\nNext, t3. Again, I check if NT3 is a non-terminal that can produce t3. Looking through the productions, under NT31 there's a rule NT31 -> NT20 NT8.

NT42 -> NT48 NT7\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nWait, the user provided all the rules, but it's a bit hard to parse. I think it's necessary to map each NT and its immediate productions correctly.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. An alternative approach is to note that the grammar is given, and the string is the result of leftmost derivation. Maybe I should attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree is binary, each step expanding a single non-terminal into two symbols. So the entire string must be generated by leftmost expansions starting from S.\n\nThe string starts with t22. So, let's see if t22 can be the first symbol. The first symbol is t22, which must come from a production. Looking at the productions, some NT might derive to t22 followed by something.

{"custom_id":"request-811","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of t-strings, which I assume are terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar to understand the production rules. Looking at the grammar, it's presented with S, NT1, NT2, etc., all in binary form, meaning each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals except when the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t32 t4 t49 t83 t19 t49 t72 t25 t12 t65 t81 t7 t48 t49 t27 t59 t30 t4 t53 t5 t12 t68 t4 t68 t15 t65 t26 t31 t53 t59 t24 t3 t69 t68 t26 t30 t42 t83 t22 t81 t10 t48 t27.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is a t followed by a number, except for 't33' and 't35' which have two numbers. Wait, no, looking again: some of these are like 't33' and 't35', but in the given string, I see 't33' in the grammar rules, so maybe that's a typo? Or maybe they are multi-symbol terminals. But in the string provided, the user wrote the string correctly, so I need to see if each 't...' is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the terminals are specific t's with numbers, like 't76', 't30', 't65', etc., so for example, 't32' is a terminal because I see a production rule for NT32 -> t37, etc. Wait, no, looking through the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar rules are given with some rules ending with a number, like NT33 -> 't73', so I think each rule that has a -> followed by a number is a terminal. So the terminals are the ones directly written as 't...' with a number, like 't76', 't30', 't12', etc.\n\nIn the given string, for example, 't32' is not a direct terminal because looking at the production rules, I don't see NT32 -> 't32'; instead, production rules for NT32 such as NT32 -> NT39 NT57, which in turn are non-terminals until they derive to terminals. Wait, but in the given grammar, the production rules for each non-terminal have specific left sides, but each right side is another non-terminal or a specific t.\n\nWait, no, the grammar only has rules like S -> NT48 NT11, then NT44 -> NT42 NT13, etc. So all these NT1, NT2,\u2026 are non-terminals, each expanding to two non-terminals. The terminals are specific t's with numbers, like 't76', 't30', 't12', etc. So the string is a sequence of these t's. \n\nSo when trying to parse the given string, which is a rightmost derivation, we need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to top-down parse the string, since the grammar is in CNF. In CNF, every production is A -> a BC, where a is a single terminal. Wait, or is it each production is A -> BC where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals, but in CNF, each production is A -> BC where both B and C are non-terminals. No, wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the given grammar, all the productions are of the form A-> B C, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So I don't see any production that ends with a single terminal. For example, in the grammar:\n\nNT33-> 't73' \n\nWait, yes, that's a production where the right-hand side is a single terminal. So in the grammar, some non-terminals (like NT33) have productions that produce a single terminal, like 't73', whereas others have two non-terminals, like NT32-> NT39 NT57.\n\nBut this is a bit confusing. Wait, the user wrote the grammar rules as something like S -> NT48 NT11 NT44 -> NT42 NT13, etc. But wait, in standard CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So perhaps the user made a typo and meant that each rule is written as A -> B C, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A-> a. So for example, NT33 is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal t73, while others are two non-terminals.\n\nSo the string to parse is composed of terminals (those t's), and the entire string must be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nTo parse the string, perhaps we can use the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for CNF grammars.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the possible derivations step by step, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, let me see the steps.\n\nFirst, the string is: t32 t4 t49 t83 t19 t49 t72 t25 t12 t65 t81 t7 t48 t49 t27 t59 t30 t4 t53 t5 t12 t68 t4 t68 t15 t65 t26 t31 t53 t59 t24 t3 t69 t68 t26 t30 t42 t83 t22 t81 t10 t48 t27.\n\nFirst, the entire string has about 46 tokens. Let's see how many steps that would take. Each step in the leftmost derivation would start with the start symbol S, which produces two non-terminals, so each step doubles the number of symbols. Alternatively, since it's a rightmost derivation, each step is appending to the right.\n\nWait, wait. The rightmost derivation would expand the rightmost non-terminal at each step. So we can try to parse the string from right to left, but using the CYK method, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see for the given string if the terminals can be reached by the production rules.\n\nEach production in the grammar is a non-terminal A that can produce a single terminal or two non-terminals. So for the string, it's a sequence of t's, and each t must be the terminal of some production. \n\nSo perhaps I can build the parse table using CYK.\n\nLet me list all the terminals from the production rules first. The terminals are:\n\nFrom the grammar, each rule that is of the form NT...-> t.... So:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminals (t's) are:\n\nt37, t33, t76, t30, t65, t81, t12, t37, t35, t27, t49, t28, t53, t5, t12, t26, t22, t10, t48, t27, t72, t58, t42, etc.\n\nWait, let me compile a list:\n\nFrom NT33: t73, t73\nFrom NT35: t27\nFrom NT33 again: t30\nFrom NT30: t84\nFrom NT19: t28\nFrom NT28: t59\nFrom NT14: t42\nFrom NT43: t55\nFrom NT35: t27\nFrom NT48: t68\nFrom NT49: t47\nFrom NT52: t7, t58, t7, t53, t37, t35, t49, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to make a list of all possible t's as terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps some t's are terminals, others are not. So for example, looking at the grammar, each production for a non-terminal results in either a single t or two non-terminals. So any t in the string that is not a left-hand side of any production is a terminal.\n\nBut to determine which t's are terminals, we can look at all the production rules. A t is a terminal if it is the right-hand side of some production. So, for each t in the string, we need to check if it's present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT33 -> t73\nNT35 -> t27, t3\nNT33 again, perhaps others?\n\nWait, let's tabulate all"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-812","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar, which is in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar provided seems to follow this structure.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the initial production rule: S -> NT48 NT11. So the string starts with 't48' and 't73', but wait, in the grammar, NT11 splits into NT49 and NT6, from S. Hold on, let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t48 t73 t42 t10 t4 t65 t84 t4 t7 t10 t84 t42 t24 t24 t27 t47 t53 t47 t25 t77 t4 t66 t69 t72 t36 t47 t47 t73 t47 t73 t24 t10 t49 t4 t48 t12 t53 t68 t59 t49 t77 t84 t31`.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't48'\u2014does any non-terminal produce 't48'? Looking at the rules, I see NT48 -> NT49 NT6. So NT48 would be replaced by NT49 (which is a list) and NT6 (another list). NT49 is 't81', which doesn't match 't48'. Wait, wait, actually, in the grammar rules, there's a section where some NTs produce terminals, like NT33 -> 't73', etc. So maybe I need to track through the productions step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which splits into NT48 and NT11. NT48 is 't49' and 't6' (from the rule NT48 -> NT49 NT6). But wait, in the provided grammar, NT49 is 't47' (from the rule NT49 -> NT11 NT6), and NT6 is 't4' (from NT6 -> 't4'). So combining these, NT48 becomes 't49' 't6', which is 't47 t4'. \n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first part is 't48 t73'. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Because S should produce NT48 and NT11, so the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT48. But NT48 -> NT49 NT6, which is 't47' 't4'. However, the string starts with 't48 t73'. That suggests that the initial split may not produce 't48' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, looking closer, NT48 is defined as 't49' 't6' because in the grammar, NT48 -> 't49' 't6'. So when S splits into NT48 and NT11, the production would start with 't49' 't6' followed by NT11's expansion. But the string starts with 't48', which isn't 't49' or 't6'. So that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NTs. Let me verify: NT48 is defined as NT49 NT6, which are themselves terminals or other non-terminals. Wait, looking back, the grammar:\nNT48 -> 't49' 't6' \u2014 so when S is expanded, the first part is t49 t6, and then the second part is NT11, which is NT49 and NT6. Wait, no\u2014the initial S splits into NT48 and NT11, each of which is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo. Let's see: in the given grammar, NT48 is one of the rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 is -> 't49' 't6'? Or is it a splitting into NT48? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking for NT48: yes, it's in there.\n\nWait, the grammar actually shows:\nNT48 -> 't49' 't6' \u2014 because the line says NT48 -> 't49' 't6'.\n\nWait no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT48 -> 't49' 't6' \u2014 yes, line 15: `NT48 -> 't49' 't6'` \u2014 so when S produces NT48 NT11, the string starts with the expansion of NT48 followed by NT11.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbols are 't48 t73'. So that doesn't match because NT48 starts with 't49' not 't48'. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait the starting symbol is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the expansion starts with the expansion of NT48, which is 't49' 't6', and then the expansion of NT11. So the string should start with t49 t6 followed by the expansion of NT11.\n\nBut the string starts with t48 t73, which doesn't match. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT48 is referring to NT48 as a non-terminal, which then can be expanded into 't49' and 't6'. So perhaps the string starts with t48, but that's a terminal. But t48 isn't present as a terminal in any of the NT rules\u2014let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT33, NT35, etc., have terminals like 't73', 't45', etc. Let me see if any NTs have 't48'.\n\nLooking at the rules, is there a NT that produces 't48'? I don't see any. Only 't76', 't65', etc. So NT48 must be a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would mean the string starts with NT48 and NT11. If NT48 is a non-terminal, it must be expanded. So the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT48. But the string starts with 't48', which is a terminal. Therefore, this must mean that the NT48 cannot start with 't48', meaning that S cannot generate a string starting with 't48'.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT48 produces 't49' and 't6'. So when we expand S, the first part becomes 't49 t6', followed by the expansion of NT11.\n\nBut the string given starts with 't48 t73', which doesn't match 't49 t6'. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the initial production S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so any string generated by S must start with the expansion of NT48 followed by NT11's expansion.\n\nIf NT48 \u2192 't49' 't6', then the first two symbols should be 't49' 't6'. But the string starts with 't48' followed by 't73', which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the grammar. Let me go through each rule again to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking for where 't48' appears in the rules: I don't see any NT that produces 't48' except possibly if a rule combines NTs in a way that results in 't48'. Wait, let's check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT48 -> 't49' 't6' \u2014 so that's two terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string given isn't starting correctly. Maybe the splitting occurred differently.\n\nWait, another approach: the string seems to start with 't48 t73'. Let me see if any NT can produce 't48' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only NT48 rule is 't49 t6', which doesn't give 't48'; there's no NT that has 't48' as a terminal in the first position. So 't48' cannot be the starting symbol generated by the grammar.

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how each non-terminal expands. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. That means S must be the start symbol, and it directly expands into two parts: NT48 and NT11. Each of these is another non-terminal, so I need to see how they can be broken down further.\n\nNT48 expands into NT49 NT6. NT49 is another non-terminal. Let's track that: NT49 can go to NT11 NT6. NT11 is another non-terminal, which goes to NT41 NT49. Hmm, that's recursive. So NT41 is a non-terminal that might go to other parts, like 't77'. But I'll need to check the production rules for each.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 is NT52 NT49. NT52 expands to 't7'. So each time NT52 is used, it contributes 't7' to the string. NT49, as mentioned earlier, can go into NT11 NT6, which creates a loop.\n\nLooking at the string, I see a lot of 't's followed by numbers. Each non-terminal is either splitting into other non-terminals or is being resolved into a terminal. To see if the string is generated, I need to see if it can be split into the expansion of S, using the productions of the grammar, possibly applying them repeatedly until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, trying to find patterns that match the productions.\n\nThe string is: `t28 t31 t49 t77 t24 t48 t12 t72 t49 t59 t5 t3 t65 t55 t10 t76 t25 t81 t84 t26 t30 t19 t48 t49 t65 t65 t59 t37 t47 t77 t12 t28 t30 t37 t68 t47 t69 t77 t36 t19 t10 t59 t5 t47`.\n\nStarting from the beginning, let's see if the first few tokens can be produced by any of the initial productions.\n\nThe first token is t28. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce t28. For example, NT12 goes to NT37 NT32, and NT37 can produce 't15' or t32. Wait, I need to check the productions more carefully.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals that produce terminal strings:\n\n- NT26: t53\n- NT24: t24\n- NT28: t59\n- NT30: t84, t22, t10\n- NT31: t8, t35\n- NT33: t73, t76\n- NT35: t3, t27\n- NT37: t13, t34\n- NT39: t40, t11\n- NT40: t68, t59, t65\n- NT41: t77\n- NT42: t55\n- NT43: t15\n- NT47: t48, t47\n- NT49: t16, t7\n- NT52: t7, t55, t25\n- NT55: t83, t82, t72\n- NT59: t24, t58, t12, t53, t10, t59\n- NT6: t4\n- NT7: t36, t28\n- NT8: t69\n- NT9: t25\n\nWait, actually, some are not directly terminals. For example, NT7 can produce 't28' and 't36'. So, in the string, we have 't28' at the beginning. That can be produced by NT7 since NT7 \u2192 't28' or 't36'. So perhaps one of the non-terminals in the expansion is NT7, which is generating 't28'.\n\nBut let's see: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So S expands into two parts. So the entire string should be a combination of the two expansions of NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, does it make sense to split it into two parts after some point? Let's see: the string has 41 tokens. That's an odd number, which is problematic because S produces two parts, which in Chomsky Normal Form, each part is a sequence of productions. So for the entire string to be generated, it must be that each part of S's expansion (NT48 and NT11) produces the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nSo perhaps the string is split into two main sections by the end of NT48's expansion and NT11's expansion.\n\nLet me try to identify where the splitting occurs. Maybe the first part ends at a certain point, and the second part starts from there.\n\nLooking at the beginning: the first token is t28. From the list above, t28 can be produced by NT7 or NT48. Wait, checking the productions, NT28 is not in the list. Hmm, perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, no, the productions are given, and in the productions list, I see NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43. So NT7 is not directly producing t28, but perhaps another non-terminal leading up to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. NT7 has a production that splits into NT12 and NT43. NT12 \u2192 NT37 NT32, and NT43 \u2192 t15. So perhaps if a non-terminal resolves to NT7, which then goes to NT12 and NT43, which then produce t37, t32, t15. But in the string, I see t37, t32, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for a way to split the string into parts that correspond to NT48 and NT11's expansions.\n\nLet me consider that S starts with NT48 NT11. So the string must start with NT48 expanding into some terms, followed by NT11 expanding. Let me see how NT48 and NT11 expand.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So NT48 expands into NT49 and NT6. Each of these can further expand. Let's see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So NT49 expands into NT11 and NT6.\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So NT11 expands into NT41 and NT49.\n\nSo putting it together, starting from NT48:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6 \u2192 (NT11 NT6) NT6 \u2192 NT41 NT49 NT6 \u2192 NT41 (NT11 NT6) NT6 \u2192 NT41 NT41 NT49 NT6 \u2192 NT41 NT41 (NT11 NT6) NT6 \u2192 and so on.\n\nThis could potentially lead to a very long chain of NT41's and so on. But in the string, I see several t's that might correspond to these terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT11 eventually leads to more NT11's, which go into NT41 and NT49, creating a loop.\n\nThis seems too complex. Maybe I should try to parse the string starting from the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write down the steps of expansion. Let me try to see if any part of the string can correspond to a known production.\n\nLooking at the string again: t28 t31 t49 t77 t24 t48... \n\nI see t28, which could potentially be produced by NT7 (since NT7 \u2192 't28'). Let's think, if one of the non-terminals in the expansion is NT7, which produces t28, followed by t31, which could be produced by NT31.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8. NT20 can produce 't26' or 't53'; NT8 can produce 't69'.\n\nBut in the string after t28, we have t31. If t31 is NT20 NT8, then perhaps t31 splits into t26 and t69, but in the string after t31, we have t49, which is longer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part of the string is generated by NT48.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to find a substring that corresponds to any production in the grammar.\n\nLooking for a longer match. Starting at the beginning: t28 t31 t49 t77.\n\nLet me see if this can be produced by a single non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-828","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the structure of the grammar. Context-free grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, many of the rules are of the form NT followed by two other NTs. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, each step expands a non-terminal into two parts. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t49, t59, etc., which are the end symbols.\n\nMy string to evaluate is: `t49 t59 t4 t32 t5 t24 t55 t37 t81 t53 t47 t7 t28 t32 t25 t4 t30 t65 t42 t32 t25 t19 t7 t76 t12 t66 t53 t10 t5 t55 t26 t77 t55 t3 t68 t55 t10 t42 t25 t19 t36 t32 t49 t83`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t49 and ends with t83. The first thing I should check is if the entire string can be generated by the grammar, which would mean that the overall structure should follow the production rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT48 NT11. So, the first step would be S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Now, each of these NTs will need to be expanded until we reach terminals. However, in the string, the first token is t49, which is a terminal. Hmm, but NT48 is supposed to produce t49, right? Looking back at the grammar, yes, there's a rule NT48 \u2192 t68. Wait, no, let me check. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, looking for NT48, I see that it's not directly producing any terminals. Instead, NT48 \u2192 t68. So, wait, that can't be right because in the string, the first token is t49. That seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reread the grammar. Wait, looking at NT48's rule: NT48 \u2192 t68. So NT48 produces t68, right? But the string starts with t49, which would require that either NT48 or something else is producing t49. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look for where NT49 is. Wait, in the list of rules, I see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, and also NT49 \u2192 t47. Oh, right, there's a terminal t47 and a production rule for it. So NT49 has two options: it can be split into NT11 and NT6, or it can produce t47. So perhaps the first symbol in the string, t49, implies that somewhere, NT49 is being produced as a terminal, but wait, there's no t49 in the rules. Wait, looking again, I don't see any rule for NT49 that directly produces t49 as a terminal. Instead, NT49 \u2192 t47. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with t49. That suggests that maybe the string isn't properly formed because there's no rule that allows NT49 to produce t49, which would explain why the string starts with t49. Wait, no, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, am I misreading the grammar? Let me check each rule again. Looking through the grammar, there's a rule for NT49: NT49 \u2192 t47, but no rule where NT49 \u2192 t49. So that would mean that the first symbol in the string, t49, can't come from NT49 because it's not defined. Therefore, that would immediately make the string invalid because there's no way for the grammar to produce a t49 token. So the answer must be no, right?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the NTs. Are any of them producing t49? I go through the list, and looking for any NT49 rules... I see NT49 \u2192 t47, and in the list, are there any other entries with NT49? No. There's also NT33 \u2192 t73, and NT49 \u2192 t47. So yes, there is no production rule that allows NT49 to produce t49. Hence, the string starting with t49 is impossible because there's no way for NT49 to expand into t49.\n\nWait, but how does that connect to the entire string? Well, the entire string is a sequence of t tokens. So if the first token is t49, but the grammar doesn't have a rule that can produce t49, then the string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Could the string have a token 't49' somewhere inside? Let me check. Scanning through the string, I don't see 't49' anywhere except possibly at the beginning. No, looking again, it's at the start: `t49 ...`. So there's no 't49' in the string; it's the first token.\n\nTherefore, since the grammar doesn't allow any non-terminal to produce 't49', the string cannot be generated by the grammar.

Since the string starts with 't53', I need to see if the first part of the string can come from the productions of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT53 is a terminal, as it appears as a token in the input. Similarly, NT30, NT27, etc., are terminals. So the string consists of a sequence of terminal and non-terminal (though all terminals here) symbols.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\n1. S starts with NT48 and NT11. So, the first symbols come from NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48, according to the grammar, it can be NT6. But wait, checking the grammar, I see:\n\nNT48: Does it exist? Wait, no. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT48 as a non-terminal. Wait, checking the list:\n\nWait, I see NT48 in the productions: yes, the rule S->NT48 NT11 is listed. But do I see any other NT48? Looking through, I see NT48 -> 't68', which is a terminal. So NT48 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Hmm, but in Chomsky Normal Form, non-terminals only produce other non-terminals or terminals. So in this case, S -> NT48 NT11, meaning NT48 is a terminal token.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT48 -> 't68' is a production, meaning NT48 is a terminal. So the string starts with 't53', which is also a terminal.\n\nWait, but the first part of the string is 't53 t32 t66 t30 t47 t10 t27 t15 t36 t22 t68 t69 t47 t55 t32 t28 t73 t24 t66 t27 t31 t59 t15 t83 t83 t42 t47 t22 t66 t73 t84 t48 t37 t3 t7 t48 t55 t15 t30 t76 t12 t25 t5 t37 t55'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't53'. Let me see if there's a production rule that directly produces 't53'. From the rules, I see NT33 can produce 't73' and 't30', and NT30 can produce 't84', 't5', etc. Wait, looking through all the productions, I don't see any direct production of 't53'. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check each rule again. Oh, wait, looking at the rules, I see NT52 has a production NT52 -> 't58' and also NT52->'t25'. Similarly, NT25->'t58' and NT25->'t5'. Wait, no 't53' directly. So perhaps 't53' is derived from another way.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nThe first non-terminal is S, which splits into NT48 and NT11. But since NT48 is a terminal, the string starts with t53, which is a terminal. So, the first part of the string is t53, so S must produce something that starts with t53. But S's production is NT48 NT11, and both are terminals. Does NT48 produce 't53'? Looking at the rules, no, NT48->'t68'. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe the grammar is given as S -> NT48 NT11, where NT48 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. But in Chomsky Normal Form, non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals. So S can produce two non-terminals, and each non-terminal must eventually produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but if NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals, then the initial step S->NT48 NT11 must have two non-terminals, which then split into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given productions, for example, NT48->'t68' is a production, meaning NT48 is a terminal. So if that's the case, then the string must start with 't68', not 't53'. But the string starts with 't53', so that can't be from NT48.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the grammar to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each production either ends in a terminal (like 't36', 't53', etc.) or continues as another non-terminal.\n\nSo, let me check if there is a production that can produce 't53'. Looking at all the non-terminals, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73' or 't30'\n- NT35 -> 't27' or 't3'\n- NT13 -> 't5' or 't19'\n- NT53: Wait, do I see any rule for NT53? Looking through, no. It's just 't53' as a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually all the terminals are listed as, for example, NT33 -> 't73' or 't30'. So each non-terminal may produce multiple terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't53'? Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT31 -> several options, none include 't53'.\n- NT53 is not a non-terminal; it's a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps 't53' is a terminal. So in the grammar, is there a production that produces 't53'? From the list, I don't see any. So if 't53' is a terminal, the grammar must have a non-terminal that produces 't53'.\n\nBut looking at all the non-terminals, none of them produce 't53' as a terminal. Wait, for example:\n\n- NT20->'t26' or 't53' (appears twice, in two different rules)\nAh, yes, looking at NT20's productions:\n\nNT20 -> 't26' or 't53'.\n\nSo NT20 can produce 't53' if that's needed.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, 't53' is a terminal that can be produced by NT20.\n\nSo, going back to S. S is S-> NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 is a terminal, 't68', according to NT48->'t68'.\n\nNT11 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT11 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT11's productions: NT11-> 't31' or 't49'.\n\nSo NT11 can produce 't31' or 't49'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is 't53', which is produced by NT20, not by S's direct productions.\n\nBut wait, S only produces NT48 NT11, which are terminals. So S directly expands to a sequence of terminals. So the first token must come from NT48 or NT11.\n\nSince S's expansion is NT48 NT11, and both are terminals in their respective productions, their productions would have to match the string's first two tokens.\n\nBut S is S->NT48 NT11. So each of these is a terminal.\n\nBut the string starts with 't53', which can't be from NT48, which is 't68', and would also not"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-842","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided CFG. Let me go through this step by step because it's a bit complex.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That\u2019s helpful because it gives me a structure to work with.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is:\n`t58 t31 t37 t65 t84 t19 t58 t19 t68 t19 t5 t37 t53 t28 t66 t32 t3 t31 t83 t83 t47 t30 t66 t28 t77 t36 t65 t15 t22 t47 t10 t31 t4 t32 t83 t53 t5 t5 t36 t84 t81 t28 t76 t48 t27`\n\nLooking at this, each token is either a two-digit number or a 't' followed by two digits. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11, each production leads to a combination of two non-terminals, which eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nMy plan is to parse this string from left to right, treating it as a sequence of terminal symbols and trying to match it with the grammar rules. I'll need to explore possible leftmost derivations or use a parsing strategy like recursive descent, since it's in CNF.\n\nBut parsing can get complicated. Alternatively, since each production is two non-terminals, every terminal in the string should be directly derivable from one of the productions. Wait, no\u2014actually, each step of the derivation introduces two new non-terminals, which may further split. So, perhaps each token in the string must correspond to a derivation step that can produce that terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me correct that: each rule in the grammar produces two non-terminals, so the derivation process creates a sequence of these, which in turn get replaced by terminals or other non-terminals. So, the entire string is built from a tree of productions, each splitting into two until we reach terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, there are 44 tokens. Since the initial production splits the start symbol S into two parts, each step either splits existing non-terminals or leaves them as is. The total number of terminal symbols in the string must be a length that aligns with the grammar's structure.\n\nWait, the initial S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which are two symbols. Each of those can be non-terminals that split further. So, for each non-terminal, we can expand it into two parts, increasing the count of symbols. In CNF, every expansion leads to more symbols. So the number of symbols should be 2^k, but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps not exactly, because some non-terminals expand into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see how each production leads to two parts, and each part might be a terminal or another non-terminal that eventually becomes a terminal. So, the string is a series of terminals, each corresponding to the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nBut another approach: perhaps I can map each terminal symbol in the string to the production rule that generates it. Then, see if the string can be formed by a series of such replacements, ensuring that the structure of the grammar is respected.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules and see how many terminals there are.

{"custom_id":"request-855","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF usually means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except maybe the start symbol. Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the rules like S -> NT48 NT11 or NT44 -> NT42 NT13 follow the two-nonterminals pattern. Some terminals are present in the productions, like 't76' or 't30', which indicate that these are the terminal symbols. So the grammar seems to be in CNF because each rule only has two nonterminals on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces: `t7 t15 t10 t25 t76 t10 t55 t77 t28 t58 t66 t28 t32 t7 t37 t48 t27 t22 t65 t81 t4 t31 t32 t53 t49 t30 t4 t81 t22 t12 t37 t49 t37 t7 t59 t76 t55 t10 t59 t72 t25 t10 t83 t69 t76 t42`.\n\nFirst step, I need to parse this string into individual tokens as per the grammar. Each part is separated by a space, so each token is a single string. The string consists of various 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers must form the left-hand side symbols of the grammar.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can have terminals. So to generate the string, it should be derived by expanding non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol (S) and try to expand it into the string. Since the grammar is quite complex, with multiple productions, I might need to check if the string can be built using a leftmost derivation or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help. But with such a long string, it's difficult to do manually. Alternatively, I can look for whether the string can be generated by any possible combination of productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in CNF, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So starting from the start symbol (which is S in this case), each expansion replaces a non-terminal with two others, but eventually, the process must terminate when only terminals are left.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, I should check the structure of the string and see if it corresponds to any possible leftmost expansion.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t7, t15, t10, t25, t76. So the first part is t7 t15 t10 t25 t76.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the first production is S -> NT48 NT11. So S expands into NT48 and NT11. So the first two symbols of the string should come from NT48 and NT11. Let's see: t7 is NT48, and t15 is NT11? Or wait, no. Let me see the productions:\n\nNT48 isn't listed as a non-terminal; rather, in the productions, I see NT48 on the right side. So perhaps the non-terminals are all the uppercase NTs, and the rest are terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, the productions start with S and then have NT48, NT44, etc. So all the NT symbols are non-terminals, and the rest are terminals. Each time a non-terminal is produced, it's replaced by two other non-terminals (except when it's a terminal, but according to CNF, non-terminals can't produce terminals on the right except for the start symbol maybe).\n\nWait, no. CNF requires that all productions are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So in the given grammar, each production takes a non-terminal and produces two non-terminals, except some may have terminals. Looking back, some productions have terminals, like NT33 -> 't76' or 't30'.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Because in standard CNF, all productions must have non-terminals on the right. If any production includes a terminal, then it's not in CNF. So perhaps the given grammar isn't in CNF after all, or it's been transformed into CNF but some rules have terminals.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. The user stated that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so possibly all rules are of the form A -> BC, except the start symbol can have A -> B or A -> a, where a is a terminal. But in the given grammar, some rules have a mix of NT symbols and terminals.\n\nSo looking at the productions:\n\nNT33 -> 't76' or 't30' \u2013 that's a terminal. So that suggests that NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, others like NT7 -> 't12' etc. So the grammar includes terminals on the right side, which would mean it's not in CNF, as CNF doesn't allow terminals on the right side except for the start symbol.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions except the start symbol can have terminals on the right? Or wait, no, that's not right. In CNF, every production must have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol which can have a single non-terminal, or even a terminal.\n\nSo perhaps the given grammar is actually in a form where non-terminals can derive terminals. Wait, but in the initial problem, the grammar was presented as being in CNF, but in this case, some non-terminals have terminals, which might imply that it's been put into a form that's a mix between CNF and something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some rules are in CNF and others are allowing terminals on the right. I might need to proceed assuming that the grammar allows for non-terminals to be replaced by terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nBut this complicates things because it's not strictly CNF anymore if some productions have terminals. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is in a different form, but for the purpose of this problem, I need to consider it as given.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that some of the productions have terminals. For example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30', which are terminals. So that would imply that NT33 can also produce terminals, which is acceptable in a general context-free grammar but not in CNF, as CNF requires that all productions on the right are non-terminals.\n\nSo this may indicate that the grammar is being used in a broader form than CNF, but since the problem states that it's in CNF, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the grammar, as it's not in CNF. However, as a problem solver, I have to proceed with the given grammar, assuming that the user is correct in stating it's in CNF.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's list out the rules and see which are non-terminals. The non-terminals seem to be the uppercase NT followed by numbers, like S, NT48, NT44, etc. The rest are terminals. So, in the productions, any rule that starts with an uppercase NT and ends with another uppercase NT is a CNF production.\n\nLooking at NT48: NT48 is on the right side. So perhaps NT48 is a non-terminal, and the productions for NT48 are not shown here; perhaps it's a terminal. Wait, but in the provided grammar, all the productions are for the non-terminals, so for example, NT33 is a non-terminal and can produce 't76' or 't30'. So NT33 can be a terminal or non-terminal, but in this case, it's acting as a non-terminal that can produce terminals.\n\nThis suggests that the grammar is not in strict CNF but possibly a mix. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar provided is in some other form.\n\nIn any case, to proceed, I need to consider that each step in the derivation expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals, but in this case, some non-terminals can expand into terminals. So perhaps the approach is to work backward from the string and see if it can be reduced to the start symbol S by checking each production.\n\nThat is, starting from the end, each terminal must match a terminal in the grammar, and each pair of non-terminals must have a production leading to them.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a leftmost derivation that matches the string. However, given the complexity of the grammar, this may be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the structure of the string and see if it matches any possible expansion.\n\nLet me split the string into individual tokens:\n\nt7, t15, t10, t25, t76"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's a bunch of production rules starting from S and breaking down into non-terminals (NT) and terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). The top-level rule is S -> NT48 NT11. So the starting symbol is S, and from there, every production rule is in CHC normal form, which is a production that goes from a single non-terminal to two non-terminals, except for the base cases where a terminal is a production for a non-terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is pretty long, but let me look at it again: t19 t81 t84 t47 t15 t12 t68 t59 t84 t72 t55 t7 t55 t15 t28 t47 t68 t72 t66 t24 t4 t66 t69 t5 t5 t65 t26 t66 t36 t7 t37 t30 t31 t32 t49 t42 t81 t47 t12 t59 t77 t26 t76 t53 t77 t10.\n\nI notice that all the elements are 't' followed by numbers; none of them are non-terminals from the grammar. So, the string consists solely of terminals. \n\nNow, my task is to see if this string can be derived by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals, except for the leaves which are terminals. So, the structure of the string should form a binary tree that can be built from the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which expands to NT48 and NT11. So the first two symbols in the string should come from NT48 and NT11. Let's see: the string starts with t19 t81. Wait, no, the first symbol is t19, which must be matched by something in NT48, and the second is t81, which must be matched by something in NT11.\n\nHmm, looking at the productions for NT48 and NT11:\n\nNT48 -> NT49 NT6\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nSo, S expands to NT48 NT11, which would expand to (NT49 NT6) (NT41 NT49). So the first part of the string would be from NT49 and NT6.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t19, which is a terminal. Looking at the productions for NT19, it's a terminal (I think because I see 't19' in a production somewhere), and the same with others in the grammar. Wait, the grammar only has a few terminals. Let me check which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT33 -> 't76' or 't30'\nNT40 -> 't65' or 't28' or 't1'\nNT45 -> 't29' or 't1'\nNT43 -> 't15' or 't55'\nNT44 -> 't73' or 't48'\nNT6 -> 't4'\nNT25 -> 't58'\nNT59 -> 't24', 't12', 't53'\nNT49 -> 't81' or 't47'\nNT13 -> 't5'\nNT52 -> 't7','t55','t10', etc.\n\nWait, actually, multiple non-terminals produce terminals. So, for instance, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t19. Looking through the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't19'? Hmm, checking the rules, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't19'. Let me scan through all the rules:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see: NT19 is not listed as a production, and all the terminals in the grammar end with 't' followed by a number, like t76, t30, t28, etc. So unless there's a non-terminal NT that produces t19, which isn't present, that might be an issue. Wait, no, the only NT that produces a terminal is those that have a rule like NT33 -> 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, others like NT40 can produce t65, t28, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check if I missed any NT that produces t19.\n\nLooking again, each NT that produces a terminal ends with 't' followed by a number that's in the grammar's data. Let me see: I don't see any NT that directly produces 't19'. For example, NT19 is not in the list; I think the grammar rules don't have NT19 as a source of a terminal. Therefore, the string starts with 't19', but in the grammar, there's no non-terminal that produces t19, which would lead to the string not being possible.\n\nWait, let me double-check: the string starts with t19, t81, etc. So S must expand to NT48 and NT11, and their expansions must generate these terminals. But if the grammar doesn't produce t19, the string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer must be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't19', but the grammar does not have any non-terminal that directly produces 't19'.

Since all the given rules are in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language generated by this grammar, I need to see if there's a derivation path that starts with the start symbol S and ends with the given string by applying the productions step by step.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to simulate the parsing process. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string must have a length that's one less than a power of 2, starting at least 2 (since the minimum derivation length for a string of terminals is 2). Let me check the length of the string.\n\nThe string provided is:\nt19 t53 t49 t5 t49 t26 t31 t73 t84 t73 t10 t48 t83 t81 t83 t32 t15 t12 t4 t31 t73 t22 t25 t49 t76 t25 t76 t30 t36 t25 t22 t4 t10 t48 t65 t31 t42 t4 t72 t22 t72 t55 t37 t25 t47 t25 t19\n\nLet's count the tokens. Including all the spaces, that's 51 tokens. Wait, no, actually, each word is a separate token, so the number of tokens is equal to the number of elements separated by spaces. Let me count:\n\n1. t19\n2. t53\n3. t49\n4. t5\n5. t49\n6. t26\n7. t31\n8. t73\n9. t84\n10. t73\n11. t10\n12. t48\n13. t83\n14. t81\n15. t83\n16. t32\n17. t15\n18. t12\n19. t4\n20. t31\n21. t73\n22. t22\n23. t25\n24. t49\n25. t76\n26. t25\n27. t76\n28. t30\n29. t36\n30. t25\n31. t22\n32. t4\n33. t10\n34. t48\n35. t65\n36. t31\n37. t42\n38. t4\n39. t72\n40. t22\n41. t72\n42. t55\n43. t37\n44. t25\n45. t47\n46. t25\n47. t19\n\nSo that's 47 tokens. The length is 47, which is 2^n -1. Let's see: 2^6 is 64, 2^5 is 32. 32-1 is 31, 64-1 is 63. 47 isn't a power of 2 minus 1, so that's a red flag. Wait, but in CNF, the number of symbols in a sentential form must be of the form 2^k -1, where k is the number of production steps. Each production either increases the number of symbols by 1 (A \u2192 BC) or replaces a symbol with one (A \u2192 a). But the start symbol S must be expanded into a string where each rule adds symbols correctly.\n\nWait, the problem states that the grammar is in CNF, so the starting symbol S must produce a string through a sequence of derivations where each step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (increasing the count by +1) or with a terminal (increasing by 0). The overall length must be 2^k -1 for some k, starting from S which is a single non-terminal.\n\nBut our string has 47 tokens, which is not congruent to 1 mod a power of 2 (since 47 is 31 +16, which doesn't match 2^k -1). Wait, 47-1 is 46, which is not a power of 2 (since 2^5=32, 2^6=64; 46 isn't a power of 2). So that suggests that the length is incompatible. So I can immediately say 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the string length isn't the immediate issue, but the actual parsing.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The starting symbol S can produce a string that's a sentential form of length 2^k for some k. For example, if S \u2192 AB, then A and B can produce terminals, each potentially branching into more, leading to 2^k symbols.\n\nBut in this case, the given string length is 47, which is 2^5 * something. Let me see: 47 is 31 +16, which isn't a clean power. Hmm, perhaps there's a problem with the length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing the levels. In CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal, so the number of symbols at each level would be a power of 2.\n\nWait, let me think. Starting from S (length 1), each production of a non-terminal can replace it with either two non-terminals (length increases by 1, so from 1 to 2, difference is +1) or with a terminal (length remains the same). So the possible lengths after each step are:\n\n- Initially: 1 (S)\n- After one step: 1 (if S \u2192 a) or 2 (if S \u2192 BC)\n- After two steps: if S \u2192 BC, then each B and C can produce a terminal or non-terminals. So possibilities include:\n  - BC\u2192 aC: 2 (if B\u2192a and C\u2192 something)\n  - BC\u2192 BC': 3 (if B\u2192BC1 and C\u2192C1C2, etc.)\nWait, this gets complicated. But the key point is that the number of symbols after each step can vary, but only by 1 each time.\n\nSo the number of symbols in the derived string must satisfy that the number is congruent to 1 mod 1, meaning any number possible? But that doesn't make sense. Actually, the number of symbols can vary as per the rules.\n\nWait, but the correct way to check is to see whether the string's length can be represented as (m+1) where each production adds 1, but that's not correct because each production can choose to add 1 or not.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is that the length must be at least the depth of the parse tree plus 1 or something similar. But I think I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me consider that each production adds either 1 (if it's A\u2192BC) or 0 (if it's A\u2192a). So the total number of symbols is 1 + n, where n is the number of times a production produced two non-terminals. Because each A\u2192BC increases the symbol count by 1, and A\u2192a leaves it the same.\n\nSo, if the start symbol S is the root, and each step adds 1 for each A\u2192BC, then the total number of symbols would be 1 + number_of_BC_productions. Since the string has 47 symbols, that implies that the number of BC productions is 46.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, how many BC productions are possible?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this isn't the right approach. Maybe it's better to attempt to parse the string according to the grammar step by step.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can try to find a path from S down to the string.\n\nBut manually parsing 47 symbols would be time-consuming. Instead, I can look for direct productions.

{"custom_id":"request-867","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t3 t83 t69 t5 t69 t65 t48 t69 t32 t4 t49 t65 t3 t7 t68 t36 t58 t30 t31 t3 t30 t30 t58 t5 t30 t27 t73 t36 t12 t58 t72 t24 t19 t4 t84 t27 t37 t69 t32 t77 t31 t84 t25 t73 t10 t65 t48`. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all given as S -> NT48 NT11, then various NT rules, and finally several NT rules that directly produce terminals (marked with 't' and numbers).\n\nThe string contains a lot of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' is likely a terminal symbol, and the numbers probably represent non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation adds exactly two symbols. So the length of the string should be a product that fits into the derivation steps. Let me check the length of the string first. \n\nCounting the tokens: t3, t83, t69, t5, t69, t65, t48, t69, t32, t4, t49, t65, t3, t7, t68, t36, t58, t30, t31, t3, t30, t30, t58, t5, t30, t27, t73, t36, t12, t58, t72, t24, t19, t4, t84, t27, t37, t69, t32, t77, t31, t84, t25, t73, t10, t65, t48. That's 44 tokens. Since each production reduces the number of non-terminals by one, the number of symbols in the derived string should be of the form 2^n, but I might need to think differently.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have CNF, the maximum length of the string is 2^n where n is the number of productions applied, but since non-terminals can be expanded into terminals, the length depends on how deeply nested the productions are. But perhaps a better approach is to work backwards from the end of the string to see if I can trace back through the productions.\n\nStarting from the last symbol: t48. Looking at the grammar, let me find which non-terminals produce t48. Scanning the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT48 is mentioned in one production: S -> NT48 NT11. Also, at the bottom, NT44 -> t68, NT48 -> t68, etc. Wait, let me check each rule line by line.\n\nWait, I notice some rules produce 't' followed by numbers, like NT33 -> 't76' and 't30'. So each rule where NTx -> t followed by two digits is a production that directly emits a terminal.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce t48. Scanning all the NT rules to see if any have 't48' as a production:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nAt line 47: NT44 -> t48.\n\nSo NT44 can produce 't48'. Similarly, other rules may produce t48? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT44 appears in two places: NT48 -> t68, and another NT44 production is NT44 -> t68. Wait, actually, I think I might have misread. Let me look again.\n\nWait, at the end of the list, I see:\n\nNT44 -> t68,\n\nand another line: NT48 -> t68.\n\nWait, but the rule for NT44 is also mentioned earlier. Looking back, I think I might have misread the initial list. Let me go through each production and note the terminals.\n\nI'll list each NT and see if they produce 't48':\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT44 -> t68 (appearing twice)\n- NT43 -> t55\n- NT45 -> t29\n- NT44 -> t66\n- NT47 -> t48\n- NT7 -> t36\n- NT25 -> t58\n- NT24 -> t19\n- NT37 -> t32\n- NT43 -> t55\n- NT35 -> t27\n- NT48 -> t68\n- NT49 -> t47\n\nWait, so NT44 can produce t68, t66, and t47? Or is it that NT44's only production is t66? Wait, looking back, I think I might have misread the initial rules. Let me check each line carefully.\n\nWait, the initial grammar is written as a list of productions. Each line is a production for an NT symbol on the left.\n\nFor example:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nand so on.\n\nThen, for terminals:\n\nNT33 -> 't76'\n\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, to identify which NT produces 't48', I need to look through all the rules to see if any NT produces t48.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see at line 47: NT44 -> t48.\n\nSo NT44 can produce t48.\n\nSimilarly, another line is NT48 -> t68.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal. So NT44 can produce t48, which is a terminal.\n\nSo the last symbol in the string is t48, which must come from NT44 -> t48.\n\nSo working backwards, the last step before the string is the non-terminal NT44, which splits into the two symbols that came before it. Wait, no, in a derivation, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So in the reverse direction, the last symbol(s) must have been produced by a production. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the string, the last token is t48, so before that, the last two symbols must have come from the production that generated t48 and something else. Wait, no, in a leftmost derivation, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So starting from the root S, each step adds symbols, and the total number should end up as the string.\n\nBut working in reverse, starting from the string and trying to find the productions that would have generated it. Since each production can produce a terminal plus another non-terminal, maybe. Wait, perhaps the best way is to try to see if the entire string can be built by replacing non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be matched by a production of the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps stepping through this step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string: t3 t83 t69 t5 t69 t65 t48 t69 t32 t4 t49 t65 t3 t7 t68 t36 t58 t30 t31 t3 t30 t30 t58 t5 t30 t27 t73 t36 t12 t58 t72 t24 t19 t4 t84 t27 t37 t69 t32 t77 t31 t84 t25 t73 t10 t65 t48.\n\nBut doing this iteratively is going to be time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to model the string as a tree and check if each symbol can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must be built by expanding S into a sequence of symbols, and since it's in CNF, each expansion splits the string into two parts until all are terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I can parse the string by trying to split it into parts where each part corresponds to a production.\n\nI'll start from the beginning and see if I can match a production.\n\nThe first symbol is t3. Let's see which production produces t3.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see an NT producing t3. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules again to find if any NT has t3 as a production.\n\nLooking through the list, I see a rule: NT30 -> t30, NT33 -> t76, NT33 -> t30, NT39 -> t40,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-887","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see that all the rules are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. So that checks out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. In CNF, the derivation starts with the start symbol, which seems to be S. The given grammar has S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, from S, we derive two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11.\n\nNext, I should build a parse tree for the string. The string is quite long, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's write down the string again:\n\nt32 t49 t42 t7 t42 t66 t37 t83 t27 t53 t68 t84 t55 t12 t72 t10 t53 t3 t72 t65 t47 t15 t28 t76 t47 t47 t15 t19 t66 t3 t19 t55 t59 t58 t76 t26 t30 t26 t42 t3 t28 t12 t27 t53 t55 t81 t5 t25.\n\nI need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived by the grammar's rules. Each step in the parse tree will involve replacing a non-terminal with two terminals or more non-terminals until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, S splits into NT48 and NT11. Now, I'll need to see if each of these non-terminals can derive sequences that match parts of the string.\n\nLet's consider NT48. Looking for productions where the left-hand side is NT48. Scanning the grammar:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6.\n\nSo, NT48 becomes NT49 and NT6. Now, we'll need to expand these. Let's take NT49: Looking through the grammar, I see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, that would mean NT49 is NT11 and NT6. Let's check NT11: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Hmm, that's a bit recursive. Let me write down the steps:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6 \u2192 (NT11 NT6) NT6 \u2192 NT11 NT6 NT6.\n\nBut NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 \u2192 NT41 (NT11 NT49). So, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently, perhaps by looking for the entire string and seeing if it can be constructed step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to use a reduction strategy, trying to match the string from left to right by finding possible matches for the non-terminals. But with a grammar, it's a bit trickier because each step depends on the rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by breaking it down into parts that match the rules. Let's consider the string and try to split it into parts that might come from the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t32. Let's see if any non-terminal can derive t32.\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals are things like t32, t49, t7, etc., and non-terminals have to be combined from the given rules. So, for t32, I'd need a production where t32 is directly a result of a rule. Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce t32 directly? Let me go through the rules:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 t48 or t32, among others.\nWait, looking closer, I see NT48 \u2192 t49 t32? Wait, no, I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar rules list something like NT37 \u2192 t48 or t32, etc. But I'm not sure what exact rules produce which terminals. It's a bit messy. Let me try to list out which non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking through the rules, here are the direct terminal productions:\n\nNT33 \u2192 t73 or t30 (multiple options)\nNT30 \u2192 t84 or t22 or t10\nNT40 \u2192 t65 or t53 or t26\nNT47 \u2192 t47 (only one)\nNT7 \u2192 t36 or others\nNT28 \u2192 t59 or others\nNT14 \u2192 t42 or others\nNT42 \u2192 t55 or others\nHmm, I'm seeing a pattern where some NTs produce terminals directly.\n\nFor example, NT37 can produce t48 (one rule) or t32 (another rule). Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the rules, I see NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35 or NT30 NT35, or is that a rule? Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought NT37 had two rules. Let me scan again:\n\nLooking for rules where left side is NT37:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35\n- NT37 \u2192 NT13 NT34\n\nSo, NT37 can be expanded into two non-terminals or another two non-terminals, but does any NT produce a terminal from NT37? It seems not from the list; both rules produce two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rules. Let me go through the given grammar again to list all rules, just to make sure I don't confuse NTs with terminals.\n\nLet me go through each line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-884","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This helps because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the start symbol is S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, to produce S, we need to have two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. From there, each of these non-terminals will produce other non-terminals until we hit the terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers or some specific strings like 't76', 't77', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t77 t37 t59 t58 t59 t84 t72 t53 t66 t32 t15 t77 t68 t65 t3 t19 t72 t42 t4 t72 t19 t36 t84 t27 t73 t66 t37 t48 t69 t22 t73 t25 t83 t36 t55 t58 t53 t32 t4 t3 t3 t53 t76 t26 t30 t59 t81 t28`.\n\nHmm, that's quite a long string. Let me see how I can approach this. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will have a binary structure, and each production step will result in two symbols. So, the length of the string should correspond to the number of steps taken during parsing. \n\nThe string starts with 't77', which I notice is directly derived from NT33 or NT30 or other rules. But let me check the productions for each 't' part to see what non-terminals they come from.\n\nFor example, looking at the first part:\n- t77 is from NT55->t72 t53 (from the grammar) or from other rules. Wait, actually, NT55 has a rule NT55->t72 t53? No, wait, looking back, I see NT55->t72 t53 is one of the rules: NT55->t72 t53. So if a production for NT55 is NT55->t72 t53, then t77 isn't directly a terminal. Let me check all terminals.\n\nWait, the terminals are the ones that are written as 't' followed by numbers. For instance, NT33 has two rules: NT33->t73 and NT33->t76. So NT33 can produce either 't73' or 't76'. Similarly, other NTs have such productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I see several parts like 't77', but I don't recall any NT that directly produces 't77'. Let me check all the NTs and their rules:\n\n- NT33: t73 or t76\n- NT30: t84 or t22\n- NT55: t72 t53\n- NT6: t4\n- NT49: t81 or t16 or t77 (wait, looking at the rules, I see NT49->t16 NT7 and NT49->t77 NT26. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I see NT49->t81, NT49->t16 NT7, and NT49->t77 NT6. So actually, NT49 can produce t81 (case 1), t16 NT7 (case 2), or t77 NT6 (case 3). So, 't77' can be produced from NT49.\n\nWait, so the string starts with t77 t37 t59 t58... etc. Let me see why the string might not fit.\n\nWait, looking at the string, I notice a t77 which would come from NT49->t77 NT6. So that's fine. Then next is t37. Looking at the grammar, NT37 can produce t32 t84 or t13 t34 or other rules. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking for t37: in the grammar, NT37->t32 t84, NT37->t13 t34, and NT37->t30 t35.\n\nWait, so 't37' would be a direct production if it's one of the terminals, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't37'; instead, it's a combination. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, but no, looking back: the grammar, under NT37, has two rules: NT37->t13 t34 and NT37->t30 t35. There's no direct t37, so the string cannot have 't37' as a standalone terminal. But the string does have 't37' in it, which would require that NT37 somehow directly produces 't37', which it doesn't.\n\nWait, that's a key point. If the string has 't37', and in the grammar, no NT directly produces 't37', but only produces pairs like 't13 t34' or 't30 t35', then 't37' cannot appear as a single terminal token. So any occurrence of 't37' in the string would make it invalid.\n\nLooking back at the string, I see a 't37' after t77. So the first two tokens are t77 t37.\n\nFrom NT49, we have t77, which is production 3: NT49->t77 NT6. So after that, we expect NT49 to produce t77 and then something else (NT6). So the next symbol after t77 would be the production of NT6.\n\nLooking at NT6: the production is NT6->t4. So in the string, after t77, we should have t4, but the string after t77 is t37, which is not t4. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, that's a big issue. Let me recap.\n\nThe string starts as t77 t37 t59... etc.\n\nFirst step: NT48 NT11 from S. Let's break down t77.\n\nThe first production is S->NT48 NT11. So NT48 and NT11 need to generate the string.\n\nNT48's production: looking back, in the grammar, NT48 is in two rules? Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT48 only appears in S->NT48 NT11 and as a production for NT40: NT47->t48. Also, in the provided rules, I see NT48 is not directly defined, but wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 -> t65\n- NT37 -> t47\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking at all NTs and their rules:\n\nNT48: Not directly defined; perhaps it's derived from another NT. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT40->t65\n- NT49->t47\n- NT44->t73\n- NT52->t58\n- So, NT40->t65, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps NT48 is part of some other rule. Wait, looking at S->NT48 NT11, and from the grammar, S is derived from NT48 and NT11. So to produce the string starting with t77, which is part of NT49.\n\nWait, perhaps S->NT48 NT11 is not the starting point. Wait, initially, I thought S is the start symbol, so it's derived from NT48 and NT11. But the string starts with t77, which comes from NT49. So that suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe S generates t77, but that can't be because S is a higher symbol.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, S->NT48 NT11. So S generates two non-terminals, NT48 and NT11. Then, each of these non-terminals would produce their own sub-productions.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t77, which would require that NT48 or NT11 can produce t77, but looking at their productions, do they have such rules?\n\nLooking at NT48's productions: Hmmm, in the provided grammar, I need to check NT48.

{"custom_id":"request-895","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string given is a sequence of tokens, which includes both terminal and non-terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and the production for S is NT48 NT11. So, the string should start with the symbols that derive from NT48 and NT11. \n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 and NT11 will each be expanded through the productions until they reach terminal symbols. I'll start by checking if the first two tokens in the string match what NT48 and NT11 expand to.\n\nI notice that NT48 has a production NT48 -> NT49 NT6. So NT48 will expand into NT49 and NT6. I look at the first token of the string, which is \"t42\". I check if \"t42\" is the expansion of either NT49 or NT6. Looking through the grammar, NT6 is defined as NT52 NT49. Wait, no, let me check. Actually, in the grammar, NT6 is \"t4\", which is a terminal symbol. But in the production, NT6 is on the right-hand side as part of some NT. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT6 -> NT52 NT49, but also NT6 is a terminal in another rule? Wait, no. Wait, the grammar is in CNF, so every production should only have non-terminals on the RHS. So let me look back.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT6:\n\nYes, here's NT6 -> NT52 NT49. So NT6 is a non-terminal that expands into NT52 and NT49. Both NT52 and NT49 are non-terminals. So in the string, starting with \"t42\", I need to see if \"t42\" is derived by expanding NT6, but wait, wait. Wait, the first token is \"t42\", but the production for NT6 leads to NT52 and NT49. So perhaps \"t42\" is not the direct terminal. Hmm, maybe the confusion arises because some non-terminals in the grammar directly are terminals when fully expanded.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, many non-terminals directly go to terminal symbols. For example:\n\nNT33 -> 't73' or 't30' or similar.\n\nSo, for the initial step, let's parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt42 t19 t5 t7 t83 t59 t28 t31 t27 t69 t30 t31 t77 t24 t72 t12 t49 t77 t55 t30 t31 t59 t25 t48 t27 t83 t32 t19 t15 t66 t25 t42 t55 t68 t73 t66 t25 t25 t73 t27 t77 t59 t4 t84 t65 t81 t37 t81 t25.\n\nBut I'm not going to list them all, just the initial steps. Maybe a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by checking for each part of the string whether it can be generated by a certain non-terminal, building a table.\n\nBut since I'm less experienced with the CYK algorithm, let me try another approach: tracing the derivation starting from S.\n\nThe string starts with \"t42\". Looking back to the grammar, I need to see what can produce \"t42\". So I should look for non-terminals that can directly produce \"t42\" in their production rules. Checking the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce \"t42\"?\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT57 -> NT9 NT37\n- NT24 -> 't65' (Wait, no, looking again, NT20 is \"t26\", NT9 is \"t25\", etc. Wait, let me list all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT33 -> 't73'\nNT33 -> 't30'\nNT40 -> 't65'\nNT20 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't25'\nNT41 -> 't77'\nNT20 -> 't53'\nNT52 -> 't7'\nNT25 -> 't58'\nNT59 -> 't24'\nNT14 -> 't76'\nNT8 -> 't69'\nNT16 -> 't26'\nNT47 -> 't48'\nNT13 -> 't5'\nNT52 -> 't37'\nNT55 -> 't72'\nNT43 -> 't15'\nNT44 -> 't73'\nNT6 -> 't4'\nWait, no, wait\u2014NT6 is 't4'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through each production, for example, NT6 is \"t4\". So NT6 is 't4', which is a terminal. So in the initial step, the first non-terminal in S is NT48 and NT11.\n\nFrom the string, the first token is \"t42\", but NT48 also can be 't49' and 't6', but I think I'm getting tangled here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to correct my approach. Since S -> NT48 NT11, the initial symbols are NT48 and NT11. So in the string, the first two symbols should come from NT48 and NT11.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is \"t42\", which could be the first symbol of NT48's expansion. So NT48's production is NT49 NT6. So the string's first part is \"t42\", and the next step is to see if \"t42\" comes from NT48. But NT48's first step is to split into NT49 and NT6. So to see if \"t42\" is the first terminal generated by NT48.\n\nWait, perhaps the CYK approach would be more systematic. Let's outline the steps.\n\nThe string is 60 tokens long, which is a bit cumbersome, but perhaps focusing on the first few tokens is manageable.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT48 -> NT49 NT6\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nSo, the entire string starts with NT48 and NT11, which each expand into two parts.\n\nSo, for the first part, \"t42\", it comes from NT48. Then \"t19\" should come from NT11.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The string starts with \"t42 t19 ...\". So the first two tokens come from NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet me parse it as S -> A B, where A is the first part (NT48) and B is the second part (NT11).\n\nSo A must derive into \"t42 ...\" and B must derive into \"t19 ...\".\n\nSo, let's consider A: NT48 -> NT49 NT6\n\nSo, A starts with \"t42\", which should come from NT49 or NT6.\n\nLooking at NT49's productions, in the grammar, NT49 appears in several productions, for example:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nAlso, NT48 -> NT49 NT6, and NT49 can produce 't84' directly. So if \"t42\" is the first terminal, it must be from a production where either NT49 or NT6 can derive to 't42'.\n\nWait, checking NT6 in the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49, which are non-terminals. But we saw earlier that NT6 is directly 't4' in another production. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up which NT rule is which. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, here's NT6:\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\n\nWait, that's a production for NT6 with two non-terminals. But wait, that can't be in CNF, right? Because CNF requires all productions to have two non-terminals on the right. So in this grammar, every rule is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo, in this case, NT6 has a production that produces two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF.\n\nBut for NT6, there's also another production? Or is NT6 only in that one production?\n\nWait, from the given grammar:\n\nLooking for NT6: \n\n- NT6 -> NT52 NT49\n\nSo, NT6 is a two-non-terminal production, but does it have any terminal productions?

{"custom_id":"request-894","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see... The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is all right. The string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like \"t77 t59 t66 ...\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules to see what they produce. The starting symbol is S, and the first rule is S -> NT48 NT11. So the derivation starts with NT48 and NT11. \n\nLooking at NT48, according to the rules, it can be broken down into t68. So the first part of the string should start with t68. But wait, the given string starts with t77. That means if the first symbol is t68, the string can't start with t77. That might already suggest a No, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the string using the grammar. Let me think about how to approach this. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can use a top-down approach or a bottom-up approach, but maybe constructing a parse tree would help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming. Let me first see if I can find any rules that result in t77. Looking through the grammar, I see NT41 -> t77 and NT7 -> t77 as well. Because NT7 is also a rule that leads to t77. So both NT41 and NT7 can produce 't77'.\n\nWait, let me check the NT41 rule. Yes, NT41 -> t77. Also, looking back, there's NT7 -> t77. So both rules can produce 't77'. \n\nBut how do we get from the starting symbol S to the string? Let me outline the steps:\n\nStarting with S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 -> t68, so the first symbol should be t68. But the string starts with t77, which conflicts because NT48 directly produces t68. So that seems like a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me re-express that. S is NT48 NT11, and NT48 is a non-terminal. Does NT48 ever expand into something else besides t68? Looking at the rules, NT48's production is only NT6 -> NT52 NT49, then NT52->t69, but wait, no, let me recheck.\n\nWait, I think I confused NT48. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT48 having any productions except S. Wait, no, the rules are all for non-terminals. So for NT48, looking through, I don't see an NT48 production. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT48 is an NT that has a production. Wait, no, I think I might be getting confused. Let me list the rules step by step.\n\nS -> NT48 NT11.\n\nLooking for NT48's productions: Looking through the list, I don't see any rule where NT48 is on the left side. So maybe NT48 is actually a terminal. Wait, but the rules only have NT productions. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT48 appears as the terminal 't68' because in the string we have t68: \"t68\" is in the string, but in the rules, it's under NT48. Wait, but in the rules, NT48 isn't listed as any non-terminal production. So perhaps NT48 is a terminal symbol. Wait, but in the grammar, S is a starting symbol, and the rest look like non-terminals. So perhaps NT48 is a terminal, as it's listed as t68 in the production.\n\nSo, S -> NT48 NT11, where NT48 is 't68' and NT11 is another non-terminal. Looking at NT11's rules, NT11 has several productions, like NT11 -> NT41 NT49. Let me see.\n\nIf S is NT48 NT11, then S expands to t68 NT11. Then, NT11 can expand into various options. Let's take the first expansion where NT11 -> NT41 NT49. Then, NT41 is 't77' and NT49 can expand into 't11' or other non-terminals. Wait, looking back, NT49's rule is NT49 -> NT11 NT6. Hmm, that's a cycle between NT49 and NT11, but there's also NT49 -> t81. So, if NT49 is 't81', then NT41 is t77 and NT49 is t81. So, the first few symbols would be t68 t77 t81.\n\nBut the given string starts with t77, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe NT11 could expand into other paths. Let me check: NT11 can also be NT31 NT37, which would lead to more symbols. Or perhaps NT11 can become another non-terminal. But let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string provided is being generated by another part of the grammar. Maybe S isn't the starting point? No, the grammar starts with S. \n\nWait, but in the given grammar, does NT48 have a production? Let me double-check. The rules I have are listed as:\n\n- S -> NT48 NT11\n- Then a list of NTs (like NT44, NT12, etc.), each with their productions.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that the first few rules are S -> NT48 NT11, then NT44 -> NT42 NT13, and so on. So in the list, NT48 is present as a terminal 't68' in one of the rules. Similarly, NT33 is 't30' and 't76', etc.\n\nWait, does that mean that some NT symbols are terminals and others are non-terminals? For example, NT48 is a terminal because its expansion is 't68'. Similarly, NT44 is a non-terminal because it can expand into other NTs.\n\nSo, S -> NT48 NT11. Now, NT48 is 't68', and NT11 is a non-terminal that can expand into various NTs. So the initial expansion is t68 followed by whatever NT11 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with t77, which is a terminal that comes from NT41 or NT7. So maybe the first NT from S is not NT48 but somehow another path? Wait, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me try to see if there's a way the production could start with t77.\n\nWait, let's think about the first terminal in the string. The string begins with t77. So perhaps the S production isn't the starting point, but instead, maybe the string contains another starting non-terminal. But no, in a CFG, the entire string must be derived from S, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the given string is a result of multiple applications of S, but in CFGs, all derivations must start from S. So I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion isn't S, but perhaps another non-terminal can be the start? But according to the standard definition, CFG starts with S. So that can't be. Therefore, if the first symbol of the string isn't t68, which is the only production for NT48, then the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I might be missing something. Let's see: the first symbol is t77, which could come from either NT41 or NT7.\n\nWait, if the first symbol is t77, that implies that S is expanded directly into t77, but in the grammar, S is only NT48 NT11, so that's not the case.\n\nUnless, maybe, there's another way for S to be t77, but I don't see any such production. S is definitely NT48 NT11. So the only possible first symbol from S would be NT48, which is t68. But the string starts with t77, which doesn't match. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a higher-level rule I'm not seeing. Or perhaps the NT48 can expand into other things besides t68, but according to the rules, NT48 is only a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT48 is under the list after S, with only 't68' as the terminal value. So it's a terminal, so S can only produce t68 followed by something else.\n\nTherefore, the string can't start with t77 because S can only start with t68. So the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-904","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to check is quite long and composed of various 't' and numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF is structured such that each production rule has the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The string we're checking consists of terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Both NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals. This means the string must start with whatever symbols NT48 and NT11 can produce. \n\nNext, I notice that each production rule in the grammar either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT48 can produce \"t68\" or another pair of non-terminals. The terminals in the string are things like 't49', 't59', etc., which must match one of the rules exactly.\n\nI also see that some non-terminals produce multiple terminals. For instance, NT33 can produce either 't76' or 't30'. So, in the string, whenever I encounter a 't30' or 't76', it must come from NT33. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't49'. I need to check if there's a rule that produces 't49'. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT49 is defined as NT11 NT6, but do any of the non-terminals produce 't49'? Hmm, no, the direct terminals are in different non-terminals. Wait, let me check: NT49 actually is defined as NT11 NT6, but I don't see direct terminals for NT49 except maybe 't47' comes from NT47, which is 't48'. Wait, no, perhaps I should look for where 't49' is mentioned. Oh, I see NT49 \u2192 't81' and NT13 \u2192 't5', but maybe I missed it. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nSince the string is long, I need a systematic way to approach it. Maybe using the CYK algorithm would be effective, but given the complexity, perhaps I can break it down. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, so the string length must be 2^n, where n is the number of splits. Wait, the given string has 45 tokens. Let's check 2^n: 2^6 is 64, 2^5 is 32, which is less than 45. So 45 is not a power of two, which would make it impossible. Wait, that's a point. In CNF, the string length must be a power of two because each step reduces the number of symbols by half. So if we have a string of length L, it should be L = 2^n for some n \u2265 0.\n\nLet me calculate log2(45). Since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64, log2(45) is approximately 5.5, which isn't an integer. Therefore, the string length of 45 isn't a power of two, which suggests it's impossible for this string to be generated by a CFG in CNF. But wait, I might be making a wrong assumption here. Let me think again.\n\nIn CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, starting from S, which is two non-terminals, each step replaces non-terminals with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc.), but actually, each production is exactly two symbols. Therefore, the overall string length must be 2^k, where k is the number of steps. So, if the string has 45 symbols, that's 45 = 2^k, which is not possible because 2^5=32 and 2^6=64, so 45 isn't a power of two. \n\nBut wait, maybe my initial assumption is incorrect because I might be confusing the depth of the parse tree with the actual string length. Let's consider that in a CFG in CNF, each application of a production rule increases the number of symbols by one (since A \u2192 BC replaces one with two). So, starting from S, which is one symbol, the next step could have two symbols, then four, eight, etc. So, the number of symbols in the string should indeed be a power of two, such as 2,4,8,16,32,64,... Since 45 isn't a power of two, the string can't possibly be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, without even checking the specifics, the string can't be generated by the given CFG in CNF.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, in the given grammar, the right-hand sides are all two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, for example, S \u2192 NT48 NT49, which is two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals (like NT48, NT49) have their own productions. \n\nSo, the approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can expand it step by step to match the entire string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each production will contribute to that sequence.\n\nBut given the length of the string, manually doing this would be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into sequences that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the start production: S \u2192 NT48 NT49. So the first two symbols must be the results of expanding NT48 and NT49. The string starts with t49. So, looking at NT49's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So, NT49 expands into NT11 and NT6. Now, NT11 is another non-terminal that can be further expanded. NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Wait, that seems recursive because NT49 is part of it. Hmm, but each step should eventually terminate into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's length can give me clues. Since the string is 61 tokens long, and each step adds one token, the number of steps would be proportional to the length. But I'm not sure about the exact number of steps.\n\nAnother thought: each non-terminal can only derive into two others or a terminal. So, for each non-terminal, I can track if it can produce the corresponding part of the string.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which produces NT48 and NT49. The string starts with t49, which is from NT49. So, the first token is t49, which comes from NT49. Now, looking at NT49's productions: only one, which is NT11 and NT6.\n\nSo, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So, we need to match the next two symbols after t49. The next token is t5, so looking at NT11.\n\nLooking up NT11's productions: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, it expands into NT41 and NT49. Now, the next token after t5 is t5. So, does NT41 produce t5? Let's check NT41's productions:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT77. NT77 \u2192 t77. So, NT41 can produce t77. But the next token is t5, so that's a problem unless NT77 can somehow split. Wait, no\u2014NT77 is a non-terminal that directly produces t77. So, if NT41 \u2192 NT77, and the next token is t5, which is a terminal not produced by NT77, that would mean a mismatch.\n\nWait, so that suggests that NT41 would produce t77, but the next token is t5, which is not t77. So that path doesn't work. Hmm. Maybe there's another path I haven't considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production for NT11 is incorrect, or perhaps I've misread the grammar. Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the grammar: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, NT11 must expand to NT41 and NT49. The next token is t5. So, the left-hand side is NT11, which needs to produce t5. So, NT11's only production is two non-terminals, but the next token is a single terminal, which can't be matched directly. That suggests an issue. \n\nWait, this might mean that my initial approach is flawed. Maybe I should consider that the string is being built step by step, each production contributing either one or two terminals. So, each step in the derivation contributes either one or two tokens, and I have to see if the entire string can be built by such steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is being built leftmost derivation. Let's try that.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT49.\n\nSo the first two tokens should come from NT48 and NT49. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t49. So, the first token is t49, which would mean that NT49's production contributes t49. Looking back, NT49's only production is NT11 and NT6, which are two non-terminals. Wait, no: NT49 might also directly produce terminals, but in the given grammar, I don't see NT49 \u2192 t49. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the grammar: the production NT49 is defined as NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. There's another production NT646? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nFrom the grammar provided, under NT49: \n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nAre there any other productions for NT49? I don't see any other rules besides that. So NT49 must expand into NT11 and NT6. That would mean that t49 is not a terminal, but the result of NT49 expanding to two non-terminals. But in the string, the first token is t49, which is a terminal. That suggests a problem unless NT11 or NT6 produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-evaluate. If S \u2192 NT48 NT49, and the string starts with t49, that would imply that NT49 must produce t49, but in the grammar, NT49 only expands into two non-terminals: NT11 and NT6. So that can't happen. Because the first token is t49, which is from NT49, but NT49 doesn't produce a single terminal; it only produces two non-terminals. So that would mean that my initial step is invalid. Therefore, the string cannot be derived from this grammar.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because S must expand into NT48 and NT49, which are two non-terminals, producing two symbols each. So the entire string must start with the results of expanding NT48 and NT49 into symbols. So the total number of tokens should be even, generated by the leftmost derivation.\n\nIn this case, the string starts with t49, which is a single terminal. But in the grammar, the first expansion is two non-terminals. So unless a non-terminal is allowed to produce a terminal directly, but in this case, the first symbol is a terminal, which would require that NT48 or NT49 directly produce a terminal. But from the given grammar, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, looking again at NT49: it's defined as NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. No other productions. So NT49 can't produce a single terminal.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a specific way of structuring grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at the production rules, they all fit the CNF because each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nNow, the string to evaluate is \"t68 t31\". I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.

So for the string to be generated, each non-terminal in the production chain must expand into the corresponding terminal symbols.\n\nLet me parse the string as \"t68\" followed by \"t31\".

Others expand to two non-terminals, which means we have to break them down further.\n\nThe input string is `t68 t77 t81`. Let's see how each 't' can be generated.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the grammar:\n\n- t4: from NT6\n- t68: from NT48\n- t77: from NT41\n- t81: from NT49\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of t68, t77, t81.\n\nWait, but the string is `t68 t77 t81`, which is three terminals. So the derivation would need to start with S \u2192 NT48 NT11, producing t68 somewhere in NT48, and t77 from NT11.\n\nBut how do these non-terminals expand?\n\nLet's break down each component:\n\n1. t68 comes from NT48. So NT48 \u2192 ... I need to see if NT48 eventually leads to 't68'. Looking at the rules for NT48, initially, I see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT44 NT49, then NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, and NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25, etc. Let's track a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, NT48 might have a direct production to a terminal, but from the rules, NT48 only is produced by others. Wait, I don't see a direct rule for NT48. Let me check the given rules:\n\nLooking back, I see NT48's direct expansions: NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT49, NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT49, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules again:\n\nWait, I don't see NT48 being defined on the left side of a rule; instead, other non-terminals refer to NT48. So maybe NT48 is defined indirectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each rule carefully:\n\n- S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n- NT33 \u2192 't68' or 't30'\n- NT48 \u2192 ... Is there any rule for NT48 as a non-terminal? From the given rules, I don't see NT48 \u2192 anything. Wait, that's strange because S \u2192 NT48 NT11 suggests that NT48 is a left-hand side. Therefore, perhaps I missed a rule for NT48.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should check all the lines again to see if any of the LHS are NT48.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I find these:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13\n- NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT49 (wait, I think I might have missed it earlier)\nYes, looking at the list again, I see:\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT44 NT49 (line: NT48 -> NT44 NT49)\nand\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT49 (seems like there are two different rules for NT48: both are after each other.)\n\nWait, no, maybe I miscounted.

NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT49\n\nWait, this can't be right because in the initial rule S \u2192 NT48 NT11, NT48 is defined as two possible productions.\n\nSo to derive 't68', we need NT48 \u2192 't68', but according to the rules, this isn't possible because NT48 is expanded into two non-terminals without any terminals. So how can NT48 directly produce 't68'? It can't because neither of the rules for NT48 have 't...' but produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the given rules again, maybe I made a mistake in initial parsing.

I need to determine if the string `t68 t77 t47` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the start symbol S must generate the string through these rules.\n\nThe string given is `t68 t77 t47`. Since each 't' is followed by numbers, I bet these are terminals. So, maybe each 't' and number corresponds to a production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several productions that produce these strings. Let's break down each part of the string.\n\nStarting with `t68`: In the grammar, I see `NT48 -> 't68'`. So, NT48 produces t68. That makes sense.\n\nNext is `t77`: Checking the grammar, I find `NT41 -> 't77'`. So, NT41 produces t77.\n\nLast is `t47`: In the grammar, `NT49 -> 't47'`. So, NT49 produces t47.\n\nNow, I need to see if these non-terminals can be derived from the start symbol S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, S produces NT48 and NT11. \n\nNT48 is directly producing t68, so that's straightforward. Now, what about NT11?\n\nLooking at NT11, I see the production NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, NT11 is two non-terminals: NT41 and NT49. \n\nNT41 produces t77 as we saw earlier. But what about NT49? NT49 can be either 't47' or other possibilities? Wait, in the grammar, NT49 has two productions: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and NT49 \u2192 't47'. So, in this case, we use the terminal production NT49 \u2192 't47'.\n\nSo, putting it together, starting from S, we derive NT48, which is t68, and NT11, which is NT41 and NT49. NT41 is t77, and NT49 is t47. So, the entire string would be t68 t77 t47.\n\nWait, does this make sense? Let me double-check the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n2. NT48 \u2192 t68\n3. NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n4. NT41 \u2192 t77\n5. NT49 \u2192 t47\n\nSo, indeed, each production step is valid, and the string can be generated.

{"custom_id":"request-36","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t68 t77 t26 t36` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how it's structured. Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals are connected in a way that forms a chain of productions until a terminal is reached. My string consists of four terminals: t68, t77, t26, t36. Each of these must be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions that ultimately end with a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The initial production for S is S -> NT48 NT11. So the string must start with NT48 and NT11. But wait, the string starts with t68. So let's see what NT48 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT48: according to the grammar, NT48 -> t68. Okay, that's straightforward. So the first part of the string (t68) is accounted for. That means we're left with the second part, which should be NT11. Because S produces NT48 and NT11, so the entire string should be NT48 followed by NT11.\n\nNow, the second part is t77. Looking at NT11, what does it produce? Checking the grammar: NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So now, we have to see if NT41 can produce t77 and NT49 can produce something else, but wait, the string is only four terms. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the string is t68 t77 t26 t36. So after NT48 (which is t68), the next part is NT11, which is two non-terminals: NT41 and NT49. But in the string, after t68 comes t77. Hmm, so NT41 must produce t77? Let me check: NT41 is defined as NT77. Looking at the grammar, I see NT77 -> NT19 NT41. Wait, that's another production. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up NT41 and NT77. Let me clarify:\n\nThe grammar entries are:\n\nNT41 -> t77. Yes, looking here: NT41 -> t77. Okay, so NT41 directly produces t77.\n\nThen, NT49: what does NT49 produce? Let me check. In the grammar, NT49 has two productions: NT49 -> NT11 NT6 and NT49 -> t81. So NT49 can produce t81 directly or also produce NT11 and NT6.\n\nWait, my string after NT48 is t77 (from NT41) and then t26, t36. But NT41 produces t77, so the second part of the string is t77 followed by ... but NT11 cannot directly produce t26 and t36. Hmm, let me retrace.\n\nWait, S -> NT48 NT11. So after NT48 (t68) comes NT11, which is NT41 NT49. So the overall string is t68 followed by NT41, then NT49, and that should be the end. So the string after t68 would be the concatenation of NT41 and NT49's productions.\n\nBut the given string after t68 is t77, t26, t36. So t77 must come from NT41, and then t26 and t36 must come from NT49.\n\nSo, first, NT41 -> t77 (correct). Now, NT49 needs to produce t26 and t36. Let's see: looking at the grammar for NT49, it can produce either NT11 NT6 or t81.\n\nWait, t26 is a terminal, and I don't see a production in NT49 that directly leads to t26. Let me check all NT49 productions. I think NT49 can only produce t81 directly. So unless t81 is somehow breaking down into t26 and t36, which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nBut wait, let's go back. The string is t68 t77 t26 t36. So after t77 (from NT41), we have t26 and t36. So that would mean NT49 needs to produce t26 t36. But in the grammar, NT49's productions are only to NT11 NT6 or t81. So there's no way for NT49 to produce two terminals in a sequence like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way via NT49 producing NT11 and NT6 and then NT11 producing something else. But wait, NT11 is NT41 NT49 again. So perhaps I have to go deeper.\n\nLet me think: S -> NT48 NT11. NT48 -> t68. So first part is done. NT11 is NT41 NT49. So we have t68 NT41 NT49.\n\n NT41 -> t77. So now it's t68 t77 NT49.\n\n Now, NT49 can be either t81 or NT11 NT6.\n\nIf NT49 is t81, then the entire string would be t68 t77 t81, which doesn't match the given string t68 t77 t26 t36.\n\nAlternatively, NT49 can produce NT11 NT6, which is two non-terminals, so the string would be t68 t77 NT11 NT6.\n\nBut NT11 is NT41 NT49 again, which would then be t68 t77 NT41 NT49 NT49, and so on, leading to an infinite chain unless there's a way to produce terminals. However, in this case, the chain would have to produce t26 and t36 along the way. But since NT49 can only produce t81 or NT11 NT6, and no further terminals, there's no way to get t26 and t36 from this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all NT49 productions again:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT49 -> t81\n\nSo no other options. So it's impossible for NT49 to produce t26 and t36, as these are not its options.\n\nWait, but in the string after t77, we have t26 and t36. So perhaps another approach. Let me go back to NT20.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each step more carefully. Let me try to generate the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the string starts with t68, then t77, then t26, then t36.\n\nBut the string is `t68 t77 t26 t36`, which is four tokens. Let's see if that can be parsed through the grammar.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS --> NT48 NT11 --> t68 NT11\n\nNow, NT11 is NT41 NT49.\n\nSo after t68, we have NT41 NT49.\n\n NT41 --> t77\n\n So after t68, we have t77 NT49.\n\n Now, NT49 can be either t81 or NT11 NT6.\n\nIf NT49 is t81, then the string after t68 t77 is t81, giving t68 t77 t81, which is three tokens, but we need four. Also, the fourth token isn't in there.\n\nIf NT49 is NT11 NT6, then after t77 comes NT11 and NT6.\n\n Now, NT11 is NT41 NT49, leading to another recursive step, and NT6 is NT52 NT49? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, NT6 -> NT52 NT49. So NT6 would split into another NT52 and NT49, leading to an infinite chain unless... Wait, NT49's production includes NH62 or something? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, NT6 is defined as NT52 NT49. So that's two non-terminals. So NT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nBut NT52 has its own definitions, for example, NT52 -> NT14 NT32, among others.\n\nThis feels like a dead end because NT49 only produces t81 or NT11 NT6, and NT6 goes into another NT52, which leads to more non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check NT20.

{"custom_id":"request-35","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t68 t77 t31 t4` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I'm a bit fuzzy on, but I remember that CNF requires each production rule to have exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Chomsky Normal Form typically has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side has two non-terminals or a terminal, right? Or is it that each production is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals? I think I might have it mixed up. Let me check: Chomsky Normal Form has each production as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the case where a terminal is allowed. But in this grammar, looking at the productions, I don't see the terminal symbols on the left; all the left-hand sides (LHS) are non-terminals. So this grammar is in a strict form where every production is of the form NTXY \u2192 NT1, NT2, etc., except for the terminal symbols at the end. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t68 t77 t31 t4`. I think I need to parse this string into its components and see if the grammar can derive it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the productions:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must start by expanding S into NT48 and NT11. Let's see what each part generates.\n\nLooking at NT48 in the productions: I don't see NT48 being listed as a rule. Wait, the grammar seems a bit messy. Let me list the productions again to understand the dependencies better.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that many non-terminals are connected in chains, like NT55 pointing to NT21 and NT59, which further go to other non-terminals, and finally terminal symbols. The terminal symbols are things like 't76', 't30', etc. So the string starts with 't68', 't77', etc., which are terminal symbols.\n\nWait, the start symbol S produces NT48 and NT11. Let me see the productions for NT48. Scanning through, I don't see NT48 having a production. Hmm, that's odd. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The productions given start with S and other NTXx symbols, so maybe NT48 is a terminal, but I see that 't68' is part of the provided string, which seems to align with NT48 \u2192 't68' because in the production list, I see NT48 \u2192 't68'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for NT48, I see the line: NT48 \u2192 't68'. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11 will produce something like 't68' followed by whatever NT11 produces.\n\nNow, what's NT11's production? Looking through, I don't see NT11 having a rule except S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which is the starting point. But I do see later lines where NT11 appears, like in the production NT11 \u2192 't31', wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, I'm looking for NT11. I don't see that in the given productions. Hmm, the provided productions are:\n\nLooking for NT11: Scanning all the lines, I see NT11 appears on the RHS of some productions, like NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 somewhere? Or maybe not. Wait, looking through:\n\nWait, no, the provided productions don't list NT11 as a non-terminal on the LHS except in the start rule S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So perhaps NT11 is a terminal. But in the string, I see 't31' and 't4' as part of the string. Wait, but the string starts with 't68 t77 t31 t4'. Let me see:\n\nWait, according to the productions, I think the only way 't68' comes is from NT48. Then 't77' must come from somewhere else. Let me trace the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t68 t77 t31 t4`. Breaking it into individual symbols: 1: t68, 2: t77, 3: t31, 4: t4.\n\nLet me see how these can be generated.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t68, which must come from NT48. Since S starts as NT48 NT11, then the first token is t68, and the next part will be NT11's derivation.\n\nNow, what's NT11? Since the only production I see for NT11 is in the start, which is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. That doesn't help. So maybe NT11 needs to expand further. Looking through the productions, perhaps NT11 has a production, but I don't see it listed. Hmm, maybe it's a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps it can expand into something else, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let's check each non-terminal to see their possible productions. For example, NT48 \u2192 't68' is in the list. NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, because I see NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and also NT49 \u2192 ... Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT49 in the list, I see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So NT49 expands into NT11 and NT6. But how does NT11 get resolved? Since S \u2192 NT48 NT11, then NT48 is 't68', and then we have NT11. So perhaps NT11 is a terminal, but I don't see a production for NT11 in the rules. Hmm, maybe it's not a terminal. Let's check if NT11 can produce something else, but from the given productions, I only see S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So perhaps NT11 can expand into two non-terminals, but according to the list, what's NT11's production?\n\nLooking through all the production lines, I don't see NT11 on the left side of any production, except in the start rule. So maybe NT11 can only expand to something else. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all the NT11's that exist on the RHS:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13\n- NT12 \u2192 NT31 NT58\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n- NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33\n- NT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1\n- NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57\n- NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1\n- NT34 \u2192 NT9 NT14\n- NT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11\n- NT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44\n- NT1 \u2192 NT19 NT41\n- NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\n- NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35\n- NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n- NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35\n- NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57\n- NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25\n- NT37 \u2192 NT13 NT34\n- NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1\n- NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7\n- NT31 \u2192 NT8 NT35\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' also in the list.\n\nWait, in the line for NT49: NT49 \u2192 't67'? No, wait, let me check the exact lines. In the problem statement, under the grammar, there are several lines that have terminal symbols, like:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76'\nNT33 \u2192 't30'\n...\n\nSo, looking for NT11's productions, I see that line:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 is one of the productions. So NT11 can split into NT41 and NT49. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11 can lead to 't68' followed by NT11 (which is NT41 NT49). Then, each of those can potentially be further split.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't68', then we have 't77', which would come from the next production. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst token: t68, which comes from NT48.

{"custom_id":"request-50","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. The string is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t49`. I need to determine if this string is generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol doesn't have a leading space, and all terminals appear only on the right-hand side of the productions. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for systematic analysis.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that all the production rules are indeed in CNF. Each production has either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. The left-hand side symbols are all non-terminals, and terminals only appear on the right as single symbols. So that's consistent with CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t49`. All these symbols are terminals, so they must directly correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions. \n\nMy approach will be to work backwards. Starting with the start symbol S, I'll see if I can derive the string through a series of productions. Since the string starts with `t68`, I need to find a production where a terminal is `t68`. Let me scan the given productions to see which one results in `t68`.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n- `NT48 -> 't68'`\nSo, `t68` comes from NT48. That means the first symbol in the string corresponds to NT48. Therefore, the next step in the derivation should be NT48.\n\nNow, the string after `t68` is `t77 t77 t47 t49`. So, the right-hand side after NT48 must be broken down. Since NT48 is a terminal, the next part of the string must come from another non-terminal. Let's assume NT48 is followed by NT49 because the next symbol is `t77`, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must come from the immediately preceding non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so let's consider that each terminal must come from a production of a non-terminal. So, for example, the first `t68` comes from NT48. The next symbol is `t77`, which must come from another production, say NT77. But looking at the productions, I don't see any production where NT77 is on the left-hand side. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to consider that the entire string is a sequence of terminals, and each terminal must be the result of a production chain starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to start from the beginning and see if we can derive each symbol step by step.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t49`. So each of these terminals must be derived from a non-terminal production. So the first symbol is `t68`, which comes from NT48. Then, the next symbol is `t77`, but in the grammar, looking at the productions for NT, I don't see any NT77. Wait, the productions end at NT99 or something. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions, all non-terminals are names like NT followed by numbers. Let's check which NTs produce t77. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT77 is a non-terminal on the left of any production? Let me see. Scanning the productions, I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT33 NT45\n\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\n\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nNT9 -> NT25\n\nNT41 -> NT77\n\nAh, yes! NT41 -> NT77. So, NT41 can produce NT77, and NT77 is a non-terminal. Wait, but I'm looking for a production that leads to `t77` directly. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, do any of the NTs directly produce `t77`? Let's see:\n\n- NT77: Hmm, looking through, I don't see any production where NT77 is on the left. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each production line.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT33 -> 't76'\n\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nNT33 -> etc.\n\nNT41 -> NT77\n\nSo, NT41 can produce NT77. Now, does NT77 produce a terminal? Let me check the productions for NT77. Hmm, I don't see any NT77 on the left-hand side. So I must have made a mistake because the string includes `t77`, which is a terminal, so it must come from a production where the non-terminal produces it directly.\n\nWait, looking again, let's check the productions to see which NT produces `t77` directly. Scanning the list:\n\nLooking for any production where the right-hand side is `t77`. I see:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76'\n\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing `t77` as a terminal. So perhaps `t77` comes from a non-terminal that I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe I misread. Let me check each production again:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLine: NT41 -> NT77\n\nSo NT41 can produce NT77. Now, if NT77 is on the left of another production, then maybe further down the chain.\n\nWait, but the grammar has a finite number of productions, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the `t77` is the result of another production that I didn't list. Let me see the entire set of productions:\n\nThe productions are listed as:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\n\nNT58 -> NT31 NT33\n\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\n\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\n\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\n\nNT34 -> NT9 NT14\n\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11\n\nNT35 -> NT47 NT44\n\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\n\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\n\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\n\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\n\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\n\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\n\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\n\nNT37 -> NT13 NT34\n\nNT21 -> NT33 NT45\n\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\n\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\n\nNT33 -> 't76'\n\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nNT33 -> etc.\n\nWait, I see now that NT33 can produce 't76' and 't30'. But nowhere is there a production that results in 't77' directly. That means either the string isn't in the language (if that's the case), or I'm missing a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the productions.

I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form has productions where each non-terminal breaks down into two other non-terminals, except for the terminals. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the productions are like S \u2192 NT48 NT11, NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, etc. Then there are some that directly produce terminals, like NT33 -> 't76' or 't30'. So the string consists entirely of terminals, so I'll need to trace a way from the start symbol S down to these terminals.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t31 t10 t47.\n\nI need to see if each 't' in the string can be derived from a path in the grammar tree.\n\nLet me break it down step by step, from the last token backward, seeing if each can be produced by some rule.\n\nLooking at the last token, t47. I'll check the grammar to see if any rule produces t47.\n\nLooking through the productions: I see NT47 -> 't48' and 't13'\u2014wait, that's not directly t47. Wait, maybe I'm looking through all the NT production rules. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking for NT (non-terminal) -> 't47'. Yes, NT14 -> 't76', NT8 -> 't69', but nothing seems to produce t47 directly. Wait, do any have t47 as a terminal?\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT43 -> 't15', NT44 -> 't73', NT48 -> 't68', NT55 -> 't83', etc. Hmm, no, actually, looking through all the productions, I don't see any directly producing t47. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, checking NT13: NT13 -> t5. NT52 -> t37, NT59 -> t24, etc. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each production line that ends with a terminal and see if any produce t47.\n\nLooking through the list: \n\n- NT47 is only present as NT47 -> 't48' and NT47 -> 't13'. No, that's not. Wait, no, I'm looking at the rules as per the user's input. Let me check each line:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76'\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n- NT40 -> 't65'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't25'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT52 -> 't7'\nWait, no. Looking for any production that ends with 't47'.\n\nLooking through all the lines, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't47'. So maybe t47 is produced indirectly or perhaps it's not part of any production. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each non-terminal for productions ending with t47.\n\nLooking at the list, the strings are:\n\n- NT47 -> t48, t13\n- NT40 -> t65\n- NT20 -> t26, t53 (Wait, no, looking again: lines 20: NT20 -> 't26', 't53'\u2014the line says NT20 -> 't26' and 't53'? Let me check: the line says NT20 -> 't26' and 't53'\u2014is that correct? Or is it a typo? Because in the user's input, it's written as:\n\n\"NT20 -> 't26', 't53'\". So, actually, NT20 can produce either 't26' or 't53', not 't47'.\n\nLooking further, NT47 itself is a non-terminal that produces 't48' and 't13', so t47 isn't directly produced by any rule. That might be a problem because if t47 isn't a terminal in any production, how can the string contain 't47'?\n\nWait, is that possible? Maybe I missed a production. Let me go through the entire list again.\n\nScanning each line for 't47':\n\n- NT47: appears as 't48' and 't13'.\n- NT44: 't73'\n- NT42: 't55'\n- NT49: 't73'\n- NT6: 't4'\n- NT58: 't31' and 't33'\n- NT59: 't24' and 't12' (Wait, looking at NT59: the production is NT59 -> 't18', 't1'\u2014no, that's not it. Wait, looking at the lines:\n\n\"NT59 -> NT18 NT1\", which is producing t18 and t1, but the lines where NTs produce terminal t's are the ones I need to look at. Let me make a list all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76', 't30'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT29 -> 't5', 't35'\nWait, NT29: NT29 -> 't5', 't35' ?\nWait, the user's input includes:\n\n\"NT29 -> NT7 NT35\"\n\nNo, that's a production from NT29 to non-terminals, not terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-72","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are quite complex, so I'll need to take it step by step. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where a production might be A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see several terminals and non-terminals. The terminals seem to be strings starting with 't' followed by numbers, like 't68', 't77', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t10 t81`. It's a sequence of six tokens, each starting with 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The initial production from S is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the string must be built by expanding S into NT48 and NT11. Let's see what NT48 and NT11 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT48's production: NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT28. So, NT44 and NT28. Next, I need to see what each of these can produce.\n\nNT44 has a production: NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13. Let's track NT42 and NT13.\n\nNT42: NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25.\n\nNT55: NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59.\n\nWait, so NT55 expands into NT21 and NT59. Let's check NT21 and NT59.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45.\n\nNT33 has two productions: NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'. So, either 't76' or 't30' there.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1. So, NT29 and NT1.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35.\n\nNT7: NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43.\n\nNT12: NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32.\n\nAnd so on. This seems complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this from the string upwards, trying to match it to the grammar.\n\nThe string is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t10 t81`. Let's reverse it to see possible derivation steps. Alternatively, maybe build the parse tree from the bottom up.\n\nWait, another approach: let's check if each token in the string can be derived directly from any non-terminal. For example, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, then matching that terminal would allow us to work towards the root.\n\nLooking at 't68'\u2014is there a non-terminal that can produce 't68'? Looking through the productions, I see NT48 \u2192 't68'? Wait no, looking again: in the grammar, I see NT48 is used in the production S \u2192 NT48 NT11. But looking through the productions, I don't see NT48 directly producing a terminal. Actually, in the productions, I see NT48 is involved in other productions, but I don't see NT48 \u2192 't68'.

Wait, no, looking through the grammar:\n\nWait, let me check each production line:\n\nAh, in the grammar, under NT40: NT40 \u2192 't65'. So, NT40 produces 't65'. Under NT18: NT18 \u2192 't69'. NT48: S \u2192 NT48 NT11.

{"custom_id":"request-76","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a where 'a' is a terminal symbol. Also, I notice that S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is the start symbol, meaning the entire derivation starts from S.\n\nNow, the string we need to evaluate is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t37 t47`. Each word in the string is a terminal symbol. Our task is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see several rules where non-terminals are broken down into other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, and some rules lead directly to terminals like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'. \n\nStarting from S, the first expansion is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, we need to see if NT48 and NT11 can expand into the first two 't's in the string. Let's check NT48.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT48 \u2192 't68'. Perfect, so NT48 can directly produce 't68'. Now, the second element in the string is 't77'. Let's look at where 't77' comes from.\n\nIn the grammar, NT49 \u2192 't77' appears as one of the options. So, if NT49 is the non-terminal that expands to 't77', that works. But where does NT49 come from? Let's backtrack.\n\nLooking back, NT48 is part of the S rule, so after NT48, we have NT11. Let's see what NT11 can produce. Checking the grammar, I find NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, NT11 expands into NT41 and NT49.\n\nNow, looking at the string, after 't68', we have 't77', which is 't77'. So, the second element 't77' must come from NT11's expansion. Since NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, we can think of this as the second 't77' coming from NT49. Wait, that doesn't make sense because NT49 would produce a single 't77' via its rule. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, actually, the string starts with 't68' (from NT48), followed by 't77'. So the second position is 't77'. Let me check what NT11 can produce. NT11 has the rule NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. NT41 can be checked for its rules. From the grammar, NT41 \u2192 't77'. So, NT41 is 't77'. Similarly, NT49 can be 't77' as per another rule, but also can produce other things, like 't31' or 't7'.\n\nWait, I think I might have mixed up something here. Let me clarify. The string is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t37 t47`.\n\nSo, starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nNT48 \u2192 't68' (so first 't68' matches the first symbol)\n\nThen, NT11 needs to expand into the rest. Let's see.\n\nNT11 can expand into NT41 NT49, per the rule NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Now, looking at the next symbols after 't68', the string is 't77 t77 t47 t37 t47'. So, we have to see if NT11 can produce these symbols in sequence.\n\nSo, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Now, the next symbol is 't77', so perhaps NT41 \u2192 't77'. Checking the grammar, yes: NT41 \u2192 't77'. So, NT41 gives 't77', and now the next symbol is another 't77'. So, that would mean NT49 must produce 't77' for the next symbol. But wait, from NT11, after NT41, we have NT49, which would produce the third symbol. That doesn't fit because we have three 't77's? Wait, no, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no, the string is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t37 t47`. So, after NT48 ('t68'), NT11 expands into NT41 and NT49. So:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't77' (symbol 2)\n\nThen, NT49 must expand into the next symbols. Let's look at NT49's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT49 has the rule \u2192 NT11 NT6, and also \u2192 NT6, and also \u2192 't49'. Hmm, wait, actually, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT49, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nBut also, looking further, I see NT49 \u2192 't77'? Or is that a different rule? Let me look again.\n\nWait, no, under NT49, I don't immediately see a rule for NT49 \u2192 't77'. Let me check all the entries for NT49:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, the only direct productions for NT49 are:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT6\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't49'\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I just rechecked, and I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT6\n\nand then another rule? Let me scan through:\n\nLooking at NT49, I see it's only defined as \u2192 NT11 NT6 and \u2192 NT6. There's no direct rule for NT49 \u2192 't77' or 't49'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the rules were a bit scattered. Let me parse the grammar section again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, under NT49, the rules are:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo, yes, there's a direct rule NT49 \u2192 't77' which I missed earlier. So, NT49 can produce 't77' or 't4' or others? Wait, no, under NT49, the direct rules are:\n\n1. NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\n2. NT49 \u2192 NT6\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the actual rules for NT49 are:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT49 -> NT6\n\nWait, no, wait, let me find all the lines in the grammar that involve NT49:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT49 -> NT6\n\nWait, but earlier in the problem, I might have misread the grammar rules. Let me re-examine the entire grammar.\n\nWait, the given grammar is:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\n\nNT58 -> NT31 NT33\n\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\n\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\n\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\n\nNT34 -> NT9 NT14\n\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11\n\nNT35 -> NT47 NT44\n\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\n\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\n\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\n\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\n\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\n\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\n\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\n\nNT37 -> NT13 NT34\n\nNT21 -> NT33 NT45\n\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\n\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\n\nNT33 -> 't76'\n\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nNT40 -> 't65'\n\nNT20 -> 't26'\n\nNT9 -> 't25'\n\nNT41 -> 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-93","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the string \"t68 t77 t77 t31 t49 t55 t47\" is generated by the given grammar. First, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is a non-terminal breaking into two non-terminals or a terminal. That should help because we can apply the CYK algorithm or at least follow the rules step by step.\n\nThe string has seven tokens: t68, t77, t77, t31, t49, t55, t47. Each of these is a terminal symbol except for t, which might be part of a larger chain. Wait, no, in the grammar, the terminals are sequences like 't76', 't30', 't65', etc. So each token in the string must correspond to a terminal in the grammar or be part of a production.\n\nLet me list out all the possible non-terminals and their productions to see how they can derive into the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT48 NT11. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Each of those must, in turn, be produced by other non-terminals.\n\nLet's see what NT48 and NT11 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT48 \u2192 t68. So NT48 is a non-terminal that can directly produce 't68'. That matches the first token in the string.\n\nNow, NT11: Checking the rules, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Okay, so NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49. Both of these need to produce t77 and t49 respectively, but let's check each.\n\nNT41 \u2192 t77? Looking through the grammar, yes, NT41 \u2192 't77'. Perfect, so NT41 can produce 't77'.\n\nNow, looking at NT49 \u2192 't49'? Wait, in the grammar, NT49 \u2192 't49'? Let me check: Yes, there's a production NT49 \u2192 't49'. So that's correct.\n\nSo far, the first three tokens (t68, t77, t77) correspond to S \u2192 NT48 (t68) \u2192 NT11 \u2192 NT41 (t77) and NT49 (t77). Wait, but NT49 is 't49', but the second token after 't68' is 't77', but the third is also 't77'. Hmm, wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the first token is t68, which is from NT48. Then, NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49. The second token is 't77', which could be NT41. The third token is another 't77', which could be NT49. So that fits.\n\nWait a minute, but NT49 is 't49', so the third token should be t49. But in the string, it's t77. Wait, that's a problem. Let's double-check.\n\nLooking again: The string is t68 t77 t77 t31 t49 t55 t47.\n\nSo after t68 comes t77, t77, t31, t49, t55, t47.\n\nPreviously, I thought that NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49. So the first step is S \u2192 NT48 (t68) and NT11 \u2192 NT41 (t77) and NT49. So the string starts with t68 followed by t77 and then t77, which would mean that the second token is NT41 (t77) and the third is NT49 (t49), but the string shows t77 again. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different way to parse it. Perhaps the NT11 production leads to more non-terminals that can derive t77 again. For instance, maybe another production of NT11 that leads to t77 again.\n\nLooking back, NT11 only has one production: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So it can only produce t77 (from NT41) and t49 (from NT49). So how does the string have t77 twice after the initial t68? That's a problem because after S, it would go NT48 \u2192 t68, and then NT11 \u2192 t77 and t49. But the string has two t77's before t31.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying NT11's production. Let me look again. S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So S produces two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. So when we apply these, the string would have two parts: the first part is derived from NT48 and the second from NT11. But since NT48 produces t68, the first token is t68, and then NT11 needs to produce the remaining string split in some way.\n\nWait, but the string is seven tokens, so perhaps the way to parse it is that NTS48 produces t68, and then NT11 needs to produce the remaining six tokens. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps NT11's production is more complex. Let me think again. NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo the entire string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT48 and NT11. Since NT48 is just t68, the string starts with t68, and the rest comes from NT11's derivation.\n\nBut the string after t68 is t77, t77, t31, t49, t55, t47. So we need to see if NT11 can derive this substring.\n\nSo, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nNow, NT41 \u2192 t77, and NT49 \u2192 t49. So in that case, NT11 produces t77 and t49, which would make the second part of the string as t77 followed by t49. But in the given string, it's t77, t77, t31, t49, etc. So that can't directly be the case, as the second token would need to be followed by more.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps I should use the CYK algorithm.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible terminals in the string and their positions.\n\nString: 1: t68, 2: t77, 3: t77, 4: t31, 5: t49, 6: t55, 7: t47.\n\nNow, we can list all the non-terminals that can produce these terminals directly. From the grammar:\n\nt68 comes from NT48.\n\nt77 comes from NT41, NT77? Wait, in the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t77. Yes.\n\nt31 comes from NT31 \u2192 t31? Or wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT31 directly producing t31. Let me check. Wait, in the given grammar, NT31 has some productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT31 \u2192 NT8 NT35, NT20 NT8, NT32 NT35, etc. So NT31 doesn't directly produce t31. Wait, that seems off. Because in the given grammar, the terminals are specific, like 't76', 't30', 't65', etc., and other NTs have different productions.\n\nWait, perhaps some terminal symbols are derived from multiple non-terminals. For example, 't76' is derived only from NT33, 't30' from NT30, and so on.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs have productions that only result in terminals. For example:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't49', NOT NT49 \u2192 't49'? Wait, no, the productions for NT49 are only:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't49'. So when you look up NT49, it only can produce 't49'.\n\nSimilarly, NT41 \u2192 't77'.\n\nNT77? Is there a NT77? No, I don't think so. Wait, looking at the given grammar, no NTs have been defined as NT77. Instead, we have NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30', and other NTs produce different terminals.\n\nSo, in this context, the terminals are:\n\n- 't68' \u2192 NT48\n- 't77' \u2192 NT41\n- 't49' \u2192 NT49\n- 't47' \u2192 NT44. Wait, looking at NT44, do we have any production that results in 't47'? Let me check: NT44 \u2192 NT12, NT57. No, but wait, in the grammar, NT44 is followed by different things.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of six tokens: t68, t77, t31, t55, t31, t55, t47. That's seven t's with numbers. Let me count them again to make sure I got it right: t68, t77, t31, t55, t31, t55, t47 \u2013 so seven tokens. Wait, the user wrote the string as `t68 t77 t31 t55 t31 t55 t47`, which is seven separators, making eight tokens? Wait no, looking again: the string is `t68 t77 t31 t55 t31 t55 t47` which has seven t tokens: t68, t77, t31, t55, t31, t55, t47. Let me check the grammar to see which non-terminals produce these t's.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can find the productions that generate t's:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76' or 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't84' or 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't76'\n- NT49 -> 't81'\n- NT13 -> 't5'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT11 -> 't31'\n- NT55 -> 't83'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT37 -> 't32'\n- NT9 -> 't25'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT52 -> 't7' or 't10'\n\nI think the string has seven t tokens, so the parse tree should have seven leaves corresponding to these t's. Let's try to build a parse tree for this string.\n\nStarting with the top-level non-terminal, which in the given grammar is S. The S production is S -> NT48 NT11. Let me check the S rule.\n\nS -> NT48 NT11. So, S is split into two parts: NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48: Do I see any rules where NT48 is on the left side? Scanning through the grammar, I don't see NT48 as a non-terminal on the left side of any production. Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps S is splitting into NT48, which doesn't exist in the grammar. That suggests that maybe the starting symbol is different. Or maybe I made a mistake in the given grammar. Wait, the given grammar starts with S, so S must be the start symbol.\n\nWait, wait, in the grammar, S is a non-terminal. So for the parse to proceed, the first step is S -> NT48 NT11. But if NT48 isn't defined anywhere, that would mean that S can't produce this string at all. But maybe I'm misreading the grammar.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT48 appears in the productions as a right-hand side, for example, in S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, to produce S, we need NT48 and NT11. So first, I need to see what NT48 and NT11 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT48: Is there any production for NT48? Let me scan the rules:\n\nYes, for example, NT53 -> 't12', NT6 -> 't4', etc. Wait, I don't see NT48 in any rules except perhaps in the list of non-terminals, but looking back, let's check:\n\nOh, wait, in the grammar, under NT48, I see that's actually under the non-terminals: for example, NT53, NT6, etc. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let's re-examine the list of non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT48 is listed as a terminal? Wait, no, the grammar lists non-terminals as NT followed by a number. So NT48 is one of the non-terminals.\n\nBut when scanning the grammar rules, the productions for NT33, NT30, etc., but I don't see any production where NT48 is on the left side. So that would mean that NT48 doesn't have any rule, which suggests that S cannot be derived because it requires NT48. But that can't be right because the user provided the string to evaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps S is split into two parts, and one of them is a terminal? But S is a non-terminal, so it must produce two other non-terminals. Because the grammar is in CNF, so all productions have at most two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nWait, S->NT48 NT11: So when deriving S, we have to replace NT48 and NT11 with something. But NT48 isn't a non-terminal; perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar has a typo, and one of the rules is written incorrectly. Because otherwise, S can't start if it needs to split into NT48 and NT11, which themselves don't produce terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the non-terminals and their productions. Let me try to list all the non-terminals and their productions to find if there's a path leading to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that some of these non-terminals produce t's through multiple steps. For example, NT11 could produce NT41 and NT6, then NT41 could produce other non-terminals that eventually become t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nGiven the string is `t68 t77 t31 t55 t31 t55 t47`.\n\nEach t is a terminal symbol, so these must be generated by non-terminals. So the parse would start with S -> NT48 NT11. Now, both NT48 and NT11 must be decomposed into the string.\n\nBut wait, let's check if ND48 and NT11 can produce the first t. Wait, but NT48 is a non-terminal in the starting production, but if NT48 doesn't have any production, then this would be impossible. So perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking again, the rule definitions:\n\n- NT53 -> 't12', but I don't see 't12' in the string. Wait, in the given string, I have t76, t30, etc. Wait, no, the string is t68, t77, t31, t55, t31, t55, t47.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I don't see any NT producing t77. The only NT that produce t's are those that have 't' in their productions. Let me list the NT's and their possible t outputs:\n\n- NT33 -> 't76' or 't30'\n- NT30 -> 't84' or 't22'\n- NT14 -> 't76'\n- NT49 -> 't81'\n- NT13 -> 't5'\n- NT55 -> 't83'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT37 -> 't32'\n- NT9 -> 't25'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT52 -> 't7' or 't10'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT52 -> 't25'\n- NT37 -> 't32'\n- NT31 -> 't8' if it has a production (Wait, checking: under NT31, I see NT53 and NT33. Wait, under NT31, I think the rule is NT31 -> NT8 NT35, and NT35 -> 't3' and others. Wait no, in the given grammar, looking back:\n\nNT33 -> 't76' or 't30'\n\nLooking through the list again, maybe I missed some rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-111","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, a single non-terminal, or a combination of two non-terminals. Each production on the right side of the arrow has exactly two parts, so that's helpful.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is: `t68 t77 t77 t81 t55 t26 t37 t55`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminal strings directly. For example, NT33 can produce 't73' or 't30'. Similarly, NT12 can produce 't37', and many others produce terminals like 't26', 't53', etc.\n\nLet's start from the beginning of the string and see if each 't' corresponds to a production.\n\n1. The first 't68' in the string: Looking at the grammar, NT48 -> 't68'. So S starts with NT48 NT11. Our first symbol is t68, which matches NT48. Now our remaining part after t68 would be whatever NT48 produces, but wait, NT48 is a terminal 't68', so after that, the next part is NT11. So after t68 comes t77, which must come from NT11.\n\n2. The next symbols are t77 t77. So NT11 produces t77. Wait, looking back, NT11 is defined as NT41 NT49. So NT11 expands into two parts. So that means the first 't68 t77' comes from NT48 and NT41 NT49.\n\nWait, no. S is NT48 NT11. NT48 is 't68', and NT11 is the next non-terminal. So after t68, the NT11 must produce t77.\n\nLooking at NT11's production: NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So it's two non-terminals. That would expand into two parts. So t77 should come from either NT41 or NT49. Let me check what NT41 and NT49 produce.\n\nNT41 -> 't77'. So that's a terminal. So NT41 is 't77'. NT49 is another non-terminal.\n\nSo the next part after t68 is NT48 -> t68, then NT11 is split into NT41 (t77) and NT49. That gives us t68 t77 so far, which matches the first two symbols of the string.\n\nNow moving on. The string is t68 t77 t77 t81 t55 t26 t37 t55.\n\nWe have t68 (NT48) followed by t77 (NT41). Now, the next symbols should come from the expansion of NT49.\n\nNT49's production is NT11 NT6. So NT49 is two non-terminals: NT11 and NT6.\n\nLooking at NT11, we've already determined it's 't77'. So NT11 as 't77' gives us t77. Now NT6: Looking at the grammar, NT6 -> 't4'. So NT6 is 't4'. That would give us t77 t4 after the initial t68 t77.\n\nWait, but the string after t68 is t77 t77. So after t68 t77 comes another t77. So maybe I missed something here.\n\nWait, the initial string is t68, t77, t77, ... So after t68, we have t77, which is from NT41. Then the next t77 must come from NT49's production, which is NT11 NT6. But NT11 is 't77', so that gives us t77 followed by t4. But in the string, the third symbol is t77. So after t68 t77 t77, it would be t77 (from NT11) and then t4 (from NT6). But the string has t77, not t77 t4. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to reevaluate the structure. Let's consider S -> NT48 NT11. So after t68, we have the NT11 part.\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nNT41 is t77, and NT49 is NT11 NT6. So NT49 would be t77 (NT41) followed by 't4' (NT6). So overall, the expansion of NT11 is t77 t77 t4. But in the string, after t68, we have t77 t77. So perhaps the expansion of NT49 is two parts: NT11 and NT6, which expand to t77 and t4. So overall, NT11 would produce t77 t4, making the string t68 t77 t4. But the given string is t68 t77 t77. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the NT49 production is NT11 and NT6, but NT11 is 't77' and NT6 is 't4', so their combination would produce t77 t4. So when NT11 expands, it's t77 t4, so the first three symbols after t68 would be t77 t4. But in the string, after t68, it's t77 t77. So that doesn't align. So perhaps the string isn't being generated correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reevaluate the structure. Let me try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be generated by S -> NT48 NT11, then NT48 is t68, NT11 is two parts: NT41 (t77) and NT49. NT49 is NT11 (t77) and NT6 (t4). So the expansion would be t68, t77, t77, t4. But the string is t68, t77, t77, t81, ... So that doesn't match. Hmm, so maybe the string isn't generated this way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT11 in S is splitting into other symbols. Let me try to map the string step by step.\n\nString: t68 t77 t77 t81 t55 t26 t37 t55\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. t68 -> NT48.\n\n2. The next part is NT11. NT11 is NT41 NT49. NT41 is t77. Then NT49 is NT11 NT6. So the next part is NT41 (t77) and NT49 (which is NT11 (t77) and NT6 (t4)). So after t68, we have t77, then t77, then t4. But in the string, after t68 comes t77, then another t77, then t81. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT11 is contributing something else. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step where the grammar allows for a different expansion path. Let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production of NT11 is followed by something else. Let me check NT11's production again: NT11 -> NT41 NT49. NT41 is a terminal 't77'. NT49 is NT11 NT6, which would be 't77' and 't4', so 't77t4'.\n\nSo the expansion of NT11 is t77 t77 t4. But our string has t68 t77 t77 t81..., which doesn't match. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial breakdown. Let me see the string again: t68 t77 t77 t81 t55 t26 t37 t55.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different production for S or some other non-terminal that I'm not considering. Alternatively, maybe a different path in the grammar.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way for the string to expand. Perhaps after NT48 (t68) and NT11, we have a different production for NT11.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT11 can only produce NT41 NT49. So it's not a terminal; it's another non-terminal that expands into four symbols (two production parts).\n\nSo after t68, the next part should be a production of NT11, which is t77 (from NT41) followed by NT49.\n\nNow, NT49 is NT11 NT6, which is t77 followed by t4.\n\nSo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So the entire string must be formed by replacing S with something that leads to all these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t68. So let's see which non-terminal produces t68.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT48 \u2192 t68. So NT48 directly produces t68. That's good. So the first part checks out.\n\nNext, we have t77. Let's look for a non-terminal that produces t77. Checking the list, I see NT49 \u2192 t47, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking again, I see NT77? No, wait, looking through, I don't see NT77 as a terminal. Hmm, wait no, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me look through all the rules for terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT33 \u2192 't73', but I'm looking for t77. Hmm, wait, I see NT49 \u2192 t47, which is part of an earlier line, but that's a production that produces a terminal, t47. So perhaps I need to see which non-terminals produce t77.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a direct production for t77. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again. Looking through the list:\n\nI see NT6 \u2192 't4'; NT14 \u2192 't76'; NT16 \u2192 't26'; NT20 \u2192 't26'; NT28 \u2192 't59'; NT29 \u2192 't5'; NT30 \u2192 't84'; NT33 \u2192 't73'; NT35 \u2192 't27'; NT37 \u2192 't32'; NT40 \u2192 't28'; NT41 \u2192 't77'; NT42 \u2192 't55'; NT43 \u2192 't55'; NT44 \u2192 't66'; NT47 \u2192 't48'; NT49 \u2192 't47'; NT52 \u2192 't7'; NT55 \u2192 't72'; NT59 \u2192 't24'; NT60? No, not in the list; NT7 \u2192 't53'; NT12 \u2192 't37', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I missed one. Let's check all the rules where a terminal is listed:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't73'\n- NT33 \u2192 't30'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT11 \u2192 't31'\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'\n- NT16 \u2192 't26'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT28 \u2192 't59'\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't84'\n- NT33 \u2192 't73', 't30'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT39 \u2192 't40'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT42 \u2192 't55'\n- NT44 \u2192 't66'\n- NT47 \u2192 't48'\n- NT52 \u2192 't7', 't58', 't37', 't55', etc.?\nWait, looking again, some non-terminals have multiple rules. For example, NT52:\n- NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32\n- NT52 \u2192 NT18 NT1\n- NT52 \u2192 NT25 NT59\n- NT52 \u2192 NT25 NT58\nWait, but above, I see lines like:\n- NT52 -> NT14 NT32\n- NT52 -> NT18 NT1\n- NT52 -> NT25 NT59\n- NT42 -> NT55 NT25\nWait, but in the terminals, NT52 has two rules:\n- NT52 \u2192 't7'\n- NT52 \u2192 't58'\nHmm, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, I see:\nNT52 has two production rules leading to terminals:\n- NT52 -> 't7'\n- NT52 -> 't58'\nSo that means NT52 can produce either 't7' or 't58'. So in the string, I see a 't7' and a 't58' perhaps?\n\nWait, in the string, the 5th element is t7, the 6th is t77, 7th is t47, 8th is t4.\n\nSo the string is in the order: t68, t77, t77, t47, t7, t77, t47, t4.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nThe first symbol is t68, which is from NT48 \u2192 t68, so that's good.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t77. So the next non-terminal is NT11. So NT11 needs to produce t77.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT11:\nLooking through the rules, lines starting with NT11:\n\n- NT11 -> NT41 NT6\n- NT11 -> NT49 NT6\n- NT11 -> NT41 NT6\nSo NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT6.\n\nWait, but t77 is a terminal, so how does NT11 produce t77? Because in the grammar, non-terminals may only produce other non-terminals or terminals, but in this case, I don't see NT11 directly producing t77. So perhaps I missed a rule for NT11.\n\nWait, looking again through the rules, I see lines like NT33 \u2192 't73', but for NT11, do any of the production rules produce a terminal?\n\nWait, looking through all the rules again, I don't see a direct production for NT11 that produces a terminal. So that's a problem. Because if NT11 can't produce t77, then this path doesn't work.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the rules again for NT11:\n\nLooking through, the lines for NT11 are:\n- NT11 -> NT41 NT6\n- NT11 -> NT49 NT6\n- NT11 -> NT41 NT6\n\nSo all the productions for NT11 are to other non-terminals. So NT11 cannot directly produce a terminal like t77. That's a problem because the second token is t77, which must be produced by NT11.\n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's reevaluate:\n\nThe string is t68 t77 t77 t47 t7 t77 t47 t4.\n\nThe first token is t68 (from NT48), then the next is t77, which would come from NT11. But since NT11 only has non-terminals, that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, maybe I should look into how S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so the first symbol is NT48, which is t68, then the next symbols are derived from NT11.\n\nSo the second symbol is t77, which must come from NT11. But NT11 doesn't produce t77 directly. So unless the productions of NT11 can somehow produce t77 through other non-terminals, but that would require more steps, which might not fit in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Let's try to build the parse tree.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t68. So that's the first symbol, which matches.\n\nNow"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-128","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember is a specific way where each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. \n\nThe grammar provided is pretty long, with various non-terminals and production rules leading down to terminal symbols, which are labeled 't' followed by numbers. The string I need to evaluate is `t68 t77 t77 t77 t47 t4 t7 t26 t28`. \n\nFirst, I should probably parse the string and see if it can be built up from the start symbol S using the given rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step should either split a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminal symbols, so I need to see if each of these can be generated by the grammar. Let me break down the string into individual tokens: t68, t77, t77, t77, t47, t4, t7, t26, t28.\n\nI'll start from the beginning of the string and try to match it against the grammar, starting with the start symbol S. The first production rule is S -> NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols should come from NT48 and NT11.\n\nThe first symbol is t68. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT48 -> t68. So that matches. So the first part is t68, which comes from NT48.\n\nNext, the second part of S is NT11. The next token is t77. So does NT11 produce t77? Looking at the grammar, I see NT11 -> NT41 NT49. Oh, that's two non-terminals, not a terminal. Hmm, but the next token is a terminal. That might be a problem. Did I get this right?\n\nWait, no\u2014the production for NT11 is NT11 -> NT41 NT49, which is two non-terminals. But in the string, after t68 comes t77, which is a terminal. That might be a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the order.\n\nWait, S is NT48 followed by NT11. So the string starts with t68 (from NT48). Then the next part is NT11, which is supposed to be followed by another symbol. But in the string, after t68 comes t77, which should come from NT11's production.\n\nWait, perhaps the second part of S is NT11, which expands to NT41 and NT49. So the initial part of the string is t68 (NT48), then after that, the NT11 should expand into two parts. So the next tokens should be the two non-terminals produced by NT11. \n\nWait, let's clarify. The string is t68, t77, t77, t77, t47, t4, t7, t26, t28. So after t68 (NT48), the next token is t77. So looking at NT11, its production is NT41 NT49. Are either of these terminals? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT41 -> t77. Oh, yes! NT41 is a non-terminal that produces t77. Similarly, NT49 is another non-terminal that also produces t77, I believe. Let me check NT49's production.\n\nWait, NT49's production: NT49 -> NT11 NT6. Wait, that's two non-terminals. But NT6 -> t4. So yes, NT49 can produce strings ending with t4 when followed by NT11 and NT6. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's take it step by step.\n\n1. S starts with NT48 NT11. NT48 -> t68. So the first symbol is matched.\n\nNow, the next part is NT11. NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So the next two tokens should be from NT41 and NT49.\n\n2. The second token in the string is t77. Does NT41 produce t77? Looking at NT41's production rule: NT41 -> t77. Yes. So the next symbol is matched.\n\n3. Next token is another t77. This should come from NT49. Let's see what NT49 produces. NT49 -> NT11 NT6. Both of these are non-terminals. So the token after should be NT11 producing t77 (from the first step) and NT6 producing t4. But the next token in the string is t77 again. Wait, but NT6 produces t4, which is a terminal. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Let's try to expand NT49.\n\nAfter NT48, NT11 expands to NT41 (t77) and NT49. So now, after the first t68, the next symbols should be t77 (from NT41) and then something from NT49.\n\nLooking at the string: after t68, t77, t77, t77. So after the first t77 (from NT41), the next token is t77, which should come from NT49.\n\nSo the third token in the string is t77, which is the first part of NT49's production (as NT49 -> NT11 and NT6). So let's see: NT49 produces a sequence that starts with NT11 and NT6. But both are non-terminals, so the next tokens should be parts of those.\n\nWait, but the string has t77 as the third token, which might correspond to NT11's production as t77. But let's see: NT11 is already a non-terminal, but in this case, we're already in NT49's production.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step, applying the grammar rules from the bottom up.\n\nLet me list the tokens: [t68, t77, t77, t77, t47, t4, t7, t26, t28]\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT48 NT11. So the first symbol is t68 (NT48), and the second symbol comes from NT11. So after t68, the next should be the result of NT11's production.\n\nBut NT11 is a non-terminal that can only be split into two parts: NT41 and NT49. So after t68, the next two symbols must come from NT41 and NT49. But in the string, after t68, the next two are t77 and t77. So let's check if NT41 can produce t77, which it does (NT41 -> t77). Then, nt11's production is NT41 NT49, but the third symbol in the string is t77 again, which has to come from NT49.\n\nWait, but NT49's production is NT11 NT6, which are both non-terminals. So then, after t68 (NT48), we have NT41 (t77) and NT49. Now, NT49 needs to expand. So the next symbol after t77 should come from NT41's expansion (wait, no\u2014NT49 comes right after NT41). Hmm, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long or too short, but I should calculate the length. The string has 9 symbols. Starting from S, each production step either adds one symbol (if it's a terminal) or two (if it's a non-terminal). Wait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form requires each production to be a non-terminal to two non-terminals, or a non-terminal to a terminal. But in this case, the grammar allows for terminals only in some productions.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the start symbol S is followed by two non-terminals: S -> NT48 NT11. Then, NT48 can produce t68, so the first token is matched. Then, NT11 is split into NT41 and NT49. So the next two tokens must come from NT41 and NT49.\n\nLet me map the string step by step.\n\nPosition 0: t68 (matches NT48)\nPosition 1: t77 (must come from NT41)\nPosition 2: t77 (must come from NT49)\nPosition 3: t77 (but wait, after position 2, does the next token get split?)\n\nWait, this isn't making sense. Let me think differently. Each production can only handle two non-terminals at a time, but when a terminal is encountered, it must have that terminal as the next token. \n\nLet me attempt a parse tree:\n\nS"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-132","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t7 t31 t10 t26 t36`. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. That should help in parsing the string since each step of parsing involves substituting non-terminals with pairs of symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that all the production rules start with a capital letter on the left and either production on the right, and many of them produce two symbols: either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, etc. Wait, actually, checking the grammar, each production seems to have exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, some being terminals and some non-terminals. So that aligns with CNF, except for the terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, the right-hand side can have only terminals or one non-terminal, but in this case, sometimes it's a combination, like S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Hmm, wait, no, actually in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right, which could be terminals or non-terminals. So production rules that produce two terminals would effectively be a direct terminal symbol. But in this case, the initial grammar's right-hand sides are usually two symbols, sometimes both non-terminals or a mix.\n\nSo the given grammar is in CNF as per the productions provided. The next thing is to parse the string using this grammar. Let me think about how to approach the parsing.\n\nParsing in CNF is typically done with a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm, but since the string is short, maybe I can manually check or see through it.\n\nThe string given is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t7 t31 t10 t26 t36`. So it's a sequence of terminals. I need to see if this can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the production rules that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice some rules produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't73'\n- NT33 \u2192 't7'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT11 \u2192 't31'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT26 \u2192 I don't see it here; wait, let me scan through.\n\nOh, looking at the terminal productions:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't7' or 't73'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT11 \u2192 't31'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT14 \u2192 't42' (Wait, no, NT14 is a non-terminal, looking back. Oh, I see NT14 is an NT, but looking at the terminals, let me check each:\n\nLooking through each NT rule, I see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 t7 or t73\nNT49 \u2192 t81\nNT41 \u2192 t77\nNT31 \u2192 t8 or t35\nNT11 \u2192 t31\nNT20 \u2192 t26\nNT26 isn't a terminal, it's part of a production. Wait, which NTs lead to terminals?\n\nSo let me list each NT and see if they produce a terminal:\n\n- NT33: 't7' and 't73' (terminals)\n- NT49: 't81' (terminal)\n- NT41: 't77' (terminal)\n- NT31: produces t8 or t35, so not a terminal\n- NT11: t31 (terminal)\n- NT19: ? Wait, looking for all NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look at each production and see if the right-hand side can generate a terminal. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the given string and see how the symbols can be derived.\n\nThe string is t68 t77 t77 t47 t7 t31 t10 t26 t36.\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol. So I need to produce all of them via the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step uses two symbols, but the derivation can involve multiple steps.\n\nLet me try building the parse tree from the end.\n\nI know that the top-level symbol is S, which produces NT48 and NT11. So the entire string must derive from S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nLooking at the first symbol of the string: t68. So perhaps NT48 \u2192 t68. Looking at the grammar, does any rule have NT48 on the left producing t68? Let me check the NT48 rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1\n- NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57\n- etc. Wait, I'm looking for NT48, right? Wait, no, the NT48 is not a non-terminal; in the initial production, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So wait, maybe the grammar has a typo, but in any case, let me check the rules for NT48.\n\nWait, looking through all the NT symbols, I don't see any rule with NT48 on the left. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, looking through all the rules again:\n\nI see NT33 has two terminal options, but NT48 isn't among the variables. Hmm. Oh wait, the production S \u2192 NT48 NT11 suggests that NT48 is on the left, but in the grammar provided, I don't see any NT48 production. Did I list all correctly?\n\nWait, looking at the initial list, after NT39, there's NT33, then NT33 again, and so on. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through all the NTs listed.\n\nAh, I see a rule like NT48: No, actually, looking at the initial section, it says:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT48. Let me recheck:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo S produces NT48 and NT11. So in the parsing process, S's first symbol would be generated by NT48 and the second by NT11.\n\nWait, but looking through all the NTs, I don't see any rule where NT48 is on the left producing anything. The NTs are like NT1, NT2, etc., up to NT59. I don't see NT48.\n\nSo that suggests that the initial S production might not be present, meaning that the given string cannot start with t68 because there's no NT48 rule to produce t68. Therefore, that would immediately mean the string is invalid, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar step by step, I see:\n\nThe first line is S -> NT48 NT11\n\nThen NT33 has rules to 't73' and 't7'.\n\nWait, but does any NT48 exist? Going through the list, for NT48, I don't see any rule with NT48 on the left. Maybe a typo? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT48 is actually a typo and should be something else, but maybe I should continue. Alternatively, perhaps each NT is like a non-terminal that can be further broken down.\n\nWait, considering that the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would require that NT48 can produce t68 or something else. Since it's not present, the string starts with t68, but NT48 cannot derive that, so the string cannot be generated, which would make the answer No.\n\nBut wait, maybe NT48 can be broken down further. For example, perhaps NT48 is a combination of other non-terminals that can produce t68 through intermediate steps. But looking back, I don't see any rule that defines NT48 on the left, so that can't be the case. So if S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and that NT48 can't produce t68, then the string can't start with t68, so the entire string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying NT48. Let me check each line carefully to see if there's an NT48.\n\nLooking through the list of NTs:\n\nLooking for where the left-hand side starts with NT48. I don't see any line where NT48 \u2192 ... So that would mean that S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is a production, but NT48 doesn't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-154","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me see. First, I need to understand the grammar and figure out how to derive or parse the string step by step. The grammar starts with S and each production seems to be binomial, which probably restricts the way the string can be built.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is rewritten as NT48 NT11. So the first thing that happens is S becomes two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. Then, each of these non-terminals can be further expanded. Let's write out the string to see its components: t68 t77 t77 t31 t55 t47 t25 t26 t37 t55.\n\nI think I'll approach this by working backward from the string, trying to factor it into the productions. Alternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree step by step. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which are the base cases.\n\nLet me list out the string tokens: 10 tokens. The string is t68 t77 t77 t31 t55 t47 t25 t26 t37 t55.\n\nI need to see which of these tokens are terminals and which can be derived from the grammar. Wait, actually, all the tokens look like they're terminating in the grammar, so maybe all are terminals except for the non-terminals we need to expand.\n\nWait, but the string is supposed to be generated by the grammar, so each token must match a terminal production or be part of a non-terminal's expansion. Looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals have productions that result in a single terminal, like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'. Others might have more complex expansions.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and their possible terminal expansions:\n\nNT33 \u2192 t76 or t30\n\nNT31 \u2192 t8 t35\n\nNT47 \u2192 t48\n\nNT44 \u2192 t73\n\nNT6 \u2192 t4\n\nNT52 \u2192 t7 or t55\n\nNT14 \u2192 t76\n\nNT43 \u2192 t55\n\nNT35 \u2192 t27\n\nNT12 \u2192 t37\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68\n\nNT25 \u2192 t58\n\nNT59 \u2192 t24 or t12\n\nNT39 \u2192 t40 t11\n\nNT45 \u2192 t29 t1\n\nNT29 \u2192 t5 t35\n\nNT19 \u2192 t28\n\nNT55 \u2192 t83\n\nNT6 \u2192 t49\n\nNT44 \u2192 t66\n\nNT7 \u2192 t28\n\nNT28 \u2192 t59\n\nNT14 \u2192 t42\n\nNT43 \u2192 t55\n\nNT35 \u2192 t27\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68\n\nNT49 \u2192 t47\n\nSo when I see a terminal in the string, it needs to match one of these. Let's go token by token:\n\nt68: Looking at the grammar, which non-terminal expands to t68? Looking at NT48: Yes, NT48 \u2192 t68. So maybe S is N48 N11. So first, maybe start from S and see where it can split into N48 and N11, which then expand to t68 and something else.\n\nWait, S is NT48 NT11, so S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Then NT48 must produce t68, which it does. So that's the first part. Now, the next part is NT11. Let's look at NT11 productions: In the grammar, NT11 can expand to NT41 NT49.\n\nSo NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Then, each of those can expand further. Let's check the string.\n\nThe remaining tokens after t68: t77 t77 t31 t55 t47 t25 t26 t37 t55.\n\nSo after the first t68, we have t77 t77 t31 t55 t47 t25 t26 t37 t55, which is 9 tokens. Since S splits into two non-terminals, each of those may produce multiple terminals. Let's see: T11 can be NT41 NT49, so each of these may expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to split the string into parts that match possible expansions of non-terminals. Let's consider the entire string as a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be split into factors that match non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a recursive descent parser, perhaps we can start from the beginning and match each non-terminal step by step.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the entire string consists of 10 tokens, and each non-terminal can produce a certain number of terminals. So the way to decompose the string would be to see which non-terminals can produce a sequence that matches the remaining tokens.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nt68 is NT48's production, so that's accounted for. Now, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo after t68, the next part is NT41 and NT49. Let's look at NT41's possible expansion. Looking at the grammar: NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT41. Wait, that's a recursive production. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me look again: NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT41. That seems like it's NT41 expanding into NT19 and then another NT41, which would cause infinite recursion unless something else comes in.\n\nWait, but maybe NT41 can expand to more terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I need to see if NT41 has a terminal expansion. Looking at the grammar, none of the direct productions for NT41 produce a terminal; it's only NT19 NT41. So perhaps I've missed something.\n\nWait, maybe NT41 can expand further. NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT41.\n\nBut then NT19 can expand to NT28, right? NT19 \u2192 NT28.\n\nSo NT41 could be NT19 NT41 \u2192 NT28 NT41.\n\nBut unless NT41 can produce a terminal, this seems like a loop. Alternatively, maybe the string can be split in a way that breaks this cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to see if each part can match.\n\nThe string after t68 is t77 t77 t31 t55 t47 t25 t26 t37 t55. Let's check the beginning: t77 t77. So maybe each t77 comes from NT45, which in the grammar has a production NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1.\n\nWait, looking back: NT45 is in the grammar as NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1. So nt45 produces nt29 and nt1. Now, looking at nt29's productions: nt29 \u2192 nt7 nt35.\n\nLet me check: nt29 \u2192 nt7 nt35, which is a binomial expansion. nt7 is a non-terminal, so nt7 would expand to, in the grammar, nt7 \u2192 nt12 nt43.\n\nSo nt7 \u2192 nt12 nt43. Then nt12 \u2192 nt39 nt32. So that's nt39 nt32, each of which can expand further.\n\nWait, but in our string after t68, we have t77 t77 t31 t55 t47 t25 t26 t37 t55.\n\nWait, perhaps the first t77 comes from NT45 \u2192 t29 t1. Let me see.\n\nLooking at nt45, does it expand into 't29' and 't1'? Let's check the grammar. No, looking back: I don't see a production for nt45 that directly produces a terminal. nt45 \u2192 nt29 nt1. So that's not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another non-terminal can produce t77.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t77? Hmm. Let's see the productions for non-terminals. For example, NT14 has NT14 \u2192 t76, but that's just NT14.\n\nWait, maybe I can list all possible non-terminals that have a terminal production:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT33 \u2192 t76 or t30\n\nNT12 \u2192 nt39 nt32, but wait, nt39 \u2192 nt40 nt11.\n\nSo, NT12's expansions don't terminate yet, but look at NT59: NT59 \u2192 nt18 nt1 or nt52 nt1. nt52 \u2192 t7 t55, and nt18 \u2192 t69, and nt55 \u2192 t83"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. Each non-terminal (like S, NT48, NT77, etc.) can be expanded into two non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the string should start with whatever NT48 and NT11 produce. \n\nNow, the given string starts with t68, t77, etc. So, let's check what NT48 and NT11 can produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n- NT52 \u2192 NT25 NT21 or other rules, but also NT25 is connected to NT58, etc.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to find a path through the grammar that can generate it.\n\nLet's break down the string into its components:\nt68, t77, t31, t7, t31, t7, t77, t26, t53, t4.\n\nLooking at each terminal, I need to see if they can be derived from some non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, t68 is mentioned in the rule NT48 \u2192 t68. So, if NT48 produces t68, then when S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the first token should be t68. That matches the string's first token.\n\nSo, NT48 \u2192 t68. Now, the remaining tokens are t77, t31, t7, t31, t7, t77, t26, t53, t4.\n\nNext, NT11. From the grammar, NT11 can be derived from NT19 NT41. Let's see, but in the string, after t68, the next is t77. So, we need to produce t77.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT77 is not directly given, but looking at NT33 \u2192 t73 and t30. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check each production that introduces terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT33 \u2192 t73 or t30. So, if we have NT30 \u2192 t22 or other, but t77 isn\u2019t shown. Wait, NT36 is involved in NT28 \u2192 t59, NT29 \u2192 t5, but I don't see NT77 in the rules. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: let's see which parts derive to which terminals.\n\nt68 is from NT48 \u2192 t68. Then, NT11 can be NT19 NT41, but I don't see NT19 or NT41 in the string directly. Alternatively, NT11 can also be derived as other combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's start from the string and see if I can work backwards.\n\nThe string starts with t68. Since the only way to get t68 is directly from NT48, we know S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and NT48 \u2192 t68. So, the first part is settled.\n\nNow, the remaining tokens are t77, t31, t7, t31, t7, t77, t26, t53, t4.\n\nLooking at NT11, it can be NT19 NT41. So, after NT11, we have to generate these tokens. Alternatively, if NT11 can be derived from other rules.\n\nWait, let's check NT11's productions. From the grammar, NT11 \u2192 NT19 NT41, or is there another rule? Looking again, yes, only NT11 \u2192 NT19 NT41. But in the string, after the initial t68, the next is t77. So, if NT11 \u2192 NT19 NT41, then we need to produce t77 from NT11, which doesn't seem possible because NT19 and NT41 don't directly correspond to t77. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the NT11 production. Let me check the grammar again. Oh! NT11 has a production NT11 \u2192 NT19 NT41. But in the string, after t68, the next is t77. So, maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the production is NT11 \u2192 NT77 NT7. Because in the string, after t68 comes t77, which could be the result of NT77 and NT7, but I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that the second part of the string might involve derivations from other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see a full parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire string and see if each part can be derived.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to parse the string step by step, reducing it using the grammar rules to see if it can reduce to S.\n\nAlternatively, think about the possible expansions.\n\nAnother approach: let's think about the string and see which parts can correspond to NT48 and NT11's expansions.\n\nWe know S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and NT48 \u2192 t68. So, the string starts with t68, and after that comes the expansion of NT11.\n\nSo, if the string after t68 is t77 t31 t7 t31 t7 t77 t26 t53 t4, then the NT11 expansion must be t77 t31 t7 t31 t7 t77 t26 t53 t4.\n\nSo, does NT11 have a production that can generate this? Looking at the grammar, NT11 can only be NT19 NT41. But the string after t68 is longer, so maybe I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and NT48 \u2192 t68, so the entire string after S is the expansion of NT11, which must be the remaining tokens after t68.\n\nSo, the string after t68 is t77 t31 t7 t31 t7 t77 t26 t53 t4.\n\nSo, this must be the expansion of NT11. But looking at the grammar, NT11 only produces NT19 NT41. So, perhaps NT19 and NT41 can expand into the remaining tokens.\n\nSo, NT11 \u2192 NT19 NT41. Then, each of these (NT19 and NT41) must expand into parts of the remaining string.\n\nLooking at NT19, from the grammar: NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT77.\n\nSo, NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT77.\n\nThen, the remaining string after t68 is t77 t31 t7 t31 t7 t77 t26 t53 t4.\n\nSo, NT19 expands to NT29 NT77. The string starts with t77, so perhaps NT77 is a terminal? Let me check NT77's production. From the grammar, looking for rules with NT77, I don't see any. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake, because in the grammar, NT7 \u2192 t53 and other terms, but nowhere is NT77 a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT77 aren't explicitly given. So, perhaps NT77 is not part of the grammar, but instead, it's part of the expansion of another non-terminal. So, maybe I'm confusing NT77 with NT7. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, no, in the rules provided, NT77 appears only in the string. For example, earlier rules have NT33 \u2192 t73 or t30, but no NT77. So, maybe NT77 is a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, all symbols starting with NT are non-terminals except when they are terminals. So, perhaps t77 is a terminal, derived from NT77?\n\nWait, in the grammar, perhaps NT77 is a non-terminal, but in the rules, no NT77 is shown, so maybe NT77 is a terminal. But in the given string, after t68, we have t77, so perhaps NT77 can expand to t77. So, if that's the case, maybe NT77 is a terminal. But I don't see a production for NT77 in the grammar, so perhaps it's a terminal. That would mean NT77 \u2192 t77. So, perhaps the grammar assumes that NT77 can only produce t77.

{"custom_id":"request-177","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for certain parsing algorithms. But for this problem, it's more about using the grammar to derive the string or checking if the string can be parsed using the grammar.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of production rules, some with two non-terminals on the right side and some with a single terminal. My initial step is probably to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar rules. Since the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, these terminals must be generated by the non-terminals through a series of productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t31 t55 t26 t69 t3 t26 t69 t30 t55`.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is connected, which suggests that the derivation starts with the start symbol S, and each step either adds a terminal or non-terminal. Since S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the first expansion would be from S to NT48 NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t68. I check the grammar rules to see where t68 comes from. Scrolling through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 t68. So, according to the grammar, t68 is the expansion of NT48. That means the first part of the string, t68, must come from NT48.\n\nNow, the next symbol in the string is t77. Wait, the grammar has NT49 \u2192 t77. So t77 is the expansion for NT49. But looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so after t68 (from NT48), the next symbol should come from NT11. However, the second symbol is t77, which is from NT49, which is part of another NT, not NT11. Hmm, does that mean I'm wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more systematically. Let's parse the string step by step, building the parse tree.\n\nThe string is:\n1. t68\n2. t77\n3. t31\n4. t55\n5. t26\n6. t69\n7. t3\n8. t26\n9. t69\n10. t30\n11. t55\n\nI start with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols should come from NT48 and NT11, respectively.\n\nSo, first symbol: t68 must be from NT48. Yes, as per NT48 \u2192 t68. So that's correct.\n\nThe second symbol is t77, which should be from NT11. But looking at the grammar for NT11: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So NT11 is two non-terminals: NT41 and NT49. Each of these needs to be expanded into terminals.\n\nSo, for the string, after t68, the next non-terminals would be NT41 and NT49. So the second symbol must come from NT41, and the third from NT49. But wait, according to the string, the second and third symbols are t77 and t31, which don't directly match. So maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each non-terminal's productions. Let me list the relevant rules:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68.\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nLooking at NT41: I don't see its production here. Let me check if it's covered. Scrolling through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT41: It seems NT41 is only defined as \u2192 t77. So NT41 \u2192 t77.\n\nAnd NT49 \u2192 t77? Wait no, earlier I thought NT49 was \u2192 t77, but actually, looking back, I think I misread. Wait, in the given rules, NT49 \u2192 t11? Or wait, wait: Let's check NT49.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So NT49 is two non-terminals: NT11 and NT6.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the symbol after t68 is t77, which would have to come from NT41, as per NT41 \u2192 t77.\n\nSo the string begins:\n\nt68 (NT48), then t77 (NT41), and then the next symbol from NT49. But NT49 needs to be expanded into NT11 and NT6.\n\nWait, but NT11 is two non-terminals: NT41 and NT49. So perhaps there's a recursive expansion here.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each step is a production that directly or indirectly leads to that terminal. Let's try to see if the entire string can be derived starting from S.\n\nLet me start by noting the entire string:\n\nt68 t77 t31 t55 t26 t69 t3 t26 t69 t30 t55\n\nSo it's 11 symbols, which I assume correspond to the two initial symbols from S, so probably two steps, but the tree will branch as needed.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to map each terminal in the string to the non-terminals that generate it. For example, each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal, so each must be generated by a rule A \u2192 a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the string and see which rules can generate each part.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the string as the result of leftmost derivation. Let me attempt that.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first part is NT48, which we know \u2192 t68. Then NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\n2. The next symbols: t77 must come from NT41, which is a terminal: NT41 \u2192 t77. So that's the second symbol.\n\n3. Now, the third symbol is t31, which comes from NT49. So NT49 must expand into a symbol that leads to t31. Let's see the rules for NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, so NT49 is NT11 and NT6. So to generate t31, we need to expand one of these into a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT11: production is NT41 NT49, which are terminals, but in our case, we have t31 here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track which non-terminal is responsible for each symbol.\n\nLet me list each symbol and see which non-terminal they come from:\n\n1. t68 \u2192 NT48\n2. t77 \u2192 NT41\n3. t31 \u2192 NT49's production. Since nt49 produces nt11 and nt6.\n\nBut wait, nt49's production is nt11 and nt6. So the third symbol is coming from nt49, which is a non-terminal. Thus, nt49 needs to be expanded in the current position, but the third symbol is t31, a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing this up because the string is a flat sequence, not a tree. Maybe I should consider the entire string as a possible way to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be viewed in terms of the non-terminals that produce sequences of terminals.\n\nLet me try to approach it as a recursive descent parser.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for the entire string in the grammar's derivation.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that the grammar is quite extensive, so perhaps the string is part of a larger derivation that includes many expansions.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals and their rules, perhaps I can track the possible sequences.\n\nAnother approach is to note that some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals, such as:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't73'\n- NT33 \u2192 't30'\n- NT40 \u2192 't69'\n- NT14 \u2192 't42'\n- NT47 \u2192 't48'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't25'\n- NT49 \u2192 't77'\n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT44 \u2192 't66'\n\nWait, so some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. The others produce other non-terminals.\n\nThus, the string is a sequence of these terminals, each of which must be produced by some non-terminal that eventually leads to it via the grammar rules.\n\nSo, let me try to reconstruct a possible derivation.\n\nThe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-169","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. So, each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to check is `t68 t77 t77 t26 t53 t69 t26 t69 t73 t15 t49`. That's a sequence of 11 tokens, all of which are terminals except maybe some that might be treated as non-terminals, but looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT12, NT33, etc. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t68, t77, etc.\n\nSo first, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all from S, so I'll start by looking at S.\n\nFrom the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols must be the result of deriving NT48 and NT11. Let me note that.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t68. So NT48 needs to derive to t68. Let's check the productions for NT48. Wait, in the grammar, looking at NT48, I don't see a direct production. Wait, let me go through the grammar to find NT48. Scanning the productions, I see NT48 -> t68 directly. Yes. So NT48 can directly produce t68. That's correct.\n\nNow, the next token is t77. Since after NT48, the next production should be NT11. So I need to check what NT11 produces. Looking at the grammar, NT11 has a production NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49. Then each of these needs to be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, after t68 comes t77, so that would be the production for NT41 and NT49? Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe entire string is t68 t77 t77 t26 t53 t69 t26 t69 t73 t15 t49. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68, so the first part is done.\n\nNow, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So after NT48's t68, the next part should be the result of NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at the string, after t68 comes t77 t77 t26 t53 t69 t26 t69 t73 t15 t49. So the next two symbols are t77 and t77. So we have to split NT41 and NT49 into these.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT41 and NT49.\n\nFor NT41: Looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t77 directly. So NT41 can produce t77.\n\nFor NT49: Looking at NT49, the productions are NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and NT49 \u2192 t49. Oh, so two possibilities. Let's see.\n\nSo the next token after NT41 and NT49 would be t77 t77. But since NT41 produces t77, the next token is t77, which would be from NT49. But NT49 can either go to t49 or to NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, wait. Let's clarify: The string after t68 is t77 t77 t26..., etc.\n\nSo after NT48 (t68), the next is NT41 and NT49. Suppose NT41 produces t77, then the next symbol is t77, which would be correct.\n\nThen, the next symbol would be t77. Wait, but NT49's production could be either t49 or NT11 NT6. If NT49 produces t77, that's possible, but in the grammar, NT49 doesn't have a production that directly goes to t77. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT49's productions: NT49 \u2192 t49 or NT11 NT6. So no direct production to t77. Hmm, that might be a problem. Because in the string, the second symbol is t77, which would be from NT49. But NT49 can\u2019t directly produce t77, so that might be an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me step back. Maybe the first part is correct: S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 (NT48) followed by NT11. So now, NT11 is to be derived. NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo we have to see how NT41 and NT49 produce the next symbols. The next symbol in the string after t68 is t77, then t77 again, then t26, etc.\n\nSo let me consider NT41 first.\n\nNT41: What's its production? Looking through the grammar, I see NT41 \u2192 t77. So NT41 can produce t77 directly. So that's good. So the second symbol t77 comes from NT41.\n\nNow, after NT41 (t77), the next part is NT49. The next symbol is t77. So NT49 needs to produce t77. But looking at NT49's productions, neither of them produce t77. Only t49 or another non-terminal. So that would make it impossible for NT49 to directly produce t77. So perhaps this path doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and I need to find a different path. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe the string isn't as straightforward as I thought. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49, and each of those splits further. Let's see.\n\nSo after t68, we have the production NT41 and NT49. Let me see:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t77 (as above)\n- NT49: let's see, it can produce t49 or NT11 NT6.\n\nIf NT49 \u2192 t49, then the second symbol would be t49, but the string has t77 next. So that's no good.\n\nIf NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, then we have to derive those. So after t77 (from NT41), we have t77 from NT49. But wait, NT49 would be producing NT11 and NT6. So how does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused about the structure. Let me try to think in terms of the string step by step.\n\nThe entire string is t68 t77 t77 t26 t53 t69 t26 t69 t73 t15 t49.\n\nLet me group it accordingly.\n\n- t68: from NT48 (which is direct)\n\nThen, after t68, we have t77 t77. These two come from NT41 and NT49.\n\nNT41: t77\n\nNT49: need to derive t77. But NT49 can't produce t77 directly. So perhaps NT49 goes through its productions and eventually results in t77.\n\nLooking at NT49's productions, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, and NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49.\n\nSo perhaps there's a recursive path here. Let's try.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n\nSo let's see, if we substitute:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 \u2192 (NT41 NT49) (NT52 NT49)\n\nSo that would be NT41 NT49 NT52 NT49.\n\nEach of these non-terminals can be further expanded.\n\nNT41 \u2192 t77\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (which we can expand further)\n\nNT52 \u2192 t7 (from the grammar: NT52 \u2192 t7)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT52 \u2192 t7.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t77 t77, we have t26, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting lost. Let me try to write down the entire derivation step by step.\n\nWe need to derive the string t68 t77 t77 t26 t53 t69 t26 t69 t73 t15 t49.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-194","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t68 t77 t77 t47 t76 t65 t77 t26 t36 t25 t32 t47` is generated by this grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to structure CFGs where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because all productions except the terminal ones have two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nThe string starts with `t68`, which I think corresponds to a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see that `t68` is directly derived from `NT49` because the production `NT49 -> t68` exists. So, `t68` is the result of NT49.\n\nNext, looking at the string, the next token is `t77`, which comes from NT49 because there's `NT49 -> t77`. So after NT49, we have two NT49s: `t68 t77 t77 t47...`.\n\nAfter that, `t47` comes next. I see that NT47 has a production `NT47 -> t48`, but wait, `t47` isn't directly a terminal in the grammar. Wait, let me check. Oh, under NT40, there's `NT40 -> NT28 t59`, but that's not directly helpful here. Wait, no, looking again, I see `NT44 -> t47 t48`? Or wait, actually, looking through the productions, let me find where `t47` is. Oh, I see `NT44 -> t47 t48`, so `t47` would be part of that, but that's not directly matching the first `t47` in the string. Wait, no, in the string, the first part is t68 t77 t77 t47... So, maybe the `t47` is part of another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t77 t47 t76 t65 t77 t26 t36 t25 t32 t47.\n\nLet me parse this using the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first symbol is `t68`, which comes from NT49: `NT49 -> t68`.\n\nSo, the first production is NT49. Then, the next symbol is t77, which is another instance of NT49: `NT49 -> t77`.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the grammar, `NT49` has two productions: `NT49 -> t68` and `NT49 -> t77`. So, each occurrence of `t68` or `t77` comes directly from NT49.\n\nSo, the first three symbols are t68, t77, t77, which would come from NT49 \u2192 t68, then NT49 \u2192 t77, then NT49 \u2192 t77. But that would require NT49 to produce a sequence of three tokens, but in the grammar, NT49 only produces two terminals, so this might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps NT49 is used as a subtree, and the sequence is built up through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree in my mind. Let's see.\n\nThe top-level symbol is S, which is `S -> NT48 NT11`.\n\nSo, the entire string must be derived from S, which splits into NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t68 (NT49 produces t68), which would be part of NT48 or NT11?\n\nLooking at NT48: is there a production for NT48? Let me check. Yes, `NT48 -> t68`. So NT48 produces `t68`.\n\nThen, looking at the next part, after t68, we have t77 t77 t47... Wait, no, after S is split into NT48 and NT11, so the string must be the concatenation of what NT48 produces and what NT11 produces.\n\nSo, the string is `t68 t77 t77 t47 t76 t65 t77 t26 t36 t25 t32 t47`.\n\nWait, that's 12 tokens. Let's check:\n\nNT48 is `t68` (1 token).\n\nNT11 produces the remaining 11 tokens: `t77 t77 t47 t76 t65 t77 t26 t36 t25 t32 t47`.\n\nSo, we need to see if NT11 can produce that sequence of 11 tokens.\n\nLooking at the production for NT11: `NT11 -> NT41 NT49`.\n\nSo, NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49. Now, NT49 can produce `t68` or `t77`, so that's part of the sequence, but let's see.\n\nWait, the entire substring after NT48 must be produced by NT11, which splits into NT41 and NT49.\n\nSo, the entire string after NT48 is 11 tokens, which must be split into two parts: NT41 and NT49.\n\nSo, the first part, from t77 onwards, would be produced by NT41, and the second part by NT49.\n\nSo, let's split it: the string after NT48 is:\n\nt77 t77 t47 t76 t65 t77 t26 t36 t25 t32 t47.\n\nSo, considering NT41 and NT49, perhaps NT41 can produce the first n tokens and NT49 the remaining?\n\nBut the order is important because Chomsky normal form requires each production to be of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, NT41's production: let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT41 -> t77.\n\nSo, NT41 can produce a single terminal t77, so that would take the first token, which is t77.\n\nThen, the next part is t77 t47 t76 t65 t77 t26 t36 t25 t32 t47, which must be produced by NT49.\n\nBut wait, NT49 can produce either t68 or t77. So, the first symbol after NT41 is t77, which matches NT49 \u2192 t77.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 t77 (from NT49) ... ?\n\nWait, maybe I should structure this differently.\n\nWait, S is `S -> NT48 NT11`.\n\nSo, NT48 is t68, and NT11 must produce the rest, which is 11 symbols.\n\nNT11 is `NT41 NT49`, where NT41 \u2192 t77 and NT49 \u2192 t77.\n\nSo, NT41 \u2192 t77, and NT49 \u2192 t77 t77 t47.. Wait, no, that's not possible.\n\nWait, no, the string after NT48 is t77 t77 t47 t76 t65 t77 t26 t36 t25 t32 t47.\n\nSo, NT48 produces t68, NT11 must produce the remaining 11 symbols, which are:\n\nt77, t77, t47, t76, t65, t77, t26, t36, t25, t32, t47.\n\nBut NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, NT41 produces t77 (the first token), and then NT49 must produce the remaining 10 tokens: t77 t47 t76 t65 t77 t26 t36 t25 t32 t47.\n\nNow, NT49 can only produce t68 or t77, each a single symbol. So, after NT41 produces t77, what's the next part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the split. Let me think again.\n\nIf NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, then the entire substring produced by NT11 is the concatenation of what NT41 produces and what NT49 produces.\n\nSo, if NT41 can produce a string of length m, and NT49 a string of length n, the total is m+n.\n\nLooking at the string after NT48: 11 symbols.\n\nNT41 can produce one symbol (t77"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-197","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t68 t77 t77 t26 t69 t3 t26 t69 t30 t55 t10 t47`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. CNF is useful because it allows for efficient parsing using algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, I'm not sure if I should use that here, but maybe thinking about derivations could help.\n\nThe grammar consists of a start symbol S and several non-terminals (NT followed by numbers). Each non-terminal can be rewritten using other non-terminals or sometimes terminal symbols. The given string is a series of terminals, so I need to see if the start symbol S can be expanded through a series of productions to match this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S -> NT48 NT11. So the derivation must start with NT48 and NT11. Let's look at NT48: in the grammar, it's not listed, but wait, let me check the productions. Oh, I see NT48 -> 't68'. So NT48 directly produces 't68'. Similarly, NT11 is in the grammar as NT11 -> 't77'.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string are 't68 t77', which matches NT48 NT11 -> t68 t77. That's good. Now, after that, the rest of the string should be generated by the remaining symbols. Let's list the remaining tokens: t77, t26, t69, t3, t26, t69, t30, t55, t10, t47.\n\nWait, the initial part is t68 t77, so that's the first two symbols. Now, we need to figure out how NT48 and NT11 can produce the rest of the string. But wait, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so after S -> NT48 NT11, each of those NTs can be expanded into two non-terminals, and so on, until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nSo, I think I need to look for a way to derive the remaining tokens starting from NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11: NT11 -> 't77' directly. So after the initial 't68 t77', the next symbol is 't77', which comes from NT11. So after NT11, the next production must come from NT48. Let's see, NT48 is already resolved to 't68', so the next token after that would be the expansion of NT11 again, but that's already used. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a tree. The start is S, which splits into NT48 and NT11. NT48 becomes 't68', and NT11 becomes 't77'. But the string after 't68 t77' is 't77 t26 t69 t3 t26 t69 t30 t55 t10 t47', which is 10 more tokens. But NT11 has already produced 't77', so how can we get another 't77'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the order. Let me list the string again: t68 t77 t77 t26 t69 t3 t26 t69 t30 t55 t10 t47. So the sequence is S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 't68 t77', then what comes next is another 't77', which would require that NT11 can produce another t77. But since NT11 is a non-terminal, it can only produce 't77' directly once. So unless NT11 is used again in a way that allows multiple productions, which it can't because each production only gives two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the string is longer than just the two initial symbols. Let me count the full string: 12 tokens. So, after S, we have 't68 t77', then what? The next is 't77', then 't26', etc. So perhaps we need to look deeper into the structure.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step. Starting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. NT48 becomes 't68', and NT11 becomes 't77', so the first two symbols are correct. Now, we're left with the rest of the string: t77 t26 t69 t3 t26 t69 t30 t55 t10 t47.\n\nWait, but after S, both NT48 and NT11 have been used up. How can there be another 't77'? Unless the NT11 can be used again, but maybe through other productions. Let me check the production rules for NT11. NT11 -> 't77', so it can only produce 't77' directly. So after the initial 't77', we can't get another 't77' unless we have a way to split NT11 into something else, but it's only a terminal.\n\nSo perhaps this indicates that the string is not correct because after the initial two symbols, we can't get another 't77' from NT11. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the NTs can be split differently. Let me look at the rest of the grammar to see if any NTs can produce 't26', 't69', etc.\n\nLooking at NT26: I don't see a production for NT26 in the given grammar. Maybe it's a terminal. Wait, no, the grammar lists all non-terminals first, so if NT26 doesn't appear in any RHS, then it's a terminal. But looking through the production rules, I don't see NT26 as a left-hand side. So perhaps NT26 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, checking other tokens:\n\nt69: NT69? Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT69 as a non-terminal. So it's a terminal.\n\nt3: NT3? No, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT3 as a production, so it's a terminal.\n\nt26: same as above, a terminal.\n\nt30: looking for NT30. Wait, I see NT30 -> 't84', but also NT30 -> 't22' (from the given grammar: NT30 -> NT22). So NT30 can be split into 't84' or 't22'.\n\nt55: Looking for NT55, which is defined as NT55 -> 't83'. So 't55' is a terminal.\n\nt10: NT10? Let me check the grammar. There's NT14 -> 't76', NT10 isn't listed as a non-terminal, so t10 is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking through the production rules, I see NT55 -> 't83' and NT50something? Wait, searching through, I see NT10 is not a non-terminal, so 't10' is terminal.\n\nt47: Looking for NT47. Yes, the grammar has NT47 -> 't48'. So it's a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go step by step.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which gives 't68 t77', we have the rest:\n\nt77 t26 t69 t3 t26 t69 t30 t55 t10 t47.\n\nBut after the first two symbols, the next token is 't77', which would require NT11 to produce 't77' again. But NT11 can only produce 't77' once. So unless the NT11 can be used recursively, but in this case, since we already used both NT48 and NT11, that doesn't seem possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the order. Let's think of the entire string as a series of productions. So starting with S, then NT48 and NT11. Then each non-terminal needs to be expanded into two symbols, etc., until we get terminal tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and only two symbols are generated from S, so the rest would come from further productions. Let me think about the structure.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step, assuming each production step adds two symbols, as in CNF.\n\nWe need to generate a string of 12 tokens, which would require 6 levels of productions starting from S.\n\nBut let's construct the parse tree. S \u2192 NT48 NT11. NT48 is 't68', NT11 is 't77', which matches the first two symbols.

This makes parsing easier, but in this case, since we're just checking if the string is derived, I might not need a full parser.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals are on the left, but many of them eventually produce strings of terminals. So, perhaps it's better to see which parts of the string can be matched directly.\n\nLet me go through the string step by step:\n\nThe string starts with t68. Looking at the grammar, t68 is produced by NT49 -> 't68'. So that's good so far.\n\nNext is t77. Let's see what produces t77. Checking the rules, NT59 -> 't24' and NT59 -> 't77'. Wait, no, NT59's production is 't24' and 't59' is another option? Wait no, the rules list for NT59 are 't24' and 't12'\u2014Wait, no, wait the grammar's rules for NT59 have -> 't24' and -> 't12'? Or maybe I'm misreading. Let me check the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\nNT59 -> NT12 NT9\n\nWait, those are non-terminals. Then, looking for terminals, do any of the non-terminals produce t77?\n\nWait, no. In the given grammar, the only terminals directly produced are the t's and some others. Wait, looking back, the rules for NT59 don't have any t's. So maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the terminal symbols in the grammar. Let's see:\n\nIn the grammar rules, I see lines like:\nNT33 -> 't73'\nNT33 -> 't73'\nWait no, looking through:\n\nNT33 -> 't73'\nWait, no, the grammar seems to have multiple rules for some non-terminals. Let me go carefully.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\nNT33 has two productions:\nNT33 -> 't76'\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the list:\n\nNT33 -> 't76'\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nWait, no, actually the initial grammar list shows:\n\nNT33 -> 't76'\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nWait no, let me check the full list for NT33:\n\nFrom the grammar provided:\nNT33 -> 't76'\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nSo, NT33 can produce either 't76' or 't30'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals:\n\nNT37 production leads to 't28' and 't59', but that's part of a non-terminal? Wait, no, in the rules, some non-terminals produce strings with 't's and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the terminal productions. Let's see:\n\nNT6 -> 't4'\nNT14 -> 't76'\nNT44 -> 't68'\nNT49 -> 't68'\nNT59 -> 't24' and 't59' via NT37?\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT44 -> 't68'\n- NT49 -> 't68'\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT14 -> 't76'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT59-> 't24' and 't12'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the rules for NT59 are:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT9\nNT59 -> NT12 NT9\n\nWait, no, that's not terminals. Wait, no, in the grammar list:\n\nLooking back, the grammar productions are:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1 -> perhaps not terminals;\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to build the derivation step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t68, which is produced by NT49's production. So the first two symbols are 't68', so the first non-terminal is NT49.\n\nNow, after t68, the string is 't77 t77 t26 ... '. So next is t77, which must come from NT49 -> NT11 NT6. Wait, no: NT49's production is NT49 -> NT11 NT6. So, after t68, the next step is to have two symbols: NT11 and NT6. But the next symbol is t77, which would require one of these to be a terminal.\n\nWait, no: The production NT49 -> NT11 NT6 means that after producing t68, we have NT11 and NT6. Since they are non-terminals, we need to expand them further.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t68, it's t77, which isn't part of nt11 or nt6. So perhaps that's an issue.\n\nWait, so perhaps:\n\nStart with NT49 -> t68. Then, NT49 splits into NT11 and NT6. So the next step would be NT11 and NT6 generating t77. But NT11 is a non-terminal, and its production is NT41 NT49.\n\nLooking at NT11's rules, it's NT52 NT49. Wait, no:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nSo NT11 expands into NT41 and NT49.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nSo, after the initial t68, we have NT11 and NT6. Now, the next symbol is t77, so we need to see what comes next.\n\nWait, but actually, the string is t68 followed by three t77's, so perhaps the first symbols are t68, t77, t77, etc.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the string is:\n\nt68, t77, t77, t26, t36, t76, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t32, t47.\n\nHmm, that's 13 symbols. So perhaps the initial production is NT49 -> t68 followed by something that starts with NT49 or other non-terminals that produce t77.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how the string builds up from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt68 t77 t77 t26 t36 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t32 t47.\n\nt68 can come from NT49. So first, NT49 -> t68.\n\nNow, the next part is t77. But after t68, the derivation might involve NT49 splitting into NT11 and NT6. So:\n\nt68 (from NT49) followed by what?\n\nAfter t68, the derivation would be:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6 \u2192 NT11 generates something, NT6 generates something.\n\nBut the next symbol is t77, which needs to come from either NT11 or NT6.\n\nLooking at NT11: NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, if NT11 produces another NT41 and NT49, which itself can produce t68, then perhaps we have t68 t68, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT41 can produce t77.\n\nLooking at NT41: NT41 -> 't77'.\n\nYes! Because in the grammar's rules, one of the productions for NT41 is 't77'.\n\nSo, starting from t68, and then the next step is NT49->NT11 NT6.\n\nNow, for NT11, we have NT41 and NT49 as its children. NT41 produces t77 directly.\n\nSo the next part would be t77, which matches the second token.\n\nSimilarly, the third token is another t77, which would require another NT41 production.\n\nThen, the next tokens are t26, t36, etc.\n\nWait, let me structure this step by step:\n\n1. NT49 -> 't68' (matches the first t68).\n\n2. Now, NT49 splits into NT11 and NT6. So we have to generate ['t77', 't77', 't26',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all right-hand sides are two non-terminals (except towards the end where some are terminals) or a single terminal. Wait, no\u2014looking closer, some productions like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30' are single terminals. So that's fine because CNF allows for productions to terminals as well.\n\nNow, the string to check is a sequence of these terms: t68, t77, t26, t69, t48, t37, t25, t84, t27, t26, t69, t30, t15. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So S expands into two parts: NT48 and NT11. Let's see what NT48 and NT11 are.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT48 \u2192 't68'. So the first part is t68. That matches the first token in the string.\n\nNext, NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT49. So NT11 expands into NT7 and NT49. Now, let's expand these.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43. NT12 is NT52 or other non-terminals, but let's see:\n\nWait, I might get stuck getting into loops, so maybe a better approach is to trace the string backward from the leaves. Let's parse the string step by step, applying the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is t68, t77, t26, t69, t48, t37, t25, t84, t27, t26, t69, t30, t15.\n\nStarting with the entire string, let's see if it can be split into two parts that match the productions.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so the string t68 ... must come from NT48, which is 't68'. So the first part is done, and the rest is the second part from NT11: t77, t26, t69, t48, t37, t25, t84, t27, t26, t69, t30, t15.\n\nWait, no, the string is S's expansion, so after t68 (from NT48), the next part is NT11, which should generate the rest of the string. But looking back, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so the string should start with t68 followed by the expansion of NT11.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t68, which matches NT48, so the rest of the string is t77, t26, etc. Now, let's focus on NT11: it's NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 't48'.\n\nWait, let me check NT43's production: yes, NT43 \u2192 't48'. So, NT43 can directly produce t48. So in the expansion, after t77, t26, t69, t48, t37, t25, t84, t27, t26, t69, t30, t15, the last part is t48, so NT43 must be expanded as t48.\n\nSo, let's break down the string:\n\n1. t68 (NT48)\n2. t77, t26, t69, t48, t37, t25, t84, t27, t26, t69, t30, t15\n\nNow, after t68, we have the next part: t77, t26, t69, t48 (which is the expansion of NT43), then the rest.\n\nBut NT43 \u2192 t48, so that's correct. Now, the remaining string is t37, t25, t84, etc. So the part after t48 is t37, t25, t84, t27, t26, t69, t30, t15. So the next part is t77 followed by NT11's expansion after NT48.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so we have:\n\nS\n|\nNT48\n\/  \\\nt68  NT11\n\nNow, NT11 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43 \u2192 ... Let's see what NT43 is: NT43 \u2192 t48, so we can use that as a leaf.\n\nSo, NT11 expands into:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT7 NT43\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\nNT12 \u2192 NT52 or other, but let's look at NT12's productions: NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32 or others. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, NT12's productions include NT12 \u2192 NT52 NT49. Hmm, maybe I should track the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work from the string and see if each part matches the required expansions.\n\nThe entire string is a sequence of tokens, each generated by a non-terminal or terminal.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order:\n\n1. t68\n2. t77\n3. t26\n4. t69\n5. t48\n6. t37\n7. t25\n8. t84\n9. t27\n10. t26\n11. t69\n12. t30\n13. t15\n\nSo, starting from S, which produces NT48 (t68) and NT11.\n\nAfter t68, the rest is NT11, which is t77, t26, t69, t48, t37, t25, t84, t27, t26, t69, t30, t15.\n\nWait, but the next part is NT11, so perhaps I should parse the rest of the string as NT11's expansion.\n\nNow, NT11 has the production NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT43.\n\nSo let's split the remaining string after t68 into two parts: the expansion of NT7 and NT43.\n\nBut looking at the string after t68, the second element is t77, which needs to match NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43. So let's expand NT7.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43.\n\nNow, the next tokens are t77, t26, t69, t48, etc. So t77 is part of NT7's expansion. Let's see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 \u2192 NT52 or others. Let's check NT12's productions. Looking back, NT12 \u2192 NT52 NT49, or NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32. But in the given grammar, I don't see a production for NT12 that directly leads to a t. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has multiple NT12 productions:\n\nNT12 -> NT39 NT57\nNT12 -> NT52 NT49\n\nHmm, so NT12 can't produce t directly, it has to go through more non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the given string has t26, t69, etc., which are terminals. So perhaps the path from NT12 will eventually produce these terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string after t68, the next token is t77. So NT7 \u2192 NT12 needs to generate t77 or something else. Wait, no. Let's see: NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43. So after t77, we need NT12 NT43 to produce the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's take it step by step.\n\nAfter S \u2192 t68 NT11, the remaining tokens are:\n\nt77, t26, t69, t48, t37, t25, t84, t27, t26, t69, t30, t15.\n\nNow, NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT43.

{"custom_id":"request-230","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens: `t68 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t22 t27 t15`. \n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right. Or wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. But looking at the given grammar, I see both A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Hmm, that's not strictly CNF. Maybe the user meant that the grammar is in either Chomsky Normal Form or slightly extended. Oh well, maybe it's allowed to have rules where the right-hand side can have a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. Because in CNF, it's either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. But in this case, from the given rules, most look like A \u2192 BC, but some end with terminals like 't33' directly.\n\nSo, each production either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a single terminal. So that's acceptable, as long as the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string provided is a sequence of terminals. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t22 t27 t15.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string from left to right using the given grammar, starting from the start symbol S. Each production can consume or generate the required terminals.\n\nLet me see the structure of the grammar. Each production goes from a non-terminal to two tokens (either non-terminals or terminals). Since the string starts with t68, I need to see which production generates t68.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT48 -> t68. So the first terminal 't68' is generated by NT48.\n\nSo, the start symbol S \u2192 NT48 NT48's other production. Wait, looking at the initial rule:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT48 NT48's next production? No, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So to produce the first token, t68, it's generated by NT48, so the production must expand NT48 into t68 and something else.\n\nSo the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nBut NT48 is expanded as t68. So that would make the first symbol t68, and the next part would be NT11. Wait, but NT11 may have a production that needs to be processed.\n\nWait, let me think step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t68. So the first production must involve a rule where NT48 \u2192 t68. So NT48 expands to t68, and the right-hand side of the production S \u2192 NT48 NT11 would produce t68 followed by NT11.\n\nSo the first symbol is t68 (from NT48), and then we have NT11. So NT11 must expand into the rest of the string: t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t22 t27 t15.\n\nBut wait, if S \u2192 NT48 NT11, then the first symbol after t68 is the expansion of NT11.\n\nSo, the next step is to parse the substring t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t22 t27 t15 with NT11. How does NT11 produce this?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n\nNT41 \u2192 t77\n\nNT49 \u2192 t81\n\nSo, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 \u2192 t77 t81.\n\nHmm, but the next symbol after t68 is t77, but we also have t77 later in the string.\n\nWait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me see:\n\nWait, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which gives t68 (from NT48) and then NT11, which produces t77 t81. So after t68, the next symbols would be t77 t81.\n\nBut in our string, after t68 comes t77, then t26, etc. So that doesn't match. So this suggests that NT11 cannot produce that substring, so the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is leading us astray.\n\nWait, perhaps S expands to NT48 and NT11, but each of those can have multiple productions. Maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me re-express the first few steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Each production in the grammar is A \u2192 B C, which means that every time a non-terminal A is used, it can be replaced by B and C.\n\nBut the parsing is not straightforward. Maybe I should look for a way to break down the string into the required components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent parser approach would be better, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe looking for the start symbol and seeing if the entire string can be produced by expanding it.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNow, the first symbol is t68, so NT48 \u2192 t68.\n\nSo after that, we have NT11, which needs to generate the rest of the string: t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t22 t27 t15.\n\nSo, let me look for the production that NT11 can use. From the rules, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Now, NT41 \u2192 t77.\n\nSo, from NT11, after t77, NT49 would produce t81.\n\nSo, the first part of the string after t68 is t77 t81.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, after t68 comes t77, then t26.\n\nSo that suggests that NT11 should produce t77 followed by more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed another production for NT11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I only see one production for NT11: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the parsing is more complex, and we can have multiple expansions and look-forwards.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any other production has a terminal that matches the next token.\n\nWait, perhaps NT41 or NT49 can further expand.\n\nWait, perhaps after the initial S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which gives t68, and then NT11 being NT41 NT49, which is t77 t81, but that's not matching the string because after t68 comes t77, then t26, not t81.\n\nHmm, that suggests a problem. So perhaps S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is not the correct starting point, or perhaps I need a different expansion path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the production rules. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT48 NT11 (the starting rule)\n- NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n- NT41 \u2192 t77\n- NT49 \u2192 t81\n\nSo, NT11 is fixed to t77 t81, which is two terminals. So, any expansion starting with S would first produce t68, then t77 t81, making the sequence t68 t77 t81.\n\nBut the given string is t68 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t22 t27 t15. So after t68, the next term is t77. Let me consider that NT11's production can produce something more than t77 t81, but in the grammar, it's fixed. So perhaps the problem is that the starting production is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another production for S that produces something else. But looking back, the only production for S is S \u2192 NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-235","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string to evaluate is `t68 t77 t77 t31 t4 t42 t65 t77 t47 t25 t5 t25 t42 t81`. Alright, let me break down how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar is structured in such a way that each non-terminal can only produce either two other non-terminals or a single terminal. That should help in figuring out possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see several non-terminals and some terminals. The terminals are the strings like 't68', 't77', etc. The non-terminals are things like S, NT44, etc. Each production in the grammar seems to fit the Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the task is to determine if the provided string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of terminals, and the grammar generates strings consisting of a combination of these terminals through non-terminal productions. So, I need to see if this string can be built up by following the productions step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking for any production rules that can produce the first terminal in the string, which is 't68'. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT48 \u2192 't68'. So, NT48 can be replaced by 't68'. That's a good start because the first symbol in the string is 't68', so NT48 must be part of the derivation.\n\nSo, the initial step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Now, the string starts with 't68', so replacing NT48 with 't68' gives us 't68' followed by NT11. Next, I need to see what NT11 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT11 has the production NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, NT11 will be replaced by NT41 and NT49. Now, the string after the first 't68' should be the combination of these two non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the way it works is that each production replaces a single non-terminal with two new symbols. So, starting from S, the first step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which leads to 't68' followed by NT48 \u2192 't68' and NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, now, the string is 't68' followed by NT41 NT49, but these NT41 and NT49 are still non-terminals, so we need to replace them.\n\nBut let me think again. The string we need to evaluate is the entire sequence of terminals generated by the grammar. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be the result after all non-terminals have been expanded. So, perhaps I should think in terms of parsing the string by breaking it down into the possible non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, starting from S and generating all possible strings, but that might be too time-consuming. Instead, maybe I can break down the string step by step, trying to match it against possible productions.\n\nLooking at the string again: `t68 t77 t77 t31 t4 t42 t65 t77 t47 t25 t5 t25 t42 t81`. Let me list the terminals in order: t68, t77, t77, t31, t4, t42, t65, t77, t47, t25, t5, t25, t42, t81.\n\nI know that S starts with NT48, which is 't68', so that matches the first t68. Now, after NT48 comes NT11, which is replaced by NT41 and NT49. So, we have 't68' followed by NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't68', the next two terms are 't77' and 't77'. So, the second part of the string starts with 't77'. Now, looking for NT41 and NT49. Let me check the productions for NT41 and NT49.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT41 has \u2192 't77', so that's a terminal. So, NT41 can be replaced by 't77'. Similarly, NT49 has \u2192 't45' and other rules, but also has \u2192 't81' in another production. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT49 has two productions: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7. Also, there's another production NT49 \u2192 't81'.\n\nWait a minute, no, let me check again. Looking through the grammar, for NT49: \n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7, and NT49 \u2192 't81'?\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, under NT49, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\nNT49 -> 't81'\n\nYes, so three productions. So, NT49 can be 't81'. But in the string, after 't68', we have 't77', which is from NT41. Then the string continues with 't77' again. Hmm, wait, after 't77' and 't77', we have 't31', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should detail the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 't68' NT11\n2. NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 \u2192 so 't68' followed by NT41 and NT49.\n\nNow, the string after 't68' is 't77', 't77', etc. So, the next symbols after 't68' are 't77' and then another 't77'? Or perhaps I should see the breakdown as 't68' followed by NT41 and NT49, but the string is 't68 t77 t77 ... ', so after 't68', we have two 't77's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the string as a list and see how it can be generated.\n\nThe string is: [t68, t77, t77, t31, t4, t42, t65, t77, t47, t25, t5, t25, t42, t81]\n\nWe have S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 't68' followed by NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, after the first 't68', the next two symbols are 't77' (from NT41) and then what? Let's see: NT49 can produce 't81' among others. But in the string, the next symbol after the first 't77' is another 't77', which doesn't match 't81'. So that seems problematic.\n\nWait, so after 't68', we have 't77' and then what? The second part of S is NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, those two non-terminals must be expanded into the next two symbols. So the third symbol in the string is 't77', which would be from NT49. But in the string, it's the second 't77' after 't68', so the third position.\n\nHmm, so maybe NT49 \u2192 't77'? Wait, looking at the productions for NT49, do they have a 't77' production? Let me check: \n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT49 directly leading to 't77'. The productions for NT49 are 't81', 't65' (from NT45?), or via other paths. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine. Wait, NT49's productions are:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n\nSo, it doesn't directly produce 't77'. So, if NT49 is 't77', there's no rule for that. So perhaps that's where the problem lies. So, the second 't77' in the string would have to come from NT41 or some other non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nWait, NT41 is a non-terminal. Let me check NT41's productions. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT41 \u2192 't77'\n\nSo, yes! NT41 can be replaced by 't77'.

The string is \"t68 t77 t77 t77 t81 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t81 t4\", and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So, the top-level rule must be \"S -> NT48 NT11\", which gives me an initial path to follow.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is \"t68\". I check where \"t68\" is defined. From the grammar, I see that NT48 -> 't68'. So, the first part of the string, \"t68\", corresponds to NT48.\n\nNext, after NT48, we have NT11. So, I need to find what NT11 expands to. Looking through the rules, I find that NT11 -> 't77' directly. That takes care of the second part, which is \"t77\", so so far, the string starts with \"t68 t77\".\n\nNow, after that, the string continues with \"t77 t77 t77\". Since NT11 is already a terminal ('t77'), the next part of the string must be the next two symbols. Wait, no\u2014hold on. NT11 is followed by another NT11, right? Because the original production is S -> NT48 NT11. So, the first two symbols are \"t68 t77\". The remaining string is \"t77 t77 t77 t81 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t81 t4\".\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm confusing the steps. Let me retrace. The initial two parts are NT48 and NT11, giving \"t68 t77\". Now, the next element is another NT11, which is 't77', followed by NT31 (from NT12's production, perhaps). But the string after the initial \"t68 t77\" is \"t77 t77 t77 t81 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t81 t4\".\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly. Maybe I should think about the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the productions of the grammar.\n\nThe string has 15 symbols, all terminals, and they are a mix of letters and numbers. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production leads to terminals, so each symbol in the string must correspond to a direct production.\n\nLet me list the string: t68, t77, t77, t77, t81, t76, t59, t28, t77, t77, t47, t25, t32, t81, t4.\n\nI can start from the beginning:\n\n1. The first symbol is t68, which comes from NT48 -> t68.\n\n2. Next, we have NT11, which is 't77'.\n\n3. So now, after the first two symbols, we've covered S -> NT48 t77.\n\nBut wait, the next symbol in the string is another t77. Since NT11 is 't77', that would require another NT11, but since the initial S production only has S -> NT48 NT11, which are two symbols, each of which is a terminal. So, after the initial two symbols, the rest shouldn't have any more NT11s unless they come from transformations elsewhere. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look at the grammar again. NT11 is defined as 't77', so any occurrence of NT11 in the string must be exactly 't77'. So, if the third symbol is t77, does that come from NT11 or somewhere else? Since in the original production, after NT48, it's NT11, which is 't77', but in the string, after the first t68, we have t77 (second symbol), then another t77 (third). \n\nWait, the original production is S -> NT48 NT11, which is two symbols, so after that, if the string has more than two, it's not directly compatible unless those symbols are generated from other rules. But since all rules are in CNF, each step should expand non-terminals into two non-terminals until you reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is longer than two symbols, meaning that the initial S is not the start. But no, S is the start symbol, so the entire string should be generated by expanding S step by step until terminals are reached. So the entire string must be decomposable into the production chain starting with S.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is longer than the initial two symbols, which suggests that the expansion isn't just two symbols but more. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's represent the string as a sequence and see if it can be parsed using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is t68 t77 t77 t77 t81 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t81 t4.\n\nI can start by looking at the first symbol t68, which must be from NT48. So, the first part is NT48->t68.\n\nNext, after NT48, we have NT11. NT11->t77, so that's the second symbol.\n\nBut then, the string continues with more t77s. How do these come into play?\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Let me consider that the string has 15 symbols, so it's 15 steps from the start symbol S, but given that each production in CNF leads to two symbols, the length should be a power of 2 plus something. Wait, or more accurately, the derivation tree can have varying numbers of symbols, but in this case, the string length is 15, which is odd, but the grammar is binary, so perhaps it's not possible. Wait, but the initial S is non-terminal, so each step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, increasing the number of symbols by one. So the number of symbols in the string must be a power of two? Or more precisely, the number of symbols should be 2^k -1? Let me check. Starting with 1 symbol (S), each step adds 1, so after one step, 2 symbols; after two steps, 3; but wait, that's not correct because each non-terminal expands into two, so number of symbols increases by 1 each time. So, for n symbols, the number of steps is n-1. So, the string length is 15, so n=15, number of steps is 14. That's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to try to see if each symbol in the string can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nLet's list the symbols again: t68, t77, t77, t77, t81, t76, t59, t28, t77, t77, t47, t25, t32, t81, t4.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. t68: must come from NT48->t68.\n\nNow, after NT48 (t68), we have NT11.\n\nSo, the second symbol is t77, which is from NT11->t77.\n\nSo, after that, we have more symbols. Let's look at the next symbol: t77.\n\nBut in the original production, after NT11, there's nothing since S->NT48 NT11, so NT48 and NT11 are both terminals in this initial expansion. So, wait, the first two symbols are t68 and t77, which would end the initial step. But the given string has more than two symbols, which suggests that the initial S expansion isn't just NT48 and NT11; perhaps some of these non-terminals are replaced by other rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t68, which is from NT48, but then NT11 must expand further into other non-terminals, which then expand into more symbols.\n\nWait, that's possible. Because in Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, which may themselves expand further.\n\nSo, let me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the initial S.\n\nS -> NT48 NT11.\n\nt68 comes from NT48, so the first part is t68.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to understand how the string can be built. The grammar starts with S, which is always the start symbol. The first rule is S -> NT48 NT11. So S can be expanded into NT48 and NT11. \n\nLooking at NT48, which is defined as NT6 -> NT52 NT49. From the rules, I see NT52 -> t7 or t5 or t49 or another option. But let me check each step carefully.\n\nActually, I need to parse the entire string back into the grammar. The string has tokens like t68, t77, etc. The first token is t68, and looking at the grammar, NT48 is the only node that produces t68, specifically NT48 -> t68. So the first part of the string could come from NT48, which is part of S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nSo after NT48, we have NT11. Let's look at NT11. From the grammar, NT11 has two options: either NT41 or NT19 NT41. Wait, actually, looking more closely, ND11 has two rules: NT11 -> NT41 NT6, and another option? Let me check. Oh, no, looking at the rules, NT11 is defined as NT11 -> NT41 NT6 or NT11 -> NT28 NT14, is that right? Wait, maybe I should list all NT11 rules.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar provided for NT11 is:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT6\nNT11 -> NT28 NT14\n\nSo yes, NT11 can expand to either of these two options. Now, the string after the initial t68 is t77, so the next step would involve NT11. Let's see, from NT48 -> t68, the next element is NT11. So we need to parse the string as t68 followed by t77, then the rest.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to build a parse tree for the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t77 t26 t28 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t47.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- The first token is t68. Looking at the grammar, t68 comes from NT48 -> t68. So that means the start symbol S will split into NT48 and NT11. So our string will be split into two parts after S: the left part from NT48 and the right part from NT11.\n\nNow, the first part after S is t68, which is generated by NT48. So the next token should come from NT11. So from the string, the next token after t68 is t77.\n\nLooking at NT11, it can generate either NT41 NT6 or NT28 NT14.\n\nLet me check the next token, t77. So, if NT11 -> NT28 NT14, then the next tokens should be t28 followed by t14. But the next token is t77, which isn't t14. Alternatively, if NT11 -> NT41 NT6, then we need to see if that matches.\n\nWait, no. NT41 and NT6 are part of the production, but their terminal expansions are part of how we parse. Let's think about NT11's expansion.\n\nIf NT11 -> NT41 NT6, then the next part of the string should start with whatever NT41 produces and then NT6. Looking at the grammar, NT41 -> t77. So if NT41 expands to t77, then the next token is t77, which matches. Then after that, NT6 would produce something.\n\nWait, but the string has t77 as the second token after t68. So after S -> NT48 (t68) and NT11, the NT11 would need to produce t77 in the next step. So if NT11 -> NT41 NT6, and NT41 -> t77, and NT6 -> t68, but that's not matching because after t68, the next is t77. Hmm, maybe let's think about the parsing steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT11 -> NT28 NT14. Then, the next token is t77, which would have to match either the first part of NT28 or the first part of NT14.\n\nWait, NT28 is from the grammar: NT28 -> t59. So if NT28 expands to t59, that's one possibility, but that's after t11, the second token after t68 would be t59, but in the string it's t77. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t77 t26 t28 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t47.\n\nSo, the structure is S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 -> t68.\n\nSo the first token is t68.\n\nNow, from NT11, what can we get? Let's see the rules for NT11:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT6\nNT11 -> NT28 NT14\n\nSo, each of these would produce a sequence of tokens when the NTs are expanded.\n\nLet me see for each case:\n\nCase 1: NT11 -> NT41 NT6.\n\nNT41 -> t77, as per the grammar.\n\nNT6 -> t6.\n\nSo if NT11 expands to NT41 NT6, the next two tokens after t68 would be t77 and t6.\n\nBut in the string, after t68, the next token is t77, and the one after that is t77, not t6. So that can't be matching.\n\nCase 2: NT11 -> NT28 NT14.\n\nNT28 -> t59.\n\nNT14 -> t42.\n\nSo, if NT11 -> NT28 NT14, the next tokens would be t59 and t42.\n\nLooking at the string: after t68, the next tokens are t77, t77, which doesn't match t59 or t42, so that doesn't fit either.\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I should look for other NT11 rules or see if I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT11 is defined as:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT6\nNT11 -> NT28 NT14\nWait no, from the initial grammar:\n\nLooking back, I list all the NT rules. Let me make sure I have the correct rules for NT11.\n\nWait, the grammar provided includes:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT6\nNT11 -> NT28 NT14?\n\nNo, actually checking the provided grammar again, I think NT11 is defined as:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n...\nNT11 -> NT41 NT6\n...\n\nI think that's correct. So there are no other rules for NT11 besides those two.\n\nSo, given that, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that NT11 can expand further beyond just one step. Maybe it's a multi-step expansion.\n\nSo, starting from NT11, which could either expand as NT41 NT6 or NT28 NT14.\n\nCase 1: NT11 -> NT41 NT6.\n\nNT41 -> t77.\n\nNT6 -> t68.\n\nSo that would produce t77 and t68, but in the string, after t68, the next is t77, but then another t77, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no, because NT41 -> t77, and NT6 -> t68. So the production is t77 followed by t68. But in the string, after t68 (from NT48), the next token is t77, and then another t77. So that doesn't fit.\n\nCase 2: NT11 -> NT28 NT14.\n\nNT28 -> t59.\n\nNT14 -> t42.\n\nSo that would produce t59 followed by t42. However, the string after t68 is t77, which doesn't match t59 or t42, so that doesn't fit"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-269","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. But looking at the grammar here, it seems that some rules have two non-terminals, which is fine because that's allowed in CNF. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammar here fits because each rule has two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nNext, I need to parse the given string against the grammar to see if each token can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is: `t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t31 t25 t81 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t32 t55`.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be generated. Alternatively, I can use a recursive descent parsing method because the grammar is in CNF, which is conducive to such parsing.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals. Let me list them in order:\n1. t68\n2. t77\n3. t26\n4. t65\n5. t77\n6. t31\n7. t25\n8. t81\n9. t59\n10. t28\n11. t77\n12. t77\n13. t81\n14. t25\n15. t32\n16. t55\n\nI need to check if this sequence matches any possible derivation from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. Its production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols following S should be NT48 and NT11. But the first token in the string is t68, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the only terminal that starts with t is t33, t35, etc. But none of the non-terminals directly produce t68. Wait, let me check the production rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT59 NT48. Hmm, that's interesting. Also, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, but NT49 \u2192 t81. Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking for what produces t68: From the grammar, I think NT48 is involved. Wait, the rules for NT48 are: NT48 \u2192 NT59 NT48 | NT49. And NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So NT49 eventually produces t81 because NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, and eventually, NT49 can be t81. Wait, no: looking at the rules, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. Then, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So this looks recursive. Maybe it's better to list all possible terminal productions to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking for all rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal or a product of terminals. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'.\n- NT35 produces 't3'.\n- NT14 produces 't76'.\n- NT40 produces 't65', 't28', 't59', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't25'.\n- NT52 \u2192 't7', 't58', 't55', etc.\n- NT59 \u2192 't24', 't25', 't52', 't12', etc.\n- NT49 \u2192 't81', 't47', etc.\n- NT12 \u2192 't37', 't52', etc.\n- NT44 \u2192 't73', 't76', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'.\n- NT47 \u2192 't48'.\n- And others like NT55, NT37, etc., produce combinations of terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with t68, but in the rules, I don't see any non-terminal producing 't68' directly. Instead, NT48 \u2192 NT59 NT48. So NT48's production can only generate further non-terminals unless it's something that leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, let's look at NT48: NT48 \u2192 NT59 NT48 | NT49. So if NT49 can produce t81, then NT48, when expanded, could eventually derive t81. But t68 is something else. Hmm, this suggests that the first token t68 is not produced by any of the rules. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking again: The rules for NT48 are:\nNT48 \u2192 NT59 NT48 | NT49\nWhat does NT59 do? NT59 can produce 't24', 't25', 't52', etc. But none directly produce t68.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if there's any rule that directly produces 't68'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any production leading directly to 't68'. Therefore, the first token t68 cannot be the result of any production rule, implying that the overall string is invalid.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check the rules again more carefully. Maybe I missed a production for t68.\n\nLooking at all the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't68'. The closest is NT48 \u2192 NT59 NT48 and NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT49. Then, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 \u2192 NT31 NT8 \u2192 ... and so on. It's unclear if any path leads to 't68'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the rules. Let me list all the rules again to ensure I didn't skip any that produce 't68'. Scanning through each rule:\n\n- NT33: t76, t30\n- NT35: t3\n- NT14: t76\n- NT40: t65, t28, t59, etc.\n- NT9: t25, t59\n- NT52: t7, t58, various combinations.\n- NT59: t21, t5, etc.\n- NT49: t81, t47, t9 (if any), etc.\n- Others don't seem to produce t68.\n\nSo, no rule directly produces t68.

{"custom_id":"request-271","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the grammar provided. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT48 NT11. So, every step will involve expanding non-terminals into other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t31 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t4 t25 t32 t77 t47 t4`.\n\nThat's a lot of symbols, so I need to see if each of these can be generated by the grammar. The strategy is to work backwards from the string, trying to match the rightmost symbols, which is a common technique used in top-down parsing or using theCYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to see how each part can be formed.\n\nLet me list out each token and see which non-terminals can produce it. The non-terminals (like NT48, NT11, etc.) eventually produce terminal symbols (t followed by numbers). \n\nStarting from the string:\n\n1. The last token is 't4'. Looking at the grammar, which production rules produce 't4'? Scanning through, I see NT6 -> 't4' (NT6 -> t4). Also, NT49 -> NT16 NT7, and NT16 -> t26, so that would produce 't26'. But 't4' is directly from NT6. So, the last token must come from NT6. So the last step is NT6 -> 't4'.\n\nBefore that, the token is 't47'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't47'. Looking at the grammar, NT47 -> t48, so that's 't48', which is different. Wait, wait, maybe I should check again. Looking through the rules, NT47 -> t48? Wait, no, let me check: looking for 't47' production. Hmm, seems none of the direct productions for non-terminals produce 't47'. Wait, maybe I messed up. Let me check the given grammar again. Wait, I notice that NT47 has a production: NT47 -> 't48', no. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me go through the given grammar rules. Oh, I see some rules produce 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT33 -> 't73', NT33 -> 't30', and so on. Let me check where 't47' comes from. Looking through the rules:\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have misread some of the rules. Let me list some of the production rules for terminals:\n\nLooking through the given rules, here's a sample:\n\n- NT40 -> 't65'\n- NT49 -> 't81'\n- NT25 -> 't58'\n- NT7 -> 't36'\n- NT18 -> 't69'\n- NT59 -> 't12'\n- NT44 -> 't73'\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n- NT55 -> 't83'\n- NT48 -> 't68'\n- NT49 -> 't47'\n- Other rules produce non-terminals.\n\nSo, 't47' is produced by NT49, specifically NT49 -> t47. So before 't47', the token is ... wait, no, the last token is 't47', which comes from NT49. Before that, let's go back: the second last token is 't77', which is produced by NT77? Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't77' directly. Hmm. Let me check the rules again. Oh, wait, perhaps the 't77' comes from a non-terminal. Let me see: Maybe NT77 is in the grammar, but looking through, I don't see any NT with -> 't77'. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see how each token (like t68, t77, etc.) can fit into the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string from the start. Starting with S -> NT48 NT11. So the entire string must start with the terminal parts generated by NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet's take the first token in the string: 't68'. Looking up, NT48 -> 't68'. So that's good. So the first symbol comes from NT48.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, after NT48 is expanded, the next symbol must come from NT11. So the string starts with 't68 t... something that starts with NT11's production.\n\nWait, let's make sure. So S -> NT48 NT11, so the string should start with the first symbol from NT48 and the next symbol (after that) from NT11.\n\nSo string: t68 t77 t31 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t4 t25 t32 t77 t47 t4.\n\nFirst token is t68, which is from NT48. Then the next token should come from NT11.\n\nLooking at the given string, the second token is 't77'. So does NT11 produce 't77'? I don't recall NT11 having a production that starts with t77. Wait, looking at the grammar rules for NT11: I see NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So NT11 produces two non-terminals, which then produce terminals. So from NT11, we have NT41 and NT49.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nAfter S, we have NT48 -> t68, then NT11. NT11: we need to expand NT11 into two non-terminals, then into the next tokens. So the third and fourth tokens in the string should come from NT41 and NT49, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string: third token is 't31', fourth is 't76'. So 't31' should be from NT41, and 't76' from NT49.\n\nLooking at NT41: rule is NT41 -> NT77. Because in the given grammar, one of the rules is NT41 -> t77? Wait, no, NT41's production:\n\nLooking again, the grammar rules: I see NT41 -> t77. Yes, so NT41 -> t77. Therefore, the third token, 't31', must come from NT41, but wait, NT41 produces 't77', not 't31'. That's a problem because the third token is 't31'.\n\nWait, this suggests that the third token, 't31', is supposed to come from NT41, which actually produces 't77', not 't31'. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding NT11. Let's think again: S -> NT48 (t68) and NT11. Now, the next symbols are 't77' and 't31', but NT41 produces 't77', which doesn't align with 't31'. Therefore, this path is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to try another approach. Maybe the second token, 't77', comes from a different expansion of NT11.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, NT11 only has the production NT41 NT49. So after S, we have t68, then NT11. The next symbols must come from NT41 and NT49. Therefore, 't77' must come from NT41, which can produce 't77', but the third token is 't31', which can't come from NT49.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the way the tokens are produced. Let me clarify: S produces NT48 and NT11. So the first token is from NT48, and the second from NT11. Then, NT11 is expanded into two non-terminals, say X and Y, which then produce two tokens. So the third token is from X and the fourth from Y.\n\nSo S -> NT48 X Y NT11 -> X Y (if it's two non-terminals), but in grammar, it's S -> NT48 NT11. So the expansion is step by step, with each non-terminal expanding into other non-terminals, and so on, until terminals are reached"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-290","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex, with multiple production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the right-hand side can sometimes be a terminal, like 't76' or 't24'. The string given is `t68 t77 t31 t55 t77 t77 t47 t4 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t81`. My goal is to parse this string using the grammar rules and see if each step of the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI start by looking at the initial production rule, which is S -> NT48 NT11. Both NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded until they become terminals or further non-terminals. \n\nLet me list out the expansion steps for each part. Starting with NT48. Looking through the rules, NT48 is defined as NT49 NT6. So, to get NT48, I need to expand both NT49 and NT6. \n\nLooking at NT49, it's NT11 NT6. So, that's another pair. And NT11 is NT41 NT49. Hmm, that seems recursive. Wait, let me see these rules again:\n\nNT48 -> NT49 NT6\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nWait, so when I expand NT48, it's NT49 (which is NT11 and NT6) and NT6 (which is NT52 and NT49). But each of these is getting expanded, and there's a cycle here because NT11 expands back to NT41 and NT49, which might go further. This might get complicated quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the production rules. Let's take the string and see if it can be split into subparts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t31 t55 t77 t77 t47 t4 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t81.\n\nI need to see if this can be parsed by the grammar, starting from S which is NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be the expansion of NT48 and NT11. NT48 is NT49 NT6, so the first part should be t49 followed by t6. But looking at the string, the first token is t68, which isn't t49 or t6. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the tokens map to the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the tokens and see if they can be matched to the right-hand sides of the production rules. For example, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal sequence.\n\nBut some rules produce two non-terminals, so each application will consume two tokens in the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\n1. t68\n2. t77\n3. t31\n4. t55\n5. t77\n6. t77\n7. t47\n8. t4\n9. t42\n10. t59\n11. t28\n12. t77\n13. t77\n14. t47\n15. t25\n16. t32\n17. t81\n\nSince S is NT48 NT11, the first step is to expand these into their components. Let's look at each non-terminal's productions.\n\nStarting with NT48:\n\nNT48 -> NT49 NT6\n\nSo, the first two tokens should be derived from NT49 and NT6. The string starts with t68. So does t68 correspond to either NT49 or NT6?\n\nLooking at the definitions:\n\nNT49 is defined as NT11 NT6. NT11 is NT41 NT49, and NT41 is NT77 NT6. Wait, that's a lot of non-terminals. Alternatively, I should check each rule's right-hand sides.\n\nLet me list all the production rules to see which ones can produce a single terminal. That is, any rule where the RHS is two non-terminals, but one of them might be a terminal.\n\nWait, the problem states that it's in Chomsky Normal Form, so all RHS have two non-terminals. So each production is of the form A -> BC, where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, many of them have RHS as two non-terminals, but some have a terminal. For example, NT33 can be 't73' or 't76' or 't30'. So NT33 can be a single terminal.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules provided, I see:\n\nNT33 -> 't73'\nNT33 -> 't76'\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nSo NT33 can produce three different terminals. So in the string, any occurrence of 't73', 't76', or 't30' must come from NT33.\n\nSimilarly, NT40 can produce 't28', 't65', or 't1'.\n\nLet me see if I can identify any matches in the string to these terminals. The string has t68, which I don't see in any terminal of NT33, so that might come from some other rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start building a parsing tree. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each step in the derivation should match parts of the string.\n\nStart with the initial production S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, NT48 -> NT49 NT6, and NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. NT48: generates two parts, let's see what each of these generates. But looking at the production rules, both NT49 and NT6 are non-terminals, so I need to expand these further.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by seeing if the entire string can be split into parts that match the RHS of some rules. Let's look at the string again:\n\nAt the start, t68 t77 t31 t55 t77 t77 t47 t4 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t81.\n\nI need to determine if this sequence is a valid derivation from S.\n\nPerhaps I can process the string from left to right, trying to split it into parts that match the RHS of any rule.\n\nWait, another approach is to parse the string using the grammar, perhaps using a recursive descent parser. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can assign each rule to a function that checks the next two tokens and calls the appropriate recursive functions.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nThe first step is to split the string into tokens as given. Let's list them numerically:\n\n1: t68\n\n2: t77\n\n3: t31\n\n4: t55\n\n5: t77\n\n6: t77\n\n7: t47\n\n8: t4\n\n9: t42\n\n10: t59\n\n11: t28\n\n12: t77\n\n13: t77\n\n14: t47\n\n15: t25\n\n16: t32\n\n17: t81\n\nNow, S is NT48 NT11. So the first production is NT48 -> NT49 NT6 and NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, the string must start with NT49 deriving something and NT6 deriving something else.\n\nLet's look at what NT49 and NT6 produce:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\n\nSo, NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 also produces two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the first four tokens would be NT11, NT6, NT52, NT49, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too deep. Maybe an alternative approach is to check each part sequentially.\n\nAnother idea is to represent the parsing process as a series of reductions, matching the string tokens against the RHS of the production rules.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step:\n\nStart with S: NT48 NT11. So, the derivation starts as S => NT48 NT11.\n\nNow, NT48 -> NT49 NT6.\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, we have NT49 NT6 NT41 NT49.\n\nEach of these non-terminals needs to be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t26 t36 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t49 t25 t84 t3 t55`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is helpful because it simplifies parsing, and we can apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, I'm not sure if I should use CYK here since the string is quite long, and it might take time. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down using the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see which non-terminals can produce the terminals in the string. Let me list out the string and see each 't' followed by numbers. Each segment is a terminal, so each part of the string corresponds to a production.\n\nLooking at the string: t68, t77, t26, t65, t77, t26, t36, t59, t28, t77, t77, t77, t81, t49, t25, t84, t3, t55.\n\nI'll start from the beginning and try to match the productions.\n\n1. The first token is t68. Looking at the grammar, where does t68 come from? Scanning the productions, I see NT49 \u2192 t81, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking again, the production NT48 \u2192 t68. Yes, so t68 comes from NT48. So S starts as NT48 NT11 because the start symbol S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 followed by something.\n\nNext, after t68 comes t77. Let's see where t77 comes from. Looking at the productions, NT7 \u2192 t36, but that's not it. Wait, let me check: NT7 \u2192 t36. So that doesn't have t77. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check NT7: NT7 is actually in a production like NT7 -> NT12 NT43. So it's a non-terminal. Then NT43 is in the production NT43 \u2192 t55. So from NT7, you get t55, but not t77.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for 't77'. Looking through, 't77' is produced by NT7: NT7 \u2192 t36. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, is there another production where t77 comes from? Let me check the list again. Oh, I see: NT49 \u2192 t81, and NT31 \u2192 t20, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps t77 comes from NT52: NT52 \u2192 t7 and t49. Wait, looking back: NT52 \u2192 t7 and t49? Or is it producing terminals? Wait, looking at the grammar, the productions for NT52 include 't7' and 't37' as terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT52 has several productions, some with terminals. For example, look at NT52 \u2192 t7 (perhaps?), but let me check all NT52 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n- NT52 \u2192 t7\n- NT52 \u2192 t25\nWait, no, looking more carefully: looking at the list, NT52 is under other productions. Wait, I think I might have misread. Actually, looking at the list:\n\nThe productions starting with NT52 are:\n- NT52 \u2192 t7 (but that's not exact; let me check: The list has NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57, etc., but not NT52 \u2192 t7. Hmm, maybe I'm misnaming.\n\nWait, let me recheck the entire grammar:\n\nLooking for 't77', I see that in the production NT52 \u2192 t7 and t77: No, I think I might have misread. Looking through all the terminals, I see:\n\nThe productions that produce terminals include:\n- NT11 \u2192 t31 t9 etc., but specifically, looking for t77, I don't see it in the productions. Wait, but in the list, I see:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\n- Is there any NT that produces t77? Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the terminals in the production rules:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t36\n- NT26 \u2192 t26\n- NT16 \u2192 t26\n- NT8 \u2192 t69\n- NT14 \u2192 t42\n- NT43 \u2192 t55\n- NT33 \u2192 t73\n- NT35 \u2192 t27\n- NT48 \u2192 t68\n- NT49 \u2192 t81, t16, t7, etc.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some.

Wait, I see NT77 is not a non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, the productions:\n\nI think I see a production NT47 \u2192 t48, but that's not it. Wait, perhaps 't77' is part of a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the string. Let me list the string again to see each token: t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t26 t36 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t49 t25 t84 t3 t55.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long and the grammar doesn't have a way to produce it. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, another approach is to check if the grammar can produce the given string by checking each step. Let's try to see:\n\nThe first token is t68. That comes from NT48. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which starts with t68.\n\nSo the string starts with t68, which matches NT48.\n\nNow, the production for NT48 is: looking back at the grammar, the only production for NT48 is: NT48 \u2192 t68. Because in the list, looking for NT48... yes, the last few lines say:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t68\n- NT49 \u2192 t47\n\nSo S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols are t68 and whatever NT11 produces.\n\nWait, NT11's production is: NT11 \u2192 t41 t49. So after t68, the next two symbols should be t41 and t49. Wait, but in the string, after t68 comes t77, not t41. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because NT11 produces t41 t49, meaning that after t68 comes t41 and t49, followed by anything NT11 can produce. But in the string, after t68 is t77, which should come from NT11's production, but that's t41 and t49.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps there's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT11 is being used differently. Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT11: NT11 \u2192 t41 t49. So it produces t41 followed by t49. Therefore, in the string, after t68 (t48), the next should be t41 and t49. But the string has t77 after t68, which doesn't match.\n\nSo this suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar as the initial step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is incorrect. Let's verify:\n\nLooking at the grammar's definition of S, it's S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the first step is S \u2192 t68 (from NT48"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each token is a terminal, so the entire string must be generated by expanding non-terminals into these terminals through the grammar.\n\nLet me examine the grammar rules to see if any produce terminals. Scanning through, I see several rules that end with terminals, like `NT33 -> 't73'`, `NT30 -> 't84'`, etc. These are production rules that directly output a single terminal.\n\nMy approach will be to construct a parse tree that starts with the start symbol S and ends with the given string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step in the parse tree is a production where a non-terminal is replaced by two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if the first token, t68, can be generated by any production. Looking at the rules:\n\n- S -> NT48 NT11\n- Let's check NT48: There's a rule `NT48 -> 't68'`. Yes! So S expands to t68 followed by NT11.\n\nToken 1: t68. That matches the first part.\n\nNow, the second symbol is t77. Let's look at NT11's production: `NT11 -> NT41 NT49`. So NT11 would expand into two non-terminals, which means the third symbol will be the first of these (NT41) and the fourth will be the second (NT49).\n\nWait, the string is `t68 t77 t26 ...`, so after t68 is t77, then t26. Let me see:\n\nAfter S (t68), we have NT11 (which is two non-terminals: NT41 and NT49). So the next symbols should be NT41 and then NT49. But the next token is t77, which is a terminal, so NT41 must produce t77? Let me check the grammar for any rules where NT41 => 't77'.\n\nLooking at the rules, search for NT41:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- `NT41 -> 't77'`. Yes! So NT41 produces t77, which matches the second symbol. Then the next part would be NT49, which should produce the next symbol, which is t26.\n\nSo now, the third symbol is t26. Let's check NT49's production: `NT49 -> NT11 NT6`. So NT49 expands into two non-terminals, NT11 and NT6. The next symbols after NT49 should be the expansion of NT11 and then NT6.\n\nSo after t77 (from NT41), the next symbols should be t26. But t26 is a terminal, so that would have to come from NT6 because NT49 is producing NT11 and NT6, and the next symbol is t26. Let me look at NT6's rules:\n\n- Looking through the rules, `NT6 -> 't4'`. Wait, but 't4' is part of the string? The string doesn't have t4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me re-examine the string and mapping:\n\n- t68: S expands to t68 and NT11.\n- t77: NT11 splits into NT41 (t77) and NT49.\n- Next, after t77, should be the expansion of NT49, which is NT11 and NT6. So tokens 3 and 4 would be the expansion of NT49, which is NT11 (could produce t77 again) and NT6.\n\nWait, but in the string after t77, the next token is t26. Let me think: the third token is t26, which must come from NT6, which produces 't4'. Wait, but in the string, after t77 is t26, which is not 't4'. So perhaps I'm getting something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look at the production NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So after t77, the next part would be NT11 (which is t77) and then NT6 (which is t4). But our string after t77 is t26, not t4. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let me try another approach.\n\nMaybe after t68, the next symbol is t77, which comes from NT41, as I thought. Then, after NT41 (t77), NT49 should expand as NT11 and NT6. So the next symbols would be t77 again and then t4. But the string doesn't have t4. So perhaps this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT6 can expand into another terminal or further non-terminals. Let me check NT6's productions.\n\nLooking at NT6: `NT6 -> 't4'` is one rule. So NT6 can't produce anything else besides t4. So after t77 (from NT41), we have NT49, which is NT11 and NT6. Therefore, after t77, we have t77 again (from NT11) and then t4. But our string after t77 is t26, not t4. So this path doesn't seem to work.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that S's production is S -> NT48 NT11, which when expanded becomes t68 (from NT48) and then NT11. But perhaps the NT11's expansion requires more steps. Let me consider the entire string.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to look at the grammar and see which symbols are terminals and non-terminals, and then see how the string can be constructed.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\n- t68, t77, t26, t69, t48, t30, t5, t28, t77, t69, t28, t77, t58, t19, t53, t69, t30, t55.\n\nThese terminals correspond to the following symbols in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT33 can be 't73', 't77', etc.\n- NT30 can be 't84', 't22', etc.\n- NT19 can be 't28', 't77', etc.\n\nI need to see if the string can be generated by a series of rule applications.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the string is generated by starting with S and expanding each non-terminal step by step, matching the tokens at each step.\n\nLet me try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string starts with t68 (since NT48 \u2192 't68').\n\n2. Then we have NT11. From the rules, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So this needs to be split into NT41 and NT49.\n\n3. The next token is t77, which is the expansion of NT41 (since NT41 \u2192 't77').\n\n4. Now, after t77, the next part is NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.\n\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-331","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that the right-hand sides of the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. That fits CNF.\n\nThe string to check is: `t68 t77 t77 t77 t31 t4 t10 t47 t25 t19 t25 t42 t31 t4`. I guess this is a sequence of terminal symbols, so the string is a series of tokens that the grammar needs to derive.\n\nI think the approach here is to analyze the grammar and see if the string can be broken down into sequences that match the productions. Since it's CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string must be built up by replacing non-terminals step by step, each time possibly splitting into smaller parts.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol: S. It's initially S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first step is to split into NT48 and NT11. Then each of those might split further until we can't split anymore, and then the terminals will match the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT48 and NT11 are both non-terminals. Let me see the production for NT48: \n\nFrom the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT9 NT6. Wait, no, looking again: The production is NT48 -> NT33 NT14? Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let me check the rules carefully.\n\nWait, actually, the production for NT33 is a bit tricky. It has several options. One of them is NT33 \u2192 't73' and another is NT33 \u2192 't73' again? Or wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT33: It's written as `NT33 -> 't73'` and then another line: `NT33 -> 't73'`. Hmm, that's duplicated. Maybe it's a typo. But that's fine, it probably means NT33 can produce 't73' in multiple ways, perhaps. But it's unclear why it's duplicated, but perhaps it's redundant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me find where 't68' is in the string. The first token is 't68', so I need to find what NT48 can produce to include 't68'.\n\nLooking at the NT48 production: I don't see NT48 in the rules. Wait, the rules are given in the problem. Let me search for NT48.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, the rule for NT44 is `NT44 -> NT29 NT1`, and NT29 -> NT7 NT35, etc. Wait, I think I need to trace back from the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t68. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t68. Looking at the grammar, the productions:\n\nI see NT6 \u2192 't4' (from 't4'), NT15 \u2192 't76', NT7 \u2192 't36', NT44 \u2192 't68'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT44's productions. Oh, wait, the rules include `NT48 -> 't68'`. Wait, no, the rules have `NT48 -> 't68'` as a production? Wait, looking back:\n\nNo, actually, the rules include:\n\nLooking for 't68' in the right-hand sides of the productions. I see:\n\n- NT44 -> 't68' (from the rules)\n- Other NT tokens have t33, t49, etc.\n\nSo NT44 can produce t68. So, perhaps in the derivation, one of the non-terminals must produce 't68' via NT44.\n\nSo the first token is 't68', so that must come from NT44 \u2192 't68'. Therefore, in the initial split of S \u2192 NT48 NT11, one of them must lead to this 't68'.\n\nLet me see how S splits: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So both NT48 and NT11 are needed to produce the start. But in the string, the first token is 't68', which comes from NT48 \u2192 't68', but wait, wait:\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the entire string must be derived from these two non-terminals. So the entire string is derived from NT48 and NT11. So the tokens come from their respective expansions.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't68', so that must be produced by either NT48 or NT11. Let me check which can produce 't68'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT44 -> 't68' is present. But wait, looking at NT44's production: `NT44 -> NT29 NT1` among others. Wait, no, actually, I might be mixing the rules.\n\nWait, let me parse this carefully. The rules are:\n\nNT48 -> 't68' is one of the productions? Or perhaps I'm miscounting the NT tokens.\n\nWait, the user provided a list where lines start with NT followed by a number, then an arrow, then another NT or 't' and numbers. So each production is in the form NTXY \u2192 either NTAB or a terminal.\n\nSo for example, the first rule is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Then we have NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1, and so on.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 't68'? Let me check:\n\nWait, I'm looking for any rule where the RHS is a terminal, not involving any non-terminals. Looking through the rules, I see a few 't' productions, like:\n\n`NT33 -> 't73'`, `NT33 -> 't73'` (duplicate?), `NT33 -> 't73'`, `NT40 \u2192 't65'`, `NT44 \u2192 't68'`, `NT49 \u2192 't81'`, `NT14 \u2192 't76'`, etc.\n\nAh, yes, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't68'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'\n- NT33 \u2192 't73'\n- NT40 \u2192 't65'\n- Other rule: NT44 also has production NT29 NT1, but that's under the arrow.\n\nSo NT44 can produce 't68', so if one of the S's branches is NT44, it can contribute 't68'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't68' which must come from NT44, which is one of the two non-terminals in S.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT48 NT11. One of them must produce 't68', which would be NT44 if that's the case, but wait, NT48 and NT11 are the immediate children of S. So each of them can split further.\n\nWait, let's rephrase:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11. Each of these non-terminals will expand to produce parts of the string. The entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT48 and NT11.\n\nSo the first token in the string is 't68', which must come from either NT48 or NT11. Let's check which one.\n\nLooking at NT48:\n\nI don't see NT48 in the rules. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Wait, in the provided rules:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT14 \u2192 t76\n- NT44 \u2192 t68\nWait, then the first line after S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the next rule is NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1. So I don't think NT48 is directly a terminal. So perhaps NT48 splits into other non-terminals which eventually produce the terminal t68.\n\nWait, but wait, looking back, the rules after S include NT44 \u2192 't68', so NT44 is a non-terminal that can directly produce t68.\n\nBut for NT48: Do any of its productions lead to a terminal? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nI see NT48 isn't explicitly listed as a production. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules, but perhaps I didn't parse all of them correctly. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n- NT52 \u2192 't7' (among others)\n- Others have 't' productions.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I need to look through all the rules to see where '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar, I need to find if there's a production that starts with S and the first part can lead to `t68`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, S must come from NT48 and NT11. The first production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so after S, we have NT48 and NT11, each of which can produce other symbols.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens since the string is split into separate 't' tokens.

So, the first symbol of the string must come from NT48. Let's see what NT48 can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT48 is not explicitly listed; instead, I see NT48 being part of a production where it's NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.

Or perhaps I'm not scanning correctly.\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar lines again. Scanning through all the entries, I see lines like NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, but no NT48. Hmm. That's a problem because S's first production depends on NT48. Maybe it's a typo in the question. But assuming the grammar is correct, maybe NT48 is defined implicitly. Wait, perhaps I misread the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the list, I see several entries under NT49, NT44, etc.: for example, NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1, NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1, but no NT48.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing it.

NT47 \u2192 NT48. So, NT47 can produce NT48. So, that's one step. So, NT48 is a non-terminal that only appears as part of the production of NT47. So, perhaps the initial S production actually needs to go through NT47, since NT48 is not directly defined.\n\nWait, that's complicating. Let me retrace. S \u2192 NT48 NT11. But NT48 is only defined as part of NT47. So perhaps that's an error, but I have to work with it. Alternatively, maybe NT48 is part of another production. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the initial production S \u2192 NT48 NT11 can be broken down further.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start from the string and work backwards, seeing if I can find the corresponding grammar productions.\n\nLet me look at the first token: t68. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminal can produce t68?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nAlso, looking for any non-terminal that directly produces t68.

Hmm, so perhaps 't68' is directly an output symbol, which means the non-terminal producing it must be one that's defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan all the production rules again.\n\nWait, in the initial list:\n\nUnder NT49, I see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and also NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7. So, NT49 can produce 't6' and 't7'. Hmm.\n\nLooking for 't68': Hmm, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't68'.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is correct, and NT48 is part of S, but then we have to see how it's connected.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make a chart.

{"custom_id":"request-351","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t68 t77 t77 t77 t47 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t26 t37 t55 t49 t25 t22 t3 t47 t49`.\n\nFirst, I should remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, many of the productions end with a single terminal symbol, which are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the first production is S -> NT48 NT11. So the initial step would be to see if the string starts with NT48 NT11. Translating that, if NT48 is 't68' and NT11 is 't77', then the first two tokens of the string should match.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't68' and the second is 't77'. Does NT48 produce 't68'? Yes, because the production NT48 -> 't68' is in the grammar. Similarly, NT11 -> 't77' is also present. So the first two tokens are correct.\n\nNow, moving forward, the next production should be NT44 -> NT42 NT13. Because in CNF, each intermediate step will replace a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. So after NT48 and NT11, we need to split NT48 into its children, but wait, actually, since S is divided into NT48 and NT11, each of those is processed separately.\n\nSo first, let's process NT48. The production is NT48 -> 't68', which is a terminal, so that's done. Then, we process NT11. The production for NT11 is -> NT41 NT49. So we replace NT11 with NT41 and NT49, each of which need to be processed. Now, the string continues with t77 t77 t77 t47 t42 t59 t28 etc., which are 19 tokens. Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string step by step, replacing non-terminals with their right-hand sides until all are terminals.\n\nStarting with S -> NT48 NT11. So the expansion starts with NT48 and NT11.\n\nNT48 -> 't68' and NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So the string after processing S would be 't68 NT41 NT49', but wait, actually, each step replaces a non-terminal. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nEach step is replacing a non-terminal in the current expansion with its production. So starting with S, we have S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nThe initial string is [NT48, NT11]. Now, replace NT48 with 't68' since it produces t68. Now the string becomes ['t68', NT11].\n\nNext, process NT11, which is replaced by NT41 NT49. So the string becomes ['t68', NT41, NT49].\n\nNow, replace NT41 and NT49 with their productions. Let's find the production for NT41.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT41 has a production: NT41 -> 't77'. So replace NT41 with 't77'.\n\nSimilarly, NT49's production: looking at the grammar, NT49 is in multiple productions as a terminal. Wait, let me check. Wait, NT49: from the grammar, there are several productions, but I think the key one is NT49 -> NT11 NT6, but no, wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar entries for NT49: it's mentioned as NT49 -> NT11 NT6, but then looking for terminals, I see NT49 -> NT11 is not present. Wait, let me parse through the grammar entries again.\n\nLooking at the top, the grammar is a list. It says:\n\nNT33 -> 't73'\n...\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\nNT49 -> NT12 NT6\nWait, no, I need to look carefully. The user provided a long list of grammar productions.\n\nLooking under NT49: the grammar includes:\n\nNT49 -> 't16' 't26' [Wait, no, looking through the list: The user wrote:\n\n\"NT49 -> NT16 NT7\" (found earlier in the list), so it's a production.\n\nBut looking at the string, we have t68, then t77, t77, t77, t47, t42, t59, etc.\n\nWait, after replacing NT11 with NT41 and NT49, the current processing is ['t68', 't77', NT49], because NT41 is 't77'.\n\nNow, replace NT49 with one of its productions. Let's see, which one applies to the context here.\n\nLooking for NT49: the grammar has NT49 -> 't16' 't26? Wait, looking back, the user's grammar includes:\n\n\"NT49 -> NT16 NT7\" and \"NT49 -> NT12 NT6\" and \"NT49 also -> 't81' and others?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the relevant NT49 productions:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\nNT49 -> 't16' 't26' ?\n\nWait, no. The specific grammar provided by the user includes multiple entries for NT49, but wait:\n\nLooking back, the user provided:\n\n\"NT49 -> NT16 NT7\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT49 -> 't16' 't26'\"\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me go through the grammar entries:\n\nUnder NT49:\n\n\"NT49 -> NT11 NT6\"\n\n\"NT49 -> NT12 NT6\"\n\n\"NT49 -> NT12 NT49\"\n\nWait, no. Let me see the exact lines:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nI don't see a direct terminal production for NT49 except possibly in this line: \"NT33 -> 't73'\" but that's for NT33.\n\nWait, no. For NT49, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT49 -> NT16 NT7\"\n\n\"NT49 -> 't16' 't26'\"\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me check the part where NT49 is in the grammar:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"NT6 -> NT52 NT49\"\n\n\"NT49 -> NT11 NT6\"\n\n\"NT49 -> NT16 NT7\"\n\nSo, NT49 can produce 't16' 't26'?

No, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking again: the user writes:\n\n\"NT49 -> NT16 NT7\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT49 -> 't81'\"\n\nWait, no, looking at the exact line:\n\nThe user wrote: \"NT49 -> NT16 NT7\"\n\nBut also other lines like:\n\n\"NT33 -> 't73'\"\n\n\"NT33 -> 't30'\"\n\nSo, I think I missed that NT49 has a terminal production. Let me see the user's list again:\n\nHere's the grammar:\n\n[Long list of productions]\n\nI see at some point: \"NT49 -> 't16' 't26'\"?

Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking at the user-provided grammar, the lines are:\n\n\"NT33 -> 't73'... up to\"\n\n\"NT49 -> NT16 NT7\"\n\nLater, other NT49 productions:\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, \"NT49 -> 't47'\".\n\nWait, perhaps I should verify each line.

{"custom_id":"request-357","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let's start by understanding the grammar structure first.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I notice that most of them have two non-terminals on the right side, except for some that have a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. So, for example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is fine. But I need to check if all the non-terminals expand further until they reach terminals.\n\nNow, the string given is: t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t36 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t49 t25 t10 t48 t73 t15.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t68, t77, etc., which are terminals. So I'll need to see if there's a way to derive this sequence from the start symbol S by breaking it down step by step.\n\nStarting from S, the production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, S splits into NT48 and NT11. Each of these needs to produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLet's look at NT48 and NT11 one by one.\n\nFirst, NT48. The production for NT48 is NT49. So NT48 \u2192 NT49. Then, NT49 has the production NT48 NT6. So NT49 \u2192 NT48 NT6. Wait, but NT48 is again the same as before, which might lead to recursion. But let me look further.\n\nLooking at NT49, another production is NT16 NT7. So NT49 can also go to NT16 NT7. Let's see which path to take.\n\nIf I choose NT49 \u2192 NT48 NT6, then NT48 is again NT49, leading to an infinite loop unless we have a way to break it down into terminals. However, looking at NT49's rules, there's also NT16 NT7. Let's take the second path.\n\nSo NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7. Now, NT16's production is NT26 NT76. So NT16 \u2192 NT26 NT76. Then NT76 is a terminal (as per the rules). So NT16 expands to t26 t76.\n\nNext, NT7: wait, the string starts with t68, so maybe there's a different path. Hmm, perhaps I got lost. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the initial string starts with t68, which is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, we have a production like NT48 \u2192 t48 (from NT48 -> t48). But in the grammar provided, I see NT48's productions: it goes to NT49 and itself as NT48. Wait, looking back, the given grammar has some entries like NT44 -> NT29 NT1, but others are direct terminals. Wait, looking through the given grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT33 -> 't73'\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n- NT31 -> 't8'\n- NT25 -> 't58'\n- NT40 -> 't65'\n- NT41 -> 't77'\n- NT52 -> 't7'\n- NT52 -> 't55' and others, but wait, some non-terminals produce a terminal and non-terminal, like NT48 -> t68, because in the given grammar, I see NT48 has a production: NT48-> t48. Wait, no: looking through the given grammar, I can see for example, NT44\u2192NT29 NT1, but some non-terminals directly go to a terminal.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Scanning through the productions:\n\nLooking at NT44: it has rules like NT44 -> NT29 NT1, but also others? No, actually, each NT has multiple productions. For example, NT33 has two rules leading to 't73' and 't30', while NT48 is a terminal t48, right? Let me scan the given productions again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT48 -> t48 is present? Wait, yes, I saw 'NT48 -> 't48''. Wait, actually, looking carefully, in the given grammar, I have:\n\n\"NT48 -> 't68'\" which is present.\n\nSimilarly, NT49 has a production that leads to 't47' (from \"NT49 -> 't47'\"), and so on. So some of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nThis is crucial. So, let me re-examine the grammar. Non-terminals can either produce a terminal or two other non-terminals. The key is to figure out the derivation steps that can lead to the given string.\n\nThe string starts with t68, so looking for a non-terminal that can produce t68. Looking through the grammar, NT48 has a production to t68: NT48 -> t68.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Let's consider NT48 \u2192 t68. Then, we have NT11 left, which must expand to t77, t26, etc. So the string starts with t68, followed by t77, etc.\n\nSo, after t68, comes t77: let's see the second part.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t36 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t49 t25 t10 t48 t73 t15.\n\nAfter the initial t68 (from S \u2192 NT48), the next token is t77, which should come from NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11, the grammar production is NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nNow, we need to expand NT41 and NT49. Let's see their productions:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t77 (from \"NT41 -> 't77'\").\n- NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7.\n\nSo NT49 will expand into NT16 NT7.\n\nNow, NT16's production is NT26 NT76. So NT16 \u2192 t26 t76.\n\nAnd NT7: from the string, the next token is t77, which is a terminal. Wait, but NT7 in the grammar has a production NT7 \u2192 ... looking at the given grammar:\n\nLooking through, NT7 has production: NT73 \u2192 t73, but NT7 itself has a production NT7 \u2192 t7. Or wait, checking the grammar, I don't see NT7 \u2192 t7 directly, but let me scan:\n\nIn the grammar, I see something like NT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37, but not NT7. Wait, looking through the given grammar, I don't see any production for NT7 that leads directly to a terminal. Only NT7's production is NT7 \u2192 t7, but looking back, the given grammar doesn't have that. Wait, actually, I found that NT7's production is actually NT73 \u2192 t73 but NT76 is 't76'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing non-terminals. Let me list all the non-terminals and see which ones directly produce terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar, the direct terminal productions are:\n\n- NT48 -> 't68'\n- NT33 -> 't73' and 't30'\n- NT31 -> 't8' and also 't8' is sometimes combined with others\n- NT25 -> 't58' and 't55'\n- NT40 -> 't65', 't28', 't1'\n- NT14 -> 't76', 't42'\n- NT43 -> 't55'\n- NT49 -> 't47' and also other combinations\n- NT52 -> 't7', 't55', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all the terminals in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-377","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol leads to exactly two other symbols. That's standard for Chomsky normal form, so that's good.\n\nThe string I'm supposed to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t26 t36 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t7 t26 t53 t25 t19 t25 t76 t55`.\n\nThat's quite a long string with 21 tokens. Each token starts with 't' followed by a number. Looking at the non-terminal productions, I see that some of these tokens are literals (like t68, t77, etc.), while others might be non-terminals like NT numbers.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived by the grammar. To do that, I'll try to build a parse tree or figure out the possible way the productions can lead to this string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The first production for S is `S -> NT48 NT11`. So the string must start with symbols that can derive to NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet's break it down. Each non-terminal symbol in the string must match a production in the grammar except for the terminal tokens. So, for example, NT48 must be a non-terminal that can produce the string starting from the first 't68'.\n\nWait, let's see: NT48 isn't a non-terminal in the grammar. Looking back, the non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT48, NT44, etc. But the literals like t68, t77 are terminals. So, for NT48, it must produce a sequence of terminals. Let's check which production NT48 has.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT48 isn't listed as a non-terminal in the given grammar. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, all the production rules are listed, so NT48 isn't a non-terminal. So the string starts with 't68', which is a terminal, and the rule that starts with S produces NT48 and NT11. So for NT48 to produce 't68', I have to find a production for NT48 that only consists of terminals, but in the grammar, I don't see any. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up NT numbers.\n\nWait, let me look again. The grammar production rules only involve non-terminals like NT48, NT44, etc. So each of these non-terminals must produce a sequence of terminals. So, for example, if NT48 has a production that eventually leads to all terminals, then the string can start with 't68'.\n\nBut looking through the rules, I don't see any rule that defines NT48 except perhaps if it's defined in a production. Wait, in the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any production for NT48 except for the start symbol S -> NT48 NT11. But NT48 isn't a non-terminal that's defined elsewhere, so unless it's a typo, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any non-terminals in the rules produce 't68' when expanded. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the first production after the start symbol is NT48. So the first step is S -> NT48 NT11. So then, both NT48 and NT11 must be expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking at NT48, is there any production in the grammar for NT48? Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see NT48 as a non-terminal. Wait, S -> NT48 NT11, but in the grammar, I don't see any production for NT48. Hmm. That seems odd. Did I miss it?\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is given as the full list, but I might be getting mixed up because the grammar provided is in a particular format. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules provided, I see NT48 in S, but in the rules, NT48 doesn't appear as a left-hand side in any production. So wait, that means that either S cannot actually produce NT48 NT11 if NT48 has no further productions, which would imply that the string starting with 't68' is impossible, since S would require NT48 to expand, but if NT48 isn't defined further, that production is invalid.\n\nWait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form requires that all productions are of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. But in the given grammar, it's all in the form of two non-terminals except for some that end in terminals.\n\nLooking at the first production: S -> NT48 NT11. That's two non-terminals on the right, so it's fine. But then, if NT48 is a non-terminal, it must have a production. But in the given list, none of the NTs except for a few have production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all the non-terminals to make sure I'm not missing any:\n\nThe non-terminals are all starting with NT, followed by numbers.

However, some of them lead to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT33->'t73'\n- NT33->'t30'\n- NT33->'t3'\n\nSo, when NT33 is expanded, it produces either 't73', 't30', or 't3'. Similarly, other NTs have rules that produce terminals.\n\nNow, going back to the string. The first token is 't68'. So, the expansion of NT48 must start with 't68'.

{"custom_id":"request-375","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar looks pretty complex with a bunch of production rules, and the string I have to check is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out the production rules to get a better overview. The grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11. So every string generated by this grammar must start with NT48 and NT11. Wait, but each non-terminal (NT) can either be another non-terminal or a terminal (like 't' followed by a number). \n\nLooking at the string: `t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t37 t31 t10 t47 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t76 t15`. So it's a sequence of txxx tokens. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, it produces NT48 NT11. So the initial step is to see how these Nts can expand into the string. NT48 and NT11 must each expand into a series of symbols that, when combined, form the string.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT48 -> 't68'. Oh, so NT48 can directly produce a terminal 't68'. That's the first token in the string. So that part matches.\n\nNow, after NT48 -> 't68', the next part is NT11. NT11's production rules are: NT11 -> NT41 NT49 or NT31 NT58 or NT13 NT52 or NT37 NT44 or NT19 NT41. Wait, looking back at the rules:\n\nActually, checking the grammar again, I realize that the production for NT11 is actually multiple options. Let me list them properly:\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49 | NT31 NT58 | NT13 NT52 | NT37 NT44 | NT19 NT41.\n\nSo, after NT48's 't68', the next token in the string is 't77'. So we need to see how NT11 can produce something that starts with 't77'. Looking at the rules for NT11:\n\nNT11's possible expansions are combinations of other Nts. For example, NT37 NT44, where NT37 is 't48' and NT44 is 't66'. Wait, but in the string, after 't68', the next is 't77'. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the start using the grammar. Since it's a CFG, I can try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet's see: S -> NT48 NT11. So the string must start with what NT48 can produce. Looking at NT48's rules: NT48 -> 't68'. So the first token is 't68', which matches the string's first token.\n\nSo after that, NT11 must produce the remaining string. So the string after 't68' is 't77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t37 t31 t10 t47 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t76 t15'.\n\nSo we have 't77' as the next token. So we need NT11 to expand to a production that starts with 't77'. Looking at NT11's production rules again:\n\nLooking for any production that starts with 't77'. Let's check each:\n\n1. NT11 -> NT41 NT49: Let's see what NT41 and NT49 produce. NT41 -> 't77'. NT49 -> 't81'. So NT41 NT49 would be 't77 t81', which starts with 't77'. That fits because the next token is 't77'.\n\nSo that seems promising. So after NT48's 't68', the next part is NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So now we have:\n\nt68 followed by the expansion of NT41 and NT49.\n\nSo let's split the remaining string into two parts: after 't68', we have 't77' as the first token of NT41's expansion, then 't81' as from NT49. Wait, but the string after 't68' is 't77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t37 t31 t10 t47 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t76 t15'.\n\nSo after 't68', the next tokens are 't77', 't26', etc. So if NT41 is 't77' and NT49 is 't81', but 't81' is not the next token. The next token is 't26'. So maybe this path doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. If NT11 -> NT41 NT49, then the first symbol after 't68' would be the expansion of NT41, which is 't77', leaving the rest to be expanded by NT49. But the next token is 't77', followed by 't26', not 't81'. So that doesn't fit because NT49 would produce 't81', but the next token is 't26'.\n\nHmm, so maybe that's not the right path. Let me check other options for NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11 -> NT31 NT58. Let's see what NT31 and NT58 produce.\n\nNT31 -> 't37'. Wait, no, looking at the production rules, NT31 has some options. Let's check:\n\nNT31 -> NT12 NT32 or NT8 NT35.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules again:\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify which Nts are terminals and which are non-terminals. So according to the rules, any NT that ends with 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So NT31 as a terminal would be 't37' if it's directly that, but looking at the rules, NT31 has productions:\n\nNT31 -> NT12 NT32 | NT8 NT35.\n\nWait, that's not a terminal. So both options for NT31 are other Nts, not terminals. So NT31 is a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT58's rules are: NT58 -> NT31 NT33.\n\nNT31 is non-terminal, and NT33 can be 't73' or 't30' or 't30' as per its rules. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT33's rules: NT33 -> 't73' and 't30'. So it's a non-terminal that can expand to either 't73' or 't30'.\n\nSo going back to NT11 -> NT31 NT58. So NT31 followed by NT58. NT31 can be NT12 NT32 or NT8 NT35. Let's see what those produce.\n\nFirst, NT12: NT12 has several rules, like NT12 -> NT39 NT32; NT52 -> NT14 NT32; and others. But NT12 itself is a non-terminal because all its rules are combinations of other Nts.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this using a top-down parsing method, starting from S and trying to match the string step by step.\n\nSo, S -> NT48 NT11. NT48 produces 't68', which matches the first token. Then, NT11 must produce the rest of the string.\n\nSo NT11 can be any of its options. Let's check each option:\n\n1. NT11 -> NT41 NT49. As before, NT41 -> 't77' and NT49 -> 't81'. So this would produce 't77 t81', but the string after 't68' starts with 't77 t26', so this doesn't fit.\n\n2. NT11 -> NT31 NT58. So NT31 must produce the next symbol 't77', but as per its rules, NT31 can't produce 't77' directly because it's a non-terminal. So perhaps the next token would be the first symbol of NT31's expansion, which would be... Wait, looking at NT31's options: NT31 -> NT12 NT32 or NT8 NT35.

{"custom_id":"request-394","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string to be checked: `t68 t77 t31 t42 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t32 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t5 t25 t76 t15`. \n\nI need to break this down step by step. The string is a sequence of tokens, each starting with 't' and a number. The grammar seems to have a variety of productions that produce these terminal tokens, so my approach will be to work backwards from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the entire string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S -> NT48 NT11. So, the first two symbols in the string must come from NT48 and NT11. Let me check the string: the first token is 't68', so does NT48 produce 't68'? Looking up NT48 -> NT14 NT35. Then NT14 -> NT7 NT35, and NT35 -> NT30 NT32. \n\nWait, but the first token is 't68'. Let me check what each of these non-terminals produce. From the grammar, NT6 -> 't4', NT29 -> 't5', NT37 -> 't32', NT59 -> 't24', etc. But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this more systematically.\n\nLet me parse the string into a list of tokens:\n[\"t68\", \"t77\", \"t31\", \"t42\", \"t59\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t31\", \"t25\", \"t32\", \"t26\", \"t65\", \"t31\", \"t59\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t31\", \"t25\", \"t5\", \"t25\", \"t76\", \"t15\"]\n\nI think the best way is to build the parse tree from the bottom up, starting from S. Alternatively, I can try to work backwards, expanding each part until I reach the terminals.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT48 NT11. So, the string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet's look at NT48. From the grammar, NT48 is not a terminal, but it's in the production S -> NT48 NT11. Looking at NT48's productions: There's a production from NT28 -> NT59, and NT59 appears in NT48's productions. Wait, looking back, I see NT48 -> NT55 NT25, and NT25 is NT14 NT35. So maybe I need to break this down further.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should look for terminals in the string and see if they match the possibilities in the grammar. For example, 't68' appears first. Looking at the grammar rules, NT48 is involved in 't68'. Wait, in the grammar, does any NT produce 't68'? Let me check the rules:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT48 -> NT55 NT25\nNT25 -> NT14 NT35\nNT14 -> NT7 NT35\nNT35 -> NT30 NT32\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\nNT30 -> NT8 NT43\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\nNT43 -> NT35 NT30\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\nNT9 -> 't25'\nNT37 -> NT32 NT35\nWait, I'm looking for a production that directly results in a 't68'. However, looking at the rules, I don't see any directly producing 't68' except possibly through a chain of productions.\n\nBut hold on, looking back, I see NT49 -> NT11 NT6, and NT6 -> 't4', but that's not helpful for 't68'. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me see the string again. The first token is 't68'. Is there a non-terminal that can produce 't68'? Looking through the rules, let's check NT48 -> NT55 NT25. But NT55 is NT59 NT72, and NT72 is NT57 NT24, which is NT37, so it seems very nested.\n\nWait, perhaps 't68' is a terminal, so maybe a production from NT48 or NT11 directly. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any direct production that results in 't68'. So perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see a line: NT48 -> t68? No, actually looking here: The grammar lines don't directly show any NT producing 't68' except for NT48. Wait, no, the lines I see are:\n\nLooking specifically, I see NT48 -> NT55 NT25, and NT25 is in NT14 and NT35. There's no line that directly shows a production like NT48 -> 't68'. So that suggests that the initial 't68' would have to come from a deeper expansion of NT48.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's start from the beginning of the string and try to see if I can find a way to break it down into the grammar's productions.\n\nThe first token is 't68'. Is there any non-terminal that can produce 't68' when expanded? From the grammar, looking for 't68' in the terminals. It seems that NT49 -> 't68' isn't directly present. Wait, no: Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nI see that in one of the productions, it's NTL48 -> 't68' is not directly a production. Wait, perhaps I need to check all terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I see several NT's breaking down into terminal symbols.\n\nFor example: NT33 -> 't73' and 't30'; NT30 -> 't65'; NT35 -> 't3'; NT15 -> 't5'; etc.\n\nWait, no NT directly produces 't68'. Then, how can the string start with 't68'? That suggests that perhaps the initial NT48 doesn't produce 't68' directly. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the initial production wrong. The start symbol S is NT48 followed by NT11. But S is S -> NT48 NT11. So NT48 and NT11 are two separate NTs. So the string must be the concatenation of NT48's expansion and NT11's expansion.\n\nThe first token is 't68', which would have to come from NT48's expansion because the first part starts with NT48.\n\nBut NT48's immediate expansion is NT55 and NT25. So perhaps NT55 or NT25 produces a string that starts with 't68', but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe after expanding further, the combined expansion starts with 't68'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the string doesn't start directly with 't68', but with a deeper expansion. So perhaps the first step is to see if the entire string can be broken down as S -> NT48 NT11, and both parts expand into their respective sequences.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step:\n\nLooking at the string, there are 22 tokens. Let's denote them as pos1 to pos22:\n\nt68, t77, t31, t42, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t32, t26, t65, t31, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t5, t25, t76, t15.\n\nI need to figure out how to split these into two parts, corresponding to NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet's assume S -> NT48 NT11. So, string = NT48_expansion + NT11_expansion.\n\nThe first part, NT48, would consume some initial tokens, and the remaining would be from NT11.\n\nSo I'll start by trying to parse the first part as NT48.\n\nLooking at NT48, its productions are:\n\nNT48 -> NT55 NT25\n\nBut NT55 -> NT72 NT24, which then breaks down further.

For example, t68 directly appears as a terminal in a production rule: NT48 -> 't68' (since NT48 -> t68 from the grammar as per some rule, like NT48 -> T68 directly, though I need to check). Wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT48 -> 't68' (I think there's a rule like NT48 -> t68, or maybe NT48 is a terminal.

Let me list all the possible terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can identify the terminals as:\n\n- 't68' (from NT48)\n- 't77' (multiple places, like NT48, NT33, etc.)\n- 't77' again\n- 't77' again\n- 't81' (from NT49)\n- 't10' (from NT11)\n- 't77' again\n- 't77' again\n- 't81' again\n- 't49' (from NT11)\n- 't4' (from NT6)\n- 't42' (from NT14)\n- 't65' (from NT29)\n- 't77' again\n- 't26' (from NT20 and NT52)\n- 't28' (from NT19)\n- 't25' (from NT37 and NT44)\n- 't19' (from NT19 as a terminal)\n- 't25' (as a terminal)\n- 't76' (from NT20 and NT33)\n- 't26' again\n- 't53' (from NT20)\n\nWait, but let's confirm the exact terminals. Looking through each production:\n\nNT33 -> 't73' and 't30'. Wait, no, in the problem statement, some of the production rules have terminals:\n\nNT33 -> 't73' and 't73' or 't30'? Wait, the user's message lists some rules, but it's a bit confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-412","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t68 t77 t77 t81 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t27 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t15`, and the grammar consists of a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit that form because every rule either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. So that checks out.\n\nThe next step is to see how to approach verifying whether the string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parsing can be done using a method similar to the CYK algorithm, but maybe there's a simpler way since all the terminals are single symbols and the productions are limited.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to find a derivation path that corresponds to the given string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if each terminal can be generated by the grammar in the correct order, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t68 t77 t77 t81 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t27 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t32 t15`. That's 23 tokens long. So the starting symbol S must expand into a sequence that produces exactly these 23 tokens.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So S = NT48 followed by NT11.\n\nNow, let's see what NT48 and NT11 produce. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\nDT48 is broken down into NT11 and NT6. Then, NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 (NT11 NT6) (NT41 NT49). So the entire string must be a combination of these expansions.\n\nThis seems a bit complex. Maybe I can draw the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S: it's NT48 followed by NT11. So each of these will expand into two non-terminals each.\n\nSo S: NT48, NT11\nNT48 \u2192 NT11, NT6\nNT11 \u2192 NT41, NT49\nSo putting part of that together, the beginning could be NT48 (which breaks into NT11 and NT6) followed by NT11 (which breaks into NT41 and NT49). So the first four symbols would be NT11, NT6, NT41, NT49, each of which then needs to produce their own terminals.\n\nWait, no. NT48 is a single non-terminal that expands into two non-terminals, so in the first step, S produces two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. Each of these will themselves be replaced by their respective productions.\n\nSo let's think of S as expanding into NT48 and NT11, which each expand into two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the way to generate the string is through a series of steps where each non-terminal is replaced, building up the string.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to build up the parsing. Let's consider the string and see if it can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t68, so perhaps the first symbol is t68, which must be generated by a rule ending with a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see rules that produce single terminals. Let's see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t4 (from the end of some rules) but wait, looking at NT6's rules: NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, but I'm looking for a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, for the non-terminals, some have productions that include a terminal. For example, NT49 appears in a few rules: NT33 \u2192 t73 and t3, but wait, looking carefully through the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that end with a terminal, like NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, which are both non-terminals, so they don't immediately produce a terminal. Wait, maybe NT49 has a production that does end with a terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar provided:\n\nI see NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1, but NT18 is a non-terminal. NT33 \u2192 t76 and t30. So, for example, NT33 \u2192 t76 or t30, so those are terminals. So NT33 can produce 't33' which can be 't76' or 't30'.\n\nLooking for where the terminals appear directly, like NT12 \u2192 some rules, but I see NT52 \u2192 t7 or t55, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nLet me scan through each rule:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 t76, t30. So NT33 can produce t76 or t30.\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35. NT30 is another non-terminal, so it hasn't directly produced anything yet.\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Not terminals yet.\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t24, t12, t59 \u2192 t24 or t12 or t59. So NT59 can produce t24, t12, or t59 (which is itself? Wait, but that's a problem if we're expanding. Wait, probably no, because t59 is a terminal.)\n\nWait, the grammar has definitions like NT59 \u2192 NT21 NT59 \u2192 something? Wait, let me see. The rules for NT59:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT21 NT59 \u2192 but wait no, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT21 NT59 is not, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57\n\nNT13 \u2192 t5\n\nNT20 \u2192 t26, etc.\n\nBut many non-terminals produce other non-terminals. The only terminals I see are when a non-terminal directly expands into a terminal instead of further rules. For example, NT33 can produce t76 or t30, meaning when you have NT33, it can terminate as a terminal. Similarly, some NTs produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the full list:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 t76 or t30 (terminals)\n- NT37 \u2192 t32 or t5 (terminals)\n- NT30 \u2192 t84 or t22 (terminals)\n- NT7 \u2192 t36 (terminal)\n- NT29 \u2192 t5 (terminal)\n- NT19 \u2192 t28 (terminal)\n- NT18 \u2192 t69 (terminal)\n- NT52 \u2192 t7 or t55 (terminals)\n- NT59 \u2192 t24, t12, or t59 as a terminal? Wait, actually, NT59's rules are:\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn the grammar, NT59 \u2192 NT21 NT59 \u2192 ... ?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the provided grammar:\n\nThe production rules are listed as:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT37 \u2192 't32' or 't5'; NT35 \u2192 't3' ; NT30 \u2192 't84' or 't22' ; NT7 \u2192 't36' ; NT29 \u2192 't5' ; NT19 \u2192 't28' ; NT18 \u2192 't69' ; NT52 \u2192 't7' or 't55' ; NT59 \u2192 't24' or 't12' or 't59' ?\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-409","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and my task is to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Additionally, every non-terminal symbol (except the start symbol) has exactly one production rule, which makes parsing easier using algorithms like the CYK algorithm. The start symbol here seems to be S, as the first production is S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t77 t69 t48 t... etc.` It's a bit long, but I can process it step by step.\n\nSince I'm a bit new to this, I'll start by writing down the grammar rules and the string. Then, I'll try to see if I can break down the string into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions are combinations of non-terminals and terminals. The non-terminals eventually resolve to terminal symbols, which are the 't' strings and numbers. For example, NT33 can be 't73' or 't76', so that's a terminal.\n\nMy plan is to parse the string from left to right, seeing if each part can be derived from the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the beginning of the string. The first part is 't68'. Looking into the grammar, the production for NT48 is 't68'. So, 't68' matches NT48. The next part after NT48 in the production is NT11. So, after 't68', the next element should be whatever NT11 can derive.\n\nLooking at NT11, there are two options: it can be 't31' or 't39'. Wait, actually, looking back, the production for NT11 is NT52 NT49. So, NT11 isn't a terminal itself; it resolves into two non-terminals. Hmm, so the initial production S -> NT48 NT11 means S = NT48 NT11. So after 't68', we have to match NT11, which is NT52 NT49.\n\nSo the string starts as t68 t77 t77 t69 t48 t... Wait, actually, the initial production is S -> NT48 NT11, so the string should start with the first symbols of NT48 and NT11's expansion.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't68', which matches NT48. The next part after 't68' should be the first symbol of NT11's expansion, which is NT52. Looking at NT52, its production is NT14 NT32. So the next symbol after 't68' should be either 't14' or 't... wait, let me check the grammar again for NT52.\n\nWait, NT52 is produced by NT7 and NT35? No, looking again, actually, let me check the grammar rules properly. Wait, the grammar as given is a list of rules, each starting with the non-terminal on the left and having two symbols on the right.\n\nSo, for example, NT48 -> NT6 NT49. Wait no, looking at the list, the first few rules are:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nWait, perhaps I need to structure this better. Let me make a list of all the rules to see which non-terminals produce which terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nBut this might take a while, so maybe I should focus on the string and see if each part can be matched step by step.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t72 t58 t19 t69 t48 t73 t37 t15 t3 t28 t77 t69 t28 t77 t58 t19 t76 t15\n\nWait, wait, the user provided the string with spaces as 't68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t72 t58 t19 t69 t48 t73 t37 t15 t3 t28 t77 t69 t28 t77 t58 t19 t76 t15'. But I notice that each part is separated by a space, but in the problem statement, it's written as individual tokens. Wait, actually, in the problem, the string is written as a sequence like `t68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t72 t58 t19 t69 t48 t73 t37 t15 t3 t28 t77 t69 t28 t77 t58 t19 t76 t15`. So each space represents a token. So the actual string is: [\"t68\", \"t77\", \"t26\", \"t69\", \"t48\", \"t72\", \"t58\", \"t19\", \"t69\", \"t48\", \"t73\", \"t37\", \"t15\", \"t3\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t69\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t58\", \"t19\", \"t76\", \"t15\"]\n\nWait, but in the initial response, the user says the string is `t68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t72 t58 t19 t69 t48 t73 t37 t15 t3 t28 t77 t69 t28 t77 t58 t19 t76 t15`. So that's a total of 23 tokens.\n\nNow, the grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT48 NT11. So the first two tokens should be NT48 and NT11's expansion.\n\nNT48's production is T68. So the first token is t68, matching NT48. Then, the next token should be the first part of NT11's expansion.\n\nWait, NT11's production is NT52 NT49. So the first token of NT11's expansion is NT52, and the second is NT49. So after t68, the next token should be whatever NT52 produces. But NT52's production is NT7 NT35. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find that NT52 has multiple productions. For example, NT52 -> NT7 NT35, NT52 -> NT25 NT59, etc. Wait, no, looking through the list, I see:\n\nI see NT52 has the following productions:\n\nLooking at the original grammar list:\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\n\nWait, no, checking again:\n\nWait, going through the grammar, the NT52 rules are:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the following rules, but it's a lot.

{"custom_id":"request-436","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar, right? The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it has specific rules that make parsing easier, but for generation checks, I might not need a parser. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar provided. The grammar seems to consist of non-terminals on the left side and their productions. Each production is of the form X \u2192 Y Z, where X, Y, Z are non-terminals or terminals. And importantly, every production can only have two symbols on the right side. The initial symbol is S, and all other non-terminals are terminal-reachable except maybe S? Wait, no, looking closer, S is rewritten as NT48 NT11, which are non-terminals, so the starting point is that all symbols in the string must be products of these productions.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t26 t53 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t65 t31 t65 t77 t26 t53 t25 t32 t55 t25 t32 t15`.\n\nI notice that each element is a 't' followed by a number, which suggests that these are terminal symbols. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a single step rewriting of a single non-terminal into two non-terminals or terminals. So, to derive the string, I might need to build a parse tree from S, expanding non-terminals until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first production: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, to generate the string, NT48 and NT11 must derive to some sequence that starts with the first symbol of the string, which is t68.\n\nLooking at NT48, in the grammar, there's a production NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT1. So, NT48 can be rewritten as NT44 followed by NT1. Let me see what NT44 does. NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13. NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25. NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59. NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45. NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1.

Wait, no, NT14 is a non-terminal, but looking at the productions, NT14 seems to be used in NT43 \u2192 NT44 NT25? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions for NT48 and beyond to see how they can be resolved.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT44 NT1\nNT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13\nNT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25\nNT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59\nNT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45\nNT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1\nNT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\nNT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11\nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1\nNT14 \u2192 NT76 (Wait, no, actually, looking back: NT14 is on the left side of a production? Or is it a terminal? Let me check: looking through the productions, I don't see NT14 as a non-terminal on the left; it seems to be a terminal, but in the list, I see NT14 \u2192 't76'. Oh, wait, no\u2014when I look at the productions listed, I see lines like:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\nNT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11\nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1\nNT14 \u2192 't76'\u2014yes, so NT14 is a terminal. Wait, but looking at the grammar, it's actually a production where NT14 is on the left and 't76' is on the right. So NT14 \u2192 't76', which makes it a terminal symbol. But in the list, I also see NT14 \u2192 something else? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the productions: For example, NT23 isn't in the list, but NT14 appears as:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't76'\nWait, that seems to be in the list. Oh, wait, no: The user provided the grammar as a list, each line is \"NTabc -> ...\" So for example, the line:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\n\nis production for NT7.\n\nLooking at all the productions, many have NT... on the left, and some have 't...' on the right, e.g., NT33 \u2192 't73', NT35 \u2192 't3', etc. So, non-terminals are on the left, and terminals are the ones with arrows pointing to 't...'.\n\nSo, for NT48, the productions are:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT44 NT1\nNT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13\nNT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25\nNT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59\nNT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45\nNT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1\nNT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\nNT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11\nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1\nNT14 \u2192 't76' (Wait, no.

Looking at NT25's production:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT32 NT15 (Wait, no, looking through the list again, I see:\n\nNT25's production? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar list, I see:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't58'\n\nWait, is that correct?

{"custom_id":"request-428","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to see how the terminals are derived. The string to evaluate is `t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t65 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t15 t65 t31 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15`. It seems like the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the numbers are just part of the terminal string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) has production rules that eventually lead to terminals. For example, NT48 \u2192 't68' and NT49 \u2192 't81', and others. Some non-terminals have multiple production rules that combine other non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't68', so that must come from a rule like NT48 \u2192 't68'. Then next is 't77', which looks like it should come from NT77. But wait, the grammar doesn't have a rule for NT77 directly. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules like NT49 \u2192 't16 NT7' and NT7 \u2192 't26' or 't36'. Wait, no, NT49 has a rule NT49 \u2192 't16 NT7' and also NT16 \u2192 't26'. So NT49 can derive 't16' followed by 't26' which is 't26'. But I'm getting confused. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe string is a series of 't's followed by numbers, so each part must be a terminal symbol. The first symbol is 't68', which must come from NT48 because NT48 \u2192 't68'. Then the next is 't77'. Looking at the rules, I don't see a direct rule for NT77. Let me scan through all the rules.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT49 \u2192 't81', but no NT77. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each rule systematically.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'\n- NT13 \u2192 't5'\n- NT42 \u2192 't55'\n- NT43 \u2192 't55'\n- NT18 \u2192 't69'\n- NT57 \u2192 'NT9 NT37'\n- Wait, no 't77' in the rules. Let me see. There are rules like NT7 \u2192 't53' and 't36', but no way to get 't77' unless it's derived from some combination.\n\nWait, perhaps 't77' is derived from a combination of two non-terminals that each derive 't7' and something else? Or maybe it's a longer chain. Let me see.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't immediately see a rule that results in 't77', except maybe from combining NT8 \u2192 't69' and NT1 \u2192 't19 t41' or something. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each terminal and see where they come from.\n\n1. 't68' \u2192 NT48 \u2192 rule is NT48 \u2192 't68' \u2192 yes.\n2. 't77' \u2192 Looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't77'. So unless it's derived from two non-terminals that each produce 't' plus something, but in the rules, I don't see 't77' being produced directly or indirectly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a production. Let me check again. The rules list includes NT48 \u2192 't68', and then later NT18 \u2192 't69'. So 't77' is not appearing anywhere. That suggests that 't77' isn't part of the grammar's language, which would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Maybe I overlooked a rule. Let me scan through all the rules for 't77':\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't68'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81' and also NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, which leads to 't31' and 't4' which is 't31t4' \u2192 't34', but that's not 't77'.\n- NT52 \u2192 multiple rules: 't7', 't14', 't32', 't58', etc.\n- NT12 \u2192 't37'\n- NT11 \u2192 't31' and 't65' (since NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, which leads to 't19' and 't81', making 't19t81' which is 't8119', but that's not 't77')\n- NT55 \u2192 't21 nt59' which then leads to 't18' and 't77' (but wait, no: NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59, and NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45, which then lead to 't73' and more 't's. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at NT59 \u2192 't24' and also NT59 \u2192 't5 nt37' and NT37 \u2192 't32' and 't35', which leads to 't32' and 't35' \u2192 but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step for the entire string. Let me try to parse the string symbol by symbol, seeing if each can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the string: t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t65 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t15 t65 t31 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15.\n\nSo the string is: [t68, t77, t26, t65, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t31, t65, t31, t25, t19, t25, t42, t15, t65, t31, t25, t5, t25, t42, t15]\n\nLet's take the first symbol: t68. From the rules, NT48 \u2192 't68'. So the first non-terminal is NT48.\n\nSo we have S \u2192 NT48 NT48 (from the grammar: S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but wait, the grammar says S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So S is NT48 followed by NT11. Hmm, but our string starts with just nt48, not followed by NT11. Wait, no\u2014the string starts with 't68', which is the first symbol. So according to the grammar, S must be NT48 NT11. So S is split into NT48 and NT11. Then the first symbol is 't68', which is the production of NT48. So that's correct.\n\nNow the next symbol is 't77'. After NT48, S is followed by NT11. So after 't68', the next symbol should come from NT11.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So the next non-terminal is NT41 and NT49.\n\nSo after 't68', the string goes to 't77', which must come from NT41 or NT49. Wait, no: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, so the string after S would be 't68' followed by the symbols derived from NT41 and NT49.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

{"custom_id":"request-450","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t68 t77 t77 t81 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t84 t48 t30 t53 t3 t28 t77 t69 t28 t77 t58 t19 t31 t49`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have productions where each rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The given grammar seems to follow this structure, as all productions are of the form A -> BC, except for some terminal symbols which are the leaves.\n\nI notice that the initial symbol is S, and the grammar's first production is S -> NT48 NT11. So, any valid string must start with something derived from NT48 and NT11. Let me check the first part of the string: the first token is t68. Looking at the grammar rules, NT48 is a non-terminal. I see that NT48 can produce t68 when it's a terminal, right? Yes, the rule is NT48 -> t68.\n\nSo, the first part of the string starts with NT48, which becomes t68. Next, the second token is t77. Looking for NT11 in the grammar, the rule is NT11 -> t77. So, NT11 becomes t77. So far, the string starts correctly as S -> NT48 t68 and NT11 t77.\n\nNow, moving on to the rest of the string. The string after the first two tokens is t77, t81, t42, t59, t28, etc. So after the initial t68 and t77, we have another t77. Since we need to generate the entire string, each of these t tokens must come from either terminals or from the expansion of non-terminals.\n\nI realize that each t token corresponds to a specific production in the grammar. For example, t68 comes from NT48, t77 from NT11, and so on. The key is to see if, after S, each step correctly produces the tokens in the string.\n\nLet's break down the string into a list for clarity:\n[t68, t77, t77, t81, t42, t59, t28, t77, t77, t47, t25, t84, t48, t30, t53, t3, t28, t77, t69, t28, t77, t58, t19, t31, t49]\n\nStarting from S:\n1. S -> NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 t77 (matches the first two tokens)\n2. Now, we need to check the rest of the string to see if it can be generated by the expansion of NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48, the rule is NT48 -> t68. So, that's straightforward. So the next token is correct.\n\nNow, what's next in the string after t68 is t77. Wait, let me recount. The initial S gives t68 and t77, so the next token in the string is t77. But S is already expanded as NT48 NT11, which are the first two symbols, so after expanding, the next symbol would depend on the next production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a parse tree. Each time, after S, we have NT48 and NT11. So, for each NT, we need to see their production rules.\n\nWait, but NT48 is only producing t68, so after S, the first thing is t68, then NT11. NT11 becomes t77. So the next token should be t77, which it is. Then, the next token is t77 again. But after the initial S expansion, we've already consumed two tokens, so the rest is t77, t81, etc.\n\nThis seems confusing. Maybe I should parse the entire string step by step.\n\nAlternative approach: The string is a sequence of t symbols with specific indices. Each t is a terminal that can only appear on the left-hand side of a production that's a terminal. So, to generate this string, each t must come from a production of a non-terminal. \n\nLooking at the string, all tokens are terminals, so the entire string must be derived entirely from the left-hand sides of the non-terminals, expanding them until terminals are reached.\n\nSo, each step in the derivation must reduce the current string of symbols (non-terminals and terminals) by substituting non-terminals with their right-hand sides, eventually resulting in a string of terminals.\n\nBut starting from S, which is NT48 NT11. S \u2192 t68 t77. But the string starts with t68 t77, so the next step is to see if t68 t77 can expand further, but since both are terminals, the string length is 2, but the actual string is longer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, the entire string must be derived starting from S, expanding it into terminals step by step. \n\nBut S is NT48 NT11, which are both non-terminals. So, to generate the string, each of these non-terminals must further expand into other non-terminals and eventually into terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the left has a production that either produces another two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, NT48 -> t68, which is a terminal. So, in the expansion, NT48 can only produce t68 directly. So, in the string, after t68, we don't have another expansion from NT48 because it's already been expanded to a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT11 -> t77, so after t77, NT11 can't expand further.\n\nBut looking at the string, after the initial t68 t77, the next token is t77 again, which suggests that NT11 must have expanded again, which it can't because it's already at the terminal level. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the string is longer because NT11 can expand further. Let's check the grammar again. NT11 has the rule NT11 -> t77. There's no other production for NT11 in the given rules. So, it can't expand beyond t77. So, after the first two tokens (t68, t77), the next token in the string is t77, which would require NT11 to produce t77, but that's already been used. So, if the string requires another t77, but NT11 can't produce that, that would mean the string is invalid.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the string is much longer. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the initial expansion works.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the expansions, not as a tree. So, the string is t68, t77, t77, etc. Each of these corresponds to a node in the parse tree.\n\nSo, starting from S, which is NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 t77. Then, to generate more tokens, perhaps we need to have more productions. But since NT48 and NT11 are both terminals after expansion, how do we get more tokens? That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is generated through multiple applications of the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion S \u2192 NT48 NT11, then each NT48 and NT11 can further expand into more NTs. So, for example, maybe NT48 can expand into other NTs, and so can NT11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 \u2192 t68 (terminal). So, NT48 can't expand further. Similarly, NT11 \u2192 t77, which is terminal. Therefore, in the first expansion, S gives t68 t77. But the string has more tokens after that, so perhaps we need to have multiple production steps.\n\nWait, but how? Because after S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which becomes t68 t77, you can't get any more symbols. So, the string length would be exactly 2 if derived directly from S. But the string has 27 tokens (counting the commas as separators), which means it's much longer.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm miscalculating the string length. Let me count the tokens in the string provided:\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t77 t81 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t84 t48 t30 t53 t3 t28 t77 t69 t28 t77 t58 t19 t31 t49.\n\nCounting each part, that's 27 tokens.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol is a non-terminal. Also, all terminal symbols are on the left side of the equation. Wait, no, actually, wait: in CNF, the right-hand side can only have two non-terminals, or maybe a terminal and a non-terminal, but sometimes it's also allowed to have a single non-terminal on the right, or two non-terminals in the sense that they can produce terminals as well.

But in CNF, each rule should have two symbols on the right. So for example, S -> NT48 NT11 seems to have two non-terminals, which is fine, but NT49 -> NT11 NT6 has two non-terminals. But also, looking for any rule that might have a terminal and a non-terminal, or only terminals.\n\nWait, wait, the rules starting with NT49 -> NT11 NT6, etc. are all two non-terminals. But some rules, like NT44 -> NT42 NT13, or NT32 -> NT39 NT57, seem to have two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but some production rules might have terminals on the RHS, right? Because the problem statement says that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, but I thought that in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. Or maybe sometimes, unit productions are allowed. Hmm, but in the given rules, I don't see any unit productions (like A->B or A->a). Maybe not, so perhaps all rules are of the form A->BC, with B and C being non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, for example, the rule NT33 -> 't76' versus NT33 -> 't30' would be terminal symbols. So that suggests that the grammar allows for terminal symbols on the RHS, which would mean that the grammar is not in strict CNF. Because in strict CNF, the RHS can only have two non-terminals. Therefore, perhaps the grammar here is in extended Chomsky Normal Form, allowing rules with one or two non-terminals and possibly terminals on the RHS. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement includes rules where a non-terminal can produce a terminal. So the grammar is a combination where some rules produce two non-terminals, others produce a single non-terminal, and perhaps others produce a terminal symbol. Wait, but the initial problem states that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which typically doesn't have terminals on the RHS. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's grammar is not a strict Chomsky Normal Form, but the user is using the term in a more general sense. Because I'm seeing that some of the rules produce a terminal symbol. For example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'. So perhaps the grammar is an extended version of CNF that allows terminal symbols on the RHS.\n\nWait, no, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is where every production is of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A-> a, where a is a terminal single symbol. So some production rules in CNF can produce a single terminal symbol. So maybe that's allowed here.\n\nWait, but looking at the problem, the given grammar's rules seem to have both: some produce two non-terminals (like S -> NT48 NT11), and others produce a terminal plus a non-terminal or two terminals, like NT33 -> 't76' or 't30'. Hmm, but that complicates things because it's not in strict CNF.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to approach this with the given rules and the string. So the string to parse is t68 t77 t77 t77 t77 t47 t4 t76 t65 t77 t77 t26 t36 t10 t77 t26 t28 t49 t25 t19 t25 t76 t31 t49 t4.\n\nSo my initial approach should be to try to generate the string by applying the given production rules step by step, starting from S and trying to derive the string.\n\nLet's start by writing out S -> NT48 NT11.

{"custom_id":"request-468","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first symbols should be derived from NT48 and NT11. \n\nThe string starts with 't68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t22 t3 t25 t5 t25 t42 t69 t48 t66 t30 t55'. \n\nLooking at NT48, from the grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 't68'. So the first part is 't68'. That matches.\n\nNext, we have NT11. From the grammar, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Let's break these down.\n\nNT41 \u2192 't77', and NT49 \u2192 't47'. So NT11 should produce 't77 t47'. Checking the string after the first 't68', the next is 't77 t69...'. Wait, that doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, no, because NT11's production gives 't77 t47', but after 't68', the next items should be 't77' followed by 't47'. However, the next tokens after 't68' are 't77 t69...'. So that would mean the second part is 't77 t69', but according to the grammar, NT11 should produce 't77 t47', not involving 't69'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar for NT11 is NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. And from the rules, NT41 is 't77', and NT49 is 't47'. So when NT11 is expanded, it becomes 't77 t47'. \n\nLooking at the string: After 't68', the next tokens are 't77', 't69'... Wait, that's 't77' followed by 't69', but according to the grammar, after NT11, we should have 't77 t47', so 't69' shouldn't come next. So this might already be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the productions chain. Maybe the NT11 is part of a larger production that's been partially expanded. Wait, let's think step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first part is 't68' from NT48. Then NT11 is NT41 NT49. From the string, after 't68', the next tokens are 't77 t69...'. So let's check NT41 and NT49. \n\nNT41 \u2192 't77' directly. So that's fine. Then, NT49 \u2192 't47'. So after 't77', the next should be 't47'. But in the string, after 't77', it's 't69', which is not 't47'. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me check: NT49 has several productions. From the grammar, I see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, and also NT49 \u2192 't47' in other rules. Wait, let me double-check the rules given by the user.\n\nLooking back, the NT49 productions: \n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nAnd NT49 also appears in other rules like S->NT48 NT11, so perhaps I need to check where NT49 is defined. \n\nWait, looking through the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nand\n\nNT49 -> 't47'\n\nYes, so NT49 can be either 't47' or expanded further into NT11 NT6. \n\nSo in NT11 NT49, if NT49 expands to 't47', then the entire production from NT11 would be 't77 t47'. But in the string, after 't77', it's 't69', which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the NT49 productions again. \n\nYes, NT49 can be directly 't47' or extended to 'NT11 NT6'. So let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 't68' from NT48, the next is NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. NT41 is 't77', so we have 't77' followed by NT49.\n\nIf NT49 is expanded as 't47', then we should have 't77 t47'. But in the string, after 't77', the next tokens are 't69 t48...'. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the string is: \n\n't68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t22 t3 t25 t5 t25 t42 t69 t48 t66 t30 t55'\n\nSo the first few tokens after 't68' are 't77' followed by 't26', etc. Wait, that doesn't make sense because from NT11 we should have 't77' and then something else, but 't26' is the next token. \n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me break down the string into parts.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt68, t77, t26, t69, t48, t59, t28, t77, t31, t59, t28, t77, t77, t47, t25, t22, t3, t25, t5, t25, t42, t69, t48, t66, t30, t55.\n\nSo after 't68', the next is 't77', which matches NT41 (t77). Then the next should be the other part of NT11, which is NT49.\n\nNow, NT49 can be either 't47' or NT11 NT6. So let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: NT49 \u2192 't47' \u2192 Then after 't77', we have 't47'. But the string after that is 't26...'. So after 't77 t47', we should have t26 which isn't matching anything.\n\nCase 2: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So after 't77', we have NT11 \u2192 't77' again, and NT6 \u2192 't4' (since from the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't4').\n\nWait, but that would make the production 't77 t77 t4'... Let me check the grammar for NT11 and NT6.\n\nWait, NT6 is 't4'. NT11 is NT41 NT49, which in this case, if NT49 is being expanded as NT11 NT6, then NT11 becomes NT41 NT49, and NT49 is NT11 NT6 again. This could go on recursively, leading to possibly infinitely long productions, or perhaps it's being reduced step by step.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's look for the structure of the string.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt68 is first, which is correct as it's the expansion of S \u2192 NT48 NT11. \n\nNext, NT11 expands to NT41 NT49. NT41 is 't77', so we have 't77' as the next token. Now, the next token is 't26', which should be the expansion of NT49. NT49 can be 't47' or NT11 NT6. So let's see if 't26' matches NT49.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't26' is defined as NT26, and looking through the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT26: looking for where 't26' is.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that 't26' is the result of multiple NT rules:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't53' maybe? Or is it another NT?\n\nWait, the provided grammar has several entries ending with 't26' or 't25' or others.\n\nLooking for NT26:\n\nLooking at the rules, I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-470","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to check whether a given string is generated by a specific CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar provided and the string we need to evaluate. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t68 t77 t31 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t77 t77 t26 t28 t4 t55 t77 t81 t49 t4 t25 t19 t25 t42 t26 t37 t55`. Each of these tokens is a terminal, I suppose.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production starts with a non-terminal (like S, NT12, etc.) and breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. \n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S. The approach I'll take is to try to parse the string using the grammar, working from the start symbol and breaking down the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The production for S is NT48 NT11. So, the first step is that S generates NT48 and NT11. From the string, I need to see if the beginning parts can match NT48 and NT11.\n\nBreaking down the string: the first part should be whatever comes from NT48 and the next from NT11. Looking at the string, maybe the first few tokens could correspond to NT48.\n\nNT48 is a non-terminal, and its production is NT11 and NT6. Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\nNT48 is not listed here, but looking through the non-terminals, I don't see NT48 defined in the list. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh, wait, the grammar in the problem has specific non-terminals, but I think the way it's presented is that each production is in the form of a non-terminal followed by its right-hand side, like NT48 -> NT11 NT6. But in the initial part, it's S -> NT48 NT11, which suggests NT48 is a non-terminal that can be expanded, but in the provided grammar, I don't see NT48 defined. Hmm, that might be a problem. Or maybe the initial lines were just a typo, perhaps S is replaced by other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe in the initial setup, the user mentioned the grammar is in CNF, which has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So perhaps S is defined as S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which would mean NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals. But looking through the grammar provided, after NT48, the next lines start with NT33, NT34, etc. It seems that perhaps NT48 is not present in the list. Hmm, that might be an issue because if S can't produce, then the string isn't generated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me re-examine it. The grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11, then the list of non-terminals follows. If I check for NT48, it's not in the list as a separate non-terminal. So perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the grammar, or perhaps it's implied that NT48 is a typo. Alternatively, maybe some lines are the same. Or perhaps I need to see that the given grammar has S -> NT12 NT46, but in the provided data, I don't see that. Wait, no, the user's initial grammar is presented with only specific productions, and S is defined as NT48 NT11. \n\nBut looking in the list, none of the non-terminals have a production starting with NT48. Only NT33, NT34, etc., but NT48 doesn't appear. That suggests that S might not have any production, which would immediately mean the string isn't possible. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps NT48 is supposed to refer to another non-terminal, perhaps NT48 is just a part of a production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

So either S is perhaps a typo and was supposed to be another non-terminal, or the initial S production is an error.\n\nThis is a problem because if S can't produce anything, then none of the tokens can come from S. But the string starts with t68, which would have to come from NT48 if S produces NT48 and NT11, but if NT48 is undefined, then that production is invalid, and the grammar isn't possible. So this would mean the string can't be generated, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the grammar provided, the S production was miswritten. Let me check again. The initial line says S -> NT48 NT11. If NT48 isn't defined, then S's production is invalid, so the grammar can't generate any string, hence the given string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar list again, I see that NT48 isn't present.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar provided and see how the string might fit into it. The grammar has a start symbol S, and from the initial production rule, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must start with NT48 and NT11. Let me check the string: it starts with t68, t77, t26, etc. So I need to see if the first two tokens correspond to NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that NT48 \u2192 t68, because there's a production NT48 \u2192 't68'. Similarly, NT11 \u2192 t77. So the first two tokens, t68 and t77, are indeed produced by NT48 and NT11 respectively. That seems good so far.\n\nNext, I should break down each symbol step by step, expanding them according to the grammar until I either consume the entire string or run out of symbols without matching the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so after the initial production, we have NT48 and NT11. Each of these should expand further.\n\nNT48 is t68, which is a terminal symbol. The first token in the string is t68, so that's correct. Moving on to the next part, which should be NT11 \u2192 t77, which matches the second token.\n\nNow, the string continues with t26. Let's see what comes next in the grammar. After S, we have the first two symbols: t68 and t77. Now, I need to figure out what's generated after these. It looks like the next part is a long string, so maybe I need to split it or see how the symbols build upon each other.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a non-terminal symbol going to two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S, I can build the string step by step by choosing the right productions.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules for reference:\n\n- S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n- NT48 \u2192 t68\n- NT11 \u2192 t77\n\nSo S expands to t68 and t77. The string starts with t68, then t77, which matches.\n\nNow, after t68 and t77, we have t26, t59, t28, t77, t31, t65, t77, t31, t49, t25, t22, etc. I'm a bit confused because I only started with the initial expansion. Maybe I need to see if the subsequent symbols can be generated by some NT rules.\n\nLooking at the rest of the grammar, there are other production rules for non-terminals like NT32, NT33, etc., which produce terminals like t76, t30, t69, etc. So perhaps the string is built using these.\n\nWait, another approach: since the string is provided, I can try to parse it using the grammar. For each symbol in the string, it should correspond to a terminal in an NT production or be derived from a non-terminal which can be further expanded.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to start by looking at the parse tree. Let's see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nSo the string must start with the symbols generated by NT48 and NT11. NT48 is t68, and NT11 is t77. So the string starts with t68 t77, which it does. Now, the next symbols must be generated by NT48's production, but wait, NT48 is a terminal, so it doesn't produce anything else. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me check again. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68\n\nSo NT48 directly produces t68. Similarly, NT11 \u2192 t77. So after the initial S production, we only get two symbols: t68 and t77. But the string has many more symbols after that. So that suggests that the initial production is followed by more symbols from NT48 and NT11, but that's not possible because they are terminals.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Or perhaps the grammar has more rules that I'm missing.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I missed something. Oh, I see: NT48 is a non-terminal, and it produces t68, but perhaps other symbols in the expansion can include more NTs that then produce other symbols.\n\nWait, no. Once S expands to NT48 NT11, those are the only symbols generated, because NT48 and NT11 are terminals. But the string is much longer, containing 29 symbols. So that would be impossible unless there's a different starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe S is the starting symbol, and the string is built from S through multiple productions. But according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and NT48 and NT11 are terminals. So the string after S would just be those two terminals, and that would end it. But the string provided has 29 symbols, so that would mean that S can't generate the string because it stops after two symbols.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the string starts with t68 and t77, which match NT48 and NT11. So after that, how do we proceed? But NT48 and NT11 are terminals, so they cannot produce anything else. So the string cannot have any more symbols after that. But the string given has 29 symbols, which implies that S must generate a longer string. Therefore, maybe I've misunderstood the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look again. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. Now, NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals that produce t68 and t77 respectively. But the string provided is much longer, so how can this be? There must be another part to the production.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is wrong, or maybe I made a mistake. Or perhaps there's a typo elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the grammar has more rules beyond what's provided, but the user only listed a subset.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, I see that it's a list of rules, but I might have missed where NT48 and NT11 have other productions. But in the provided rules, I only see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t68\n- NT11 \u2192 t77\n\nSo according to that, S produces t68 t77, which is only two symbols. However, the string given is much longer, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the problem, or the grammar provided is incomplete.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but NT48 and NT11 can each produce more symbols through other rules, not just terminals. So maybe NT48 can expand into other NTs, which in turn can expand into more symbols until they reach a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT48 only goes to t68. There's no rule for NT48 to expand further. Similarly, NT11 only goes to t77.\n\nWait, that would mean that the string must consist of exactly two symbols: t68 t77. But the given string is much longer. That can't be right. So there's a problem here because the initial expansion gives only two symbols, but the string has 29.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me check again. Maybe the grammar isn't fully given, and there are other rules that I didn't consider. Looking at the grammar provided, it's a long list, but perhaps only some parts are given. But according to the user, they've provided the entire grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs and their productions. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t68\n- NT11 \u2192 t77\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n- NT28 \u2192 't59'\n- NT37 \u2192 't32'\n- NT55 \u2192 't83'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT59 \u2192 't24'\n- NT14 \u2192 't42'\n- NT43 \u2192 't55'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT11 \u2192 't31'\n- NT52 \u2192 't77'\n- And so on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the NT rules are listed as:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68\n\nNT11 \u2192 t77\n\nThe other NTs have terminals like t76, t26, etc. So perhaps the initial S generates a longer string because the NTs have more rules.

{"custom_id":"request-488","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar. Hmm, let me start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. So each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. That helps because I can parse the string by decomposing it step by step.\n\nThe start symbol seems to be S, which directly expands to NT48 NT11. So the string should start with whatever NT48 and NT11 produce. Let me check what NT48 and NT11 are.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT48 -> NT33 NT47\n- NT11 -> NT41 NT49 (Wait, but in the string, the second part after S is NT11, but the initial S expands to NT48 NT11, so the string starts with NT48 and then NT11.)\n\nWait, the string starts with 't68 t77'. Let me see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking for 't68': I see NT48 expands to NT33 NT47, which I think might eventually produce a terminal. Hmm, but 't68' might be a terminal directly from another NT. Let me check all NTs that directly produce 't68'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT44 -> t73, NT48 -> t68. So NT48 can produce 't68' directly. So the first part 't68' must come from NT48, and the second part 't77' comes from NT11?\n\nWait, no. The initial expansion is S -> NT48 NT11. So the string should start with whatever NT48 produces followed by whatever NT11 produces. But the string starts with 't68 t77', so let's see.\n\nIf NT48 can produce 't68', which it does (NT48 -> t68), then that's good. Then, what about NT11? Looking at NT11, it's NT41 NT49. Both of these are non-terminals. So after 't68', the next parts should come from NT41 and NT49. But the string after 't68' is 't77 t26 t65 t31 t65 t77 t77 t47 t55 t31 t42 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t76 t26 t36 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15'. That's a long string; maybe I should split it differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's take it step by step. The initial step is S -> NT48 NT11. So the string must be the concatenation of the strings derived from NT48 and NT11.\n\nFrom NT48, we can directly get 't68' as per NT48 -> t68. Then, NT11 can expand into two non-terminals, so it should be further broken down. Let's take NT11: NT41 NT49. Both are non-terminals, so each must expand further until they reach terminals.\n\nLet me see what NT41 and NT49 produce.\n\nLooking at NT41: According to the grammar, NT41 -> t77. So 't77' is a terminal here. So the first part after 't68' is 't77'. So far, the string is 't68 t77 ...'.\n\nNext, NT49 can expand into two non-terminals: NT11 and NT6. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me check again. The list includes:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nSo, NT49 can expand into NT11 and NT6. Both are non-terminals, so each must be further broken down.\n\nSo NT49 (which is part of NT11's expansion) can be split into NT11 (which is t77) and NT6. Let's look at NT6: NT6 -> t4. So the next part after 't77' is 't4'?\n\nWait, but the string after 't68 t77' is 't26 t65 t31 t65 t77 t77 t47 ...', so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, maybe each non-terminal can be expanded multiple times. So from NT11, it's NT41 NT49. NT41 is 't77', so that's straightforward. Then NT49 must be expanded. Let's see:\n\nNT49 can expand into NT11 and NT6. So the next symbols after 't77' would be the expansion of NT49. Let's say NT49 expands into NT11 and NT6. But NT11 is another non-terminal, so this could go recursively.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 -> t68.\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nNT41 -> t77.\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nNow, NT11 here is another 'NT11' which needs to expand further, and NT6 is 't4'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't68 t77' from NT48 and NT41. Then, the NT49 needs to be processed.\n\nSo after 't77', we have NT49, which is NT11 NT6. The first part is NT11, which will produce 't77', followed by NT6, which is 't4'. So the next symbols should be 't77 t4'.\n\nBut looking at the string, after 't68 t77', the next symbols are 't26 t65 t31 t65 t77 t77 t47 ...', which doesn't start with 't77 t4'. So that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not breaking down the non-terminals correctly. Let me try again.\n\nAfter S -> NT48 NT11:\n\n- NT48 -> t68.\n\n- NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nNow, the next part is the expansion of NT41 NT49. NT41 -> t77.\n\nSo the string starts with 't68 t77'.\n\nThen, we have NT49, which is NT11 NT6.\n\nSo after 't77', we need to process NT49, which is two non-terminals: NT11 and NT6.\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49, so it's recursive. So, the second part of NT49 is NT6 -> t4. So the string after 't77' should be 't77 t4', but in the given string, it's 't26 t65 t31 t65 t77...', which doesn't match 't4'. So that suggests that the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the order. The initial expansion is S -> NT48 NT11, which becomes t68 and then the expansion of NT11.\n\nSo, after 't68', the next part is the expansion of NT11, which is NT41 NT49. Now, NT41 is 't77', so the string is 't68 t77'.\n\nThen, the NT49 needs to be expanded into its components, which are NT11 and NT6.\n\nSo, the next symbols should be 't77 t4', but the string is 't26 t65...', which means it's not matching. Hmm, maybe the initial assumption is wrong, that is, the string starts with 't68 t77', but perhaps there's a way for the NT11 to expand differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 can be expanded further.\n\nSo, NT11 \u2192 t77, and NT6 \u2192 t4. So the expansion would be 't77 t4', but in the string, after 't77', it's 't26 t65 t31...', which suggests that maybe the string is longer. Maybe I'm not parsing correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S is part of a larger structure. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is 't68 t77 t26 t65 t31 t65 t77 t77 t47 t55 t31 t42 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t76 t26 t36 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15'. That's a lot of symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-508","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. My task is to figure out if the string can be generated by the given grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a set of production rules where each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192\u03a3, where A, B, C are non-terminals and \u03a3 is a terminal. CNF has a few key characteristics: every production on the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and every production on the right-hand side has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. This helps in parsing as each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, every production on the left side has a single non-terminal symbol, like S, NT44, etc. On the right side, each production is either two non-terminals or, in some cases, a terminal (like 't30' or 't65'). So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string provided is a series of terminal symbols: `t68 t77 t77 t26 t28 t42 t65 t77 t31 t4 t25 t32 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t28 t65 t31 t25 t5 t25 t42 t55 t49`. My goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to use the top-down parsing method, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, we can also use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. But since the string isn't too long, maybe a top-down approach would be manageable.\n\nLet me list the productions again to see what's available. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first step is to split the string into the two parts: the first part should be derived from NT48, and the second part from NT11.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nStart: t68 t77 t77 t26 t28 t42 t65 t77 t31 t4 t25 t32 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t28 t65 t31 t25 t5 t25 t42 t55 t49\n\nSo the first two symbols are 't68 t77'. I need to see if these can be derived from NT48 and NT11, respectively.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT48 is a non-terminal. Let's check its production rules. Looking through the productions for NT48, I see: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. Oh, so NT48 must derive to something that starts with the first symbol, which is 't68'.\n\nWait, the right-hand side of NT48 is NT49 and NT6. Both are non-terminals. So we need to see if the string starting from S can have NT48 split into NT49 and NT6. Then each of these would need to produce the corresponding parts.\n\nBut before that, I should check if the first two symbols of the string can be 't68 t77'. Since NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6, NT49 must produce 't68' and NT6 must produce 't77'?\n\nWait, no. Because NT48 is a non-terminal, and the first two symbols are 't68 t77', which might need to come directly from the productions of NT48. But since NT48's only production is NT49 NT6, which are non-terminals, that means we need to split the string into two parts: the first part must be derived from NT49 and the second from NT6. But the entire string starts with 't68 t77', so maybe that's not possible directly?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: the production of S is NT48 NT11. So the entire string must be the concatenation of NT48's derivation and NT11's derivation.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is what NT48 can produce, and the second part is what NT11 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are 't68 t77'. So the first part needs to end with 't77', and the second part needs to start with 't77'? Wait, no\u2014the concatenation would be NT48Derivation + NT11Derivation. So the entire string is a sequence where the first part matches NT48's derivation and the second part matches NT11's.\n\nSo for example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so the string would be a sequence where the first part is NT48's derivation, the second is NT11's.\n\nSo in the given string, the first part (from S) is t68 t77..., and the second part is ...t77 t26... So I need to see if the first part can be from NT48 and the second from NT11.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt68 t77 t77 t26 t28 t42 t65 t77 t31 t4 t25 t32 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t28 t65 t31 t25 t5 t25 t42 t55 t49\n\nSplit into two parts: first part must be generated by NT48, second by NT11.\n\nBut since each production in CNF replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, it's not straightforward. Maybe starting from S, we can split the entire string into two parts: the first derived from NT48, the second from NT11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be viewed as NT48Derivation yields part of the string, and NT11Derivation yields the rest.\n\nLooking at NT48's production: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So both are non-terminals. Let's see what their productions are.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (from line NT49 -> NT11 NT6)\n\nWait no, that's not correct. Wait, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT49: I don't see a production for NT49. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, the production list includes many NT and terminal rules. Let me scan for NT49:\n\nYes, here's line:\n\n`NT49 -> NT11 NT6` from line 15 (I think), so NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.\n\nAnd NT6 production: NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49.\n\nSo NT6 can be replaced by NT52 NT49. So let's see what happens if we do that.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT49 NT6 NT11.\n\nBreaking down, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, so now:\n\nNT49 NT6 NT11 \u2192 NT11 NT6 NT6 NT11.\n\nThen each NT can replace as per their productions.\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nNT11 NT6 NT6 NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 NT6 NT6 NT11.\n\nContinuing, NT41 \u2192 NT77 NT41 (Wait, did I make a mistake?)\n\nWait, looking back at the production for NT41:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT41's productions are:\n\n`NT41 -> NT19 NT41` (line 9?) or other?\n\nWait, no. Let me list all NT rules:\n\nGiven production lines from the grammar:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-513","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means it's structured with production rules that have two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll take a look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S. The grammar productions seem a bit complex, with a lot of NTs (non-terminals) and terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t47 t4 t65 t77 t31 t4 t25 t10 t48 t73 t53 t27 t28 t77 t24 t58 t19 t15 t4`.\n\nTo determine if this string is generated by the grammar, I think I should trace it back through the grammar. The approach would involve checking if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. \n\nLet me start from the beginning of the string. The first token is 't68'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT48 produces 't68'. So, wherever NT48 appears, it can be replaced by 't68'. \n\nThe string starts as S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, replacing S with NT48 NT11, the first token 't68' comes from NT48. That seems to check out.\n\nNext, after 't68', the next token is 't77'. So, we have to see how 't77' can be generated. Looking through the grammar, I notice that NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. NT41 is 't77', right? Let me check: NT41 \u2192 't77'. So, that works.\n\nSo the string so far is S \u2192 NT48 \u2192 t68, then S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 NT48 NT11. Wait, maybe I should think step by step. \n\nWait, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. The first token is 't68' from NT48. The next part after 't68' should come from NT11. So, 't77' is the second token, which should come from NT11's expansion. \n\nLooking at NT11's productions: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, the first part of NT11 is NT41, which is 't77', and the second part is NT49. But in the string, after 't77', the next token is 't77', not 't77' followed by something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the string after 't68' is 't77 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t47 t4 t65 t77 t31 t4 t25 t10 t48 t73 t53 t27 t28 t77 t24 t58 t19 t15 t4'. So, the second token is 't77', which comes from NT11, so NT11 must expand into two things. \n\nLet me see NT11's expansion. It seems NT11 has only one production: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So when we parse the string, after the first 't68' from NT48, we have NT11. This NT11 must expand into 't77 t77...' because in the string, it's followed by 't77'. So 't77 t77' would come from NT41 and NT49. \n\nWait, 't77' is from NT41. So in the string, the next two tokens are 't77 t77 t26...'. So, after 't77' from NT41, what comes next is 't77', which would have to come from NT49, right? Because NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So when we replace NT11, we get NT41 and NT49, each of which produce a terminal.\n\nSo, the first two tokens after 't68' would be 't77' (from NT41) and 't77' (from NT49), making the string up to that point 't68 t77 t77'. The next token is 't26', so I need to see how 't26' fits in.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't26' comes from which NT? Looking through the listings, NT16 \u2192 't26', and also NT43 \u2192 't55' doesn't help. Wait, 't26' is from NT26, maybe. Wait, let's check the terminals. Oh, I see, NT43 produces 't55', but wait, elsewhere I see 't26' is from NT16, and 't26' seems to come from some other NT as well. Wait, in the grammar terminals, I see:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't26'\n- Also, looking through the list, I see NT31 \u2192 't35' and NT30 \u2192 't22', etc. Maybe not directly useful.\n\nSo after 't77 t77', the next token is 't26', which must come from an NT that produces 't26'. From the grammar, I see NT14 \u2192 't42', which isn't helpful, but looking for 't26', it's from NT16 \u2192 't26'. So maybe the NT before it is NT16.\n\nWait, let's backtrack. After the first two 't77's, the next is 't26'. So, looking at the string, after 't68 t77 t77' comes 't26 t59...'.\n\nSo, perhaps after NT41 and NT49, which both produce 't77', we have NT16 producing 't26'. So the next step in the string is 't26', which is NT16. So, the chain would be S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which expands to 't68' followed by NT41 (t77) and NT49 (t77), and then the next production is NT49 \u2192 which, let's check NT49.\n\nLooking back at NT49, it has two productions: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I might have misread it. Let me check:\n\nWait the NT49's productions in the grammar are:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6  \nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nWait, so NT49 can produce either 't16' or 't26' followed by another NT. Hmm, but in our string, after 't77 t77' we get 't26', which is from NT16, but NT16 is a separate production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure starts as:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 (NT48 replaced) followed by NT11.\n\nWait, but NT48 doesn't replace further because it's a terminal production. No, NT48 produces 't68', so the entire S \u2192 NT48 NT11 becomes 't68' followed by NT11.\n\nThen, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, so it becomes 't68 t77' followed by NT41 and NT49.\n\nWait, that would give 't68 t77 t77', because NT41 is 't77' and NT49 is 't77' as I thought earlier.\n\nThen, the next token is 't26', so that would have to come from NT41 or NT49 expanding further. But looking at the grammar, NT41 doesn't have any further productions; NT41 is a terminal. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each non-terminal is on the left, and each production is on the right. Let me list out the productions for each NT that can produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't68'\n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT26 \u2192 't49' (no, wait, perhaps not. Wait, no, Nts like NT16 \u2192 't26', that's an NT that produces a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-534","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are both given, so my task is to figure out whether the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is the only non-terminal that can go to a terminal. So, in this grammar, I should see all productions either combining two non-terminals on the right or producing a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that most productions are of the form X \u2192 YZ, except for a few like NT33 which produces 't76' and 't30'. So the grammar's structure seems to allow only two terminals per production, which aligns with CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t65 t77 t81 t25 t22 t48 t73 t53 t48 t26 t69 t26 t69 t73 t25 t32 t28 t77 t12 t58 t19 t15`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, I can perform a derivation by breaking down the string into parts that match the productions. Each step should involve replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT48 and NT11.\n\nThe production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, the first two elements of the string must come from NT48 and NT11. Wait, actually, in CFG, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals at a time. So, the initial step might involve S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but then each of those NTs could be further expanded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should consider the string as a sequence of symbols and see if they can be grouped into substrings that match the possible productions.\n\nWait, but each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, looking at the given string, each symbol is a terminal, so perhaps we need to see if the entire string can be generated by applying the productions step by step, ending with all terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string using the given grammar, trying to match each part according to the productions.\n\nLet me list out the string again:\n\nt68, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t31, t65, t77, t81, t25, t22, t48, t73, t53, t48, t26, t69, t26, t69, t73, t25, t32, t28, t77, t12, t58, t19, t15.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, the first symbol must be part of NT48, and the second part is NT11.\n\nWait, but the initial symbol is t68, which is a terminal. Let's check if NT48 can produce t68.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48's production is:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68 (since in the given grammar, NT48 is defined as 't68').\n\nSo the first symbol t68 comes from NT48. That means after S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the NT48 can become t68, and the NT11 is still to be processed.\n\nWait, but in this case, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and each part is a non-terminal. So in the first step, S becomes NT48 followed by NT11. But in the string we have a single t68, so I think I need to check if the entire string can be divided into parts starting from S's expansion.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to represent the string as a sequence of non-terminals breaking down each symbol into their possible sources.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to find a way to parse the string using the grammar's productions. Let me try to start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t68. From the grammar, NT48 \u2192 t68. So maybe S can produce the first t68.\n\nBut how? S produces NT48 NT11, so if NT48 \u2192 t68, then the next symbol must come from NT11. Let me check what NT11 produces. Looking at the grammar, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo after t68, we have t77, which should come from NT41 or NT49. Wait, but the next symbols after t68 in the string are t77, t26, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is split into a sequence of non-terminals that eventually expand to terminals.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Let me try to represent the string as a tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can work backwards from the string to the start symbol S.\n\nEach symbol in the string could be the result of a production. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the last symbol, t15. I need to see which non-terminal can produce t15. From the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that does this. Let's check each production:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see ND44 \u2192 t76, ND58 \u2192 t31, ND39 \u2192 t40, etc. Wait, scanning all the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t36, but not t15.\n- NT29 \u2192 t5, t53, etc.\n- Let me look for anything that produces t15. Hmm, checking each production.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nI see ND52 \u2192 t7, t49, etc.\n\nWait, looking further: NT39 \u2192 t40, t11. No, t15 isn't there.\n\nLooking for:\n\nLooking through the productions again, I find NT44 \u2192 t73, ND7 \u2192 t26, ND58 \u2192 t31, ND59 \u2192 t12, etc. Wait, I don't see any production that directly yields t15.\n\nThat's a problem because the last symbol is t15, which would need to come directly from a production. If none of the non-terminals produce t15, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all productions to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking at the grammar list again, I'll go through each production to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't15'.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t4: No.\n- NT9 \u2192 t25: No.\n- NT1 \u2192 t19: No.\n- NT31 \u2192 t8: No.\n- NT37 \u2192 t13: No.\n- NT29 \u2192 t5, t53: No.\n- NT12 \u2192 t37: No.\n- NT52 \u2192 t14, t32: No.\n- NT44 \u2192 t12, t57: No.\n- NT34 \u2192 t9, t14: No.\n- NT39 \u2192 t40, t11: No.\n- NT35 \u2192 t47: No.\n- NT11 \u2192 t41, t49: No.\n- NT30 \u2192 t84, t22, t10: No.\n- NT7 \u2192 t36: No.\n- NT25 \u2192 t58: No.\n- NT37 \u2192 t30, t35: No.\n- NT11 \u2192 t41, t49: No.\n- NT30 \u2192 t22, t84, t10: No.\n- NT7 \u2192 t36: No.\n- NT12 \u2192 t37: No.\n- NT52 \u2192 t14, t32: No.\n- NT44 \u2192 t12, t57: No.\n- NT18 \u2192 t69: No.\n- NT52 \u2192 t25: No.\n- NT33 \u2192 t73, t30: No.\n- NT55 \u2192 t21, t59: No.\n- NT42 \u2192 t55, t25: No.\n- NT37 \u2192 t13, t34: No.\n- NT21 \u2192 t33, t45: No.\n- NT40 \u2192 t28, t1: No, but wait, NT40 \u2192 t28, t1.\n\nWait, wait, looking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal on the left is rewritten as two non-terminals on the right. There are some symbols that look like 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. So the non-terminals are things like S, NT48, NT44, etc., and the terminals are the 't' strings.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t68 t77 t77 t26 t65 t31 t65 t77 t47 t25 t84 t27 t15 t7 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t37 t15 t25 t32 t15`.\n\nThat's quite a long string, 30 tokens. Each token is a terminal, so my task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal. Wait, no, actually Chomsky Normal Form has productions of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So in this grammar, most productions are two non-terminals, except where it's a single terminal.\n\nSo to parse the string, I can think of it as building a derivation tree where each step splits a non-terminal into two others, until we reach the terminals that match the string.\n\nNow, the string has 30 tokens. Let's count the number of non-terminals in the grammar to see if that helps. Wait, no, actually, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each production that produces a terminal contributes to the string.\n\nHmm, alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree with height log2(n), where n is the length of the string. But let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's better to map the string to the non-terminals in the grammar, seeing if each 't' can be produced by some rule. Wait, no, I think I need to generate the string by expanding S step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm for CNF grammars, which is commonly used for parsing. But since the string is 30 tokens, it might be tedious, but maybe I can find a pattern or some recurring substructures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see which 't' tokens can be generated by which non-terminals, building a look-up table for terminals and their possible sources.\n\nLet me start by listing all the production rules and terminals.\n\nThe grammar production rules are:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\nNT58 -> NT31 NT33\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\nNT34 -> NT9 NT14\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11\nNT35 -> NT47 NT44\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\nNT37 -> NT13 NT34\nNT21 -> NT33 NT45\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\nNT33 -> 't76' or 't30'\nNT33 has two productions: 't76' and 't30'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT11 -> 't31'\nNT30 -> 't84' or 't22' or 't10'\nNT7 -> 't36' or 't53' or 't28'\nNT29 -> 't5' or others\nNT14 -> 't42' or others\nNT43 -> 't55'\nNT55 -> 't83'\nNT6 -> 't4' or 't49'\nNT59 -> 't24' or others\nNT18 -> 't69'\nNT52 -> 't7' or 't58' or others\nNT35 -> 't27'\nNT48 -> 't68'\nNT49 -> 't47' or others\nNT13 -> 't5' or others\nNT52 has a rule -> 't77'?\n\nWait, maybe I should list each non-terminal and what terminals they can produce.\n\nLooking through the rules, many of them are directly producing terminals except for certain ones.

{"custom_id":"request-550","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's part of the language defined by the grammar. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. The start symbol is S, and each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems a bit lengthy. Let me try to parse some of the rules to see how they might be used in the given string. The string to evaluate is: t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t10 t48 t37 t25 t84 t27 t47 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t32 t15.\n\nI notice that each 't' followed by a number is either part of the rules directly or could be derived from a non-terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be produced by a terminal rule or be a part of the derivation.\n\nWait, let me correct that. In the grammar, each production is either a non-terminal breaking down into two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. So the string consists of terminal symbols (like t68, t26, etc.), so for the string to be generated by the grammar, each symbol in the string must be directly produced by a terminal rule in the grammar, or be part of a two-step derivation where two non-terminals generate the terminal symbols.\n\nSo my initial thought is that each terminal in the string must be present as an option in the right-hand side of some production. Let me check the grammar to see which terminals are allowed.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals like NT33, NT12, etc., have productions that result in terminals like 't76', 't30', 't65', etc. For example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30', NT37 can produce 't32' or 't35', and so on.\n\nSo the first step is to list all possible terminal strings that can be produced by the grammar. Each terminal in the string must match one of these options.\n\nLet's go through each 't' symbol in the string and see if they can be produced.\n\nFirst symbol: t68. Looking through the rules, does any NT produce t68? I see NT48 in the rules, and looking at its productions, the only terminal is t68 (NT48 -> t68). So yes, NT48 can produce t68. So position 1: t68 is acceptable.\n\nSecond symbol: t77. Where can t77 come from? Let me check the grammar. Looking for any NT with a production that includes t77. Wait, the given rules don't show any NT directly producing t77. Hmmm, maybe through a chain of productions? For example, does any NT produce t77 via a two-step process?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that directly gives t77. So maybe t77 isn't a terminal symbol in this grammar, but perhaps it's part of a non-terminal's productions, which then break down into other non-terminals leading to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again. The rules provided only give a few terminals here and there like t76, t30, t65, t26, etc. I don't see t77 as a direct terminal, so maybe the grammar doesn't generate 't77' at all. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated because it contains t77.\n\nWait, that would mean the answer is No. But let me make sure I'm not missing any production rules that include t77.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT44 -> NT29 NT1\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT52 -> NT14 NT32, etc.\nBut I don't see any rules that produce t77 directly or via a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the user's grammar again. Oh, wait, in the rules, I see NT48 -> t68, that's all. So t77 is not directly produced by any NT. Unless, through some derivation, a chain of NTs can lead to t77.\n\nBut unless NT48 is the only way to get t68, but t77 isn't present. So, perhaps the string contains a terminal symbol that isn't part of the grammar's terminal set, meaning the string cannot be derived.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check each symbol in the string to see if any are not present in the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t68, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t77, t77, t81, t76, t59, t28, t77, t77, t81, t25, t10, t48, t37, t25, t84, t27, t47, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t32, t15.\n\nSo, checking each:\n\nt68: present (NT48 -> t68). So yes.\n\nt77: Looking through the rules, do any NTs give t77? I don't see any. So t77 is not directly produced. Maybe via a chain? Let me think. For instance, does any NT lead to t77 through another NT's production?\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\nFor example, NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43. Now, NT12 is another NT. What does NT12 produce? Let me check the rules for NT12.\n\nLooking: NT12 -> NT39 NT32. So NT12 breaks into two other NTs. Similarly, NT43 is another NT.\n\nWait, let's try to see if any of these NTs can eventually produce t77.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the grammar doesn't have any NTs that can produce t77, which would mean that t77 is not part of the grammar's terminal symbols. So any string containing t77 can't be generated by this grammar, hence the answer would be No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing some steps. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1: so NT29 might lead somewhere.\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35.\n\nWait, so NT29 can go to NT7 and NT35.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43. Then NT12 is NT39 NT32.\n\nWait, this could go on indefinitely unless a terminal is reached.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find a way to produce t77.\n\nLooking, I see NT7 produces t36 (from NT20 -> t26, but that's not t77).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: is there any path in the grammar that eventually leads to a terminal symbol? For example, does any NT produce a terminal? It seems that for many NTs, their productions only lead to other NTs, hence not directly to terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, some NTs do produce terminals. Let me list all NTs and their productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT25 (as per NT9 \u2192 't25').\n\nWait, NT9 is a terminal. So NT9 can produce t25.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 has a production: NT25 \u2192 't58' and also NT25 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, so NT9 \u2192 t25, which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT20 \u2192 't26' and also NT20 \u2192 NT8 NSomething.\n\nSo, some NTs do produce terminals. Let's see:\n\nLet me find all NTs and their terminal options.\n\n- NT7: NT43 is another NT, so no terminal.\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8: NT20 leads to t26 or another NT, so NT31's production leads to t26.\n\nWait, but NT31's production is NT20 and NT8. So each step from NT31 will go to NT20 (which produces t26) and NT8, which is another NT. Wait, looking at NT8: NT8 \u2192 't69' and also NT8 \u2192 something else?

{"custom_id":"request-557","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's see. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't68 t77 t26 ...' etc.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Let's list out the productions to see how the non-terminals expand. The top-level non-terminal is S, which produces NT48 NT11. Both NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals that eventually produce terminal symbols (the 't' followed by numbers) or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, each non-terminal on the left has a production with two parts on the right. So, the string we're evaluating is a series of t's and numbers, which suggests that the non-terminals in the grammar eventually derive these tokens.\n\nI think a good approach would be to try to parse the string from the top down. Starting with S, which splits into NT48 and NT11. Each of these needs to derive their respective parts of the string.\n\nLet me break down S -> NT48 NT11. So the string should be split into two parts: the first part should be generated by NT48 and the second by NT11.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t26 t36 t42 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t3 t31 t55 t47 t25 t84 t27 t15\"\n\nThe first part of the string that NT48 should generate is \"t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81\". Let's see if that can be built from NT48's productions.\n\nLooking at NT48's productions: The only production is NT48 -> NT28 NT42. So NT48 must derive \"t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81\", which is \"t68\", \"t77\", \"t26\", \"t59\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t77\", \"t81\".\n\nLet me see if I can get these from NT28 and NT42.\n\nNT28's production is NT28 -> NT59 NT14, but looking at the grammar, NT59 and NT14 have productions that can lead to terminals. Let me check NT59: it can produce 't59' or 't24', and NT14 can produce 't14' or 't42'.\n\nWait, but in the first part, the first token is 't68', but NT28 starts with 't59' or 't24' depending on the production. That means NT28's first step is 't59' or 't24', neither of which are 't68'. So this seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 is derived into NT28 NT42. NT28's production is NT59 NT14. Let's see the possible terminals from NT59 and NT14.\n\nNT59: production is either 't59' or NT18 NT1. NT18 is 't69' or 't1'. NT1 is 't19' or 't41'. So NT59's possible terminals are 't59', 't69', 't19', 't1'.\n\nNT14: production is 't14' or NT42 NT1. NT42 is NT55 NT25. Looking at NT55, it's 't55' or NT21 NT59. NT21 is 't21' or NT33 NT45. NT33 can be 't33' or 't30'. NT45 is 't45' or NT29 NT1, etc.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of going from S, let's see if the entire string can be formed by following the grammar's productions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a parsing strategy like recursive descent. Let me outline the grammar structure again.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\nNT48 \u2192 NT28 NT42\nNT28 \u2192 NT59 NT14\nNT59 \u2192 't59' | NT18 NT1\nNT18 \u2192 't18' | NT1 NT58\nNT1 \u2192 't1' | NT19 NT41\n... and so on.\n\nHmm, this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string from the bottom up.\n\nEach non-terminal must derive a sequence of terminals. Let me try to see if the string can be split into the required non-terminals.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t26 t36 t42 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t3 t31 t55 t47 t25 t84 t27 t15\n\nLet me start from the beginning. The first token is 't68', which must come from somewhere. Looking at the grammar, terminals are on the right side of productions. So 't68' could be from NT48 or any of its non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014the terminals are only in the productions, so each step must produce specific terminals.\n\nLooking at NT48: it's NT28 NT42. So the first token must come from NT28, which is 't59' or NT14. Alternatively, if NT28 is generating its own terminal, it would have to be 't59' as the immediate first token. But the string starts with 't68', so that's a problem because NT28's first production is 't59' or something else.\n\nWait, that's an issue. Because according to the grammar, NT28 produces NT59 NT14. NT59 can produce 't59' if the next symbol is 't59', but the string starts with 't68', which is not 't59'. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, it's impossible for the first token to be 't68' because NT28 can't derive it.\n\nSo that suggests the string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the initial NT48 is being split differently. But no, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and each non-terminal must produce the respective part. So if NT48 is NT28 NT42, then the first token must be from NT28, which can only produce 't59' or something else that starts with 't59', not 't68'.\n\nSo indeed, the string starts with 't68', which can't come from NT28. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since I'm new to this, I'll start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This simplification helps in parsing and understanding the derivation process.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, while others directly produce terminal symbols (the 't's and numbers). My task is to see if the given string can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions until only terminals remain.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must start with whatever NT48 and NT11 produce. Looking at each of these non-terminals, they seem to expand into other non-terminals. For example, NT48 might eventually lead to a terminal like 't68' based on the productions.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into parts to see if each terminal can be matched by the productions of the grammar. Let's list the string again for clarity:\n\nt68 t77 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t65 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t5 t25 t76 t55 t25 t22 t48 t66 t55 t55 t47\n\nEach 't' or number is a terminal or a non-terminal, respectively. I'll go through each step of the string and see if it can derive from the grammar.\n\n1. Starting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n   - NT48's production leads to 't68' (from NT48 \u2192 't68')\n   - NT11's production leads to 't77' (looking at NT11 \u2192 t77)\n   So, the first two tokens are t68 t77, which matches the start.\n\n2. Next, the third token is t77. So, the second level of expansion would involve NT48's second symbol or NT11 producing more. Wait, actually, I need to see how the productions expand step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree or seeing if each token in the string fits into the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, each token is either 't' followed by a number or just a single number. Let's check which non-terminals produce what terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, some non-terminals directly expand to terminals. For example:\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n- NT44 \u2192 't66' or 't73' or 't47' or 't73' again\n- NT48 \u2192 't68'\n- NT55 \u2192 't72' or 't83' ... wait, no, from the given grammar, some have multiple productions. Let me cross-reference.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread some parts. Let me list all non-terminals and their terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the terminals are:\nt68, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t31, t65, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t31, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t5, t25, t76, t55, t25, t22, t48, t66, t55, t55, t47.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at each rule for non-terminals:\n- NT48 \u2192 't68'\n- NT7 \u2192 't36' etc., but I think I should list all the terminals per non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to create a mapping of which non-terminals can produce which terminals. Let's go through the given rules:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76', 't30'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't40', 't11'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't28', 't1'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't55', 't25'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't66', 't73'\n\nNT45 \u2192 't29', 't1'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't81'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't7', 't35', 't58', 't55', 't19'\n\nWait, no, actually, for each NT, their rules are as follows:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't68'\n- NT44 \u2192 't66', 't73', 't47', 't73' (duplicate, but that's okay)\n- NT7 \u2192 't36', 't28', 't16', 't53', 't49', 't47'\n- NT33 \u2192 't76', 't30'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28', 't1', 't65', 't26', 't22', 't76', 't55', 't14', 't73', 't53', etc. Wait, no, each NT has a specific rule.\n\nActually, looking back, each rule is a production like NTxy \u2192 something. Each non-terminal's production is on the left, and the right side is either other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76' | 't30'\n\nMeaning NT33 can produce either 't76' or 't30'.\n\nSimilarly, NT35 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't65', 't26', 't59', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps for each non-terminal, list their possible terminal outputs.\n\nLet me create a list for each non-terminal:\n\n1.

NT52 \u2192 't7', 't35', 't58', etc. Wait, let me look again:\n   NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32 (from NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32)\n   NT52 also has other productions?\nLooking back at the provided rules, some have 't's directly:\n- NT52 \u2192 't7', 't35', 't58', 't55', 't19', 't25'\nWait, no, actually, looking at each rule, NT52 is used in multiple production rules on the right. For example:\n- NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32\n- NT52 \u2192 NT19 NT41\n- NT52 \u2192 NT55 NT25\n- Also, in NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59\n   And NT55 has 't72', 't83' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal's production is singular, as each rule is one production. So, if I list each non-terminal's possible productions:\n\nNT33:\n- 't76', 't30'\n\nNT35:\n- 't3'\n\nNT40:\n- 't28', 't1', 't69'... Wait no, looking back.\n\nWait, in the provided rules:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't28', 't1', 't69', etc. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no, each production is a single production.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S, which can have two non-terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, right? Because Chomsky normal form requires each production (except the start) to be a single non-terminal. Wait, no, I think I might be confusing. Let me recall: Chomsky normal form requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, S is the start symbol and produces NT48 NT11, which are non-terminals. But looking further, the NT symbols like NT44, NT45, etc., all produce two non-terminals each. The only terminals are those where NT... \u2192 terminal. For example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30'. \n\nSo the entire language is built starting from S, which splits into two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. Each of these will produce other non-terminals, until we reach the terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string given is a series of terminal symbols, each preceded by a space. So my task is to see if this string can be derived by S.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think it's best to use a parsing approach. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can apply the CYK algorithm or check the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map the string to the grammar and see if each symbol can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me think about the string: It's 38 symbols long, but each symbol is a 't' followed by a number, so like t68, t77, etc. Since the grammar's NT rules split into non-terminals, I need to trace how these terminals might come from the non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must be generated by NT48 producing some sequence leading to the first t68 and NT11 leading to the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each NT produces exactly two non-terminals, except when it's a terminal (the 't' followed by a number). But looking at the grammar provided, each rule is like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'. So for example, NT33 can produce the terminal symbols 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13, meaning it produces a non-terminal NT42 and a non-terminal NT13.\n\nSo each non-terminal either splits into two non-terminals or produces a terminal. Therefore, the parsing tree will consist of a series of splits and productions until we reach a terminal.\n\nGiven the string, each symbol must come from a production of the corresponding non-terminal. So let's see: starting from S, it splits into NT48 and NT11.\n\nNow, the string starts with t68, so one of these two (NT48 or NT11) must derive to t68. Similarly, the next symbols are t77, t26, etc.\n\nLet me check the rules for each NT symbol that can produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n- NT30 \u2192 't84' or 't3' or 't22' or 't10'\n- NT19 \u2192 't28'\n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT25 \u2192 't58' or 't5'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26' or 't53'\n- NT13 \u2192 't5'\n- NT42 \u2192 't76'\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n- NT53 \u2192 't53' is not a production, wait, looking more carefully, let me see each NT's rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals and see which NTs can produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs produce terminals:\n\n- NT33: 't76', 't30'\n- NT30: 't84', 't3', 't22', 't10'\n- NT19: 't28'\n- NT41: 't77'\n- NT25: 't58', 't5'\n- NT20: 't26', 't53'\n- NT13: 't5'\n- NT42: 't76'\n- NT7: 't36'\n- NT53: looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT53 production except maybe I missed it. Let me check: looking at the list, perhaps there's a typo, but in the grammar provided, I don't see NT53 \u2192 't53' or any production. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The grammar has rules like NT30 \u2192 t84, t3, etc. So perhaps NT53 is a non-terminal that only splits into non-terminals and doesn't produce a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because the string includes t53, which would need to come from a terminal production. Wait, NT20 produces t26 and t53. So in the string, I see t26 right after t77 and t53.\n\nWait, the string is: t68 t77 t26 t53 t69 t69 t48 t69 t3 t69 t48 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t32 t25 t5 t25 t42 t76 t25 t84 t3 t76 t15.\n\nLooking at the first few terms: t68, t77, t26, t53.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The first term t68 must come from a production that eventually leads to t68. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t68? I don't see any NT producing t68 directly. Let me check each line. Hmm, in the rules: NT48 \u2192 t68? No, wait, the rule seems to be S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and looking further down, I see:\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t68. The only 't's are as follows:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n- NT30 \u2192 t84, t3, t22, t10\n- NT19 \u2192 t28\n- NT41 \u2192 t77\n- NT25 \u2192 t58, t5\n- NT20 \u2192 t26, t53\n- NT13 \u2192 t5\n- NT42 \u2192 t76\n- NT7 \u2192 t36\n- etc. Let me see if any NT produces t68.\n\nAfter checking the entire list, I don't see any NT that produces 't68' directly. So that means t68 cannot be generated, meaning the entire string is invalid. Because no NT rule leads to t68. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a rule. Let me cross-verify.

{"custom_id":"request-596","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF means. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol doesn't have any terminals directly producing it. So, in this grammar, all the productions seem to follow this structure.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t77 t81 t55 t77 t77 t31 t49 t4 t76 t65 t77 t81 t25 t5 t25 t42 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t55`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that many non-terminals are expanding into other non-terminals and terminals. For example, rules like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30', or NT6 \u2192 't4'. The string is a series of terminals, so the derivation must have reduced all non-terminals to terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to reconstruct the derivation starting from the start symbol S and see if it can produce the given string. Alternatively, I can parse the string from right to left or look for the leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and see if I can match it to the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the grammar is defined as S -> NT48 NT11. So the start symbol produces two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. Each of these must be further expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, the string has 39 tokens, which means it should be produced by a left derivation starting with S, which has two symbols, and each production step increases the number of symbols by one (since each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc.).\n\nBut maybe I should think of it as a binary tree: each non-terminal can have two children. So each step in the derivation will expand one non-terminal into two symbols, either both non-terminals or a mix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each terminal can be traced back to the start using the grammar rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the derivation from S. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be derived from NT48 and NT11, in the order they appear in the string. Hmm, but in the string, the order is a row of terminals. So let's see if the first NT48 can generate the first part and NT11 can generate the rest.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can parse the string by trying to match the rightmost or leftmost symbols against the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, using the Earley's algorithm with a parser might help, but I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to try to see if the string can be broken down into the components defined by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 39 terminals, all starting with 't's. Let me look for the rules that produce t's. For example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3' (Wait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, some rules are: NT35 \u2192 't27'? Wait, wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for any productions that result in a 't' terminal. For example, NT6 \u2192 't4', NT7 \u2192 't36', NT9 \u2192 't25', NT18 \u2192 't69', NT26 \u2192 't59', NT40 \u2192 't28', NT41 \u2192 't77', NT44 \u2192 't66', NT49 \u2192 't47', NT52 \u2192 't7', 't5', 't10', 't25', etc. There are many.\n\nSo, each 't' in the string must be the result of expanding a non-terminal rule that ends in that 't'.\n\nSo, since the string is a sequence of 't's, each 't' is generated directly from a rule of the form NT \u2192 'tX' (where X is another number). So, each of these 't's can be matched to a specific rule.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model the string as a sequence of rules leading to each 't'. But let me think about how to check this.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to see if the string can be split in such a way that each split corresponds to a production step.\n\nHmm, but given the complexity of the grammar, perhaps a better approach is to write down the string and see if I can trace the possible derivations.\n\nWait, the string is: t68 t77 t77 t81 t55 t77 t77 t31 t49 t4 t76 t65 t77 t81 t25 t5 t25 t42 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t55.\n\nWait, that seems really long, 39 't's. Each step of the derivation increases the number of symbols by one, but since S starts with two symbols, the number of steps required to reach 39 symbols would be 38 steps? Because starting with 1 symbol (S), each step adds one, so to get to 39 symbols, you need 38 steps.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because each production can add more than one symbol. Wait, no\u2014since the grammar is in CNF, each production is exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal\u2014wait no, if it's A \u2192 a, that's a terminal, so in that case, the production adds one terminal. Wait, but in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals. Because if you have A \u2192 a, that's allowed, but each production is at most two symbols.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, productions can be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So, when deriving, each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each step will replace each non-terminal with its production. So the length after n steps is 2^n. But in our case, the string has 39 symbols, which is an odd number and not a power of two. Let's see: 2^0 =1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64. But 39 is between 32 and 64, which suggests that this string cannot be derived from the given grammar because the number of symbols would have to be a power of two.\n\nWait, that makes sense. But in the given string, it's 39 symbols, which is not a power of two, and since each production step doubles the number of non-terminals, the total number of symbols would always be a power of two at each step. So, if the string length isn't a power of two, it's impossible to derive it.\n\nTherefore, without even checking, I can say that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because its length isn't a power of two.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning. So, starting with one symbol (S), each production step replaces each non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So, after each step, the number of symbols is multiplied by 2 for each non-terminal replaced. If all replacements are for non-terminals, then the number is multiplied by 2 each time. So, the total length would be N = 2^(k), where k is the number of steps. But if during some steps, a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal followed by a non-terminal (e.g., A \u2192 aB), that would result in a mix, but in this case, all productions are such that the number of non-terminals increases. So, in any case, the only way for the string to have a length that's not a power of two is if at least one terminal is inserted during a production step.\n\nWait, wait, that's a point I might have missed. If a production is A \u2192 a, that's one terminal symbol, so each time a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal and a non-terminal, the total increases by one instead of doubling. So, let me think: starting with 1, each production of A \u2192 BC adds two, so you have a multiplicative effect. If instead, you have a production where one symbol produces a terminal and a non-terminal, then"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-595","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite large with many production rules, so I need to approach this carefully.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A grammar is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit this structure as all rules are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, but wait, actually, some rules have two terminals on the right, like NT33 -> 't76' or 't30'. Oh, right, in some variations, CNF allows rules like A \u2192 aB or A \u2192 Ba, but here some rules directly produce two terminals, which might mean the grammar isn't strictly in CNF. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, some rules are like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30', which are directly terminals. That's allowed in CNF because CNF allows production rules where the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc. But in any case, the important thing is to parse the given string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t65 t77 t77 t26 t53 t7 t26 t65 t77 t26 t28 t65 t77 t26 t28 t25 t10 t48 t72 t58 t5 t55 t25 t32 t55.\n\nThat's a long string, 31 tokens. I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols should be NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t68. Now, according to the grammar, what does NT48 produce? Let me look up the production for NT48. Scanning through the rules, I find NT48 \u2192 t68. Perfect! So the first symbol t68 is matched by NT48, and the next symbol should be produced by NT11.\n\nNext, the second token is t77. What does NT11 produce? Checking the rules, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So now I need to parse the string after the second token using NT41 and NT49.\n\nWait a minute, the second token is t77. But NT11's production is two non-terminals: NT41 and NT49. So in order for NT11 to produce t77, that means either NT41 or NT49 must produce t77, but that's not possible unless one of them has a production that directly includes t77. Let me check the rules for NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at NT41: It's defined as NT41 \u2192 NT77. So NT41 can only produce NT77, which I need to check. Then, for NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, which is recursive and not directly producing t77. Hmm, that's a problem because the second token is t77, which should be the result of NT11's production. But NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49, and neither of these directly produce t77. So that's an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's backtrack. The first two symbols are t68 and t77, which correspond to NT48 \u2192 t68 and NT11 \u2192 t77. But NT11's production is NT41 and NT49. So for the production NT11, the two non-terminals NT41 and NT49 must be expanded into t77. But how?\n\nI need to check how NT41 and NT49 can produce t77. From the rules, NT41 \u2192 NT77. So NT41 produces NT77, which must then produce t77. Looking at NT77, what is its production? Let me search the list. I don't see NT77 in the list of productions provided by the user; instead, there's NT77 pointing to other non-terminals. That might be a problem because if NT77 is a non-terminal, it needs to have a production rule. Maybe I made a mistake in scanning the rules.\n\nWait, let me check again. The rules provided are for various NTs, but for example, NT77 is mentioned as \"NT77 -> ...\" but I don't see it defined. So perhaps NT77 doesn't have a rule, which would be a problem. Or maybe the rule was meant to point to another NT. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, but since I can't confirm, I have to proceed.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's list, I see that NT31 is defined as \"NT31 -> NT8 NT35\", and further down, NT31's production is also defined twice. So sometimes, rules can be duplicated or point to the same thing.\n\nWait, the user's production list includes some duplicate rules, for example, NT11 is defined as \"NT11 -> NT41 NT49\" twice. Maybe that's a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nNow, the key issue is that NT41 \u2192 NT77, and we need NT77 to produce t77. But if there's no production for NT77, that means we can't proceed. That suggests that the second token t77 might not be possible because NT11's production leads to NT41 and NT49, which can't produce t77. Therefore, the string would be invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see if there's any other way NT11 can produce t77. NT11's rule is only one: NT41 and NT49, so no, there's no direct production of t77. Thus, the parser would fail here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me check again. Does any NT produce t77 directly? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NTs that directly produce t77 except NT41 which goes to NT77. So without NT77 producing t77, it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the second symbol t77 cannot be derived from NT11, which in turn can't be derived from NT41 and NT49. Hence, the string as a whole is not in the language of the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should look deeper. Let's try to parse beyond the initial step. Maybe there's another path. But no\u2014the initial step is fixed: S starts with NT48 and NT11. The second token must come from NT11, which is NT41 and NT49. Since neither can produce t77, and there's no other production for NT11, the parser immediately fails.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the string starts with t68 (correct) and t77, which is impossible because NT11 only produces non-terminals that don't include t77.

{"custom_id":"request-611","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any rule except itself. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems all the non-terminals are on the left side, and each production either is a two-symbol combination or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the top-level symbol S is producing two non-terminals, NT48 and NT11.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t53 t69 t53 t69 t30 t25 t84 t27 t69 t48 t69 t48 t69 t27 t26 t69 t30 t25 t32 t53 t69 t73 t25 t22 t48 t73 t73 t55`.\n\nFirst, let's note that the string consists of a series of tokens, all of which are terminals (they are 't' followed by numbers). So, each symbol in the string is a terminal, meaning in the parse tree, each node must be generated directly by a production rule that produces a single terminal.\n\nSince this is in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the parse tree would be a binary tree where each node has either zero or two children (since all productions have two parts on the right except terminals, but wait, no: in CNF, all productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each non-terminal will produce exactly two other symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. Non-terminals will continue to split until they eventually produce terminals.\n\nSo, the string length is 36 symbols, and each production introduces exactly two new symbols. Starting from S, each step takes a non-terminal and splits it into two. The number of symbols at each level doubles until terminals are reached. However, since the string is a linear sequence, we have to see if it can be broken down into the right sequence of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step. Starting from the beginning, I'll try to find a production that matches the first few symbols.\n\nThe string starts with 't68 t77 t26 t69...'. Looking at the grammar, let's see which rules produce 't68' or 't77'.\n\nLooking at NT18 -> 't69', NT21 -> 't69'?

{"custom_id":"request-614","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a set of production rules where each non-terminal can be broken down into smaller non-terminals or into terminals (which are the 't' followed by numbers). The starting symbol is S, and the production rules are all in CNF, meaning each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two (or a non-terminal and a terminal, but in CNF, it's two non-terminals) on the right. But looking at the rules, some right-hand sides have terminals, so maybe it's not pure CNF since typically in CNF, all productions have non-terminals on both sides. Hmm, but the user said it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which allows for productions to have a terminal and a non-terminal, not necessarily two non-terminals. So perhaps the grammar is in a slightly different form, but the user specified Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps I should stick to that.\n\nWait, actually, standard Chomsky Normal Form requires all productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So perhaps in this case, some of the production rules are terminals? Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most production rules have two non-terminals on the right side, e.g., S -> NT48 NT11. But some rules, like S -> NT12 NT43, also have two non-terminals. So all the production rules seem to be in the form of two non-terminals, except for some that have a terminal. Wait no, looking again, I see that some rules have a terminal directly, like NT33 -> 't76', but perhaps it's just a terminal. So the grammar has both two-step and one-step productions, but in CNF, I think all are two-step except for terminals. Hmm, maybe the user included both. Anyway, I'll proceed.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t77 t26 t53 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t31 t4 t4 t25 t10 t48 t53 t69 t26 t69 t73 t25 t84 t27 t26 t26 t69 t69 t48 t73 t76 t55`.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. The goal is to see if this string can be derived from the starting symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nTo approach this, I'll try to build a derivation tree starting from S and see if the string can be generated.\n\nFirst, let's note that the grammar has multiple production rules, and the string is quite long. So perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar, perhaps using a top-down or bottom-up approach. Since it's a context-free grammar, a recursive descent parser or a Pratt parser could be used, but given the complexity, maybe a bottom-up approach is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the production rules.\n\nLet me see the structure of the string:\n\nt68 t77 t77 t26 t53 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t31 t4 t4 t25 t10 t48 t53 t69 t26 t69 t73 t25 t84 t27 t26 t26 t69 t69 t48 t73 t76 t55.\n\nThat's 34 tokens.

Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the string as given, it's a list of tokens delimited by spaces. Let's count them:\n\n\"t68 t77 t77 t26 t53 t42 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t31 t4 t4 t25 t10 t48 t53 t69 t26 t69 t73 t25 t84 t27 t26 t26 t69 t69 t48 t73 t76 t55\"\n\nThat's 33 tokens (since it's 34 words when splitting by spaces, but looking carefully, it's 33 words. Let me check:\n\n1. t68\n2. t77\n3. t77\n4. t26\n5. t53\n6. t42\n7. t59\n8. t28\n9. t77\n10. t77\n11. t77\n12. t31\n13. t4\n14. t4\n15. t25\n16. t10\n17. t48\n18. t53\n19. t69\n20. t26\n21. t69\n22. t73\n23. t25\n24. t84\n25. t27\n26. t26\n27. t26\n28. t69\n29. t69\n30. t48\n31. t73\n32. t76\n33. t55.\n\nSo yeah, 33 tokens.\n\nNow, the starting symbol is S, which is defined as S -> NT48 NT11. So to start, S must be expanded into NT48 and NT11.\n\nSo the string must start with the concatenation of what NT48 and NT11 produce.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT48: Looking through the list, I see NT48 -> NT11 NT6.

Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking for NT11 in the grammar, yes, NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo S expands to NT11 NT6 NT11, which then becomes NT41 NT49 NT6 NT41 NT49.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps I should look for the beginning of the string to match the productions.\n\nThe first token is t68. Let's see if that's part of any production.\n\nLooking for NT48: NT48 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nLooking for the token 't68' in the productions. Checking the grammar, does any rule produce 't68'?

{"custom_id":"request-630","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to evaluate. The goal is to determine whether the string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The grammar consists of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT44, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals or terminals. The starting symbol is S, which according to the first rule, expands into NT48 and NT11. So S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t77 t26 t69 t48 t53 t69 t69 t27 t76 t25 t32 t69 t48 t69 t27 t69 t48 t83 t58 t5 t76 t25 t19 t25 t42 t73 t15 t37 t77 t31 t49 t49`.\n\nI notice that every production in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or terminals. So each step in parsing the string will involve expanding non-terminals until we reach terminals, which should match the string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the initial production S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols after S would be the two parts generated by NT48 and NT11. Wait, no, actually, each production is a single rule, so the string is a sequence of symbols. Each NT in the grammar can either generate two NTs or a terminal. So to parse the string, I need to see if it can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a concatenation of symbols, each of which must be generated by the non-terminals expanding step by step. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (each production has two non-terminals), the parsing process would involve a series of steps where each non-terminal is expanded into two symbols, and so on until the string is fully generated.\n\nI'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Maybe I can try to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation would be the way to go. Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for all the terminals in the string and see if they can match the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, I see several 't' followed by numbers. Let me list them:\n\nt68, t77, t77, t26, t69, t48, t53, t69, t69, t27, t76, t25, t32, t69, t48, t69, t27, t69, t48, t83, t58, t5, t76, t25, t19, t25, t42, t73, t15, t37, t77, t31, t49, t49.\n\nNow, I check if each token is present in the grammar's terminals. Terminal symbols are those that appear on the right-hand side of a production, not as non-terminals. Looking through the grammar rules, the terminal symbols are:\n\nt68, t77, t26, t69, t48, t53, t76, t25, t5, t77, t32, t69, t48, t27, t83, t58, t5, t76, t25, t19, t25, t42, t73, t15, t37, t77, t31, t49, t49.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't65'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28'\n- NT42 \u2192 't55'\n- NT49 \u2192 't16' and 't7'\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't26'\n\nSimilarly, NT33 \u2192 't76' and 't30'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't73'\n\nWait, let me go through all the rules:\n\nLine by line:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76' and 't30' (from NT33 \u2192 't76' and 't30'?)\n\nWait, no, actually each grammar rule is written as the non-terminal on the left goes to the right side. But looking at it more carefully, some rules have terminals, others have non-terminals. For example, looking at the given grammar:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76'\nNT33 \u2192 't30'\n\nSimilarly, NT55 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nSo each non-terminal production can produce either two non-terminals (like NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1) or a terminal. \n\nSo, the terminal symbols present are all the 't' followed by numbers in the right-hand side. So from the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt68, t77, t26, t69, t48, t53, t76, t25, t5, t83, t58, t19, t25, t42, t73, t15, t37, t31, t49, t30, t76, t28, t59, t22, t9, t8, etc. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the right-hand sides have a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, some rules produce terminals, some produce non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4' (wait, no, NT6 \u2192 't4'? Looking at the grammar: NT6 \u2192 't4').\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse each rule correctly.\n\nLooking at each rule line by line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n2. NT44 \u2192 NT29 NT1\n3. NT12 \u2192 NT31 NT58\n4. NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-636","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and string are provided, and I have to determine yes or no. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF grammar has all production rules of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most of the rules seem to be non-terminals splitting into two other non-terminals, so that's consistent with CNF. But I also notice some rules directly go to terminals, like NT33 -> 't76' or NT33 -> 't30'. I need to make a note of those.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t68 t77 t31 t7 t77 t26 t26 t69 t69 t48 t66 t73 t55 t25 t26 t26 t69 t69 t48 t30 t26 t69 t26 t69 t73 t55 t27 t28 t77 t12 t58 t5 t30 t15.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to start from the start symbol, which looks like S. According to the grammar, S -> NT48 NT11. So the first step is for S to produce NT48 and NT11. So the string starts with symbols derived from NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t68. Let me check what NT48 can produce. Scanning the productions for NT48: from the grammar, I see NT48 -> NT14 NT41 and NT49 -> NT16 NT7, and a few others, but specifically, looking at NT48, I don't see a production for NT48 directly. Wait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see that NT48 appears in the rules but I don't see a direct production for NT48. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT48, I see it's produced by NT14 and NT41, and another production, but perhaps I'm missing the direct rule for NT48. Oh wait, in the initial part of the grammar, the first production is S-> NT48 NT11. So S splits into NT48 and NT11. Now, looking for NT48, I go through the provided productions. For example, NT48 appears in the production of NT33 (twice), NT49, NT59, etc. Wait, but is there a direct production for NT48? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT48 is produced by NT14 NT41 and also by NT49 (from some rule I'm not sure, perhaps). Wait, perhaps I should go through each non-terminal and see which ones can produce terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree bottom-up, checking each token.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order: t68, t77, t31, t7, t77, t26, t26, t69, t69, t48, t66, t73, t55, t25, t26, t26, t69, t69, t48, t30, t26, t69, t26, t69, t73, t55, t27, t28, t77, t12, t58, t5, t30, t15.\n\nI think the best way is to try to backtrack the string through the grammar. Each non-terminal should expand into two non-terminals, and so on until we reach terminals.\n\nStarting with the string, we can try to see if each non-terminal can produce the needed part. But maybe it's better to think starting from S.\n\nLet me outline S as NT48 NT11. So the string starts with NT48 followed by NT11.\n\nFirst token is t68, so let's see if NT48 can produce something that starts with t68. From the grammar, I see that NT48 -> NT14 NT41. But I don't see NT14 or NT41 directly producing terminals, so perhaps this path isn't correct. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NT48 production again.\n\nWait, looking back, in the provided grammar under NT48, the first rule is NT48 -> NT14 NT41. Then later, under NT48, I see another production: NT48 -> NT6 NT49, which is another possible expansion. Also, there's another production: NT48 -> t4, but is that correct?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, for example, in NT33, we have NT33 -> 't76' and NT33 -> 't30'. Similarly, others have terminal rules. Wait, but I don't see a direct production for NT48, except maybe looking further down.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all NT48 rules again from the provided grammar:\n\n- NT48 -> NT14 NT41\n- NT48 -> NT49 \u2192 Not sure, perhaps I miscounted. Wait, looking back, maybe there's a production for NT48 somewhere. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the entire grammar to list all NT48 productions. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to see if any of the non-terminals in the string can expand to a terminal sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list all the terminal productions to see if they include any relevant terminals.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\nNT33 -> 't76' or 't30'\n\nNT35 -> 't3'\n\nNT57 -> 't9' and 't37'\n\nWait, others:\n\n- NT32 -> NT39 NT57\n\n- NT44 -> NT9 NT14\n\n- NT12 -> NT39 NT32\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look at each part of the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t68. So t68 must be produced by a terminal production or by a non-terminal that produces it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see which non-terminals have terminal productions. For example, NT6 -> 't4', so if a non-terminal can expand to NT6, then it can produce t4.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 -> 't58'\n\nNT15 -> 't76'\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, any non-terminal that directly maps to a terminal is a terminal production.

{"custom_id":"request-653","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the grammar provided. It seems a bit complex with many non-terminal symbols, each eventually producing a terminal string or some combination of them. My goal is to check if the string `t68 t77 t77 t77 t26 t36 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t48 t65 t31 t65 t77 t47 t25 t5 t25 t76 t25 t10 t3 t77 t77 t26 t28 t4 t37 t31 t4 t4` can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11, so any valid string must start with NT48 followed by NT11. The initial step is to see if the string begins with these two symbols. Looking at the string, the first term is t68, so I need to figure out what NT48 expands to.\n\nLooking at NT48 in the grammar, I see that it's a terminal symbol, so NT48 directly produces t68. So the first part matches. Next, NT11 should produce t77. Checking the production for NT11, it's NT41 NT49. Wait, that's two symbols. I need to see what NT41 and NT49 expand to.\n\nNT41 is a terminal, producing t77. NT49 is another non-terminal. Let me check NT49's production: according to the rules, NT49 -> NT11 NT6. Okay, so NT49 will expand into NT11 and NT6. That means after t77 from NT41, there's NT49 => NT11 NT6. Now, NT11 is t77, and NT6 is t4.\n\nWait, but in the string, after the first t68, the next terms are t77, t77, t77. Let's track this step by step. The entire string is:\n\nt68 t77 t77 t77 t26 t36 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t48 t65 t31 t65 t77 t47 t25 t5 t25 t76 t25 t10 t3 t77 t77 t26 t28 t4 t37 t31 t4 t4.\n\nSo the first part after S -> NT48 NT11 would be t68 t77 (from NT48 -> t68 and NT11 -> NT41 NT49, where NT41 is t77). Now, NT49 needs to be expanded. So after t77, the next part is another t77, which would come from NT49 expanding into t77 (from NT41), but wait, hold on. Wait, no: NT49 produces NT11 and NT6, which are both terminals. So NT49 directly expands into t77 (NT11) and t4 (NT6). So the full expansion of NT11 is NT41 NT49, which is t77 followed by t77 and t4. Hmm, but in the string, after the initial t68 t77, the next two terms are t77 and t77 again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to reconstruct the steps.\n\n1. S -> NT48 NT11\n   NT48 -> t68\n   NT11 -> NT41 NT49\n   NT41 -> t77\n   NT49 -> NT11 NT6\n      NT11 -> t77\n      NT6 -> t4\n\nSo the expansion of S would start as t68 t77 (from NT48) followed by t77 t4 (from NT11). But in the string, after t68, the next three terms are t77, t77, t77. So that's not matching because after t68 t77, the next term should be t77 followed by t4, which would make it t68 t77 t77 t4. But in the string, it's t68 t77 t77 t77...\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So maybe my initial approach is wrong. Perhaps I need to look deeper into the grammar and see if there are multiple ways to expand NT49.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out each production step for the given string. Let's list the string again:\n\nt68 t77 t77 t77 t26 t36 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t48 t65 t31 t65 t77 t47 t25 t5 t25 t76 t25 t10 t3 t77 t77 t26 t28 t4 t37 t31 t4 t4.\n\nWe start with S, which is NT48 NT11. So first, NT48 must produce t68, which matches the first t68. Then, NT11 must produce something that leads to the next t77 t77 t77... Let's dissect.\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\nNT41 -> t77\n\nSo after the first t68, we have t77 from NT41. Now, NT49 needs to produce the next terms. Let's look at NT49's production: NT49 can be NT11 NT6. So after t77 from NT41, we have NT49 -> t77 (from NT11) and t4 (from NT6). So the next terms should be t77 followed by t4. But in the string, after the first t77, the next two t77s don't include a t4. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT49 production has other rules. Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT49 actually has two productions: NT49 -> NT11 NT6 and NT49 -> NT13 NT52? Or wait, let me check again. Oh, no. Wait, the given grammar for NT49 is only NT11 NT6. I think I might have misread that earlier.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nSo NT49 only has one production, which is NT11 and NT6. So after NT41 (t77) and NT49, which produces t77 t4, the expansion would be t68 t77 t77 t4.\n\nBut in the string, after the initial t68, the next terms are t77, t77, t77. That doesn't align because the third term would be t77, then the fourth would be t4. So that's a mismatch. Therefore, this suggests perhaps the string is not generated by the grammar as it's expecting an extra t4 after the third t77.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the production again for S: S->NT48 NT11. So S starts with t68, then NT11. NT11 is NT41 NT49, which is t77 followed by t77 t4. So the initial part would be t68 t77 t77 t4. But the string starts with t68 followed by three t77s, which is t68 t77 t77 t77..., which includes a t77 after the initial t68 and t77, making it t68 t77 t77... So that's a problem because the grammar only allows for t77 followed by t4 after that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about deeper expansion of NT49. Oh wait, no\u2014because NT49 only has one production. So after NT49, it's t77 t4, no other possibilities. So the initial expansion after S would be t68 t77 t77 t4. But the string has t68 t77 t77 t77, which is an extra t77.\n\nThat suggests that the string does not match the grammar, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other production paths.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar rules. Let me check again for NT49: looking at the provided grammar, the line says NT49 -> NT11 NT6. So that's it. No alternatives, only one rule.\n\nTherefore, after S -> NT48 NT11, which is t68 and then NT11 -> t77 and then NT49 -> t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-652","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me see how I can approach this. Hmm, I think I need to parse the string using the rules of the grammar and see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. The grammar seems to consist of multiple production rules starting from S and others. The initial rule is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the derivation starts with NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me note the string as a list of tokens for clarity: [\"t68\", \"t77\", \"t77\", \"t26\", \"t59\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t77\", \"t26\", \"t59\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t31\", \"t59\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t77\", \"t77\", \"t26\", \"t36\", \"t4\", \"t25\", \"t5\", \"t25\", \"t76\", \"t55\", \"t59\", \"t28\", \"t77\", \"t77\", \"t47\", \"t25\", \"t32\", \"t55\", \"t49\"].\n\nWait, that's a lot of tokens. Let me see if I can match these to the grammar rules. Each rule in the grammar seems to split into two non-terminals except for some that produce terminals directly. So, for example, some rules like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30' mean that when we apply that rule, we get a single token.\n\nI think I should approach this by starting from the start symbol S and applying its production, which is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the initial expansion would have two branches: NT48 and NT11. I'll have to see if each of these can derive the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is \"t68\". Let me see which non-terminal can produce \"t68\". Scanning the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 't68'. So that means when we apply S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the first token would come from NT48, which directly produces \"t68\". So that matches the first token.\n\nNow, the next token is \"t77\". Let's see what comes next. After NT48, the next non-terminal is NT11. So, I need to find a rule for NT11 that can generate \"t77\".\n\nLooking through the rules, NT11 \u2192 't77' is a production. So, that's a direct match. So the first two tokens are matched: \"t68\" and \"t77\" come from S \u2192 NT48 't68' followed by NT11 't77'.\n\nMoving on, the third token is \"t77\", which would come from the next application of NT48 or another non-terminal. Wait, actually, each production step involves expanding a non-terminal into two parts. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which in turn can be expanded further until terminals are produced.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to parse the string step by step, applying the rules in reverse. That is, starting from the entire string and trying to match against the right-hand sides of the grammar rules. This might be more efficient because the string is quite long.\n\nSo, let me list all the production rules and see which ones can produce the tokens in the string. Another approach is to identify which non-terminals generate each token and see if they can be connected in a way that forms the entire string.\n\nLooking at the tokens, \"t68\" is from NT48, \"t77\" is from NT11, \"t26\" is from NT7, \"t59\" is from NT20, \"t31\" is from NT19, \"t4\" is from NT52, \"t28\" is from NT37, \"t76\" is from NT33, etc. I think it's better to create a map of which non-terminals can produce which tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if each part of the string can be derived from S by expanding step by step. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the first token must be \"t68\" (from NT48) followed by whatever NT11 produces. The string starts with \"t68 t77 t77...\", which matches S \u2192 NT48 followed by NT11. So after S, we have NT48 \u2192 \"t68\", and then NT11 \u2192 \"t77\". So the first two tokens are matched.\n\nNow, after \"t77\", the next token is \"t77\". Let's see where that comes from. The next non-terminal in the expansion after NT11 is... Wait, actually, each expansion can be split into two branches, so perhaps the next part is a combination of the expansions of NT48 and NT11. Or maybe it's better to think of the entire string as a series of applications of the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a table-driven parser approach, where I have to see if the entire string can be consumed by expanding S step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to break down the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me try to write the string with indices for clarity:\n\n1: t68\n2: t77\n3: t77\n4: t26\n5: t59\n6: t28\n7: t77\n8: t77\n9: t26\n10: t59\n11: t28\n12: t77\n13: t31\n14: t59\n15: t28\n16: t77\n17: t77\n18: t77\n19: t26\n20: t36\n21: t4\n22: t25\n23: t5\n24: t25\n25: t76\n26: t55\n27: t59\n28: t28\n29: t77\n30: t77\n31: t47\n32: t25\n33: t32\n34: t55\n35: t49\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I need to focus on the first few steps and see if the string can be derived.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 't68' (matched), leaving the rest to be matched by NT11.\n\nWait, no, because S is replacing with NT48 and NT11 as two separate parts. So the entire string must be a concatenation of two parts: the expansion of NT48 and the expansion of NT11.\n\nSo the first part starts with NT48, which produces \"t68\". The next non-terminal is NT11, which produces \"t77\". So the first two tokens are \"t68 t77\", which matches the string.\n\nNow, after that, the next parts depend on how NT48 and NT11 expand further.\n\nBut wait, since we're using the grammar in CNF, each application replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. But then each of these can be expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to parse the string as a series of steps where each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two parts, and seeing if they match the string.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nThe entire string must be derived by expanding S. Let's attempt to parse it step by step.\n\n1. Start with S: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must start with the expansion of NT48 and NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 't68', so the first token is \"t68\".\n\nNT11 \u2192 't77', so the second token is \"t77\".\n\nNow we have the string tokens 1 and 2 matched: [\"t68\", \"t77\"].\n\nNext, the third token is \"t77\". Let's see how we can parse this. After NT11 is \"t77\", we need to figure out how the first part (NT48) can produce the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to track the expansion more carefully.

It seems to consist of multiple production rules that break down terminals ('t' followed by numbers) and non-terminals (abbreviated as NT followed by numbers). The top-level rule is S -> NT48 NT11. So, the string must start with whatever NT48 and NT11 generate.\n\nStarting with NT48, according to the grammar, NT48 -> 't68'. So the first token 't68' matches. Then NT11 must generate 't77'. Looking at NT11's production rules, I see NT11 -> NT41 NT49. \n\nNow, let's break that down. NT41's rule is NT41 -> 't77' directly, so that's straightforward. Next, NT49 has two options: NT49 -> 't81' or NT49 -> 't47'. Wait, the string has 't77 t81 t65 t77 t81 t65...', but let me go step by step.\n\nWait, the string starts with t68 t77. So after NT48 (t68), the next is t77, which is from NT11. Let's consider NT11 -> NT41 NT49. NT41 is 't77'. Now, NT49 must produce 't81' because the string's third token is 't65', but wait, that's the third token. Wait, let's recount.\n\nThe entire string is 43 tokens long, but let's just focus on the initial steps. After t68 (from NT48), the next is t77 (from NT41). So after that, the next token should be t41's output 't77', but the third token in the string is t65. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me write down the tokens in order:\n\n1. t68\n2. t77\n3. t65\n4. t77\n5. t81\n6. t65\n\nWait, after t77 (from NT41), the next should be NT49's output. What does NT49 produce? NT49 can be either 't47' or 't81'. The third token is 't65', which is actually NT12 or NT9 or others, but let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me retrace. The string starts with t68 (from NT48). Then the next part is t77, which is from NT11's first production: NT11 -> NT41 NT49. NT41 is 't77', so after that, we have NT49, which should produce 't77' again, but in the string, the third token is 't65', which is not t77 or t47.\n\nWait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let's re-examine the grammar. NT11 -> NT41 NT49, and NT49 can be 't47' or 't81'. The string after t77 (from NT41) has t65 as the third token, which is 't65'. I don't see a rule where NT11 produces 't65'. That suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let me check the grammar again. Starting with S -> NT48 NT11. So the first tokens should be NT48 and NT11. NT48 is 't68'. Then, NT11 is split into NT41 and NT49. NT41 is 't77'. So after 't68' comes 't77' from NT41. Then, the next non-terminal is NT49, which can be either 't47' or 't81'.\n\nIn the string, after 't77' (from NT41), the next token is 't65' (third token). But NT49 doesn't produce 't65'. So that suggests a contradiction. Wait, but maybe 't65' comes from another part of the string. Let me check the string again:\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t26 t53 t69 t69 t48 t65 t77 t81 t65 t77 t47 t25 t19 t25 t42 t25 t84 t48 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t28 t25 t32 t25 t19 t25 t42 t76 t15.\n\nHmm, so after t77 (from NT41), the next token is t26, which is 't26'. Let me see where 't26' comes from. Looking at the grammar, 't26' is produced by NT20. So perhaps after NT49, which is the second non-terminal, we have another step.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me parse this correctly. The grammar is in CNF, so each production rule is a binary split. So S -> NT48 NT11. Each of these can further split.\n\nWait, the initial derivation would be S => NT48 NT11. NT48 is 't68', and NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49. So the string starts with t68 t77 t47\/t81. But in the string, it's t77 followed by t26, etc. So that suggests that NT11's second non-terminal is leading to something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial split is more complex. Let me try to parse the entire string using the grammar, step by step.\n\nStart with the entire string: [t68, t77, t26, t53, t69, t69, t48, t65, t77, t81, t65, t77, t47, t25, t19, t25, t42, t25, t84, t48, t65, t31, t59, t28, t77, t77, t26, t28, t25, t32, t25, t19, t25, t42, t76, t15]\n\nThe first two tokens should be derived from S -> NT48 NT11. So NT48 is 't68', which matches the first token. Then NT11 must produce the second token and onward. But wait, NT48 is just 't68'; the next non-terminal is NT11, which produces two tokens. So the second token must come from the first part of NT11, and the third token from the second part.\n\nSo: S => NT48 NT11 => 't68' followed by NT11's tokens.\n\nNT11 can be NT41 NT49. So NT41 is 't77', so the next token should be 't77'. So far, the string's first three tokens are t68, t77, t26. That implies that after 't77' from NT41, the third token comes from NT49, which is either 't47' or 't81'. But the third token is 't26', which is 't26'. So that suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I have to parse the entire string as a sequence of non-terminals and terminals, using the grammar rules to expand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should attempt to reduce the string from the bottom up, using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the smallest possible parts of the string that can be matched by a single non-terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at 't15' as the last token. What non-terminals can produce 't15'? Looking at the grammar, 't15' is produced by NT47. So the last token must come from NT47.\n\nSo, to reduce the string, the last token is from NT47. The rule for NT47 is NT47 -> 't48'. So before 't48' in the reverse order, there must be a NT47.\n\nWait, no.

But looking at the grammar, I see that some productions end with terminals, like NT33 -> 't76' or 't30'. So, the CNF as defined here allows for that, which is a bit non-standard but manageable.\n\nThe start symbol is S, so I need to see if S can derive the given string. The initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, each of these will need to derive parts of the string. \n\nSince the string starts with 't68', I need to see if NT48 can produce 't68'. Looking at the productions for NT48: I don't see one directly, but in CNF, it would probably have productions that eventually derive to terminals. Wait, in the grammar, for example, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, and NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, etc. So I need to trace through the possible derivations to see if the terminals can combine to form the string.\n\nBut given the length of the string, it's going to be quite a lot of steps. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar, seeing if each token in the string can be matched by the productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t77 t47 t65 t77 t77 t47 t65 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t65 t31 t25 t84 t48 t30 t28 t3 t28 t77 t69 t28 t77 t58 t19 t15 t25 t5 t25 t76 t15.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the string, it's a list of tokens separated by spaces. So each 't...' is a terminal symbol. The grammar's non-terminals are prefixed with NT, like NT33, so I need to ensure that the derivation steps can match these terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo first, nt48 and nt11 must derive to parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT48, I don't see a direct production to 't68' in the grammar. Wait, let's check NT48 in the grammar. I see:\n\n- NT44 -> NT29 NT1\n- NT48 -> t68 (maybe? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT48, there's no production. Oh, maybe I missed it. Wait, no, all the NTs are as listed. Wait, looking at the grammar, I need to check all the productions for each NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar entries:\n\nFor NT48, I don't see any production. Hmm, that's a problem. The initial production for S is NT48, but NT48 doesn't have any productions except for one that was supposed to be there. Wait, let me check: in the provided grammar, under NT48, is there a production? Looking through the list:\n\nNo, I don't see NT48 being defined in any production. Only NT33, NT40, NT45, etc., but NT48 isn't there. So S \u2192 NT48 would not have any way to start, so S can't produce anything. But the string starts with t68, which is a terminal, so that would only be produced by NT48 if it had a production to 't68', which it doesn't. So maybe the string can't be generated because S can't derive to 't68'. \n\nWait, but maybe the grammar was transcribed incorrectly. Let me double-check the user's input. The grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11. Looking at the grammar list, the productions for NT48: I don't see any. Because in the list, for example, NT49 has a production, NT48 isn't listed. So perhaps that was a typo, and in reality, NT48 could have a production like NT48 -> 't68', but in the given grammar, that's not the case. \n\nTherefore, the start symbol S cannot produce 't68' as its first step because S \u2192 NT48 NT11 requires NT48 to have a production, which it doesn't have, or at least not to any terminal. So that would mean the string can't be generated, so the answer would be No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the grammar does have a production for NT48. Let me go through the list again. Scanning through all the NTs:\n\nLooking for NT48: I see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, but no NT48. So, no production for NT48. Therefore, S cannot produce anything.

What's the rule for NT11? From the grammar: NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So, NT11 expands to NT41 NT49.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 -> NT52 NT49. So NT6 is NT52 NT49.\n\nSo the first part after t68 is NT11 and NT6, which split into NT41 NT49 and NT52 NT49. But how does that connect to the string?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parse the string step by step, expanding non-terminals to terminals or other non-terminals. Let me try building a parse tree.\n\nThe entire string is a sequence of terminals, so each production must expand to a sequence of terminals without any non-terminals left.\n\nLet me list all the grammar rules for better clarity:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT44 -> NT42 NT13\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49\n\nNT58 -> NT31 NT33\n\nNT57 -> NT9 NT37\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT1\n\nNT32 -> NT39 NT57\n\nNT45 -> NT29 NT1\n\nNT34 -> NT9 NT14\n\nNT39 -> NT40 NT11\n\nNT35 -> NT47 NT44\n\nNT1 -> NT19 NT41\n\nNT31 -> NT20 NT8\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT43\n\nNT37 -> NT30 NT35\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\n\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\n\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\n\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\n\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\n\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\n\nNT37 -> NT13 NT34\n\nNT21 -> NT33 NT45\n\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\n\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\n\nNT31 -> NT8 NT35\n\nNT33 -> 't76' or 't30'\n\nNT33 can produce either t76 or t30, which is important because the string has several 't77's, which I need to check.\n\nLet's go back to the initial string:\n\nt68, t77, t77, t77, t77, t31, t59, t28, t77, t31, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t10, t48, t66, t55, t25, t5, t25, t76, t55.\n\nLooking at 't68', which is from NT49. As above, NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nSo, the first part is NT49.\n\nThen, NT49 expands to NT11 and NT6.\n\nLet me first look up the production for NT11: NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, after NT49, we have NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nSo, after t68, the next tokens should be NT41 and NT49, then NT52 and NT49.\n\nBut in the string, after t68, the next token is t77, which is different from NT41 or NT52.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how to parse. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire string as being generated by multiple steps, and see if each symbol is correctly produced by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of terminals, I should check which non-terminals can generate each terminal and how they fit together.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt68, t77, t77, t77, t77, t31, t59, t28, t77, t31, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t10, t48, t66, t55, t25, t5, t25, t76, t55.\n\nSo, let's go through each symbol and see if they can be matched by the grammar.\n\nt68: generated by NT49.\n\nt77: Let's see which non-terminals produce t77. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT rule that outputs t77 directly. All the 't's have specific rules.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because none of the non-terminals have a rule that directly produces 't77'. That would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Because in the entire grammar, all terminals are specific combinations, and I don't see any production that generates 't77'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a typo. Let me double-check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the rules: No, none of the NT rules produce 't77'. The closest is 't68', 't76', 't30', 't26', etc. So if the string contains a 't77', which is not present anywhere in the grammar, then it's impossible for the grammar to generate that string.\n\nWait, is that true? Because all non-terminals must expand into terminals, but in this case, 't77' appears in the string, and it's not generated by any rule. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-696","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have each production rule either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That's helpful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, which is defined as NT48 NT11. So whatever the derivation is, it must start with NT48 and NT11. The given string starts with \"t68 t77 t26...\" which I notice includes several t's, which are likely terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production rule seems to split into two non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right. For example, S -> NT48 NT11. So S must derive into two parts, each of which can further split.\n\nThe provided string is quite long, so I'll try to parse it step by step, looking at the possible expansions from each non-terminal.\n\nLet me start by breaking the string into tokens: t68, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t31, t59, t28, t77, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t77, t47, t65, t31, t25, t10, t48, t26, t69, t26, t69, t73, t25, t5, t25, t42, t15, t25, t19, t25, t42, t15.\n\nNow, the start symbol S is NT48 and NT11. Let's see what NT48 and NT11 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 -> NT6 NT49 (from the given rules). So the first step would be S -> NT6 NT49 NT11.\n\nLooking at NT6, the rule is NT6 -> NT52 NT49. So now, the string after S would become NT52 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNext, NT52 has a rule NT52 -> NT14 NT32. So this part becomes NT14 NT32 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNow, NT14 -> NT7 NT35. So now we have NT7 NT35 NT32 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNT7's rule is NT7 -> NT12 NT43. So expanding that: NT12 NT43 NT35 NT32 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNT12 can become NT39 NT32. So NT39 NT32 NT43 NT35 NT32 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNT39 has two rules: one is NT40 NT11, the other is NT40 \u2192 't65' (a terminal). Oh wait, the rule is NT39 -> NT40 NT11. So we use that and expand.\n\nSo now, NT40 NT11 NT32 NT43 NT35 NT32 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNT40 has two rules: one is NT28 NT1, the other is 't69'. Looking at the string, one of the tokens is t69, so perhaps we use the terminal version of NT40.\n\nSo replacing NT40 with 't69', we get t69 NT11 NT32 NT43 NT35 NT32 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNow, NT11 can be NT41 NT49. So replacing that: t69 NT41 NT49 NT32 NT43 NT35 NT32 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNT41 is NT77. So t69 NT77 NT49 NT32 NT43 NT35 NT32 NT49 NT49 NT11.\n\nNow, looking at NT77, the rule is NT77 -> 't48' (since looking at the grammar, NT41 -> 't77', wait no, looking again: NT77 is not directly defined. Wait, I need to check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are a bit dense. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT48 -> t68. But NT48 is a non-terminal. No, NT48 is on the left, and the rule is something like NT48 -> NT6 NT49. Wait no, looking again:\n\nIn the given rules, NT48's expansion is in the later rules. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules. The user provided a long list. Let me look:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 is defined as NT6 NT49.\n\nNT6 is NT52 NT49.\n\nWait, I see NT48 -> NT6 NT49 (from earlier). Okay, that part is correct.\n\nBut in the list, after looking through, I don't see NT48 having a production that results in a terminal. All NT48's rules lead to other non-terminals. So the only way to get a terminal from NT48 is through those non-terminals eventually expanding to terminals.\n\nBut in the string, after the initial t68, the next is t77, etc. So perhaps I need to track where each non-terminal can expand into.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at each terminal in the string and see if they match any direct productions.\n\nLooking at the first token, it's t68. So where is 't68' defined as a production? Looking through the rules, I see NT48 -> 't68'? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules: I see \"NT48 -> t68\" here: Yes, looking at the beginning:\n\nWait, the user's grammar has, for example: NT33 -> 't73', NT44-> 't66', etc. So in the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nYes, so for instance, NT33 can go to 't73' or 't76', etc. So maybe I can track the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this as a parse tree, trying to match the string step by step.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, perhaps a better approach is to model the possible expansions.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t68. So we need a production whose expansion starts with t68.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT44 -> 't66'; NT48 doesn't have a terminal. Wait, no: wait, in the given rules, is there any NT that can produce 't68'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, for example, NT6 -> 't4', NT26 -> 't53', NT28 -> 't59', NT42-> 't55', NT37->'t32', etc. Wait, does any NT directly produce 't68'?\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at each production for non-terminals, I see NT48 -> 't68'? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n\"NT48 -> 't68'\"\n\nSo NT48 can produce t68.\n\nSimilarly, NT49 can produce t47, etc.\n\nSo, starting from S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nSo the first token is t68 (from NT48), which we can derive from S -> NT48 t68 followed by NT11.\n\nSo after S, we have NT48 (which is t68) and NT11.\n\nSo the string starts as t68 ... and the next part must come from NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11's rule: NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo now, we have t68, followed by NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at the string, after t68 comes t77, t26, t59, etc. So after t68 comes t77. So let's see what NT41 can produce.\n\nNT41's production is NT77. So NT41 expands to t77.\n\nSo now, the string would be t68 t77 followed by NT49 and others.\n\nSo expanding S as NT48 (t68) and NT11 (NT41 (t77), NT49).\n\nNow, looking at NT49. NT49's rule is NT16 NT7.\n\nSo we have t68 t77 followed by NT16 and NT7.\n\nLooking at the string, the next token is t26.

{"custom_id":"request-710","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or one terminal. That should make parsing a bit easier because each step in the derivation processes exactly two symbols or two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S. S directly produces NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the start symbols. Let me look at the string: the first two tokens are 't68' and 't77'. Are these corresponding to NT48 and NT11?\n\nI think I need to create a parse tree starting from S. So the first step would be S -> NT48 NT11. Now, for the string to be generated, the next step is to expand NT48 and NT11 into their respective components.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal has productions. Let me write down the productions for each NT:\n\n- NT48: Looking at the grammar, I see S -> NT48 NT11, but I don't see a production for NT48. Wait, did I miss something? Let me check again. Or maybe NT48 isn't a separate non-terminal but just an abbreviation. Hmm, perhaps NT48 is just a specific non-terminal, but in the grammar provided, it's only used in the production S -> NT48 NT11. Wait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nOh, wait, in the grammar, all the non-terminals seem to have productions, but perhaps NT48 and others are part of the initial productions. Let me check again. S -> NT48 NT11. Then looking for NT48, I see NT48 -> NT49 NT6. And NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So the next step would be to expand NT48 into NT49 NT6 and NT11 into NT41 NT49.\n\nSo after S -> NT48 NT11, the next step is NT48 => NT49 NT6 and NT11 => NT41 NT49. So the string so far is t68 t77 t49 t6 (from NT49) t41 t49 (from NT41 and NT49). Wait, but wait, the string is given as a sequence of tokens, so after the initial S, each expansion would split each non-terminal into their components, which may be other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to match the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nThe first token is t68. Looking for which non-terminals produce t68. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT48 -> t68 is not explicitly stated. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see under NT6: NT6 -> t4. Under NT44: NT44 -> NT29 NT1, and earlier under NT6, it's only a production into NT52 and NT49.

{"custom_id":"request-714","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember is a specific way of structuring CFGs where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's a set of rules. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. This means the start symbol S can be replaced by NT48 and NT11. Each of these NTs are non-terminals that can further expand. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t68 t77 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t84 t48 t65 t77 t26 t53 t65 t77 t81 t25 t5 t25 t76 t25 t10 t27 t15 t42 t65 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t31 t4`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how this grammar works. The top-down approach would involve starting from S and breaking down the string step by step according to the production rules. Alternatively, the bottom-up approach could be used, where we start from the string and try to reduce it to S by applying reverse productions. But since the string is quite long, the top-down approach might be more efficient.\n\nThe string starts with 't68 t77 t77 t26 t65...'. Looking at the production rules, I notice that 't68' is only present once, in the rule NT48 \u2192 't68'. So, the first symbol 't68' must come from NT48. That means after S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the first symbol comes from NT48.\n\nSo, let's deconstruct the first part:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 't68' and the next part comes from NT11. We saw in the rules that NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, the first two symbols after 't68' should come from NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at the string: t68 t77... That means after t68, the next symbols are t77, t77, t26, t65... So the first part is t68 followed by something that starts with t77, t77, etc.\n\nWait, but the first symbols after S \u2192 NT48 NT11 are NT48's replacements first, then NT11's. So after t68, we'll have the expansion of NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at NT41, the rule is NT41 \u2192 't77', so the next symbol after t68 would be t77. Then, the next symbol should come from NT49. NT49's rules are multiple: it can be 't16' or 't7', 't47', 't81' etc. But looking back, in the rules, NT49 has multiple productions, including 't47'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT49 has several rules: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, which would require more steps, but I think in the case of a given string, the shorter path is better.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the first terminal symbol must come from NT48, which \u2192 't68'. So the first symbol is t68.\n\n2. Next, the first part after NT48 is NT11. The string now is t68 followed by the rest. So, after t68, the next symbols should be the expansion of NT41 and NT49 (since NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49).\n\nLooking at the string, after t68 comes t77, t77, t26, etc. So the next two symbols should come from NT41 and NT49.\n\n3. NT41 \u2192 't77', so the next symbol is t77. So, after t68, first is t77.\n\n4. Now, the next symbol is t77. After t77, we have another t77, which should come from NT49.\n\n5. Looking at NT49's rules, one of them is 't47', so the next symbol could be t47. But the string after t68, t77 is t77, then t26. So perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe NT49 expands into something else.\n\nWait, let's look at all NT49 rules:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, NT31 NT32, NT40 NT1, NT49 \u2192 't16', 't7', 't47', 't81', etc. Wait, I need to check the grammar more carefully.\n\nIn the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT49 \u2192 NT31 NT32\nNT49 \u2192 NT40 NT1\nNT49 \u2192 't16 NT7' \u2192 Wait, wait, no. Looking at the grammar lines:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, I find:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT49 -> NT31 NT32\nNT49 -> NT40 NT1\nNT49 -> 't16'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT49 -> 't47'\nNT49 -> 't81'\n\nSo, NT49 can produce 't16', 't7', 't47', or 't81'. So, the third symbol after t68 should come from NT49's production.\n\nWait, let's get back.\n\nAfter t68 (from NT48), the next part is NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, after t68, the first symbol from NT41 is 't77', as per the rule NT41 \u2192 't77'.\n\nSo the sequence is t68, t77.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t77 again. Where does that come from? Because after NT11, we have NT41 (t77) and then NT49.\n\nSo, the next symbol, t77, must come from NT49. Looking at NT49's rules, can it produce t77? Let's check. Looking through the rules for NT49, I don't see any production that results in t77. So that would be a problem.\n\nWait, the given string is:\n\nt68 t77 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t84 t48 t65 t77 t26 t53 t65 t77 t81 t25 t5 t25 t76 t25 t10 t27 t15 t42 t65 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t31 t4.\n\nSo the second symbol after t68 is t77. But according to NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, the first part is t77 (from NT41), and the next symbol comes from NT49. But none of NT49's rules produce t77. So that would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me re-examine the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11\n\nNT48 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n\nNT41 \u2192 't77'\n\nSo S expands to t68 NT41 NT49. NT41 is t77, then NT49 must follow. But none of NT49's rules produce t77. So either the string is invalid, or perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the NT49 can produce more, like a chain. So after t68, we have t77, and then what? The third symbol is another t77.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT49 can produce t77 via other rules. But looking through the provided rules, I don't see any NT49 \u2192 't77'. The closest is NT53, NT59, NT47, etc., but nothing for NT49.\n\nSo perhaps the string is invalid because after t77, it expects another t77, but NT49 can't produce that.\n\nWait, but wait: perhaps the production for NT49 includes more steps, like combining with other symbols. Let me check NT49's rules again.\n\nNT49:\n-> NT11 NT6\n-> NT31 NT32\n-> NT40 NT1\n-> 't16'\n-> '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That's it, so NT48 directly produces t68.\n\nFor NT11: the rules don't directly say, but we have to see the productions. Wait, the given rules have NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Let me check:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 NT19 NT41 (doesn't seem helpful), but looking further, NT41 \u2192 t77. Wait, no, in the rules, I see NT41 \u2192 t77? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t77? Checking the rules provided, under NT41, there is a rule NT41 \u2192 t77. Yes, so NT41 produces t77 directly.\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t81 and t16 depending on other rules. Wait, looking for NT49, in the rules: NT49 \u2192 t16 NT7 and NT49 \u2192 t7 t26. So, NT49 can produce t16 followed by NT7 and so on, or t7 followed by t26, but in any case, in the string, after the initial t68, we have three t77s, then t26, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT48, which gives t68, then NT11.\n\nNow, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo NT41 \u2192 t77, and NT49 can be expanded. Let's see what NT49 produces.\n\nFrom the rules, NT49 \u2192 t16 NT7 and NT49 \u2192 t7 t26.\n\nSo, for the minimal expansion, perhaps NT49 \u2192 t7 t26.\n\nBut in the string, after NT48 (t68), we have three t77s. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. The string is t68 followed by three t77s, then t26, t59, etc.\n\nLet me think: S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 NT11.\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nNT41 \u2192 t77.\n\nNT49: let's see, maybe it can produce t26 nt something. Looking at NT49's rules: NT49 \u2192 t16 NT7 and NT49 \u2192 t7 t26.\n\nSo, NT49 can be either t16 NT7 or t7 t26.\n\nIf NT49 \u2192 t7 t26, then the production would be t7 t26. But in the string, after t68, we have three t77s. That's a problem because t77 is part of NT41 (t77) and not t7 t26.\n\nThis suggests that maybe the initial hypothesis is incorrect. Maybe NT49 produces something else, but wait, looking back, I'm pretty sure NT49's production is either t16 NT7 or t7 t26.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in how the NT48 and NT11 are processed. Alternatively, maybe the string is built in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built as follows:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 (from NT48) and then NT11.\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 \u2192 t77 (NT41) and then NT49.\n\nNT49 \u2192 t7 t26 (as per the rules: NT49 \u2192 t7 t26).\n\nSo, the second part after t68 is t77 t7 t26.\n\nBut in the string, after t68, the next tokens are t77 t77 t77 t26. That's three t77s followed by t26. That doesn't match my current analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps NT49 can produce multiple t77s somehow. But looking at the rules, I don't see NT49 producing more than two symbols. For example, NT49 \u2192 t7 t26, which is two symbols: t7 and t26. Or in another path, perhaps NT49 leads to t7, then when you look at NT26, which might be a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at NT26: do we have any rules for it? Let's check the rules provided. I see NT20 \u2192 t53, but not directly NT26. Wait, is there a rule like NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25, and NT25 \u2192 t58, etc.? Hmm, perhaps I should try to find a way to get a sequence of t77s.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 (from NT48) and NT11. Now, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, and NT41 can produce t77 and NT49 can produce, for example, t7 t26. So that would give t77 t7 t26. But in the string, after t68, there are three t77s.\n\nThis suggests that maybe NT49 can produce more t77s through some other pathway. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the NT44 rule. From earlier rules, NT44 has a production to t73, but I'm not sure that's relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that some of the NTs have productions that lead to more t77s. Let me look for whether any non-terminals produce t77.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 t73 and t30\n- NT37 \u2192 t73 and t35\n- NT39 \u2192 t77 and t11 (so NT39 can produce t77 t11)\n- NT27 \u2192 t73\n- NT7 \u2192 t25 and t36\n- NT16 \u2192 t26 and t14\n- NT47 \u2192 t48\n- NT9 \u2192 t25\n- NT41 \u2192 t77\n- NT49 \u2192 t81 and t16 t7?\n- NT26 \u2192 t4?\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me start by understanding both the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It starts with S -> NT48 NT11. So the entire string must be derivable from S. Let's break down the first few steps.\n\nThe initial production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So NT48 and NT11 must be expanded further. Looking at NT48 \u2192 't68'. Similarly, NT11 \u2192 't77'. So the first two symbols 't68 t77' match the production for NT48 and NT11. So far, so good.\n\nNext, NT48 is fully processed as 't68', and NT11 as 't77', so the next part is what's left of the string. The next part starts with 't26 t65 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t31 ...' and so on.\n\nNow, moving forward, after NT48 and NT11, the next NT would be T_31 because the next symbol after 't68' is 't26', which is in the production of NT31. Wait, NT31 is in the grammar. Let's check: NT31 \u2192 't26' and NT43. So when deriving, NT31 would produce 't26' followed by NT43. But wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT31 \u2192 't26' because earlier in the grammar there's a rule NT31 -> 't26' (from NT29 -> t5, but wait, actually let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT31 -> 't26' and NT43 -> 't15', and so on. So NT31 produces 't26' and NT43 produces 't15'. So the sequence after 't77' is 't26 t65 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t31 ...'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the entire string step by step, breaking it into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string:\n\nt68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t31 t4 t65 t77 t77 t26 t28 t4 t25 t84 t48 t76 t53 t3 t28 t77 t24 t58 t19 t15 t25 t19 t25 t42 t55.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 t77.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t26, which starts NT31. So the next part is NT31 \u2192 't26' and NT43. So 't26' followed by NT43, which is 't15'. So t26 t15.\n\nBut looking at the string, after 't77', the next symbols are t26, t65, t77, t77, t26, t65, t77, t31, etc. So maybe after handling the initial t68 t77, we look at t26 as part of NT31.\n\nWait, perhaps each step in the string must correspond exactly to the non-terminals and terminals in the grammar. Let me try to build the string step by step.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which is t68 t77, the remaining string starts with t26 t65 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t31 ... So let's process the remaining part starting from t26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26: NT26 is 't26' because there's a rule NT26 -> 't26'. But wait, in the grammar, the rules like NT26 are present. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, wait a second, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't26', but after that, NT11 \u2192 't77', but in the string, after 't77', next is t26, which would correspond to NT20 \u2192 't26', which has a production NT20 \u2192 't26' and another (NT20 is also used in NT14 \u2192 't42'? Or wait, no: looking carefully, in the grammar, NT20 is present and has production NT20 \u2192 't26'; but are there any other rules for NT20? Yes, another rule: NT20 \u2192 't53'? Or is it that NT20 has only 't26'? Wait, in the grammar, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't26' [line: NT20 -> 't26']\nNT20 \u2192 't53'? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't26'\nOther NTs with NT20? Wait, actually in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT20 -> 't26'\nIs there another rule for NT20? Or is NT20 only that?\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, I only see NT20 -> 't26' and no other rules. Wait, let me recheck:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT20: only 't26' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the provided list, I see:\n\n- NT40 has a production NT40 -> 't28' and another rule NT40 -> 't65'? Or no:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT40 has:\n\nNT40 -> 't65' [Yes, one production: NT40 -> 't65']\nAnother NT40 production: NT40 -> 't28'?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT20 -> 't26'\nNT20 also has NT20 -> 't53'? Wait no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, the rule NT20 is present only once, is it? Let me scan the grammar:\n\nNT20 -> 't26' (line: NT20 -> 't26')\nWait, no, I think I misread.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar has:\n\nNT20: \n\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT20 -> 't53'?\n\nWait, no, the grammar says:\n\nLooking at line numbers, for instance, line 7-15:\n\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\n...\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the grammar is long. Let me structure it.\n\nAfter the initial S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which becomes 't68 t77', the next part is 't26 t65 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t31 ...'\n\nSo, the next symbol is 't26', which must be derived from some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NTs produce 't26'? I think NT20 does.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT20's rules are:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT20 -> 't26' [line: NT20 -> 't26']\nYes, that's the only production for NT20. So NT20 must produce 't26'.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT48 NT11 \u2192 t68 t77, the next symbol must be 't26', which is from NT20.\n\nSo the string now is: t68 t77 t26 ...\n\nBut the next symbol is 't65', so after NT20, which is 't26', the next is 't65'.\n\nSo now, after 't26', we have 't65'. So the structure is t68 t77 t26 t65 ... \n\nLooking at the grammar, which NT produces 't65'? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT53 produces 't65'\u2014wait, no, actually, do I have anything:\n\nLooking again, the grammar has:\n\nLine: NT20 -> 't26'\n\nBut also, line: NT16 -> 't26'\nWait, no, that can't be.

Checking the string: it starts with t68, t77, etc. Wait, so what does NT48 and NT11 expand to?\n\nFrom the grammar, NT48 \u2192 t68, and NT11 \u2192 t31 or t37 (but in the given string, the second part is t77, which isn't matching directly. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check NT11: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. Then NT41 \u2192 t77, and NT49 \u2192 t81. So NT11 would expand to t77 t81. But in the string, after the initial t68 (which is NT48), the next part is t77... Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the parts.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the full expansion would be NT48 \u2192 t68, and NT11 \u2192 t77 t81. So the entire first part should be t68 t77 t81. But looking at the string, it's t68 t77 t26... That doesn't match, so maybe there's a mistake. Wait, the string given is:\n\nt68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t42 t65 t77 t26 t53 t25 t84 t27 t26 t28 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t28 t25 t84 t48 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t32 t25 t32 t55.\n\nWait, the initial part is t68 t77. That matches NT48 (t68) and NT11's first possibility, but NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, which are t77 and t81. So the initial expansion would be t68 t77 t81, but in the string, it's t68 t77, then t26. Hmm, that doesn't align. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the NT production for NT11. NT11: I see in the rules, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. NT41 is t77, and NT49 is t81. So the entire S would expand to t68 t77 t81. But the string starts with t68 t77, then t26. So that's conflicting. Maybe I need to see if there's a different way to parse the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't even starting correctly. Maybe it's using a different NT48 or NT11. Let me check the NT48 rule: NT48 \u2192 t68. So after that, whatever NT11 gives should come next. But in the string, after t68 t77, the next token is t26. Wait, perhaps the string is not generated by S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but something else. Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the starting symbols. The first token is t68, which is from NT48. So S must expand to something starting with t68. The next should be from NT11. But the second token is t77, which is from NT41, and the third is t26, which is from NT7. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nNT7 \u2192 t36 or t53, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe NT11 \u2192 something else. Wait, the initial grammar seems to have some inconsistencies. Let me list out all the NT rules to see the structure.\n\nFrom the start, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. NT48 \u2192 t68. So S starts with t68, followed by NT11's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT11: NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. NT41 \u2192 t77, and NT49 \u2192 t81. So S expands to t68 followed by t77 and t81. But the string has t68 t77 t26... So that doesn't match. Therefore, unless there's another production for NT11, which there isn't, the string can't start with t68 t77 t26 because the expected next tokens are t77 and t81, not t77 and t26.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is invalid because it starts incorrectly. Let me check the first three tokens: t68 t77 t26. According to the grammar, the first two should be t68 t77, then the next should be part of NT11's expansion, which is t81. But the string has t26 instead. So the string can't be generated correctly, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but could there be a different parse tree where the string is generated? Maybe if the NT11 is expanded differently, but looking at the NT rules, NT11 only expands to NT41 NT49. No alternative productions here. So the initial three tokens are t68 t77 t26, which don't fit.

{"custom_id":"request-756","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, and it should have a unique parse tree for any string it generates.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t31 t7 t77 t81 t25 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t4 t65 t77 t77 t77 t47 t49 t4 t25 t19 t25 t42 t55 t49 t25 t32 t55`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal. Therefore, any string generated by this grammar must have a length that is either 1 (for a terminal) or of the form 2^n, where n is the number of steps in the derivation. Let me first check the length of the given string.\n\nCounting the number of tokens in the string: let's see: 33 tokens. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2^n must be a string of length 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. So 33 is not a power of 2. Hmm, that might indicate a problem. But wait, sometimes the initial step can be of the form S \u2192 NT11, which is two non-terminals. So each step would double the number of symbols. Let's check the initial rule: S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So each symbol is a non-terminal. Then each production rule for a non-terminal can split into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't68', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, 't68' is produced by the non-terminal NT48. Specifically, there's a rule NT48 \u2192 t68. Similarly, 't77' might be produced by NT49, as I see NT49 \u2192 t47 and others, but I need to check all the rules.\n\nWait, also, the initial rule S \u2192 NT48 NT11 means that S generates two non-terminals, so the first symbol must be a terminal that NT48 can produce, which is 't68'. So the first symbol is 't68', which comes from NT48. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the string's length. It's 33 tokens. Let's see the derivation steps. Starting with S, which is two non-terminals. Each production step can potentially double the number of non-terminals, but terminals don't contribute to the number. So the length of the generated string depends on the number of terminals produced. However, since each step in the derivation can produce terminals or non-terminals, it's possible that the string's length is not a power of 2 because the derivation can involve a mix of terminal and non-terminal productions.\n\nWait, no, in the case of context-free grammars in CNF, the number of symbols (terminals and non-terminals) after each production step doubles because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. So the total number of symbols should be 2^n, where n is the number of derivations. But in this case, the string has 33 symbols, which isn't a power of 2. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, so 33 isn't possible. This suggests that the string might not be in the language, but I need to be careful because the derivation could have some terminals that contribute to the length without necessarily reaching a full power of 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count isn't the main issue here. Let me proceed step by step, trying to parse the given string through the grammar to see if each symbol can be derived correctly.\n\nLet me look at the first symbol: 't68'. According to the grammar, NT48 \u2192 t68. So that's good.\n\nNext symbol: 't77'. Looking into the grammar, 't77' is produced by NT19. Let me check if NT19 can be derived from the rules. Wait, in the grammar, NT19 \u2192 NT41 NT6. So I need to check if NT41 and NT6 can derive 't77' and 't4', respectively. NT6 \u2192 t4. OK, that matches. NT41 \u2192 t77. So yes, that would work.\n\nSo far: 't68' and 't77' are correct, leading to the pair (NT48, NT19) from S, which is correct because S \u2192 NT48 NT11, but wait, in this case, it's NT48 producing 't68' and NT11. So perhaps I'm mixing up the steps. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this by building the parse tree starting from S.\n\nS starts by producing NT48 and NT11. So NT48 is 't68' as per the rules. NT11 can produce 't77' or other non-terminals. Wait, looking at the rules, NT11 has production NT41 NT49. So NT11 can be NT41 and NT49. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think recursively. Let me try to parse the string step by step, ensuring that each part can be matched by the grammar.\n\nSo the string starts with 't68'. So that must come from NT48 \u2192 t68, which is correct.\n\nNext symbol: 't77'. The grammar has 't77' produced by NT19. So 't77' must come from NT19. Then NT19 \u2192 NT41 NT6. So we need to check if NT41 can produce a terminal and NT6 can produce 't4'. But looking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 t4. So that works. NT41 \u2192 NT25 NT19. Wait, but 't77' is a terminal, so if we're getting 't77', that must come directly from NT19 \u2192 t77. So maybe I should look for the rule NT19 \u2192 t77. Wait, let me check the rules: do I see NT19 \u2192 t77?\n\nLooking back at the rules: yes, there is a production NT19 \u2192 t28. That's not 't77'. Hmm, so perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, looking again:\n\nThe rules for NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT41 NT6 (which would be two non-terminals). But wait, is there a terminal 't77' produced by any other non-terminal? Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let me check the rules for NT19:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT19 \u2192 t77. Instead, NT19 \u2192 NT41 NT6. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Then how does 't77' get produced?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper. Let's see: the given string's second token is 't77'. So which non-terminal produces 't77'? Looking through the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 't26', NT25 \u2192 t58, etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through all NT productions for terminals:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76', 't30'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't65', 't28'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't55', 't25'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't7', 't58', 't25', 't49'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT59 \u2192 't18', 't1'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't73'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't76'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't73'\n\nWait, so looking for 't77', do any NT produce that? Hmm. Checking all NT rules, I don't see any that produce 't77'. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the NTs. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, checking each NT in the list:\n\nLooking at NT1 to NT78, perhaps I missed 't77' production. Let me scan through all the NT rules to see if any produce 't77'.\n\nNT33: yes, 't76' and 't30'\n\nNT37: 't32"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-774","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It seems like the grammar is quite large, with multiple production rules involving non-terminal symbols (like S, NT44, MT58, etc.) that eventually derive into terminal symbols (like t68, t77, etc.). Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t77 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t36 t65 t77 t26 t65 t77 t47 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t69 t48 t72 t58 t5 t53 t69 t73 t15 t25 t10 t27 t15 t25 t22 t27 t55 t4 t49`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Each production rule is either a binary split or a terminal, so the string must be a leftmost derivation, where each step replaces a single non-terminal with two others, eventually leading to all terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string step by step, looking for possible non-terminals that can produce the current part of the string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to find a path from S down to this sequence through the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t68. Let me check the grammar for any rule that produces t68. From the given rules, NT48 \u2192 t68. So, the first part must come from NT48. So, in the derivation, we need to have NT48 \u2192 t68.\n\nNext, considering the initial production S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, S can expand to NT48 and NT11. Since the string starts with t68, that's compatible because S can produce NT48, which then produces t68. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNow, after t68, the next tokens are t77, t77, t77, t26, etc. Let's see what comes after NT48, which is NT11. So, we have to see how NT11 can derive the remaining string.\n\nLooking at NT11's productions. From the rules, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So, NT11 can split into NT41 and NT49. Now, let's see how these can produce the next part of the string.\n\nThe current string after t68 is followed by t77, t77, t77, t26, t59, t28, etc. The next symbol is t77. Let's see if either NT41 or NT49 can produce t77.\n\nLooking at NT41: It has a production NT41 \u2192 t77. So, that's a terminal, so NT41 can directly produce t77.\n\nSo, after the first t68, we have NT41 which gives t77. So far, we have t68, t77.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t77. Let's go deeper into the NT41 expansion. The NT41 rule is a terminal, so that's a leaf. Now, moving past that, the next part is t77, which is the third symbol. But in this step, we're dealing with NT41, and after it, there's another NT49 (since NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49). So, after NT41 gives t77, we have to have NT49 handle the remaining symbols.\n\nSo now, the remaining string to derive is t77, t77, t77, t26, etc. Wait, no, the initial split was S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which generates t68 followed by whatever NT11 produces. Since NT11 splits into NT41 and NT49, and NT41 produces t77, then NT49 needs to produce the rest.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think again.\n\nBreaking it down: S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 \u2192 t68, so that's the first symbol.\n\nThen, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo after t68, the string starts with t77, which is the next symbol. So, NT41 \u2192 t77, which is correct.\n\nThen, the next symbol is the third t77, which comes from where? Because after NT41, we have to process NT49. So, after producing t77 from NT41, we then have to handle NT49.\n\nWait, this might not be the right approach. Maybe I should represent the string as a list and process it step by step.\n\nLet me try structuring the string as a list:\n\nInitial string: [t68, t77, t77, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t77, t26, t36, t65, t77, t26, t65, t77, t47, t59, t28, t77, t77, t26, t69, t48, t72, t58, t5, t53, t69, t73, t15, t25, t10, t27, t15, t25, t22, t27, t55, t4, t49]\n\nI need to generate this string from the grammar. Let me attempt to split the string into parts corresponding to the productions.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the first part is t68 (from NT48), then we have to process NT11, which is NT41 NT49.\n\nSo, after t68, the next symbols must be produced by NT41 and NT49 in some order.\n\nLooking at NT41: It can be a terminal t77, so the second symbol is t77, which matches. So, we've consumed the first two symbols: t68, t77.\n\nNow, the remaining string starts with t77, t77, t77, t26, etc. So, after NT41, which gave t77, we have to process NT49. So, NT49 must produce the remaining symbols starting from the third t77.\n\nLooking at NT49's productions: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 or NT11 NT6. Wait, let me check the rules again. From the given data, NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, in the productions:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 is one of the rules. So, NT49 can expand into NT11 and NT6, which are both non-terminals. So, after the first t68 and t77 (from NT41), NT49 will split into NT11 and NT6.\n\nSo, after NT41 \u2192 t77, we now have NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So, we need to process NT11 and NT6.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t4 or other options. Looking at the rules: NT6 \u2192 t4, so it can be a terminal.\n\nSo, for the third symbol, which is t77, but according to the grammar, NT11 is involved because NT49 splits into NT11 and NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me try again.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT48 NT11, we have:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t68\n\n- Then, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n\nSo, the string becomes t68, then NT41 and NT49.\n\nNT41 \u2192 t77, so the next symbol is t77.\n\nSo, we have t68, t77.\n\nThen, NT49 needs to produce the remaining symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-768","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the given string to see if I can break it down into parts that match the grammar's rules. The string is:\n\nt68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t65 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t47 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15 t4 t25 t32 t55 t25 t19 t25 t42 t15.\n\nI'll start by examining the initial part of the string to see if it matches the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t68. In the grammar, NT48 is a non-terminal. Checking the productions for NT48, I see NT48 -> t68. So the first part can be replaced with t68. \n\nNext, the first production is S -> NT48 NT11, which becomes t68 followed by NT11. So the string so far is t68 (remaining symbols: t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t65 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t47 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15 t4 t25 t32 t55 t25 t19 t25 t42 t15).\n\nNow, I need to see what NT11 can be broken down into. Looking at the grammar, NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So the next part is t77, which should correspond to NT41. Checking the productions for NT41: NT41 -> t77. So that's correct.\n\nSo far, we have t68 t77. The remaining string is t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t65 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t47 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15 t4 t25 t32 t55 t25 t19 t25 t42 t15.\n\nNext, NT49 comes after NT41, so NT49 should produce t6. Checking the grammar, NT49 -> t6. That matches the next symbol, t6. So now we have t68 t77 t6. Remaining string: t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t65 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t26 t65 t77 t47 t59 t28 t77 t77 t81 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15 t4 t25 t32 t55 t25 t19 t25 t42 t15.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. The production for NT49 is NT49 -> NT6. Wait, I think I might have mixed up NT49's production. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, under NT49, there's a production: NT49 -> NT11 NT6. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nWait, here's the relevant part:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nSo, wait, that's not correct because in the earlier step, NT11 was supposed to be the next non-terminal, but here NT49 is after NT41, which is NT41 -> t77, and then NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure this properly.\n\nAfter the initial S -> NT48 NT11, which becomes t68 NT11. Then, NT11 -> NT41 NT49. So we have t68 followed by NT41 and NT49.\n\nNT41 -> t77, so the next symbol is indeed t77. Then, NT49 is next. But NT49 is a non-terminal, so it needs to be replaced.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT49: NT49 can be replaced by NT11 NT6, or alternatively, looking at the provided list, there's an entry NT49 -> 't81'? Wait, no, I think I'm misreading. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I might have misread NT49. Let me search the grammar productions for NT49.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, here's what I find:\n\n- NT49: \n  - NT49 -> NT11 NT6\n  - Also, there's NT49 -> t81? No, wait, in the list, I see NT33 -> 't73', NT53, etc. Let me check all NT49 productions.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through all the NT49 productions in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\n- NT49 -> t81? No, I don't see that. Wait, the list starts with grammar rules for each non-terminal. Let me find NT49's rules.\n\nIn the provided grammar, under NT49:\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, is that the only production for NT49? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, under NT49:\n\nThe rule is: NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nSo, it seems that NT49 can only be replaced by NT11 and NT6. So the production for NT49 is NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, but in some cases, non-terminals like NT49 can have other productions. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT33 has two rules: one is NT33 -> 't73', the other is NT33 -> 't30'. Similarly, other NTs have multiple rules.\n\nI need to go through all NT49 rules. Wait, in the list above, I see NT49 entries:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of rules.

{"custom_id":"request-786","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is pretty long, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It seems like each production rule starts with a non-terminal and is split into two non-terminals except for the terminals. I'll start by identifying which parts of the string can be parsed using the grammar.\n\nThe initial production is S -> NT48 NT11. So the entire string must start with NT48 producing 't68' and NT11 producing 't77'. Wait, no, actually, the string starts with 't68', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT48 -> 't68', so that's good.\n\nNext, let's look at the rest of the string. After 't68 t77', it's 't26 t69 t48 t59...'. Let's see how that can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26 is involved. Wait, let me check. The rule NT26: I don't see a direct rule for NT26, but maybe I can derive it. Wait, another approach: perhaps the string can be factorized into non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t4 t65 t31 t25 t5 t25 t42 t25 t32 t69 t48 t59 t28 t77 t77 t31 t55 t47 t65 t77 t47 t25 t22 t48 t37 t25 t32 t25 t10 t3 t73 t55.\n\nI'll split it into parts based on the grammar rules.\n\nStart with S -> NT48 NT11. So the string starts with 't68' (NT48) and then 't77' (NT11). So far, so good.\n\nNow, moving forward from 't68 t77', the next parts of the string should correspond to the rules for NT48's production and NT11's production.\n\nWait, I might be getting tangled. Maybe a better approach is to recursively parse the string using the grammar rules. Let's try that.\n\nThe string starts with 't68', which is NT48. So S's first part is done. Now, the next part should be the production from NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11's production: NT11 can produce NT41 NT49 or NT28 NT31.\n\nThe next parts of the string after 't77' are 't26 t69 t48 t59...'\n\nSo let's consider if NT11 can produce the next tokens.\n\nLooking at the string after 't77': 't26 t69 t48 t59...'\n\nSo, for NT11, possible productions are:\n\n1. NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49: Then, the next part should be 't77 t77' (since NT41->t77 and NT49->t81?)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, NT41 \u2192 't77', and NT49 \u2192 't81'. So NT41 produces 't77', and NT49 produces 't81'.\n\nBut in the string, after 't77 t77' comes 't26 t69...'.\n\nWait, perhaps the next step is NT11 \u2192 NT28 NT31.\n\nLooking at production rules: NT11 \u2192 NT28 NT31. So, is there a way for 't26' to be part of NT28 or NT31?\n\nWait, but 't26' is a terminal, and in the grammar, NT26 is a non-terminal. Wait, looking back, the initial statement: the string is 't68 t77 t26 t69...'. So after NT11 (which is 't77'), the next is 't26 t69...'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to check if 't26' is part of NT28 or NT31. Let's see: looking for rules that produce 't26'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't26' is produced by NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT28 nt35, but that's not terminal. Hmm, wait, looking for terminals. The terminals are things like 't26', 't25', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, I see some terminals directly:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals map to terminals:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT19 \u2192 't28'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT28 \u2192 't59'\n- NT14 \u2192 't42'\n- NT43 \u2192 't55'\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n- NT9 \u2192 't25' (Wait, no, NT9 \u2192 't25')\nWait, maybe I can reconstruct the entire string in terms of the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check whether each part of the string can be parsed step by step according to the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't68'\n- NT11 \u2192 Need to produce 't77 next? Or perhaps it's part of a larger structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is t68 t77 t26 t69 t48 t59...\n\nSo, after 't68 t77', the next part is 't26 t69...'.\n\nSo, the S production is NT48 NT11, which gives us the initial 't68 t77'. Now, to process the remaining tokens, we need to see how NT11 can be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT11, the possible productions are:\n\n1. NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49 \u2192 't77 t81'\n2. NT11 \u2192 NT28 NT31 \u2192 't59? Wait, no: 't28' is the terminal for NT28 or NT19?\n\nWait, according to the grammar:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't59'\n\nBut in the string, after 't77', the next is 't26', which is a terminal. That doesn't match any of the NT28 or NT19's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure. Maybe I need to parse the entire string from S down, using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down parsing approach.\n\nAnother approach: check if the entire string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe it's better to try to build a parse tree.\n\nLet me try parsing token by token.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT48 NT11.\n\n- Token 1: 't68' (NT48)\n- Token 2: 't77' (NT11)\n\nSo, after parsing S, we're left with tokens: t26 t69 t48 t59...\n\n2. Now, process NT11. The next token is 't26'.\n\nSo, what can NT11 produce? Let's check its rules:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\nNT11 \u2192 NT28 NT31\n\nLooking at 't26', which terminals are produced:\n\nLooking through the grammar, terminals are:\n\nt68, t77, t26, t69, t48, t59, t28, t77, t31, t4, t65, t31, t25, t5, t25, t42, t25, t32, t69, t48, t59, t28, t77, t31, t55, t47, t65, t77, t47, t25, t22, t48, t37, t25, t32, t25, t10, t3, t73, t55.\n\nFrom those, 't26' is NT20's production.\n\nWait, but in NT11's productions, there's no 't26' directly. So perhaps that indicates a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps NT11 can't produce 't26' directly. Let's see.\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT28 NT31. Now, NT28 \u2192 't59', and NT31 \u2192 't31' or other.\n\nWait, so:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT28 NT31.

{"custom_id":"request-788","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies some parsing aspects. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. Each non-terminal (like S, NT44, etc.) produces two non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals are the 't' followed by a number and some letters and numbers, but from the rules, it seems most terminals are actually single 't' followed by numbers or letters. Wait, actually, looking closer, some of the terminals are 't' followed by two digits, like 't76', 't30', etc. But other terminals are 't' followed by a single digit or a letter. Hmm, no, looking again, some rules like NT33 -> 't76' and NT33 -> 't30' suggest that the terminals are 't' followed by two digits. For example, t76, t30, etc.\n\nBut wait, the string we have is: `t68 t77 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t48 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t31 t7 t31 t49 t49 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t5 t25 t42 t25 t10 t3 t55 t55 t31 t25 t47`.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers. Now, I think each of these terminals correspond to some production rules. The idea is that the grammar can generate these terminals, and we need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, and S -> NT48 NT11. So S must expand into two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. Let's see what NT48 and NT11 are in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT48 -> 't68' (from the rule NT48 -> t68)\n\nBTW, checking the grammar:\n\nIndeed, NT48 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't68' as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT11: according to the grammar, NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nSo S -> NT48 NT11 becomes 't68' followed by NT41 and NT49. So the string starts with t68, followed by whatever NT41 and NT49 produce. \n\nWait, the string starts with t68, t77, t77, etc. So after t68, the next part is t77, t77, etc. So we need to see if the production of NT41 and NT49 leads to that sequence.\n\nLet's focus on NT11 first: it produces NT41 and NT49. So the next part of the string after t68 should be the result of NT41 and NT49.\n\nLooking at NT41 in the grammar: NT41 -> 't77'\n\nYes, NT41 directly produces 't77'. So the first few tokens after t68 should be 't77'.\n\nNow, the string after t68 is t77 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 ... So, after t68 comes t77, then another t77. So that aligns with NT41 producing t77 and NT49 producing something that starts with t77. Because NT41 is followed by NT49.\n\nWait, but NT49 is NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nSo NT49 -> NT11 (which we already have rules for) and NT6.\n\nNT6 -> 't4' directly.\n\nSo, after NT49, we have 't4'.\n\nWait, but in the string, after the two t77s, the next is t26. So let's reconstruct:\n\nS -> t68 NT41 NT49 -> t68 NT41 (NT11 NT6)\n\nNT41 is 't77', so now the string is t68 t77.\n\nThen, NT49 is NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The string is a series of tokens, each being a terminal. Let's try to parse the string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt68, t77, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t31, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t10, t48, t59, t28, t77, t77, t77, t31, t7, t31, t49, t49, t59, t28, t77, t77, t47, t25, t5, t25, t42, t25, t10, t3, t55, t55, t31, t25, t47.\n\nWait, but S is NT48 NT11, which gives t68 followed by NT44 NT41?\n\nNo, wait, S -> NT48 NT11. NT48 is t68, NT11 is NT41 NT49.\n\nSo the entire string starts with t68, then NT41 and NT49.\n\nSo S expands to t68 NT41 NT49.\n\nSo the string starts as t68, then whatever NT41 produces, then NT49.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t68, the next is t77, which matches NT41.\n\nSo from S -> t68 NT41 NT49, we have t68, then NT41= t77, then NT49.\n\nSo the string after t68 and t77 (now, t68, t77) should continue with what NT49 produces.\n\nWhat's NT49's production? It's NT11 NT6.\n\nNT49 -> NT41 (which is t77) and NT6 -> t4.\n\nSo NT49 would produce t77 t4.\n\nWait, but in the string after t68, t77, comes another t77. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the string token by token.\n\nLet me write the string as a list:\n\n1. t68\n2. t77\n3. t77\n4. t26\n5. t59\n6. t28\n7. t77\n8. t31\n9. t59\n10. t28\n11. t77\n12. t31\n13. t25\n14. t10\n15. t48 (Wait, no, S is generating t68, then NT41 and NT49. So after t68, the next token is t77 (from NT41). So the next should be NT49. But in the string, after t77, we have t77 again. That seems off.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not parsing correctly. Let me think again.\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT48 -> t68\n\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nSo overall, S-> t68 NT41 NT49\n\nSo the first token is t68, then NT41, then NT49.\n\nNT41 -> t77, so the second token is t77. Then NT49, which is NT41 and NT6.\n\nSo NT49 -> t77 t4.\n\nSo after t77, the next tokens should be t77 and t4.\n\nBut the string after t68 is t77, t77, t26, etc. So perhaps after t77 (from NT41), the NT49 produces t77 t4.\n\nBut the string has t77, t77, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT49 can expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider the string as a list of terminals and see if each can be matched through the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t68, which is NT48, so that part is easy.\n\nThen, we have t77, which could be NT41.\n\nAfter that, we have another t77. Let's see what's after that.\n\nWait, perhaps the production of NT49 is a bit more involved.\n\nWait, let's look at the full string and try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe string is: t68, t77, t7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-804","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is a sequence of tokens that look like they might be derived from the grammar's rules.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form productions have two symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have two non-terminals. Each production is of the form A -> BC. So, every step in the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two others.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of tokens starting with 't68' and ending with 't81'. I notice that each token in the string must correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions, possibly repeated multiple times.\n\nI should check if each token is a terminal or a non-terminal. Terminals are any sequence of letters and numbers that aren't on the left side of the productions. For example, in the grammar, NTs (like S, NT44, etc.) are non-terminals, while 't68', 't26', etc., are terminals.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see some entries like NT33 -> 't76' and NT33 -> 't30', which means NT33 can be replaced by either 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, NT35 can become 't3' or 't27', and so on.\n\nThe process will involve starting from the start symbol S and seeing if we can derive the string through a series of replacements. Since the string is quite long, it might help to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me outline the approach: parse the string from left to right, using a parse table or recursive descent. Starting with S, which can produce NT48 and NT11. So, the first two symbols in the string must be t68 and t77 because in the grammar, S -> NT48 NT11, and NT48 -> t68, NT11 -> t77.\n\nSo, the first two tokens are 't68' and 't77', which matches the start. Next, the third symbol should be the third production from NT48 or the second from NT11? Wait, after S produces NT48 and NT11, each of those can be terminals or non-terminals. If NT48 is a terminal, then the next token is 't68', and if NT11 is a terminal, the next token is 't77'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 is a terminal 't68', and NT11 is 't77'. So the first three tokens must be 't68', 't77', then the production ends, right? Wait, no, because each production is applied to the current non-terminal. So S produces NT48 and NT11. NT48 is 't68', NT11 is 't77', so the first three tokens of the string are t68, t77, and then possibly another symbol? Or does the derivation stop there?\n\nWait, no, because in a typical derivation, each non-terminal can produce two symbols, which could be either terminals or non-terminals. So after S -> NT48 NT11, each of NT48 and NT11 can be expanded further as needed.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT48 is a terminal 't68', so it can't be expanded further. Similarly, NT11 is a terminal 't77'. So the initial production S -> NT48 NT11 would produce t68 t77. However, the string we have is much longer, so that must mean that the derivation proceeded beyond S. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, S is split into NT48 and NT11, each of which is a terminal. So the only way to get more tokens is if one of these is a non-terminal, but looking at the grammar, they're both terminals. So S can only produce t68 t77. But the string has way more tokens. That suggests that maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The production S -> NT48 NT11 is present, but looking further, I notice NT48 is defined as 't68', which is a terminal. So S can only be t68 followed by t77. So the string can't have more than two tokens if it starts with S. But the given string has over 20 tokens. That indicates that perhaps I misunderstood the structure.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the string provided is much longer than 2 tokens. So maybe the grammar isn't S -> NT48 NT11 but perhaps there's a longer chain? Or maybe the initial production isn't directly nt48 and 11.\n\nWait, no, the grammar starts with S -> NT48 NT11, so S expands into two symbols, which are terminals in this case. Therefore, the string can't be longer than two if starting from S. This suggests that either the given string is incorrect, or my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is more complex, and the S's expansion might involve more steps. Let me check other productions. For instance, NT12 has a production to NT31 and NT58. Let's see if any of these are non-terminals and can be further expanded. But looking at the list, NT12 -> NT31 NT58, both of which are NTs.\n\nWait, for example, NT31 can produce NT20 and 8, but in the grammar, NT31 is 't20' -> 't20' and 't8' is 't8'. Wait, but in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT58\n\nAnd in the right-hand sides of NT31, there's a production: NT31 -> NT20 NT8. So if NT31 is a non-terminal, it can be expanded into NT20 and NT8, which are then terminals.\n\nBut then, if the string starts with S -> NT48 NT11, which are both terminals, and the string is longer, perhaps the initial steps involve other NTs, but S doesn't seem to split those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing is not leftmost, but that seems unlikely. I'm getting confused. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nThe string is: [t68, t77, t26, t53, t69, t69, t48, t69, t48, t59, t28, t77, t77, t77, t26, t28, t55, t81, t49, t49, t65, t31, t25, t19, t25, t42, t25, t19, t25, t42, t53, t69, t30, t25, t32, t76, t55]\n\nSo 28 tokens in total.\n\nSince S is the start symbol, which directly expands to NT48 and NT11, which are 't68' and 't77'. These are the first two tokens. So the first two elements must be t68 t77. Let's check the string: first two are t68 t77, correct so far.\n\nBut then the third token is t26. So after S, we get t68 t77, and then t26. How do we get t26? Unless one of the NTs can produce t26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NTs can produce t26? Let's see.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT7 -> 't26'\n- NT20 -> 't20' and also 't26' under NT20's production: NT20 -> 't20' and 't26'\n- NT49 -> 't49' and also some NT that eventually leads to 't26'\n\nWait, looking for where 't26' appears:\n\n- NT7 -> 't26'\n- NT20 (multiple times): e.g., NT20 -> 't26' (appears multiple times)\n- NT53 -> 't53' and also 't26' in NT53's productions?

{"custom_id":"request-802","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I\u2019ve got this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Here, S is the start symbol, and all other non-terminals (NT) are defined in terms of other non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, which are the actual symbols in the language.\n\nLooking at the string: t68, t77, t31, t76, t65, t77, t26, t69, t48, t65, t77, t31, t4, t59, t28, t77, t77, t26, t28, t25, t5, t25, t76, t25, t32, t69, t3, t76, t55, t25, t5, t25, t42, t26, t26, t69, t69, t48, t72, t58, t5, t73, t55.\n\nI notice that the grammar uses a mix of non-terminals and terminals where terminals are the specific 't' values like t68, t77, etc. So each production either breaks down into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI should check if the string can be parsed step by step by breaking it down according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step must produce two symbols: either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal in some combination, but actually, in CNF, it's A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait no, in CNF, the productions have two parts on the right, each being a non-terminal or a terminal. So each production of a non-terminal A will produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11 means that S can be replaced by NT48 and NT11, each of which can then be replaced if they are non-terminals.\n\nSo the approach is to parse the string from left to right, breaking down each part into non-terminals step by step until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by writing down the string as a list:\n['t68', 't77', 't31', 't76', 't65', 't77', 't26', 't69', 't48', 't65', 't77', 't31', 't4', 't59', 't28', 't77', 't77', 't26', 't28', 't25', 't5', 't25', 't76', 't25', 't32', 't69', 't3', 't76', 't55', 't25', 't5', 't25', 't42', 't26', 't26', 't69', 't69', 't48', 't72', 't58', 't5', 't73', 't55']\n\nNow, I'll process this string, looking for pairs that match the right-hand sides of the grammar productions.\n\nStarting with 't68'. I look at the grammar to see which productions result in 't68'. Scanning through, I see NT48 \u2192 't68' (from NT48: S \u2192 NT48 NT11, and other productions like NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, etc., but looking for where 't68' is a terminal). Checking all production rules to see if any non-terminal expands to 't68'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT48 -> 't68' (from the given grammar). So yes, NT48 can produce 't68'. So the first symbol 't68' must come from NT48.\n\nSo now, the string is processed as 't68', which breaks down to NT48. Now, the next part must be the other part of the production of S. S \u2192 NT48 NT11, so NT11 must be the next component.\n\nNext, the string after 't68' is 't77', 't31', etc. So looking at NT11, I check which productions produce NT11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49. So NT11 is replaced by NT41 and NT49. So now, the current part is 't77', but the production for NT11 is two non-terminals, so my current part is 't77', and then I have to break it down into NT41 and NT49.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When processing S \u2192 NT48 NT11, the entire string is 't68 t77 ...'. So after 't68', the production is 't77', which must come from NT11, which is NT41 NT49. So 't77' is the first terminal after NT48, which is 't68', and the next part is NT11, which is NT41 and NT49.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string as a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, trying to match each production's right-hand side.\n\nLet me list all the productions for clarity:\n\n- S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n- NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13\n- NT12 \u2192 NT31 NT58\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n- NT58 \u2192 NT31 NT33\n- NT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1\n- NT32 \u2192 NT39 NT57\n- NT45 \u2192 NT29 NT1\n- NT34 \u2192 NT9 NT14\n- NT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11\n- NT35 \u2192 NT47 NT44\n- NT1 \u2192 NT19 NT41\n- NT31 \u2192 NT20 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43\n- NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35\n- NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49\n- NT52 \u2192 NT14 NT32\n- NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57\n- NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT35\n- NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32\n- NT55 \u2192 NT21 NT59\n- NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT25\n- NT37 \u2192 NT13 NT34\n- NT21 \u2192 NT33 NT45\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1\n- NT49 \u2192 NT16 NT7\n- NT31 \u2192 NT8 NT35\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n- NT40 \u2192 't65'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't25'\n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT20 \u2192 't53'\n- NT52 \u2192 't7'\n- NT25 \u2192 't58'\n- NT59 \u2192 't24'\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'\n- NT8 \u2192 't69'\n- NT16 \u2192 't26'\n- NT47 \u2192 't48'\n- NT13 \u2192 't5'\n- NT52 \u2192 't37'\n- NT55 \u2192 't72'\n- NT43 \u2192 't15'\n- NT44 \u2192 't73'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT59 \u2192 't12'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n- NT13 \u2192 't19'\n- NT52 \u2192 't10'\n- NT37 \u2192 't32'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT11 \u2192 't31'\n- NT30 \u2192 't84'\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't22'\n- NT19 \u2192 't28'\n- NT30 \u2192 't10'\n- NT7 \u2192 't53'\n- NT12 \u2192 't37'\n- NT52 \u2192 't55'\n- NT18 \u2192 't69'\n- NT52 \u2192 't25'\n- NT33 \u2192 't73' or 't30'\n\nWait, some non-terminals have been"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-825","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and based on the grammar, certain of these tokens are terminal symbols while others are non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Each production has two non-terminals on the left side, except for the ones where the right side has a non-terminal and a terminal. Each non-terminal production splits into two non-terminals recursively. This structure means that any derivation using this grammar will produce strings of length 2^n for some n, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the string, I see it's quite long\u201439 tokens. Let me check if this length makes sense. The start symbol S is NT48 NT11. Each production is binary, so the length of the string built from S would be 2^1 * 2 = 2^2 when expanded once. Each subsequent expansion doubles the length. So, starting from 2 tokens, each step doubles it:\n\n- Step 0: 2 tokens\n- Step 1: 4 tokens\n- Step 2: 8 tokens\n- Step 3: 16 tokens\n- Step 4: 32 tokens\n- Step 5: 64 tokens\n\nWait, 32 tokens are 2^5, but the string has 39 tokens, which doesn't fit neatly into powers of two. That might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the grammar can have longer derivations, but more likely, such a string won't be generated because the lengths don't match.\n\nBut let me not jump to conclusions yet. Maybe the string is formed through a specific combination of productions that add more than two terminals at some point. However, each non-terminal in the grammar expands according to a fixed set of productions. So unless a non-terminal has a production that introduces a terminal directly to an even length, it's tricky.\n\nWait, the start symbol is NT48 and NT11. Let me check their productions:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT48 -> NT49 NT6\nNT11 -> NT41 NT49\n\nSo, let's see the possible expansions. Each of these non-terminals will further split. Let's take NT48:\nNT48 -> NT49 NT6\nThen, NT49 -> NT11 NT6, so substituting that in:\nNT48 -> (NT49 NT6) NT11 \u2192 (NT49 NT6) (NT11)\n\nBut both NT49 and NT11 can further split, which can lead to more tokens, but each production introduces two non-terminals. So, after each expansion, the number of tokens increases, but the base cases (terminals) replace those non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols, some are multi-digit numbers, like t76, t30, etc. The grammar replaces some non-terminals with a single terminal, but each step of the expansion (when a non-terminal is split) produces two non-terminals, which eventually become terminals.\n\nThe key here is that the string can only be generated if its length is 2^k for some k. Since 2^k grows exponentially, and the string has length 39, which isn't a power of two, the grammar can't generate it. The earliest possible expansion that reaches length 2^5 is 32 tokens, but 39 isn't a multiple of 32, so it's impossible to derive this string.\n\nWait, but 39 is larger than 32. Could it be that the grammar allows for non-adjacent insertions or somehow creates more tokens? No, because each production only replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So each step replaces one non-terminal with two, thus increasing the count by one each time. So starting from 2 tokens, the number of tokens after n steps is 2 + n. But 2 + n =39 \u2192 n=37 steps, which is odd. Because each expansion step increases the count by 1, starting from 2, after an even number of steps, the count is 2 + even, which is even, and after odd steps, it's odd. But 39 is odd, which is possible. So 37 steps would get us to 39 tokens.\n\nBut wait, each production that creates two terminals increases the length, but some may replace a non-terminal with two terminals. For example, if a non-terminal has a production that includes a terminal, like NT33 -> 't73' or 't30', but in the given grammar, NT33 has multiple productions: NT33 -> 't73' and NT33 -> 't30'. The other productions in the grammar seem to consist of only non-terminals, except for NT33 having those two terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT12 has a production that includes a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT33 is one of the non-terminals that has two terminal productions. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the production rules, many have two non-terminals, but some have a non-terminal followed by a terminal. Specifically, the rules for NT33 are:\n\nNT33 -> 't73'\nNT33 -> 't30'\n\nSo NT33 can produce either t73 or t30, which are terminals. So if in the derivation, a non-terminal like NT33 occurs, it can be replaced with either t73 or t30, which are single terminals.\n\nBut the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each production is a single non-terminal -> two non-terminals, except for the terminals, but in the given grammar, it's not directly CNF because some have A->a, which would actually be a single symbol. Wait, hold on, the correct Chomsky Normal Form has all productions in the form A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So in that case, the grammar seems to have a mix of productions with two non-terminals and those with a terminal.\n\nBut since the question states that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, perhaps the problem assumes that all productions are of two non-terminals, but the terminals are only at the leaves. Therefore, perhaps the grammar can produce terminal strings only at the top level, and the internal nodes are non-terminals that split down to the end symbols. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar includes some rules where a non-terminal is immediately replaced by a terminal, which would change the way the expansion works.\n\nIn any case, the key point is that the string's length is 39, which isn't a power of two. Since each step of the grammar's expansion (when all non-terminals are split into two non-terminals) increases the count by 1, starting from 2, 3, 4, etc. So the possible lengths are 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. But 39 is possible? Wait, let's think differently: 2^1=2, so first expansion gives 2 tokens. Second step (each non-terminal splits), so 4 tokens. Third step, 8 tokens, etc. So the lengths are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

{"custom_id":"request-817","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the start symbol must be S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the string must start with NT48 and NT11. Wait, actually, since the string is a sequence of terminals, but the productions produce non-terminals first. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Actually, each production directly leads to terminals, but in this case, the NT symbols eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nWait, looking closer, I see that some NT symbols produce terminals, like NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30', and others produce other non-terminals. So, our goal is to see if the entire string can be generated by starting with S and deriving the string through these productions.\n\nThe string given is: t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t77 t31 t37 t77 t47 t76 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t47 t4 t25 t32 t81 t49 t65 t77 t81 t25 t22 t48 t65 t77 t81 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t19 t25 t42 t25 t5 t25 t76 t15.\n\nWait a minute, that's a long string. Let's see if each terminal can be matched by the productions.\n\nI'll start by considering the structure. S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the first step is that S must expand into NT48 and NT11. Therefore, the string must start with the expansion of NT48 followed by NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48, I see it has a production: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. So, NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT6. Now, both NT49 and NT6 need to expand.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6. So, NT49 expands into NT11 and NT6. Wait, but NT11 is another non-terminal. Let me see.\n\nWait, this might be getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if I can break it down into the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if each terminal in the string can be derived in the reverse order. But that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of rules. Let me try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t68. Looking at the grammar, which NT symbols produce t68. I see NT48 \u2192 t68. So, t68 must come from NT48.\n\nSo, the first production is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So, the first part of the string is T68, which comes from NT48.\n\nSo, the string starts as T68, T77, T26, etc. Wait, no, S starts as NT48 NT11. So, the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet me look at the first part: t68 t77. So, T68 is from NT48, and then T77. Let's see, after NT48, we have NT11. Now, what is NT11's production?\n\nLooking at NT11, I see it produces NT49 and NT6. So, NT11 \u2192 NT49 NT6.\n\nNow, let's look at T77. Wait, wait. The second part after t68 is t77. Wait, no, the string starts as t68 t77 t26..., so t68, then t77, then t26, etc.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT48 NT48 produces T68, but NT11's expansion is NT49 NT6. So, after NT48, we have NT11, which is NT49 NT6. So, the second symbol after t68 should come from NT49 and NT6.\n\nWait, the string is t68 (from NT48) followed by t77. Hmm, t77 is a terminal. Let's see which NT produces t77.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing T77. Let me check all NT symbols: NT33 \u2192 t76 or t30, NT34 \u2192 t9 t14, etc. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT17 is not even listed, but maybe it's in the NT symbols. Wait, I think I might have missed some. Wait, in the list, NT33 \u2192 't76' and 't30'. NT14 \u2192 't76'. NT25 is a terminal? Wait, no, NT25 \u2192 't58'. Let me check all to see if any NT produces 't77'.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't77'. The closest is NT36: 't53', NT15: 't48', NT28: 't59', etc. It seems 't77' is not directly produced by any NT. Therefore, the string must not be deriveable, because 't77' is not a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed some production. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the list, the NT symbols and their productions are as follows:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76', 't30'\n- NT34 \u2192 't9', 't14'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3', 't3'\n- NT39 \u2192 't40', 't11'\n- NT40 \u2192 't28', 't1'\n- NT49 \u2192 't16', 't7' etc.\n\nWait, I see NT49 \u2192 't16', 't7'; but nowhere do I see 't77'. So, without a production that directly produces 't77', the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't miss any NT symbol that produces 't77'. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking through all the NT symbols, I see that NT33, NT9, NT25, etc., all are either terminals or produce other non-terminals. But I don't see any NT that directly produces 't77'.\n\nTherefore, since 't77' is not in the terminals of the grammar, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal 't77', which is not derived by any production of the grammar. \n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-838","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF has specific rules. Each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. It also means that the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production, and every production has two non-terminals on the right. But wait, looking at the given grammar, I notice some productions have terminals on the right, like NT33 \u2192 't76' and others. So maybe the grammar is not in strict CNF because in CNF, you shouldn't have terminals on the right side except for maybe the start symbol, but that's a rare case.\n\nHmm, but the problem says it's presented as a CNF, so perhaps it's okay because some non-terminals might produce terminals, which is allowed. The important thing is that all productions are either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. Let me check a few:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't76' \u2192 that's a terminal, so okay.\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32 \u2192 both non-terminals, correct.\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 \u2192 non-terminals? Wait, NT6 is a non-terminal, but NT49 \u2192 NT11 and NT6. But looking at the productions, NT6 has a production like NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, which might loop. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t68 t77 t77 t77 t47 t25 t31 t42 t65 t31 t25 t10 t48 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t53 t65 t31 t25 t10 t48 t73 t25 t10 t48 t66 t31 t76 t65 t31 t25 t19 t25 t76 t31 t25 t81 t4`.\n\nThe string starts with t68, then t77, which is the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string should start with NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet me check NT48's production. Looking through the productions, I see that NT48 \u2192 NT28 NT6. Wait, is there a production for NT48?\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT48, I see: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT28. Let's check that. Yes, the production NT48 is: NT48 \u2192 NT49 NT28.\n\nWait, wait, the user provided the grammar as several lines. Let me see:\n\nHere it is: \n\nLooking for NT48, I see:\n\n\"NT48 -> NT28 NT6\"? Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT48 -> NT49 NT28\"\n\nNo, actually, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT48 as a separate production. Let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see NT48 is written as: \"NT48 -> t68\"\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, no, in the list, I see:\n\n\"NT33 -> 't76'\nNT33 -> 't30'\n...\nNT40 -> 't65'\nNT20 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't25'\nNT41 -> 't77'\nNT20 -> 't53'\nNT52 -> 't7'\n...\nNT48 -> t68\"\n\nWait no, looking again, the user provided the grammar as several lines, and somewhere in the list, there's:\n\n\"NT48 -> t68\"\n\nWait, is that a production? Because in CNF, all productions except possibly the start symbol should be A \u2192 BC, where both B and C are non-terminals. But here, if NT48 \u2192 t68, which is a terminal, that's allowed because it's a production of a non-terminal to a terminal. However, in that case, the string must start with t68, which it does, but then we have to see if the rest of the string follows the other productions.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-837","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar produces. CNF grammars have each production rule on the left side that produces two non-terminals, except for the start symbol producing a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal on the right side. The given grammar seems to have all rules set up that way except maybe a few, but most look correct.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of tokens like 't68', 't77', etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nI recall that in CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but parsing might be complicated because I don't remember how to do that exactly. Alternatively, I can try to match the string step by step, but that seems error-prone since the grammar is quite complex.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's mostly about combining non-terminals that eventually expand into terminals through multiple steps. For example, S -> NT48 NT11, and then NT48 and NT11 have their own production rules. I think each step reduces the number of symbols until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me look at the string:\n\nt68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t10 t31 t42 t65 t77 t26 t53 t69 t69 t48 t73 t73 t15 t25 t84 t27 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t3 t15\n\nI notice that some tokens like 't68', 't77', etc., are either terminals or may correspond to certain non-terminals. For example, some non-terminals have production rules that include these terminals. So, I think each 'tX' corresponds to a specific non-terminal.\n\nFor instance, looking at NT48, the production is NT48 -> 't48'. Similarly, NT75 could produce 't84', but in the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT84 directly. Wait, no, in the grammar, I see that NT47 -> 't48', so NT48 is 't48'? Or wait, look at the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules are all S -> NTAB NTCD..., so I need to figure out which non-terminals expand into which terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT48 -> 't48' (so S's first production is NT48 and NT11; NT48 expands to 't48', NT11 needs to expand to something that results in 't77', as the first token is 't68', then 't77', etc. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must be derived by the grammar, meaning every step in the derivation must follow the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider how the string is built up. Each step in the derivation must split into two parts, each of which is a non-terminal that can derive the next part of the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, but I'm not sure how to do that without a parser. Alternatively, perhaps I can check whether each token in the string can be matched to a non-terminal, and that the sequence of non-terminals can be derived in a way that eventually gives the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the first two symbols must come from two non-terminals that derive to the first two components, and so on.\n\nLet me think. The string starts with 't68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t10 t31 t42 t65 t77 t26 t53 t69 t69 t48 t73 t73 t15 t25 t84 t27 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t10 t3 t15'\n\nThe first two tokens must come from the first production, which is S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nSo, S expands into NT48 NT11.\n\nTherefore, the string should be generated by expanding NT48 into something and NT11 into something else.\n\nLooking at NT48, the production is NT48 -> 't48'. So the first token is 't48', but the string starts with 't68', which doesn't match. Therefore, that suggests that maybe the string does not start with 't48', so it can't be derived from S, which first splits into NT48 NT11, which would start with 't48'.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't68', which is not 't48', so that would mean that the string is not derived from S's first production. Hmm, that can't be, but that would suggest that the string is invalid. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string starts with 't68', and S produces NT48 NT11. So if NT48 production is 't48', but the string starts with 't68', which is different. So that would mean that the entire string can't be generated by this grammar, because the first step of the derivation would produce 't48' followed by something else, but the string starts with 't68'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my analysis is incorrect. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48's production is: NT48 -> 't48' (I think). Wait, let's check the grammar:\n\n- NT48 -> 't48'\n\nYes, under the list of rules, I see:\n\nNT48 -> 't48'\n\nSo, if S -> NT48 NT11, then the first token must be 't48', but in the given string, the first token is 't68'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar, because the first step leads to 't48'.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, if the first token is 't68', and S starts with NT48 NT11, which produces 't48' and something, but the string starts with 't68', that's a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer should be 'No'. I don't even need to check the rest of the string beyond the first token because it's a direct conflict.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check the production rules.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nS -> NT48 NT11\n\nNT48 -> 't48'\n\nSo, yes, the first token must be 't48', but the string starts with 't68', so it's not possible.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the string is not generated by the given grammar because the first token doesn't match the production of S.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-851","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is long. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a grammar in CNF looks like. CNF has rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals, or a terminal. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to follow CNF because each production either has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT49, which is two non-terminals, and NT33 \u2192 't76', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t68 t77 t26 t26 t69 t69 t48 t30 t65 t77 t77 t77 t31 t49 t7 t26 t28 t37 t77 t77 t47 t4 t55 t77 t31 t25 t77 t47 t55 t81 t4 t65 t77 t81 t25 t84 t27 t15 t27 t28 t77 t24 t58 t19 t73 t15\".\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production of a non-terminal can be thought of as a rule that splits the string into subparts. It's similar to a parsing tree where each node has exactly two children or a terminal.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals, so each terminal corresponds to a production that ends the derivation for that branch.\n\nGiven the structure of CNF, if the grammar generates the string, it must be possible to split the string into a series of steps where each step uses the productions recursively.\n\nI should approach this by trying to parse the string according to the grammar.\n\nFirst, I can note that the grammar is given with all the productions, but it's quite extensive. To effectively parse, I can list all the productions that end with a terminal, as these define the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nFor example, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76'\n- NT33 \u2192 't30'\n- NT40 \u2192 't65'\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'\n- NT41 \u2192 't77'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't25'\n- NT11 \u2192 't31'\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n- NT30 \u2192 't84'\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT19 \u2192 't28'\n- NT30 \u2192 't10'\n- NT7 \u2192 't53'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n- NT37 \u2192 't32'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT33 \u2192 't73'\n- NT55 \u2192 't83'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT44 \u2192 't66'\n- NT7 \u2192 't28'\n- NT28 \u2192 't59'\n- NT14 \u2192 't42'\n- NT43 \u2192 't55'\n- NT35 \u2192 't27'\n- NT48 \u2192 't68'\n- NT49 \u2192 't47'\n- NT52 \u2192 't7', NT52 \u2192 't58', NT52 \u2192 't37' (multiple rules)\n- NT44 \u2192 't73'\n- NT6 \u2192 't49'\n- NT59 \u2192 't12'\n- NT49 \u2192 't81'\n\nWait, some non-terminals have multiple termination rules, like NT52 has multiple t rules. I need to see which are the possible endpoints.\n\nNow, the given string starts with t68, so I can look for production rules that have 't68' as their terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT48 \u2192 't68' is the only one.\n\nSo, the first part of the string would correspond to the production NT48. Now, since NT48 is in the start symbol's production? Wait, the start symbol is S, which is the first production. Let me check the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S: S \u2192 NT48 NT49. So S is made up of two non-terminals: NT48 and NT49.\n\nSo, the string should be breakable into two parts, each derived from NT48 and NT49, respectively.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, so each step in the parse tree will combine two parts. But for the entire string to be generated, it should be derived in such a way that each terminal comes from some production.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this as a parsing problem. Let's think recursively. The entire string should be a series of terminals, each corresponding to a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nStarting with the entire string, we can split it into two parts, each corresponding to one of the two non-terminals in each production, starting from the top.\n\nIn the grammar, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT48 NT49. So, S is split into two parts: NT48 and NT49. So the entire string needs to be split into two subparts, each generated by NT48 and NT49, respectively.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the string can be split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT48 and the second by NT49.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nLooking at NT48's productions. NT48 \u2192 't68' is one of its rules. So, if the first element is 't68', then the rest of the string after that should be generated by NT49.\n\nSo, the entire string would be t68 followed by t77 t26 t26 t69 t69 t48 t30 t65 t77 t77 t77 t31 t49 t7 t26 t28 t37 t77 t77 t47 t4 t55 t77 t31 t25 t77 t47 t55 t81 t4 t65 t77 t81 t25 t84 t27 t15 t27 t28 t77 t24 t58 t19 t73 t15.\n\nWait, the entire string starts with t68, so that's a single symbol from NT48. Then, the remaining string is: t77 t26 t26 t69 t69 t48 ... up to t15.\n\nNow, the next non-terminal after t68 is NT49, because S is divided into NT48 and NT49. So, the next part after t68 should be generated by NT49.\n\nSo, looking at NT49's productions: NT49 \u2192 t47 (from two places), and other rules. Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT49: In the initial list, NT49's productions are:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT49 \u2192 NT65 (though I think it's NT65, but looking carefully:\n\nWait, in the initial grammar list, I see NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and NT49 \u2192 t81. Let me check the initial grammar:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe list is:\n\nNT40 -> NT28 NT1\n...\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT49 -> NT16 NT7\nNT49 -> t81\n\nWait, actually, in the initial grammar, NT49 has the following productions:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nNT49 \u2192 t81.\n\nWait, I think I missed that in the initial list. Let me check again:\n\nIn the initial grammar:\n\n...\nNT20 -> 't26'\n...\nNT44 -> 't42'\nNT7 -> 't36'\nNT30 -> 't84'\n...\nNT14 -> 't76'\n...\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT49 -> t47 (multiple times)\nNT49 -> t81\n\nSo, NT49 can be t47, t81, or the combination of NT11 and NT6.\n\nNow, the next symbol after t68 is t77, which is the first symbol of the second part.

{"custom_id":"request-849","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. This makes parsing a bit easier, but since it's a decision problem, I need another approach.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me list them out:\n\nt68, t77, t26, t59, t28, t77, t77, t47, t59, t28, t77, t31, t25, t22, t48, t69, t27, t69, t27, t76, t25, t10, t48, t59, t28, t77, t77, t47, t65, t77, t26, t26, t69, t26, t69, t73, t15, t25, t19, t25, t76, t25, t5, t25, t76, t55.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is either a single non-terminal or a pair of non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT44 and NT11. So, the initial expansion starts with S \u2192 NT44 NT11.\n\nI'll need to see if the string can be broken down into the production rules of the grammar. Let's start by analyzing the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S \u2192 NT44 NT11. So the first two non-terminals should be NT44 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t68. Let me check what each non-terminal expands to.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57\nNT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37\nNT9 \u2192 't25'\nNT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35\nNT30 \u2192 't22'\nNT35 \u2192 NT27 NT3\nNT27 \u2192 't69'\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\nSo NT57 \u2192 't25' 't30' \u2192 Wait, actually, NT57 is broken down into NT9 and NT37, each of which produce specific terminals. So let's see:\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT9 (which is 't25') and NT37 (which is 't22' since NT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35, which are 't22' and 't3'). So NT57 \u2192 't25' 't22'.\n\nNow, NT44 = NT12 NT57. So NT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32, and NT57 \u2192 't25' 't22'.\n\nWait, let me break down each step properly:\n\nNT44's production is NT12 NT57.\nNT12 is NT39 NT32.\nNT39 is NT40 NT11.\nSo NT44's production could be broken down into a chain of terminals and sub-productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by seeing how the string starts with t68. So let's find which non-terminal can produce t68.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only place 't68' appears is in NT48 \u2192 't68'. But in the current grammar, I don't see NT48 as a non-terminal; wait, checking the grammar, yes, in the last line, NT48 \u2192 't68'.\n\nWait no, let me check again: the production rules include NT48 \u2192 't68', which means NT48 is a terminal. So the only way to produce t68 is directly from NT48. So in the initial production S \u2192 NT44 NT11, neither NT44 nor NT11 directly produce t68, so that can't be the first step. Wait, so the string starts with t68, which must come from NT48, but the start symbol S produces NT44 and NT11, so I must find a way to get t68 from NT44 and NT11 through their productions, but none do directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- t68 (NT48)\n- t77 (NT49)\n- t26 (NT14, maybe others)\n- t59 (NT59)\n- t28 (maybe others)\n- t7 (NT7, etc.)\n- t53 (NT20)\n- t27 (NT27)\n- t3 (NT33)\n- t76 (NT33, wait, looking at the grammar, yes, both NT33 and others produce some t tokens.)\n- t4 (NT6)\n- t69 (NT12, others)\n- t30 (NT30)\n- t22 (NT30)\n- t10 (NT35)\n- t5 (NT35, I think NT35 is NT27 NT3, so t69 and t3)\n- t19 (NT19)\n\nWait, the string starts with t68. Since t68 is only in NT48, which is a production on its own, that means that in the string, the first occurrence must come from a derivation that eventually produces NT48.\n\nBut the start symbol S \u2192 NT44 NT11. So the first two symbols in the string must come from NT44 and NT11. But the first symbol is t68, so that would mean that nt44 \u2192 t68 and nt11 \u2192 something else, which isn't possible because NT44 doesn't produce t68 directly. So perhaps the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, let me check again the production for NT48. Yes, in the last line, NT48 \u2192 't68'. So to produce t68, we must have a path where a non-terminal produces nt48. But the initial symbol S produces NT44 and NT11, which don't include NT48. So unless there's a way to produce NT48 from NT44 or NT11 through their productions, which I don't see.\n\nLooking at NT44's production: NT12 NT57. Neither NT12 nor NT57 produce t68 directly. Similarly, NT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49, and so on. So the string starting with t68 can't be derived from S, which starts with NT44 and NT11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. It looks like all the non-terminals (everything that starts with N) are on the left, and each production rule consists of two non-terminals on the right. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers and some other symbols like 't76', 't26', etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string we're evaluating starts with 't68 t77 t26 ...' So I need to see if the string can be derived from S following the production rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbols: 't68' and 't77'. Wait, in the grammar, I see S -> NT48 NT11. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT48 and NT11. Let me check if both of these can produce 't68' and 't77' respectively.\n\nLooking at NT48, in the grammar, I see NT48 -> NT14 NT35. Then NT14: looking at the productions, NT14 -> 't76'. So NT14 produces 't76'. Then NT35: NT35 -> NT40 NT25. Wait, that's not right. Wait, looking again, NT35's productions are:\n\nNT35 -> NT40 NT11\nNT35 -> NT33 NT14\nNT35 -> NT27 NT...\nWait, let me look again. The user provided an extensive list. Let me search for NT35.\n\nYes, NT35 -> NT33 NT46? Wait, no. Let me check. The list has:\n\nNT35 -> NT40 NT27\nWait, no, actually looking again, the user's grammar has:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nLooking for NT35:\nNT35 -> NT27 NT45\nNT35 -> NT23 NT45\nWait, no. Let me scan the productions. Let me look for NT35.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT35 -> NT40 NT27\nNT35 -> NT23 NT45\nHmm, perhaps I miswrote. Let me check the user's grammar again.\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's grammar, I see:\n\nLooking down, I see:\n\nNT35 -> NT27 NT45\nNT35 -> NT23 NT45\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the provided grammar.\n\nLooking through, yes, here's NT35:\n\n- NT35 -> NT40 NT27\n- NT35 -> NT23 NT45\n\nSo, NT35 can generate two sequences. Wait, but looking at the string, after NT48 is 't68', which would come from NT14. Let me track:\n\nSo S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nNT48 -> NT14 NT35.\n\nNT14 -> 't76'? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT14 -> 't76' and also other productions. So NT14 can produce 't76', so 't76' is derived from NT14. So 't68' is the first symbol in the string. Wait, that doesn't match because NT14 would produce 't76', not 't68'. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, looking back, S -> NT48 NT11. Let's see what NT48 and NT11 can produce.\n\nNT48: looking for productions, I see NT48 -> NT14 NT35.\n\nThen NT14: NT14 -> 't76'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't68', not 't76'. So that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in looking up NT48.\n\nWait, let me check again. The user's grammar is provided. Let me find NT48.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT48 -> NT6 NT49.\n\nSo NT48 can derive into NT6 and NT49. NT6 -> 't4', but in the string, we have 't68 t77 t26...'.\n\nWait, let's step back. Maybe I misunderstood the initial steps. Maybe I should look for all possible starting paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be matched by another production path. Let me consider if S can generate the string through different non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming S directly leads to NT48 NT11. Maybe there's another way, but in the given grammar, S only has that production. So I have no choice but to follow S -> NT48 NT11.\n\nWait, so the first part is S -> NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols should come from NT48 and NT11.\n\nIn the string, the first two symbols are 't68' and 't77'. So let's see if NT48 can produce 't68' and NT11 can produce 't77'.\n\nLooking at NT48: it's NT48 -> NT6 NT49.\n\nNT6: NT6-> 't4', so that would produce 't4'. But the first symbol is 't68', so that's not matching.\n\nWait, but perhaps NT48 produces something else. Wait, perhaps I misread the productions. Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, NT48 -> NT6 NT49.\n\nNT6 -> 't4' but also some other productions? Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nSo NT6 can also produce NT52 and NT49.\n\nWait, so NT48 can be expanded in two ways:\n\n1. NT48 -> NT6 NT49, which then becomes 't4' and possibly more.\n\n2. Wait, no, NT48 is NT6 NT49. So NT48 becomes NT6 NT49. So the first symbol is 't4' from NT6, but the string starts with 't68', so that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me see what each symbol in the string comes from.\n\nThe string is: t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t65 t31 t25 t19 t25 t76 t81 t7 t26 t36 t49 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t31 t42 t65 t31 t25 t19 t25 t76 t81 t7 t26 t36 t49 t59 t28 t77 t77 t47 t25 t5 t25 t42 t15 t3 t28 t77 t24 t58 t5 t55.\n\nLet's count the length. The string is 47 symbols long. The grammar is quite complex, so manually expanding it would take a lot of time, but maybe I can find a pattern or see if any of the non-terminals can produce sequences matching the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if any of the terminals at the start can be matched. For example, the first symbol is 't68'. Looking through the grammar to find a non-terminal that can derive into 't68'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for a production where a non-terminal A can produce 't68'.\n\nLooking through, I see NT48 -> NT6 NT49. Earlier I thought NT6 can produce 't4', but wait, NT6 also has a production: NT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nWait, for NT6: Line 14: NT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nThen, NT49: Let's see. Wait, NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nSo NT49: NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nThen NT11: NT11 -> NT41 NT49.\n\nAnd NT41: NT41 -> 't77'.\n\nWait, so NT48 -> NT6 NT49.\n\nThen NT6 -> NT52 NT49.\n\nThen NT49 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nSo NT48 becomes NT6 NT49, which is NT52 NT49 NT6.\n\nBut this is getting too deep.

{"custom_id":"request-866","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar first. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That should make parsing a bit easier, maybe with the CYK algorithm or similar methods. But since the string is quite long, maybe I should look for simpler ways or see if there's a pattern.\n\nThe grammar has multiple non-terminals: S, NT48, NT44, NT12, NT58, NT57, NT49, NT59, NT32, NT45, NT34, NT39, NT35, NT1 -> NT19 NT41, NT31 -> NT20 NT8, NT7 -> NT12 NT43, NT37 -> NT30 NT35, NT11 -> NT41 NT49, NT52 -> NT14 NT32, NT44 -> NT12 NT57, NT29 -> NT7 NT35, NT12 -> NT39 NT32, NT55 -> NT21 NT59, NT42 -> NT55 NT25, NT37 -> NT13 NT34, NT21 -> NT33 NT45, NT40 -> NT28 NT1, NT49 -> NT16 NT7, NT31 -> NT8 NT35, NT33 -> 't76' or 't30', NT40 -> 't65', NT20 -> 't26', NT9 -> 't25', NT41 -> 't77', NT20 -> 't53', NT52 -> 't7', NT25 -> 't58', NT59 -> 't24', NT14 -> 't76', NT8 -> 't69', NT16 -> 't26', NT47 -> 't48', NT13 -> 't5', NT52 -> 't37' again, which is confusing because NT52 appears multiple times. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo? Let me check again. Yeah, it's different versions for NT52. Maybe the correct one is the first occurrence? Or perhaps the grammar has multiple productions for the same non-terminal.\n\nAlso, several non-terminals point directly to 't' strings, which are terminals. So each production ends when it reaches a terminal symbol. The string given is a sequence of these terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no, the string is all t's and numbers. So I need to parse this string through the grammar to see if it can be derived.\n\nThe string is: `t68 t77 t26 t65 t77 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t37 t47 t25 t22 t3 t55 t49 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t81 t37 t31 t49 t25 t84 t48 t30 t37 t15 t48 t73 t28 t77 t69 t28 t77 t58 t19 t15`.\n\nFirst, let's notice that some productions immediately produce t's. For example, NT33 can be 't76' or 't30'. Similarly, NT40 is 't65', NT20 is 't26', NT9 is 't25', NT41 is 't77', etc.\n\nI think the approach here is to build a derivation tree starting from S and see if we can reach the given string. Alternatively, perhaps we can parse the string step by step, checking if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nBut since this is a long string, parsing manually might be tedious. Perhaps I can group the parts that correspond to the t's and see if they can be produced by the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT48 NT11. So the string must start with something derived from NT48 and NT11. Let's check the string: it starts with t68, t77, etc.\n\nWait, let me see each part step by step. S -> NT48 NT11. So the string should be split into parts that correspond to NT48's expansion and NT11's expansion.\n\nLet me list the rules for NT48 and NT11:\n\nNT48: Not defined in the given grammar. Wait, looking back, NT48 is part of the production for S. So actually, in the given grammar, S -> NT48 NT11. So NT48 and NT11 must be defined somewhere. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT33 has 't76' and 't30'. NT42 -> NT55 NT25. NT55 is defined as NT21 NT59. Hmm, this is getting complex. Maybe it's better to see which parts of the string correspond to each NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can break down the string into segments where each segment is a production of a non-terminal.\n\nFor example, starting from S, the first part is NT48, and the second is NT11.\n\nLooking at NT48, I don't see a direct production for it in the given grammar. Wait, S -> NT48 NT11, so NT48 must be expanded somewhere else. Let me check all rules to see if any non-terminal starts with NT48.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT33's expansions are 't76' and 't30', which are terminals. NT48 is not directly defined, but perhaps it's a concatenation that can be built from existing rules. Wait, maybe NT48 is part of a larger rule somewhere. Hmm, perhaps I can see if any other non-terminals produce something that starts with NT48.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps I should check which rules have 't68' in them. Wait, looking back, NT52 has 't7', 't58', etc. NT45 has 't76', etc. Wait, perhaps there's a non-terminal that has 't68'.\n\nWait, the only terminal symbols start with 't'. Let me check which non-terminals produce 't68' or other t's.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice that NT48 is not directly a terminal; perhaps it's part of a longer production. Wait, actually, the rule S -> NT48 NT11 suggests that NT48 and NT11 are combined, so perhaps the string should be split into two parts, each being the expansion of NT48 and NT11.\n\nLet's take the string and try to split it into segments that correspond to NT48 and NT11. So the total string length is 55 t's and other tokens. Wait, let me count:\n\nThe string has 53 elements. I need to split them into two parts: one for NT48 and one for NT11.\n\nWhat could NT48 produce? Looking at the rules, NT52 -> 't7', 't58', etc. Wait, looking at NT52, it has multiple productions. For example, NT52 -> 't7' or 't58', but wait, actually, looking back, there are multiple rules for NT52.\n\nWait, the user input had a duplicated NT52 rule: one says NT52 -> NT14 NT32, another says NT52 -> 't7' or 't58'. That seems conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nYes, in the given grammar, NT52 appears more than once. It's defined as:\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\n...\nNT52 -> 't7' \n...\nAnd another as NT52 -> 't58'\n\nSo that seems like a mistake because NT52 is being defined in multiple ways, including one that outputs a terminal string. But in CNF, non-terminals can only produce other non-terminals, not terminals. So this suggests that perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check the original grammar again.\n\nLooking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT52 -> NT14 NT32\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\nNT44 -> NT12 NT57\nNT29 -> NT7 NT35\nNT12 -> NT39 NT32\nNT55 -> NT21 NT59\nNT42 -> NT55 NT25\nBTW, I think I might have misread the grammar earlier. Let me recount the rules. Wait, perhaps the user wrote it in a confusing way.

{"custom_id":"request-879","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. That structure helps because it simplifies parsing, but it also means that each production step either combines two non-terminals into another or terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of symbols: t68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t31 t65 t77 t47 t25 t84 t48 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t77 t47 t4 t55 t77 t77 t77 t81 t4 t49 t4 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t84 t48 t69 t3 t69 t27 t30 t25 t5 t25 t42 t25 t32 t55. Man, that's a long string!\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that many non-terminals produce just one symbol, either a terminal or another non-terminal. For example, NT33 can produce 't76' or 't30', and NT40 can produce 't65' or 't28' or 't1'\u2014wait, no, actually looking again, each rule seems to produce exactly two non-terminals. Wait, no. Let me clarify: the grammar is in CNF, so each production produces two non-terminals or one terminal. So some rules have two non-terminals, others have a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production should be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in the given grammar, I see a mix. For example, S \u2192 NT48 NT11 is a production that has two non-terminals on the right, so when expanded, it would generate two symbols. Similarly, some rules have a terminal and a non-terminal, meaning they could generate a terminal followed by whatever that non-terminal generates.\n\nLooking at the string, all the symbols are terminals (like t68, t77, etc.), except perhaps some non-terminals? Wait no, because the grammar only produces terminals or non-terminals. Wait no, the string is a sequence of terminals. So if the grammar only produces terminals, then perhaps each production must eventually lead to a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. The grammar is in CNF, so each non-terminal can either produce a terminal or two non-terminals. However, the string provided is just a sequence of terminals, so perhaps the grammar must derive exactly that string from the start symbol S by expanding into only terminals.\n\nSo the process is to see if the string can be broken down into the sequence of productions given.\n\nLet's look at the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S.\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11. That's a production with two non-terminals. So the string must start with whatever NT48 produces followed by whatever NT11 produces. Let me see what NT48 and NT11 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT6 NT49 (from the top: NT49's first rule is NT11 NT6, but wait no, let me check.)\n\nWait, the grammar has NT48 \u2192 NT6 NT49. Looking through the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49, and NT49 has multiple rules, but let's focus. Alternatively, I might have to approach this by breaking down the string into possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should reverse the approach. Start from the string and try to see if it can be derived by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the string is a series of t's followed by numbers, each corresponding to a production rule that produces that terminal.\n\nSo the string starts with t68. Looking for which non-terminals produce t68.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 \u2192 NT6 NT49. Then, perhaps the first part is t68, so let's see what NT48 produces: in the rules, NT48 \u2192 NT6 NT49. So NT6 produces 't4' (from NT6 \u2192 t4 in the bottom-level rules), and NT49 produces 't11' and 't6'\u2014looking at the grammar, NT49 has a rule NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, which in turn, NT11 is 't31' and 't49', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to map each terminal to which non-terminal produces it. So, looking through the bottom-level rules:\n\n- NT33 has rules t76 and t30\n- NT37 has t32, t35\n- NT25 has t59\n- NT28 has t59\n- NT26 has t25, t53\n- NT19 has t28\n- NT30 has t84 (in NT30 \u2192 t84, but wait, no. Looking at NT30's rules, I see NT30 \u2192 t84. So when NT30 is expanded, if it's a terminal, then it's t84.\n\nWait, the terminal symbols in the string are things like 't68', 't77', etc. So each of these must be generated by some non-terminal. So I'll map each terminal to which non-terminal produces it.\n\nLooking through each terminal in the string and seeing which non-terminals can produce them:\n\nt68: NT48 \u2192 t68 is in NT48 \u2192 NT6 NT49. But Wait, the string starts with t68. So looking at the rules, perhaps NT48 can produce t68. Wait, in NT48 \u2192 NT6 NT49. So unless NT6 or NT49 can produce t68, which they can't from the given rules. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals are being processed in a derived form. So to get a t68, the non-terminal must directly produce t68. But looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t68 unless a rule for a non-terminal ends with t68 as the only terminal. But looking at the grammar rules, I don't see that. The only place where 't68' appears is as the production of NT49: in NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, but that doesn't produce t68. Similarly, in NT44 \u2192 T47 and T44 is in NT49.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me see if there's any non-terminal that directly produces any of the t symbols in the string.\n\nLooking through all rules, the t symbols in the productions are:\n\n- t68: does any non-terminal produce this? Checking, no; nt33 \u2192 t76 and t30, nt48 \u2192 nt6 nt49, etc. So no non-terminal directly produces t68. So that's a problem because the first symbol in the string is t68, which must come from a non-terminal that directly produces t68, but it does not. So perhaps the string is invalid, hence the answer is No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe the terminals in the grammar can only come from specific non-terminals. So if the first token is t68 and no non-terminal produces t68 directly, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again to see if any non-terminal produces t68 as a terminal. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' and 't30'\n- NT37 \u2192 't32' and 't35'\n- NT25 \u2192 't59', etc.\n\nNo non-terminal directly produces t68, t77, t26, etc. So in the given string, the first symbol is t68, which cannot be generated by any rule, meaning the string is not possible.

{"custom_id":"request-877","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a set of production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens. First, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar and how it can generate the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's structured in a way that non-terminals are defined using other non-terminals and the string symbols 't' followed by a two-digit number. The start symbol is S, and it produces NT48 NT11. So the first step is to see what NT48 and NT11 lead to.\n\nI can see that NT48 is defined as NT44 NT49. NT44 is NT12 NT57, and NT57 is NT9 NT37. NT9 is 't25', and NT37 is NT30 NT35. NT30 is 't22', and NT35 is NT3 NT14. NT3 is 't3', NT14 is 't76', etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step. Let me write down the production rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT48 NT11  \nNT48 \u2192 NT44 NT49  \nNT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57  \nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32  \nNT57 \u2192 NT9 NT37  \nNT37 \u2192 NT30 NT35  \nNT30 \u2192 't22'  \nNT35 \u2192 NT3 NT14  \nNT3 \u2192 't3'  \nNT14 \u2192 't76'  \n... and so on for each non-terminal.\n\nI can see that each non-terminal eventually resolves to a sequence of 't' symbols. My goal is to parse the input string using the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use either a top-down approach (like recursive descent or using the parsing table) or a bottom-up approach (like the CYK algorithm). Given that the grammar might be ambiguous, but Chomsky normal form doesn't necessarily guarantee uniqueness, but for this purpose, we just need to find if there's a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the string can be split into the required non-terminals. The input string is:\n\nt68 t77 t26 t59 t28 t77 t77 t77 t26 t69 t27 t26 t69 t73 t15 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t32 t81 t65 t77 t26 t65 t77 t31 t76 t59 t28 t77 t31 t25 t32 t26 t36 t65 t31 t25 t32 t15 t25 t19 t25 t42 t55\n\nI'll try to match this step by step. Starting from S, which is NT48 NT11.\n\nSo NT48 expands to NT44 NT49. Let's see what NT44 and NT49 produce.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57  \nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32  \nNT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11  \nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1  \nNT28 \u2192 NT59  \nBut NT28 is in the string as t59, so that might be possible, but wait: NT28 is produced by NT59, and NT59 can be 't28'. Hmm, let me check. Looking at the grammar, NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1, but also NT59 \u2192 't28'? No, wait. In the provided rules, I see NT59 has two productions: NT59 \u2192 NT21 NT59 and NT59 \u2192 't28' and also NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT55, but also NT59 \u2192 't24'? Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at all NT definitions:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1  \nNT59 \u2192 't28'  \nWait, no, I need to check. The provided rules have:\n\nLooking for NT59: \n\nLooking through the list: \n\nNT59 \u2192 NT21 NT59  \nNT59 \u2192 NT33 NT55  \nNT59 \u2192 't28'  \nWait, no, I think I missed that. Let me scan through the provided NT rules:\n\nLooking for NT59... line says: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT1; other lines: NT11 -> ..., NT13->..., NT14->..., NT15->t47, NT18->..., NT21->..., NT25->..., NT28->..., NT33->..., NT40->..., NT44->..., NT47->t48, NT52->..., NT53->..., NT55->..., etc.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me go through each line:\n\nLine: NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57  \nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32  \nNT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11  \nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1  \nNT28 \u2192 NT59  \nIs that correct? \n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nThe grammar's rules list each NT's production:\n\nLooking for NT39:  \nLine says NT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11.  \nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT1.  \nBut NT28 has a production: NT28 \u2192 NT59.  \nWait, but looking through the provided lines, I see:\n\n- NT28: in the lines, I see NT28 \u2192 't59', which is correct because in the input we have t59 appearing. So NT28 can expand to 't59'.\n\nWait, no, the line says NT28 \u2192 't59' and also NT25 \u2192 't58' etc. So NT28 \u2192 't59' is one production, but in the grammar, does NT28 have another production besides that? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLine says: NT19 \u2192 't28' and also NT19 \u2192 't25'; similarly, other NTs.\n\nWait, looking at the full list:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT41 NT49  \nNT13 \u2192 t5  \nNT14 \u2192 t76  \nNT15 \u2192 t47  \nNT18 \u2192 t69  \nNT19 \u2192 t25 t25  \nWait, no, in the provided lines:\n\nWait, looking in the grammar lines:\n\nLet me check for NT28:\n\nLine says: NT28 \u2192 't59'  \nNT26 appears elsewhere, but does NT28 have other rules? Let me see:\n\nI see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't28'  \nWait, no, in the grammar:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't28' is one of the rules, I think.\n\nWait, let's scan through the list again:\n\nThe grammar's non-terminals and their rules are quite extensive. For NT28, I see:\n\nLooking for NT28 in the rules:\n\n- From the list, I see NT28 \u2192 't59'.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps no other rules? Wait, does NT28 have any other productions besides NT28 \u2192 't59'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT43  \n- NT26 \u2192 NT53  \n- NT29 \u2192 't5'  \n- NT30 \u2192 't22'  \n- NT33 \u2192 't73' and 't30'  \n- NT35 \u2192 't3'  \n- NT37 \u2192 't55' and others  \n- NT28 is in the rules as NT28 \u2192 't59'\n\nSo yes, NT28 only has that production.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that NT12 expands to something. Let me try to re-examine this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t68. So S must expand to NT48 NT11, which is t68? Wait, no, because NT48 and NT11 are non-terminals. So they must expand to some sequence of symbols.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT48 NT11, which then, in the next step, NT48 is replaced by NT44 NT49, so S \u2192 NT44 NT49 NT11.\n\nThen NT44 \u2192 NT12 NT57, so S \u2192 NT12 NT57 NT49 NT11.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT39 NT32, so S \u2192 NT39 NT32 NT57 NT49 NT11.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT40 NT11, so S \u2192 NT40 NT11 NT32 NT57 NT49 NT11.\n\nWait, this seems getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look at the entire string and see how it can be split into the required non-term"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Similarly, NT48 is not a production, but wait, no\u2014looking at the production list, I see NT48 is included as a result from NT44: NT44 -> NT29 NT1.

So the first two symbols of the string must be the terminals generated by NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking at the string: first token is t68. So t68 must be derived from NT48. Similarly, the second token is t77, which must come from NT11.\n\nSo let's see the productions for NT48 and NT11.\n\nLooking for NT48: I see here, for example, NT44 -> t48. Wait, no, looking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT44 -> NT29 NT25\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT48 isn't directly shown as a production starting with NT48, but maybe from NTP->NT33, which does produce 't73' or others.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for all productions where a NTX leads to a terminal or another NTY.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions are:\n\nNT33 -> 't73', and another NT33 -> 't30'. Similarly, NT35 -> 't3', etc.\n\nSo let's reconstruct the derivation steps.\n\nFirst, S -> NT48 NT11. So the first two symbols are t68 and t77, which are the results of NT48 and NT11.\n\nNow, looking for how NT48 is derived. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step is a single production.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT48 as left-hand side. Instead, maybe it's derived via a chain of productions. For example, NT48 could be derived from NT29 and NT25, but in the first step, we have NT48.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe NT48 is an intermediate that eventually produces t68 via a chain of productions.\n\nBut since in the first step, S produces NT48 and NT11, both must be terminals or produce terminals. Since t68 is a terminal, NT48 must reduce to t68 in one step. Similarly, NT11 must reduce to t77.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT11: the productions listed are:\n\n- NT11 -> NT41 NT49\n- NT11 -> NT7 NT6\nHmm, so NT11 has two possible productions. Let's see which one can produce t77.\n\nWait, t77 is not a terminal directly, but looking at the productions, there's NT19 -> t77? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, looking again at the productions:\n\nLooking for 't77' in any production. Yes, I see NT19 -> t77 (from the list: NT11 -> NT7 NT6, which leads to t69 and t69?), wait no. Wait, the productions are all in CNF, so each production has two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, finding 't77' in the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> t36\n- NT37 -> t37\n...

{"custom_id":"request-891","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can confirm that each rule either has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal symbol. So that's correct.\n\nThe string to check is:\n\nt68 t77 t77 t77 t26 t65 t31 t59 t28 t77 t77 t26 t28 t25 t32 t55 t42 t65 t31 t25 t84 t48 t69 t27 t69 t48 t76 t5 t28 t77 t24 t58 t5 t76 t25 t32 t81 t55 t26 t65 t31 t65 t77 t26 t53 t25 t10 t3 t15.\n\nFirst, I need to parse this string according to the given grammar. Parsing in this context means applying the production rules to break down the string into the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, we can consider that each step produces two symbols at a time, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, etc., but since all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or a, the parsing can be done using the CYK algorithm or similar methods. But given the string's length, I might consider a more manual approach, perhaps using a recursive descent parser or trying to find a derivation that matches the string.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can look for patterns or see if any of the rules directly produce terminal symbols matching the string. Let me look at the grammar rules that produce terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the grammar, several NT have rules ending with terminals. For example:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't76' or 't30'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'\n- NT7 \u2192 't36'\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT55 \u2192 't83'\n- NT28 \u2192 't59'\n- NT51 \u2192 't53' but I don't see a rule named NT51. Wait, let me check again. Oh, I see NT20 has a rule to 't26' and also some rule with NT52 or others, but I might have made a mistake there. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking back: the grammar has rules like NT20 \u2192 't26' and another NT41 \u2192 't77'. Also, some rules produce 't's followed by numbers. For example, NT14 \u2192 't76', NT33 can be 't76' or 't30', etc.\n\nAnother approach is to map each symbol in the string to a production rule. If I can find a leftmost derivation where each step produces the next part of the string, then it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string is built from symbols that are terminals or non-terminals. Since the string only consists of terminals (t followed by numbers), except for the NT symbols. Wait no, wait: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production right-hand side must have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each symbol in the string must be either a terminal (like 't68') or the left-hand side of a production (like NT33, S, etc.).\n\nWait, but looking at the string: it's only 't68', 't77', etc. So any NT symbol in the string must have a production that allows it to be expanded into the next part of the string. Otherwise, if an NT symbol appears, we would need to expand it, which would require that the string have that NT as part of a replacement, which isn't the case here because the string only has t symbols.\n\nWait, hold on. If the string is composed entirely of terminal symbols, then the entire derivation must consume all non-terminals and produce the t's. But the starting symbol is S, which in the given grammar is S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So the string must start with S's expansion, which is NT48 followed by NT11. Each of these NT's would then need to produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nWait, but the entire string is a single sequence of terminals. So the parsing tree must start with the S rule, and each of the two symbols generated by S (NT48 and NT11) must themselves be expanded into the appropriate t's.\n\nSo let's attempt to see if the string can be broken down into S's production.\n\nFirst, the entire string has 48 symbols. S \u2192 NT48 NT11. So if I can split the string into two parts, one that begins with the expansion of NT48 and the other that starts with the expansion of NT11, then it could work.\n\nLet me try to split the string into the first part (NT48) and the second part (NT11).\n\nFirst, let's see what NT48 can derive. Looking at the grammar, the production for NT48 is:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT6 NT42.\n\nWait, no, looking back: I don't see a production for NT48. Wait, in the provided grammar, let me check line by line.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the key lines are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT48 NT11\n- NT44 \u2192 NT42 NT13\n- NT12 \u2192 NT31 NT58\n- NT6 \u2192 NT52 NT49\n- NT38... Wait, let me go step by step.\n\nLooking through each NT rule, for example:\n\nNT48: I don't see a production for NT48 in the given lines. Wait, looking again, the lines are as follows (probably I didn't count correctly before). Let me list all NT rules properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused. The user provided a long list of grammar rules, each line starting with NT followed by some symbols. Let me list them:\n\n- NT48 -> ?\nWait, looking back: Let me list each production:\n\n1.
