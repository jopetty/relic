{"custom_id":"request-9","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t17\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This means that every production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or directly with a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Others, like NT5 \u2192 't39', directly produce terminal symbols. So, our goal is to see if we can derive \"t17\" by starting from the start symbol S and applying these production rules step by step.\n\nStarting with the string \"t17\", I need to see if there's a way to work backward to see if it can be formed by the given grammar. Alternatively, I can try to find a sequence of productions that lead from S to \"t17\". Since \"t17\" is a terminal, it must directly result from a production rule that ends a derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT17 \u2192 't80'. Hmm, wait, that's for NT17. But in our case, the string is \"t17\". Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces \"t17\". \n\nScanning through the rules, I notice NT1 has a rule: NT1 \u2192 't3'. Oh, that's not helpful. NT2 \u2192 't71'\u2014still not \"t17\". NT3 \u2192 't65' or 't7'\u2014wait, I see that NT7 \u2192 't44' and NT76 \u2192 't79'. But I don't see any production that directly produces \"t17\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"t17\" can be derived through multiple steps. Maybe there's a way to combine non-terminals that eventually produce \"t17\" as a terminal. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSince \"t17\" is a terminal, it must come from a production where a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal. Let's see which non-terminals have such productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 't39', NT56 \u2192 't62', NT15 \u2192 't40', NT47 \u2192 't84', etc. Hmm, not seeing \"t17\" yet. Wait, maybe through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the string \"t17\" is derived from a single production. Let me check if any of the productions end with \"t17\". Looking at the given rules, I don't see any production that directly produces \"t17\". All the terminals are unique and not \"t17\".\n\nWait a second, maybe through a series of non-terminals leading to \"t17\". Let me see. For example, if there's a production where a non-terminal X \u2192 Yt17 Z, but I don't see any such production in the given grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t17\" is derived by a chain of steps where intermediate non-terminals eventually produce \"t17\". Let me try to see if any non-terminal can eventually lead to \"t17\".\n\nLooking at the production NT77 \u2192 't47' and NT5 \u2192 't39', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe via NT17: NT17 \u2192 't80'. Wait, no, that's 't80' not 't17'.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a non-terminal that produces 't17' through another production. Let me check all non-terminals to see if any of their productions could lead to \"t17\".\n\nLooking through the end productions, not directly. The terminals are things like 't3', 't71', 't65', etc. So, I don't see any that produce \"t17\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"t17\" is part of a longer derivation. Let me consider the structure of how the string would be generated.\n\nStarting from S, which goes to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Suppose I take the first path, S \u2192 NT13 NT69. NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Then NT70 has a production NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 or NT70 \u2192 NT60 NT13. If I take NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 't44'. Wait, but that's not helping with \"t17\".\n\nAlternatively, starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT77. NT4 \u2192 't54', which gives us the first 't' in the string. But our string is \"t17\", not starting with another 't'.\n\nWait, maybe that's a dead end. Let me think differently. Perhaps \"t17\" is part of a longer string, and our task is to see if it's a substring. But I don't think so; the problem says the string may or may not be in the language, so it's not about substrings but the exact string.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the grammar allows for a production that combines two non-terminals into terminals in such a way that \"t17\" is produced. But looking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal is followed by another that directly produces a single terminal as 't17'.\n\nWait, let me consider if any non-terminals have productions that could lead to \"t17\". For example, maybe a rule like A \u2192 B t17 C, but in this grammar, I don't see that. All terminals are single characters, and they're part of direct productions.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps \"t17\" is not produced by any direct rule but is an intermediate step. However, since it's a terminal, the only way it can appear in the string is if a production rule directly produces it.\n\nWait, looking again, the terminal 't17' isn't listed anywhere. Let me check all the rules for any terminal being 't17':\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39' appears multiple times\n- NT17 \u2192 't80'\n- NT34 \u2192 't78' etc.\n\nNo, I don't see \"t17\" as a direct production. So, the only way \"t17\" can appear in the string is if there's a derivation where a non-terminal produces a terminal, and that terminal is t17. But since none of the non-terminals directly produce t17, the string \"t17\" cannot be derived from this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules again to be thorough.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n- NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29\n- NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n- NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n- NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n- NT60 \u2192 NT38 NT18\n- NT9 \u2192 NT31 NT45\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45\n- NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62\n- NT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3\n- NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\n- NT5 \u2192 NT83 NT9\n- NT21 \u2192 NT73 NT53\n- NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n- NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18\n- NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT58\n- NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT10 \u2192 NT68 NT58\n- NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21\n- NT12 \u2192 NT38 NT67\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80\n- NT53 \u2192 NT17 NT38\nAh, wait!

{"custom_id":"request-6","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string 't50' is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through the grammar to see how 't50' can be formed. I remember that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. So, to derive 't50', I need to find a production rule that eventually leads to 't50'.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that some symbols are directly represented by 't' followed by a number. For example, NT53 -> 't80' and NT34 -> 't78'. I'm specifically looking for 't50', so I should check if any non-terminal directly expands to 't50'.\n\nScanning through the productions, I notice that NT5 -> 't39' and NT77 -> 't47', but where is 't50'? Hmm, let me go through each rule one by one.\n\nLooking at NT61 -> 't17' and NT77 -> 't9', that's not it. Wait, I see NT51 -> 't34' and NT53 -> 't80' and 't9'. Still nothing. Oh, wait, there's NT67 -> 't6' and NT9 -> 't0', which are 't' symbols. Let me look for a rule that ends with 't50'.\n\nI spot NT62 -> 't71', but that's 't71'. Hmm. There's also a NT31 -> 't50'. Oh! Wait, that's exactly what I'm looking for. NT31 can directly produce 't50'.\n\nSo, does that mean that the string 't50' can be derived from NT31, which in turn needs to be derived from another non-terminal. Let me check if NT31 is a starting symbol. The start symbol is S, so I guess we have to see if S can derive to NT31 and then 't50'.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the starting symbol S has productions like S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. So, S is breaking down into two non-terminals. Let's see if any of these can lead to NT31.\n\nWait, if I have NT31 -> 't50', then I can get 't50' by S -> NT31 NT69, but wait, S's productions are S -> A B where each A and B are non-terminals, so unless A or B can produce 't50', which in this case, if one of them is NT31, then NT31 can produce 't50'.\n\nSo, for example, if S -> NT31 NT69, then the string would be 't50' followed by whatever NT69 produces. But in the string given, it's just 't50', so maybe NT69 must derive to the empty string or nothing. But looking at the grammar, the non-terminals seem to produce either another non-terminal or a terminal. There's no production for NT69 that directly leads to something besides other NTs or 't's.\n\nWait, checking NT69: according to the rules, NT69 -> NT23 NT6. So NT69 would expand to two non-terminals, which would then have to be expanded further. So S -> NT31 NT69 would lead to 't50' followed by whatever NT69 produces.\n\nBut the string we're testing is just 't50', which would mean that NT69 must derive to the empty string, but in this grammar, all non-terminals expand to exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. There's no empty production here. Therefore, if S -> NT31 NT69, then the string would be 't50' followed by something else, not just 't50'.\n\nWait, but maybe NT69 can derive to nothing? Looking at NT69, the rule is NT69 -> NT23 NT6. So both NT23 and NT6 must be expanded. NT23 -> NT73 NT41, and NT41 -> 't9'. So NT23 leads to 't9'. NT6 -> 't18'. Therefore, NT69 would expand to 't9' followed by 't18', which is 't9t18' or 't918' perhaps, but we don't have such a symbol. Wait, the actual string would be 't9t18', but we're testing for 't50', so unless NT23 and NT6 produce 't50', which they don't.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe S can derive to NT31 NT69, but if NT31 is the only one producing 't50', then S must be able to derive to 't50' plus whatever NT69 produces. But since the string is just 't50', this can't be unless NT69 produces something that isn't present here, which it does because NT69 leads to 't9t18'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way for S to produce 't50' without going through NT31. Let me look at other NTs that can produce 't50'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT62 -> 't71', which isn't 't50'. NT31 -> 't50' is the only one that directly produces 't50'. So unless there's another way, I don't think 't50' can be produced unless NT31 is involved.\n\nWait, unless S can go through another path to produce 't50'. Let me check the other productions starting from S.\n\nS can be split into S -> NT4 NT77. NT4 -> 't54' and NT77 -> 't47'. So S would go to 't54t47', which is not 't50'. Alternatively, S -> NT13 NT69. NT13 -> NT70 NT46, and NT69 -> NT23 NT6.\n\nNT70 has a production to NT76 NT7, but NT76 is NT76 -> NT79 NT7, and NT7 is 't44'. NT79 is NT79 -> NT5 NT62, NT62 -> 't71'. So NT76 would lead to NT79 (which leads to NT5 NT62, 't71'), and NT7 is 't44'. So that would give 't44t71' and so on. This is getting complicated, and I don't see how it would lead to 't50'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can derive to another NT that can produce 't50', but from the rules, only NT31 does that. So unless there's a way to have S split into NT31 and something else that doesn't contribute, but I don't see how that's possible because NT69 can't lead to nothing.\n\nWait, perhaps S can derive to NT31 and NT69, but if NT69 somehow derives to nothing, then 't50' would be the end. But in the grammar, every non-terminal must be expanded into something else. So there's no way for NT69 to derive to nothing, so that can't happen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT69 can be simplified in some way, but I don't see any epsilon productions here. Each rule has two non-terminals or a terminal and non-terminal, so you can't have the derivation stop before that.\n\nWait, maybe there's a rule I missed. Let me go through all the non-terminals to see if any expand to exactly one symbol that could lead to 't50'. From the rules, I only see NT31 as directly producing 't50'. So unless S can split into NT31 and something that doesn't contribute, which isn't possible because the other part would expand.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the string 't50' is not in the language, because to have it, S would have to split into NT31 and NT69, which would produce 't50' followed by something else, but the string is just 't50' alone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a left-most or right-most derivation that allows S to derive to 't50' without NT69, but I don't see that. Maybe there's a chain that leads to 't50' elsewhere, but from the productions, I only see NT31 as the direct source.\n\nWait, let me double-check the NT69 production. NT69 -> NT23 NT6. NT23 -> NT73 NT41. NT41 -> 't9'. NT6 -> 't18'. So NT69 would expand to 't9t18' or 't918'. So if S -> NT31 NT69, then the string would be 't50t918', but our test string is 't50', which is shorter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can derive"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t9 t7\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or even two terminals. Each production has exactly two symbols on the RHS. So, that's good because it means the parser can proceed in a straightforward manner, like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I don't need that here since it's a small string.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, there are several production rules, some of which produce terminals with 't' followed by a number. So, the leaves of this grammar are those 't' followed by numbers. For example, I see NT4 -> 't54', NT9 -> 't0', and so on.\n\nThe string I need to check is \"t9 t7\". Wait, each token is separated by a space, so that means the string is 't9' followed by 't7'. So, the string has two terminals, each being a single 't' followed by a digit. \n\nNow, in CNF, for a string of length n, the derivation will have n-1 productions. For our case, n=2, so one production is needed to split the string into two terminals. That means the initial symbol S must expand into something that can produce these two terminals in one step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, so the first production from S is either NT13 NT1 or NT4 NT77. So, S can expand into two non-terminals. Let's check if any of those can lead us to 't9' and 't7'.\n\nWait a second, no. The string we have is 't9' 't7'. So, each of these is a terminal, so to get two terminals in the string, each must come from their own production chain. Let's see:\n\nWe need to check if there's a way for S to produce NT1 (which is 't3') and NT1 again, but that's not it. Alternatively, S can go to NT4 NT77, so we need to see if NT4 can produce 't9' and NT77 can produce 't7'.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT4. Looking through the grammar, I see NT47-> 't34', and NT48-> 't48', but where is NT4? Oh, I don't see NT4 in the initial part. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me look through the given rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT4-> 't54' and NT49-> 't40', but I don't see NT4 as the LHS. So, maybe NT4 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I should look for other paths.\n\nWait, maybe S can produce NT13 NT1, where NT13 is a non-terminal that can produce something that eventually leads to 't9', and NT1 can produce something that leads to 't7'. Let me check NT13.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT13 -> NT70 NT46. So, both NT70 and NT46 are non-terminals. Then, NT70 can produce NT76 NT7, and NT7 can produce 't44'. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7, and NT7 -> 't44'. Hmm, but in our target, we need 't9' and 't7'. Let me think. Alternatively, NT13's production is NT70 NT46. NT70-> NT76 NT7, and NT76-> 't79'. That doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at NT4 directly. Does NT4 produce a terminal? Oh, here it is: NT4 is present only on the RHS of other productions. Wait, no. Wait, let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n- NT45->NT46 NT36\n- NT42->NT68 NT67\n- NT46->NT58 NT69\n- NT47->NT84\nWait, no, I'm looking for NT4 as a non-terminal in the LHS. Wait, no, the given rules don't seem to have any NT4 as the LHS. They only have NT4 as part of RHS. So, that's a problem because NT4 doesn't produce any terminal, so we can't get 't9' from NT4 because it's not part of any production as LHS. That leaves us with looking at S->NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, so for \"t9 t7\", let's check S->NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 can't produce 't9' directly because there's no production where NT4 is on the LHS and produces a terminal. So that path doesn't seem viable. Alternatively, does any other production lead to these terminals?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Let's consider each terminal in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, 't9' which is NT9 -> 't0', but wait, looking at the rules: NT9 has a production NT9->'t0', so yes, that's a terminal. So, NT9 can produce 't0'. But wait, our target is 't9', not 't0'. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the terminals. Let me double-check. The grammar has rules like NT9->'t0', which means that NT9 can produce the string 't0'. So, 't9' would require another production. Wait, perhaps NT9 is 't9' as well? But looking at the rules, I don't see any NT9 that produces 't9'. Only the RHS of NT9 is 't0'.\n\nWait, so perhaps the string is incorrect because none of the non-terminals in the grammar produce 't9' or 't7'.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the given rules again, I see NT32->'t11' and NT42->'t68', NT58->'t31', etc. So, some rules produce terminals like 't31' (NT58), but 't9' isn't a terminal here. Because in the original grammar, 't9' might not be a terminal but a non-terminal that's further broken down. Wait, no, in the given rules, the right-hand sides include strings like 't50', 't39', 't40', 't48', etc., but to get 't9', we'd need a production where a non-terminal directly produces it. But looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't9'.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the given grammar in a more manageable way.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, I see:\n\nFor NT5: NT5 has two productions:\nNT5 -> NT38 NT74 or NT5-> NT83 NT9\nSo, both of these are two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, looking elsewhere, I don't see any non-terminal that can produce 't9'. For example, looking for NT9, the productions are:\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45\nand perhaps others?\n\nWait, let me check NT9's productions in the given rules. Oh, looking through them:\n\nThere's indeed a rule NT9->NT46 NT62, but I don't see a direct production for NT9 producing a terminal like 't9'. Instead, NT9 is part of other RHS, so it's a non-terminal that's further broken down.\n\nWait, maybe I should trace back. Our target is to get 't9' and 't7'. Let's see if 't9' can be obtained. From the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that can directly produce 't9'. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, maybe I should see if 't9' comes from some derived production.\n\nWait, but 't9' is a single terminal, so in the grammar, it's part of the RHS of some production only as a terminal. So, for example, NT80->'t43', but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me go through each production rule to see which RHS contains 't9' or 't7'.\n\nLooking through each RHS:\n- NT5-> 't38' and 't9' for NT58? Wait, no, looking at NT58: NT58-> 't62'.\n- Wait, let's go through the RHS:\n\nLooking at all the RHS entries:\n\nNT5: 't38', 't74', or 't83' and 't9' (from NT5->NT83 NT9)\nWait, no, in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-19","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t3 t68` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. That should help in breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the start symbol, which I see is S. The productions for S are NT4 and NT69, so S -> NT4 NT69 or S -> NT47 NT69? Wait, looking back, the grammar has S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. So S can derive either of those two.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Oh yes, the first lines are S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. So S can be NT13 followed by NT69, or NT4 followed by NT77.\n\nNow the string we need to check is `t3 t68`. So each part of the string must be derived from some production. Since it's two tokens, it should be two productions applying. So each token must be derived from some non-terminal, and then those non-terminals must ultimately derive to these terms.\n\nLooking at the tokens, we have t3 and t68. I'll check where these terminals appear in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT1 -> t3. So if a non-terminal NT1 can produce t3, and NT46 can produce t58, but wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly go to terminals. For example, NT1 is 't3', NT4 is 't54', NT31 is 't50', NT36 is 't56', NT5 is 't39', NT39 might go to something else... Wait, actually, some rules have non-terminals. For example, NT58 -> NT61 NT3, which isn't helpful yet. But I'm looking for terminals.\n\nWait, the rules have NT42 -> 't68', which is one of the terms in the string. So the second token is t68, which is NT42. So if anywhere in the derivation, a non-terminal like NT42 must lead to 't68', that's a key point.\n\nNow, S can be NT4 and NT77. Let's take the first possibility: S -> NT4 NT77. Then, the string would need to be NT4 followed by NT77.\n\nWait, but the string is t3 t68. So can NT4 produce t3? Looking at the rules, NT1 becomes t3, but NT4 is a separate non-terminal. Oh, unless NT4 can derive to t3 somehow. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT4 directly producing t3, but maybe through other steps. Let me look for rules where NT4 is on the left side. For example, NT41 -> 't9', NT46 -> 't58', NT42 -> 't68', NT47 -> 't84', NT47 in S's productions isn't relevant here. So, NT4 itself is a non-terminal, and I don't see a production for NT4 that leads to a terminal immediately. So S -> NT4 might not help us get t3, because NT4 doesn't seem to produce t3 directly.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the other S production: S -> NT13 NT69. So NT13 and NT69 would need to produce t3 and t68, respectively.\n\nLooking at NT13: It has rules like NT13 -> NT70 NT46, NT13 -> NT32 NT21, etc. Not immediately helpful. Let me see if any of these can lead to t3.\n\nWait, NT32 -> t11, which is a terminal. So if NT32 can produce t11, but then we also need to get to t3. Hmm, not directly. Alternatively, maybe NT13 can produce t3 elsewhere.\n\nWait, I see a rule NT61 -> t62, and NT56 -> t31. Also, NT34 -> t78 or t9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT3 directly, which is a non-terminal that can produce t65 and also have other productions. Wait, NT3 is 't65' in some cases, which doesn't help. Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the rules,NT3 -> ... some other NTs, not a terminal. Wait, let me scan through the rules again. For example:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT34 -> 't9', which is a terminal. So maybe some non-terminals can reach t3.\n\nWait, let's think differently. For the string to be t3 t68, we need to have a derivation where on the left side (first part) we derive t3, and on the right side (second part) t68.\n\nWe need to check if t3 can be derived. Looking at the terminals, I see NT1 is 't3', so we can directly have a production that produces t3. So if a non-terminal NT1 is present, it can produce t3.\n\nSimilarly, t68 comes from NT42, as NT42 is 't68'.\n\nSo the question is whether the grammar allows S to derive NT3 NT42, which would produce t3 t68.\n\nNow, let's see if S can be split into NT3 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the S rules: S can be NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So we need a way for S to produce NT3 NT42.\n\nBut currently, S's productions don't directly lead to NT3 or NT42. So perhaps there must be some intermediate steps.\n\nLet me track down how to get from S to NT3 and NT42.\n\nIf I can find a way for S to produce NT3 and another non-terminal, which then produces NT42. Alternatively, perhaps the two parts of the string are derived from the two parts of an S production.\n\nWait, perhaps S can go S -> NT4 NT77. Then, maybe NT4 can go through some steps to produce something, and NT77 can go through others.\n\nWait, NT4 itself is a non-terminal. If there's a rule where NT4 can produce something else, perhaps through two steps.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT4 -> 't54', which is a terminal. So if NT4 can produce t54 directly, but we need t68, which comes from NT42.\n\nSo perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe S -> NT13 NT69, and if NT13 can eventually produce t3, then NT69 must produce t68.\n\nSo let's see: NT69's productions are NT23 NT6, and NT67 NT4, etc. Let me check NT69. It can go to NT23 NT6 or NT67 NT4.\n\nLooking at NT23: It can be NT73 NT53 or some other rules. NT73 is 't9'.\n\nWait, NT73 is a rule that's 't9', and NT53 has multiple rules. Wait, NT53 -> 't80' or 't9', so NT53 can also produce 't9'.\n\nSo if NT23 can lead to t9 or something else. Wait, if NT23 -> 't73', but that's a terminal 't73' which isn't the case. Wait, looking back, I think earlier I might have listed some rules wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT73 NT53\n\nNT53 -> 't80' or 't9'\n\nSo, if NT23 can produce NT73 and NT53, which are then terminals if NT73 is 't9' and NT53 can be 't9' or 't80', but wait, looking back.\n\nWait, in the initial rules, it's written as:\n\nNT53 -> 't80' or 't9'\n\nSo for NT53, possible terminals are 't80' or 't9'. So, if NT23 can produce 't9' via NT53 -> 't9', then that would be possible.\n\nWait, but NT23 is 't73'? Or is that a production rule? Wait, looking back:\n\nI think I misread the NT53 rules earlier. Let me check again.\n\nFrom the initial rules, the relevant parts are:\n\nNT53 -> 't80' or 't9'\n\nAnd also NT73 -> 't9'\n\nSo, moving back.\n\nIf S -> NT13 NT69, then perhaps NT13 can produce t3, and NT69 can produce t68 via some other chain.\n\nSo for NT13, it can produce NT70 NT46, or several other combinations. Let's see if any of those can lead to t3.\n\nLooking at NT70"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, three steps. Let's consider that the string must be produced by a series of productions starting from S.\n\nBut another approach is to check if each symbol in the string can be part of a larger derivation. Starting from S:\n\nS can go to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nEach of these are non-terminals, so each must be expanded into terminals.\n\nLet me consider S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54' directly, so that works for the last symbol.

No, that's not matching. Wait, NT53 \u2192 't48'? Let me check the productions. NT53 \u2192 NT17 NT38 or NT80 NT69. Neither of these directly give me 't28'.

Hmm, still not t28.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to see if the entire string can be generated step by step.\n\nLet's say the string is t50 t28 t54.\n\nWe know that t54 is produced directly by NT4. So the last part comes from NT4. So in the derivation, the last symbol is produced by NT4 \u2192 t54.\n\nSo the last step would be something like ... \u2192 NT4 \u2192 t54.\n\nBefore that, the second symbol is t28, which would come from NT28, but looking at the productions, there's no NT28. Wait, maybe it's from a production that leads to t28.\n\nWait, maybe t28 comes from NT47 \u2192 't47' or 't34'? Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT47 \u2192 't47' and NT77 \u2192 't34'. So, 't28' isn't directly produced. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second symbol is part of a chain. For example, if we have NT72 \u2192 't28', but there's no such production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's produced via NT12 \u2192 't81' or something else, but that's not t28.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see: NT11 is produced by NT26 \u2192 't42' or something? Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is t50 (from NT31), then t28, and then t54 (from NT4).\n\nBut how do these connect?\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't50' (so that's good for the first symbol).\n- What's NT31's other option? It could go to NT61 \u2192 't62' or something else, but not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second symbol is part of another NT that leads to t28, but I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces t28.\n\nWait, perhaps t28 comes from NT53 \u2192 't48' or 't80', but that's t48 or t80, not t28.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68, and NT42 \u2192 't60'... Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe the string isn't possible. Let me try another approach.

Let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT7 \u2192 NT56 NT9. So NT7 can be expanded as NT56 NT9.\n\nThen NT56 \u2192 't62' or 't31'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going too deep. Alternatively, let's see if the string can be built by following the productions.\n\nAnother approach: check each symbol in the string against all possible NT.\n\n1. t50: must come from NT31 \u2192 't50'.\n\n2. t28: must come from some NT that produces it, but looking through the productions, there's no NT that directly produces t28. So unless there's a longer path, this might not be possible.\n\n3. t54: comes from NT4 \u2192 't54'.\n\nSo, the string starts with t50, which comes from NT31, and ends with t54, which comes from NT4.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules that start with non-terminals (like S, NT13, etc.) and expand into other non-terminals or terminals ('t' followed by a number). My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string in question is `t79 t47 t17`. Since this is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, I need to check if each terminal appears in the correct order in the derivation.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules for each terminal:\n\n1. `t79` appears in the production rule `NT76 -> t79`. So, to get `t79`, the non-terminal before it must be NT76.\n\n2. `t47` appears in two places:\n   - NT77 -> t47\n   - NT77 -> t72\n   So, `t47` can come from NT77 or NT77 again, which might be a bit confusing. Wait, actually, looking back, in the provided grammar, the line `NT77 -> 't47'` is correct. So, `t47` is an alternative for NT77.\n\n3. `t17` is in the production `NT17 -> 't80'`? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, under 'NT17', I see `NT17 -> 't80'`. Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT17, it's `NT17 -> 't80'`? Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at line: `NT17 -> 't80'`. Hmm, but the string has `t17` but in the grammar, NT17 always goes to 't80', so 't17' is only in another rule:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see lines like `NT47 -> 't84'`, but in the string, it's `t47`. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread. Looking again, the grammar lines:\n\nWait, I see that under `NT17`, the rule is `NT17 -> 't80'`, so 't17' doesn't come from NT17. Instead, looking for `t17` elsewhere, I notice that under `NT17`, it's `t80`. Wait, perhaps another place has `t17`?\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nYes, the line `NT23 -> 't9'`, but that's 't9', not 't17'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me go through each production again to find where `t17` comes from.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT67 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT34 -> 't9' (twice)\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT74 -> 't47'\n- NT32 -> 't24'\n- NT61 -> 't62'\n- NT26 -> 't42'\n- NT15 -> 't40'\n- NT32 -> 't24' (duplicate)\n- NT42 -> 't60'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT61 -> 't17' (Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.)\n\nYes, under NT61: `NT61 -> 't17'`, so `t17` is an option for NT61. But in the grammar as provided, is that correct? Let me check the line:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I do see:\n\n\"NT61 -> 't17' NT47\"\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me find it. Looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking, I see:\n\n\"NT61 -> t62\"\n\"NT74 -> t47\"\n\"NT61 -> t17\"\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n\"NT26 -> t42\"\n\n\"NT15 -> t40\"\n\n\"NT32 -> t24\"\n\n\"NT61 -> t62\"\n\n\"NT61 -> t17\"\n\nYes, under NT61: `NT61 -> 't17'`, and another production `NT61 -> 't62'`. So, `t17` is an option for NT61.\n\nBut in the string, the last part is `t17`, so it must come from NT61.\n\nSo, now, compiling the required non-terminals in the string: `t79` comes from NT76, `t47` comes from NT77, and `t17` comes from NT61.\n\nSo now, I need to find a way to connect these through the grammar.\n\nLet's think about the structure of the string. The string is three terminals: t79, t47, t17.\n\nIn the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two options: S -> NT13 NT13? No, looking back, S is defined as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT13? Wait, no, S is defined as:\n\n\"First, the grammar: S -> NT13 NT13? Or is it S->NT13 NT13? Wait, looking at the provided lines, S is defined as:\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n\"S -> NT13 NT13 NT13\"\n\nWait no, let me check. The user provided multiple lines. Let's find the lines starting with S:\n\nThe provided lines include:\n\n\"S -> NT13 NT13\"\n\"S -> NT4 NT77\"\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT13 NT13 NT13\"\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user provided:\n\n\"S -> NT13 NT13\"\n\n\"S -> NT4 NT77\"\n\nSo, S has two productions: goes to NT13 twice, or NT4 and NT77.\n\nSo, for the string `t79 t47 t17`, let me see how it can be derived.\n\nFirst, S can go to NT13 NT13. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's three terminals. So the derivation should result in three steps, or maybe more, depending on the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, S could go to NT4 NT77, but let me see:\n\nIf S -> NT4 NT77, then we need to derive t79 t47 t17 as the result. Let's see.\n\nNT4 -> 't54', which is a terminal, so that can't give us t79 or t47.\n\nThus, using S -> NT4 NT77, it would start with t54, which is not part of our string. So that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is S -> NT13 NT13.\n\nSo the first step is S -> NT13 NT13.\n\nNow, we need to derive t79 t47 t17 from NT13 NT13.\n\nWait, but NT13 NT13 can be split into two NT13s. Let's see what NT13 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT13: `NT13 -> NT70 NT46` and `NT13 -> NT76 NT7` (wait, no, let me check: the user wrote:\n\n\"NT13 -> NT70 NT46\nNT13 -> NT76 NT7\"\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the lines are:\n\n\"NT13 -> NT70 NT46\"\n\nand \n\n\"NT13 -> NT76 NT7\"\n\nWait, no, looking back: the user listed \"NT13 -> NT70 NT46\" and \"NT13 -> NT76 NT7\"\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nIn the provided grammar list, under NT13, it's:\n\n\"NT13 -> NT70 NT46\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT13 -> NT76 NT7\"\n\nSo, each NT13 can go to NT70 NT46 or NT76 NT7.\n\nBut our string has three terminals, so let's see how this works.\n\nIf we have two NT13s: each can produce two terms, leading to possibly four.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has specific rules that each production is either a single terminal or exactly two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has productions that are either terminals (a), or two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the string `t24 t79 t29 t42`, each token is a terminal. The task is to see if these terminals can be derived through the production rules. \n\nI think the best approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol S by decomposing each step. \n\nStarting with S, it can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. \n\nLet's break down the string into its parts: t24 t79 t29 t42. \n\nI'll try to work backward, seeing if each terminal can be a result of a production. \n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that NT42 is connected to NT42 \u2192 t68. Wait, let me check the grammar. \n\nActually, in the grammar provided, NT46 \u2192 t58 is one of the rules, but looking through the productions, I don't immediately see NT42 \u2192 anything. Let me check the given productions again.\n\nWait, under NT80, there's a rule NT80 \u2192 t43. But that's for NT80. Looking through the productions, does any non-terminal lead to t24? \n\nLooking through the list, I see NT32 \u2192 t24. So that means NT32 can produce t24. But how do I get t24 in the string? The fourth token is t42. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. \n\nWait, no, the string is `t24 t79 t29 t42`. So t24 is the first token. So how do we get t24? Well, NT32 produces t24, but wait, does any production lead to NT32?\n\nLooking through the productions: \n\nNT32 \u2192 t11 (from NT32 -> t11), but that's a production. But wait, t11 isn't in our string. Hmm, maybe I need to see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is in the correct form and each token is the result of a production.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the parse tree. The string has four terminals. So the parse tree would have four leaves. \n\nLet me see. Starting with S, which can expand into two non-terminals. Let's consider the string as a series of terminals. \n\nBut looking at the grammar, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each non-terminal in the production must further expand. \n\nLet me see: the string is four tokens long. So starting from S, which is two non-terminals. Let's say S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Then both NT13 and NT69 need to expand to produce more non-terminals, but we end up with terminals. \n\nSo, for example, starting with NT13: NT13 -> NT70 NT46. Then each of those needs to expand. \n\nNT70 can expand \u2192 NT76 NT7. NT76 is a non-terminal \u2192 NT79. NT7 is a non-terminal, which in the grammar is NT7 \u2192 t44. Wait, but in the grammar, NT7 points to t44? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, look for NT7: \n\nYes, one of the productions is NT7 \u2192 t44. But in our string, we have t79 and t29, which I don't see being derived directly from NT7 or NT76.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I'm missing the NT24 production. Wait, looking at the grammar, do we have any NT24? Or is it a terminal?\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT24 as a non-terminal, so NT24 must be a terminal. Similarly, NT29 is not a non-terminal, so must be a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, are these all non-terminals? Let me see.\n\nWait, in the grammar, all the productions on the left are non-terminals, and the right side is either terminals or non-terminals. So for example, S is a non-terminal and can produce NT13 NT69, which are non-terminals. So the leaves are terminals.\n\nTherefore, in the string, each token is a terminal, which must be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. So I need to check if each token in the string can be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the tokens: t24, t79, t29, t42.\n\nIs t24 produced by any non-terminal? Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce t24. Looking through the productions, there is a rule NT13 \u2192 t11. But t24 isn't there. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each production and see if any of the non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree for the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNow, NT13 must derive into t24 and something else, and NT69 must derive into something else and t42. Or maybe another combination.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by trying to match the string from left to right, using the productions.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see which non-terminals can produce each of these terminals.\n\nLooking at t24: Do any non-terminals produce t24? I see that NT32 \u2192 t11, and NT24 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Wait, but in the list, is there any non-terminal that can produce t24? Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides only have terminals (like t7, t39, etc.) and combinations of non-terminals. So t24 is a terminal. To produce t24, which non-terminal can do that?\n\nWait, looking at the list again, I notice that NT24 appears on the right-hand side: look at this production: NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62. No, that's using NT9. Wait, no, the production for NT9 is NT9 \u2192 t46 and t62? No, let me check again.\n\nWait, the production for NT9 is: NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80. But I don't see any terminal t9. Wait, no, in the grammar, the productions for NT9 include t9. Let me check:\n\nYes, there's a production for NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80 and NT9 \u2192 t46 NT80. Wait no, wait looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> NT46 NT80\n\nNT9 -> NT46 NT80\n\nBut wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, I think I might have missed the one where NT9 produces a terminal.\n\nWait, from the list:\n\nYes, in the list, there is:\n\nNT9 -> t46 NT80\n\nAnd another:\n\nNT9 -> NT46 t80 (Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe grammar list shows:\n\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nNT9 -> NT46 NT62\n\nAnd:\n\nNT9 -> t46 NT80\n\nWait, no, I'm confused.

{"custom_id":"request-40","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the string `t85 t18 t23 t11` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided with production rules, and I have to apply these rules step by step to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69 | NT4 NT77\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT13, NT69, NT4, NT77) has their own productions. My goal is to work backward from the string, trying to see if each symbol in the string can be matched against any terminal productions or if they can be expanded into more symbols that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nThe string to check is `t85 t18 t23 t11`. Each of these is a terminal symbol, so I need to see how they can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the production rules for each symbol in the string:\n\n- `t85`: Looking through the rules, I see that `NT34 -> 't78'` and `NT46 -> 't58'`, but `t85` isn't directly produced. Wait, let me scan the rules. Hmm, I don't see any production that results in `t85` directly. Maybe it's produced indirectly? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals expand into 't's. For example, NT42 -> 't68', but `t85` isn't a terminal in any production. Wait, checking NT23's production: NT23 -> NT73 NT41. NT73 is 't9' and NT41 is 't9'. So NT23 \u2192 t9 t9, which is `t9 t9`, not `t85`. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check NT85. Oh, wait, there's no NT85 in the productions, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see that `t85` isn't listed as a terminal; maybe it's a non-terminal that expands into 't85'. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any NT that expands into 't85'. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps `t85` is from NT34 somehow? Let me check NT34's production: NT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47. NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18, and NT47 \u2192 NT84. NT84 is 't50'? Wait, no, looking at NT47's production: NT47 \u2192 NT84. And NT84 is 't50' according to the rules: NT83 \u2192 't7', NT84 \u2192 't50'. Wait, no, looking for NT47, which is 't84'? No, I think I need to double-check.\n\nWait, let's look for the production rules carefully:\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT47 -> NT50, wait no, let me check again.\n\nWait, let me find where 't84' comes from. The rule is NT47 -> 't84'?\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT47 -> NT50\nWait no, the rules are in the chain. Let me find it:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT53 -> 't48', but not t84. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminal symbols:\n\nThe string has `t85`, `t18`, `t23`, `t11`.\n\nIn the production rules, I see that some terminals are generated by NTs:\n\n- NT36 -> 't56'\n- NT58 -> 't62'\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT67 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT74 -> 't47'\n- NT32 -> 't11'\n- NT26 -> 't42'\n- NT15 -> 't40'\n- NT32 -> 't24'\n- NT42 -> 't60'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT61 -> 't17'\n- NT78 -> 't72'\n- NT38 -> 't29'\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n- NT7 -> 't44'\n- NT56 -> 't62'\n- NT16 -> 't28'\n- NT38 -> 't29'\n- NT33 -> 't85'\n- Also, NT13 is 't85'?\n\nWait, no. Let me look for each terminal symbol:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT33 \u2192 NT85, so NT33 \u2192 't85'. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, in the production rules, NT33 -> 't85' is present.\n\nSo, 't85' comes from NT33 \u2192 't85'.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is t85, which is derived from NT33.\n\nNext, t18. Looking for 't18' in the terminals, NT6 \u2192 't18' is present. So 't18' is from NT6.\n\nThen, t23. Let me see, 't23' is not a terminal directly. Looking through the rules, perhaps NT23 is NT73 NT41, both are non-terminals. NT73 is 't9', so NT23 \u2192 t9 t9, but that's `t9 t9`, not `t23`. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up symbols.\n\nWait, t23 is a terminal? Let me check the rules again. I don't see any NT that produces 't23' directly. So perhaps it's part of a larger expansion. Alternatively, maybe 't23' is from NT23, which is a non-terminal, so we can't directly derive it. Therefore, it's possible that the string is invalid unless there's a path to produce it.\n\nWait, but in the string, the third symbol is 't23', which would need to come from a non-terminal that expands into 't23'. But looking at the rules, I don't see any NT that produces 't23' directly. The closest is NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41. Let's see what those expand into.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT73 -> 't9' (per the rule NT73 -> 't9'), because I see NT73 is 't9'.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me look again: I see NT73 is 't9'? Let me confirm.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT73 -> 't9' no. Wait, no, looking again: The rules state NT73 -> 't9' is not present. Wait, let's double-check all the rules to find NT73's production.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT78 -> 't72' and NT38 -> 't29', but nothing for NT73. Wait, checking the provided rules:\n\nUnder NT73: NT73 -> NT9. But wait, according to the rules:\n\nLet me list all rule lines:\n\nLooking for NT73. I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT73 NT41\n\nAnd under NT73's production: not directly specified except in the line given in the rules.\n\nWait, checking all the lines, I don't see NT73 being defined as a production. Wait, let me scan the list again.\n\nThe full list of production rules is:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69 | NT4 NT77\n\nNT47 -> NT50\nWait, no, I think I should check each production properly.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each line carefully to find where NT23 might be defined.\n\nWait, looking at the provided production rules, I see:\n\n- NT47 -> NT50\nWait, that's not correct. Let me list them properly:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT69\n2. S -> NT4 NT77\n3. NT47 -> NT66 NT29\n4. NT45 -> NT46 NT36\n5. NT18 -> NT49 NT80\n6. NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n7. NT69 -> NT23 NT6\n8.

{"custom_id":"request-49","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to determine whether the string `t58 t7 t85 t34 t44` is generated by the given context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It consists of non-terminals (like S, NT13, NT4, etc.) and terminals (like 't58', 't7', etc.). The start symbol is S, which produces other non-terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the given string: `t58 t7 t85 t34 t44`. Each word is a terminal, so I'll need to find a sequence of productions that lead from the start symbol S down to these terminals, possibly with some non-terminals in between that I can replace.\n\nStarting from S, I see two initial productions: S -> NT13 NT13 or S -> NT4 NT77. Wait, no, looking back, the first two options are S -> NT13 NT13? Wait, no, the user provided the grammar as S -> NT13 NT69, etc. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the user listed the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n...\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce NT13 followed by NT69 or NT4 followed by NT77. Since the string we're evaluating has five terminals, the derivation will involve multiple steps where non-terminals are replaced.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the string from left to right, assigning each terminal to a corresponding part of the production. Let's see the string is `t58 t7 t85 t34 t44`. So, it's five terminals. That means the derivation will probably involve splitting into smaller parts, perhaps through intermediate non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the first production of S: S -> NT13 NT69. If I assume that, then NT13 could produce parts of the string starting with 't58'. Alternatively, S -> NT4 NT77 could be another starting point. Let's first explore the S -> NT13 NT69 path.\n\nNow, looking at NT13's productions:\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\nNT13 -> NT69 NT46\nNT13 -> NT32 NT21\nNT13 -> NT12 NT68\nNT13 -> NT1 -> 't3'\nWait, one of the productions for NT13 is NT13-> 't3'. So, from NT13, we can derive the terminal 't3'. But in our string, the first terminal is 't58', which is not 't3'. So maybe that path isn't the right one. Alternatively, perhaps NT13 can be split into more non-terminals.\n\nAnother option: Let's look at the production NT13->NT70 NT46. NT70 can produce NT76 NT7. Hmm, but the string starts with 't58', which is a terminal. Let me see if any NT can produce 't58'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I spot NT56 has a production NT56 -> 't42' and another production NT56 -> 't42' again. Wait, let me check all NT productions looking for 't58':\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT74 -> 't47'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT78 -> 't72'\n- NT58 -> 't7' (Wait, no, looking again, the user wrote 't7'), but actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\nLooking for 't58' as a terminal.

The string to evaluate is `t9 t17 t43 t81 t80`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like and how it produces the strings. CNF means that each production is either a terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols. The start symbol is S, and the productions are given as S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. CNF is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain analyses. Each production has either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see what terminals and non-terminals are present. Terminals are terms like 't3', 't50', etc. Non-terminals are the NTs like S, NT4, NT13, and so on.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT13 NT69. So, the derivation must start from S.\n\nThe string given is `t3 t65 t80 t9 t17 t28`. Since it's a space-separated string, let's map each token to a terminal. So the string is six tokens: [t3, t65, t80, t9, t17, t28].\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nLet's look at the possible derivations:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nSo the first two symbols must be produced by NT13 and NT69.\n\nLet's see what NT13 can produce.

So is NT7 a terminal or a non-terminal?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the grammar has entries likent5 -> 't39'. So 't's are terminals, others are NTs.\n\nLooking at NT7: It's not a left-hand side in any production, so it must be a terminal. So NT7 is equivalent to 't7'.\n\nSimilarly, let's continue.\n\nSo, for NT70:\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\n\nThen,\n\nNT76 -> NT79 NT7\n\nSo NT79 is a terminal, right?

Let me write each step.\n\nStarting from NT13:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nNow, expand NT70: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n\nSo now, the sequence is NT76 NT7 NT46.\n\nNext, expand NT76: NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7\n\nSo the sequence becomes: NT79 NT7 NT7 NT46.\n\nNow, NT79 is a terminal 't79'.\n\nSo now, the sequence is [t79, t7, t7, NT46].\n\nNext, expand NT46. Looking for NT46's production.\n\nNT46 \u2192 't58'\n\nSo NT46 is a terminal 't58'. So the string now is [t79, t7, t7, t58].\n\nHmm. But our target string is [t3, t65, t80, t9, t17, t28]. So the first part is t79, t7, t7, t58. But our target starts with t3, so this path doesn't align. Maybe I took the wrong path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me check.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nI assumed NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, so let's try expanding NT13.\n\nBut wait, NT13 could have other productions.

The grammar's first line under NT13 is only that.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nThe grammar as provided has several entries, perhaps it's better to list all the productions of NT13.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nI see NT13 -> NT70 NT46, and also NT70: various expansions.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar as provided, it's likely that NT13 has only one production: NT13 --> NT70 NT46.\n\nSo, NT13 must expand to NT70 and NT46.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT13 NT69 \u2192 (NT70 NT46) (something)\n\nNow, NT69 production. Looking for NT69:\n\nNT69 can be -> NT23 NT6 or -> NT67 NT4.\n\nSo NT69 can expand in two ways.\n\nLet's take NT69 -> NT23 NT6.\n\nSo now, the string becomes [NT70, NT46, NT23, NT6].\n\nNow, let's expand each of these.\n\nFirst, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7.\n\nThen, NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7.\n\nAnd NT7 \u2192 't7'.\n\nSo NT70 becomes t79 t7.\n\nNext, NT46 is a terminal 't58'.\n\nThen, NT23.\n\nLooking up NT23's productions: NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41.\n\nSo NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41.\n\nExpanding NT73 \u2192 NT9 NT.\n\nLooking for NT73's productions: looking at the grammar.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT73 -> 't9'.

So this path doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, let's try the other possibility for NT69: NT69 -> NT67 NT4.\n\nSo then, S \u2192 NT13 NT69 \u2192 (NT70 NT46) (NT67 NT4).\n\nNow, let's expand each part.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 \u2192 NT79 NT7 NT7.\n\nSo [t79, t7, t7] for NT70.\n\nNT46 is a terminal 't58'.\n\nNT67's production: looking for NT67.\n\nNT67 can produce NT6 NT18 or 't6' (I need to check).\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT67 appears in the productions: NT67 -> 't6' \u2192 so NT67 is a terminal 't6'.\n\nBut wait, is that correct?

{"custom_id":"request-72","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t81 t0 t9 t17 t62 t79`. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way of structuring grammar rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol isn't allowed to produce empty strings, and each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. This is important because it has implications on how strings are generated and parsed.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, all rules are either two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT13 NT13?) Wait, no, looking again, some are S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which are two non-terminals, and others like NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT9, which are two non-terminals as well. Except for some, like NT56 \u2192 't18', which is a terminal. So that follows the CNF structure.\n\nThe task is to see if the string `t81 t0 t9 t17 t62 t79` can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. Since the string is made up of terminals, the derivation path must expand the start symbol into a sequence of productions leading to these terminals.\n\nI'll approach this by considering the structure of the grammar and seeing if each terminal in the string can be reached starting from S. \n\nFirst, let's break down the string into individual terminals: t81, t0, t9, t17, t62, t79.\n\nNow, looking for production rules that produce these terminals. For example, looking at the rules, I notice NT77 \u2192 't47', NT77 \u2192 't34', and NT47 \u2192 't84'. So these terminals can be produced directly from certain non-terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, t81 is present. Looking through the rules, there's a production NT21 \u2192 't73' and NT23 \u2192 't9', among others. Wait, I don't see a direct production for NT53 \u2192 't80', but looking carefully, I see NT53 \u2192 't80', but that doesn't seem to help for t81. Let me check the rules again for any NT that produce t81. Oh wait, there's no production rule that outputs 't81' directly. Hmm, that's a problem because if the string has t81, but the grammar doesn't have any rule that produces t81, then the string can't be generated. But let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I don't immediately see 't81' as a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let's scan again. Hmm, okay, the rules for non-terminals lead to specific terminals. I don't see 't81' as a terminal in any rule. So that implies that the string can't be generated because t81 is not a terminal that any production can output.\n\nWait, let me make sure I don't miss anything. Let me look through all the production rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT31 \u2192 't50'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT49 \u2192 't40'\n- NT53 \u2192 't48'\n- NT67 \u2192 't6'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT42 \u2192 't68'\n- NT12 \u2192 't81'\n- Wait! Yes, in the rules, I see that NT12 \u2192 't81'. That's correct. So the production exists. So t81 can be generated by NT12. But let me verify that.\n\nYes, looking at the rules, there's NT12 \u2192 't81' and NT12 \u2192 't68'. So NT12 can produce both 't81' and 't68'. Therefore, 't81' is a terminal that NT12 can produce.\n\nSo the first symbol is t81, which is generated by NT12. Now, we need to see if NT12 can be derived from S, perhaps through some intermediate steps.\n\nSince S starts as NT1 (as per the two options: S \u2192 NT13 NT13?) Wait, no, the grammar seems to start with S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So S can produce two non-terminals. Let's see.\n\nBut S is the start symbol, so S \u2192 either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So any derivation starts with S first expanding into one of these two.\n\nSo, to get t81, we need to see if in one of these productions, one of the non-terminals can lead to t81. Let's consider each case.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Then NT13 could produce something that eventually leads to t81, but in the string, the first symbol is t81. So let's see if there's a path where NT13 can produce t81, but looking at the production rules, the only way to get t81 is via NT12. So perhaps NT13 can produce NT12, which then produces 't81'. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT13's productions. The rules for NT13 are:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n- NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21 (Wait, earlier I thought it was NT32, but let me confirm. Oh, no, I see in the rules, NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21.\n\nSo, from NT13, we can go to NT32 NT21. Then, each of those can be broken down further. Let's explore that.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT42 NT68 (from NT32 \u2192 NT42 NT68)\nNT42 \u2192 NT61 NT36 or NT42 \u2192 NT68 (from earlier rules).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Maybe building the parse tree from the start and seeing if the string is a substring of the derived string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is part of a longer string, so maybe the entire string is a valid derivation. But in any case, the string provided is only six symbols long, all terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to work backwards. Let's see the structure of the string:\n\nt81 t0 t9 t17 t62 t79\n\nSo, each of these is a terminal. For each, I need to see how they can be produced by the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from the first symbol, t81 comes from NT12. So in the parse tree, the first production would be something leading to NT12.\n\nLooking back, NT12 is produced by S's productions? Wait, S only directly produces NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So S cannot directly produce NT12. But wait, when S \u2192 NT13 NT69, the NT13 can potentially produce a pathway to NT12, and NT69 can produce another pathway.\n\nWait, no. The start symbol S can only directly expand into NT13 and NT69. So for the string to start with t81, which is from NT12, either NT13 or NT69 must be able to produce NT12 through some other productions. Let's check each.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So S would produce something like NT13's expansion followed by NT69's expansion. The first symbol t81 is from NT12, but that would require either NT13 or NT69 to be NT12, which they are not. So this path might not be possible unless through combining productions.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the second option: S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Here, NT77 can produce t47, t34, or t7 (looking at its rules: NT77 \u2192 't47', NT77 \u2192 't34', NT77 \u2192 't3').\n\nWait, in the second option, NT4 and NT77 are produced. NT4's rules are NT4 \u2192 't54', and NT4 \u2192 't5' (from the rules). Wait, looking back, I see there's a rule NT14's rule: No, wait, looking at the grammar, the rules for NT4 are:\n\nLooking back, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check the rules again.\n\nFrom the rules provided:\n\nLooking through, I see NT4's productions:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nNT4:\nNT4 \u2192 't54', no? Or perhaps looking again, I think I may have miswritten earlier. Looking carefully, I think in the provided rules, there's a production for NT4: NT46 \u2192 't58', but no direct NT4. Wait, let me look line by line.\n\nLooking at the production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me re-examine the options for S.\n\nThe start symbol S can derive either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nThe string starts with t34, which comes from NT77 \u2192 t34 NT3. So perhaps the correct production is S \u2192 NT4 NT77, and then NT77 produces t34, followed by NT3, which might produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the first part is NT4, which is a terminal (t54), but our string starts with t34, which is not t54. So this would mean that the production S \u2192 NT4 NT77 cannot generate the string starting with t34, because NT4 is t54, so S \u2192 NT4 would produce t54 as the first symbol, which doesn't match the given string.\n\nTherefore, the only option left is S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo S produces NT13 and NT69. The first token in the string is t34, which comes from NT77 \u2192 t34 and NT3.\n\nWait, but NT13 is producing NT70 and NT46, both non-terminals, which then we need to see how they can produce the rest of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that after NT13 and NT69, perhaps NT69 can produce t68. Let me check NT69's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nSo NT69 can produce NT23 and NT6.

So, I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t62 t85 t44 t62 t60 t58 t23` is generated by it. Okay, first, I should understand the grammar structure and the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's all in CNF, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production either expands a non-terminal into two others or into a single terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first step is to see what S can produce. From S, it can go to NT13 NT1 or NT4 NT77. So, any string generated by this grammar must have two parts derived from these options.\n\nGiven the input string is `t62 t85 t44 t62 t60 t58 t23`, which has seven tokens. Since each production except the terminals either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the structure must correspond to a derivation where each non-terminal splits into two, leading to a binary tree structure. \n\nThe number of symbols in the string must match the Catalan number for the number of steps. For a string with n symbols, it must be derived in n-2 steps if all are non-terminals. Wait, but in this case, we have both terminals and non-terminals, so the string must be built by expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nCounting the terminals in the string: t62, t85, t44, t62, t60, t58, t23. That's seven terminals. So, the derivation must have a structure that, when all non-terminals are expanded, results in seven terminals. Since each production either increases the count by one (if it's a terminal) or by one (if it's a non-terminal that splits into two), the number of steps would be such that the number of non-terminals in the initial step should lead to these terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to approach this from the top-down. Starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLooking at the first production of S: NT13 NT1 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me try the first option: NT13 and NT1.\n\nNow, the first symbol in the string is t62. So, let's see if any non-terminal can produce t62.\n\nLooking through the productions, many non-terminals end with 'tX', so I need to find which ones produce t62. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't71' (Wait, no, NT62 is defined as NT62 \u2192 't71' no, actually looking back, I think I misread earlier.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided rules, most of them expand non-terminals until they hit terminals. So, each step in the derivation reduces the length of the string by one.\n\nThe string in question has eight tokens: t47, t44, t80, t0, t7, t40, t71, t47. Since each terminal is a single character apart from the number (like 't80'), each token corresponds to a single non-terminal in the grammar. But wait, no, actually each token is directly a terminal, except maybe the numbers, but in this case, all tokens end with 't' followed by numbers, so each is a terminal symbol. So the entire string is eight terminals. Therefore, the derivation should produce a string of length 8.\n\nIn a CNF grammar, the number of steps needed to derive a string of length n is n-1. So for this string, 8 terminals, we need exactly 7 reductions. Let's see if the grammar can produce this string in 7 steps.\n\nStarting from S, which is the start symbol. Let's look at the possible productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo, from S, the first step can split into either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: Start with NT13 and NT69.\nNT13 can produce NT70 and NT46. Then NT70 can further expand into NT76 and NT7, but wait, NT76 is further split, but looking at the rules, NT76's production isn't directly given. Let me check: NT76 \u2192 NT79 and NT7. NT77 is another possibility. But this seems getting complicated. Maybe let's try the other option.\n\nOption 2: Start with NT4 and NT77.\nNT4 \u2192 't54' (wait, looking back at the rules, NT4's production is 't54'? Wait, no, looking again: the rule is `NT4 -> 't54'`. Wait, but in the string, we have 't54'? No, in the string, we have 't44', 't80', etc. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again the string: it's `t47 t44 t80 t0 t7 t40 t71 t47`, but in the grammar, NT4 is a terminal directly producing 't54' and 't46'\u2014wait, no, looking back, the rules for NT4 are: `NT47 -> 't80'` or perhaps I'm mixing up. Wait, no, let me recheck the grammar. The user provided a long list of rules, so I need to parse them correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's list the relevant rules:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't54' (from the line `NT4 -> 't54'`? Wait, no, in the grammar provided, I see:\n`NT4 -> 't54'`? Or is it another NT4 production? Wait, looking back, the rules include `NT4 -> 't54'` and `NT4 -> 't46'`? Wait, no, the line is `NT4 -> 't54'` is not present.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- `NT4 -> 't54'`? No, wait, actually, the line is `NT4 -> 't54'? or is it another NT4 production?\n\nWait, looking back, in the provided grammar snippet, I don't see NT4 being a terminal; rather, NT4 is a non-terminal. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nThe relevant ones for NT4 are not directly producing terminals. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. For example, `NT4 -> 't54'` is likely a rule, but perhaps it's in another part. Wait, no, in the list, I see lines like:\n\n- `NT43 -> 't47'`\n- `NT47 -> 't80'`\n- `NT48 -> 't46'`\n- `NT54 -> 't39'`\nSo NT4 isn't directly producing a terminal in these. But earlier, I thought NT4 has a production that leads to 't54', which would correspond to symbol t54. But in the string, we have 't44', which is a different symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: in the provided grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce a 't44' terminal? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, the productions where a non-terminal ends with 't' followed by numbers include:\n\n- `NT4 -> 't54'`? No, looking through, I don't see that.

The terminal symbols are like 't3', 't6', 't44', etc. So for example:\n\n- `NT64 -> NT61 NT3`? No, perhaps I'm not finding any. Wait, no. Let me scan all the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side is just a terminal. It seems that none of the rules are directly producing a terminal, except perhaps the last ones:\n\nLooking:\n\n- `NT56 -> 't62'`\n- `NT77 -> 't47'`\n- `NT17 -> 't80'`\n- `NT53 -> 't48'`\n- `NT34 -> 't9'`\n- `NT61 -> 't62'`\n- `NT32 -> 't11'`\n- `NT42 -> 't68'`\n- `NT12 -> 't81'`\n- `NT3 -> 't65'`\n- `NT5 -> 't39'`\n- `NT49 -> 't40'`\n- `NT42 -> 't68'`\nWait, so some non-terminals do directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't65'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54' (Wait, earlier I thought NT4 had that, but looking at the rules, I don't see `NT4 -> 't54'`.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and some of them produce terminal symbols (like tX or just letters), which means those parts can't be broken down further. My goal is to see if I can derive the given string step by step using the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NTx, NTy, etc.) produces two other non-terminals, except some which produce a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S, which produces NT13 NT69. So S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nThe string we need to check has eight tokens separated by spaces: t9, t3, t18, t81, t47, t85, t44, t47. So the length of the string is 8.\n\nI need to see if the grammar can derive this string. Let me start by breaking down the string and seeing which rules can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n- NT77 \u2192 t47\n- NT78 \u2192 t5\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- And many others, like NT9 \u2192 t0, but that might not be useful here since our string doesn't have t0.\n\nWait, in our string, the terminals we have are t9, t3, t18, t81, t47, t85, t44, t47. So I'll go through each terminal and check if there's a direct production rule that results in each one.\n\nStarting with t9. Looking at the rules, I see:\n- NT9 \u2192 t3 t45\n- Also, looking at NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62, which is more complicated, but maybe we can find a rule that directly gives t9. Wait, checking again, I see NT73 \u2192 t9? Let me check. Oh, no, looking at the production rules, I don't see any direct NT -> t9. But I do see that NT73 \u2192 t9 is present? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, let me list the production rules for NT symbols that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT77 \u2192 t47\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT49 \u2192 t40\n- NT53 \u2192 t48\n- NT67 \u2192 t6\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT42 \u2192 t68\n- NT12 \u2192 t81\n- NT34 \u2192 t9 (twice)\n- NT26 \u2192 t42\n- NT15 \u2192 t40\n- NT32 \u2192 t11\n- NT42 \u2192 t60\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT61 \u2192 t62\n- NT26 \u2192 t42\n- NT15 \u2192 t40\n- NT32 \u2192 t24\n- NT42 \u2192 t60\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT4 \u2192 t65\n- NT61 \u2192 t17\n- NT56 \u2192 t62\n- NT16 \u2192 t28\n- NT38 \u2192 t29\n- NT33 \u2192 t85\n- NT78 \u2192 t33\n- NT6 \u2192 t18\n- NT18 \u2192 t43\n- NT7 \u2192 t44\n- NT56 \u2192 t31\n- NT76 \u2192 t79\n- NT7 \u2192 t23\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some.\n\nWait, the problem statement lists a list of production rules, each starting with 'NTx -> NTy NTz'. But looking back, the way the user presented it, each line after the grammar is a production rule. So for example:\n\nNT77 -> t47 (looking at the lines provided, like \"NT77 -> t47\" is present. Let me confirm each terminal production.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT77 \u2192 t47\n- NT53 \u2192 t48\n- NT67 \u2192 t6\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT42 \u2192 t68\n- NT12 \u2192 t81\n- NT34 \u2192 t9\n- NT34 \u2192 t9\n- NT46 \u2192 t58\n- NT74 \u2192 t47\n- NT32 \u2192 t11\n- NT61 \u2192 t62\n- NT26 \u2192 t42\n- NT15 \u2192 t40\n- NT32 \u2192 t24\n- NT42 \u2192 t60\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT61 \u2192 t17\n- NT56 \u2192 t62\n- NT16 \u2192 t28\n- NT38 \u2192 t29\n- NT33 \u2192 t85\n- NT78 \u2192 t33\n- NT6 \u2192 t18\n- NT18 \u2192 t43\n- NT7 \u2192 t44\n- NT56 \u2192 t31\n- NT76 \u2192 t79\n- NT7 \u2192 t23\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n\nSo, the direct terminals are:\n\nt0 from NT9 \u2192 t0\nt3 from NT3 \u2192 t3\nt3 again from NT1 \u2192 t3\nt4 from NT4 \u2192 t54? Wait, NT4 \u2192 t54, so 't54' is a terminal.\nWait, no, looking back, NT4 \u2192 t54, which is a terminal, so any production that includes NT4 as one of the components will produce 't54'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I don't see t54, so maybe NT4 is used somewhere else. Let me get back to the string: t9, t3, t18, t81, t47, t85, t44, t47.\n\nLooking for each terminal in the string in the production rules. So for each token:\n\n1. t9: Looking through rules, does any NT produce t9? From above, I see NT34 \u2192 t9 (twice). So maybe NT34 can produce t9. But in the given string, we have t9 appearing once.\n\n2. t3: There are multiple rules that produce t3, like NT3 \u2192 t3, NT1 \u2192 t3.\n\n3. t18: NT6 \u2192 t18 is present.\n\n4. t81: NT12 \u2192 t81.\n\n5. t47: NT77 \u2192 t47.\n\n6. t85: NT33 \u2192 t85.\n\n7. t44: NT7 \u2192 t44.\n\n8. t47: Again, NT77 \u2192 t47.\n\nNow, the idea is to see if these can be derived in a way that when you put them together through the production rules, you end up with the given string.\n\nLet me try to see the overall derivation.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which rules into NT13 NT69. So first step:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo after S, we have NT13 and NT69.\n\nLooking up each of these:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\n- NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nSo now, the string becomes: NT70 NT46 NT23 NT6.\n\nNow, let's expand each of these:\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 (from the rules).\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT46 \u2192 ... Wait, looking back, I thought NT46 is a non-terminal. Wait, let me refer to the exact production rules.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 \u2192 so NT76 is present, NT7.\n\nNT46 \u2192 from rules, like NT46 \u2192 NT9 NT47? Or let me check. Wait, in the given production rules:\n\nI don't see any direct line for NT46 \u2192 something, but I do see that NT46 \u2192 t58? Wait, looking again: The rules list includes:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT68 NT58\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT38 NT67\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT17 NT38\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT80 NT69\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n\nSo NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. NT76 is another non-terminal, which \u2192 NT79 NT7, but let me check:\n\nLooking for NT76: In the rules, there's NT76"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. For example, NT56 -> 't62', NT46 -> 't58', and so on. These are the base cases, the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string we're evaluating has a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each of these corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. For instance, 't24' might correspond to NT24, which I need to see if it has a production rule that leads to 't24'.\n\nI'll start by trying to see how the string could be derived. Let's break it down:\n\n1. t24: Look for a production where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that directly produces 't24'. Checking the grammar, is there any NT -> 't24'? I don't see an NT with a rule producing 't24' directly. So maybe 't24' comes from a non-terminal that expands further.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree for the string.\n\nAlternatively, start from the start symbol S and see how to derive this string.\n\nS can go to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So the string should start with two non-terminals, each of which eventually generate a sequence of t's.\n\nLooking at the string, it's nine tokens long. Let's see if each 't' can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps using a recursive descent approach would help, but that might be complex. Maybe I can try to see if each token in the string has a corresponding production chain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a 't' followed by a number, like NT56 -> 't62'.\n\nSo for each token in the string, I'll check if there's a production that leads to it.\n\n- t24: Is there an NT that produces 't24'? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't24'. Maybe it's from a longer expansion, but that would require some NT path that eventually leads to 't24'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should work backwards, seeing if each 't' can be matched by some terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is 't24 t62 t28 t11 t48 t60 t17 t60 t34'. Let me list them again and think about the grammar.\n\nEach 'tX' is a terminal; each X is an integer, probably the index of the NT or a terminal derived from the grammar.\n\nFor example, 't62' could be from NT56, since NT56 -> 't62'.\n\nSimilarly, 't28' might be from NT16, because looking at NT16 -> 't28'. Yeah, that's one of the productions.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Checking the grammar: yes, NT16 -> 't28'.\n\nSimilarly, 't34' could come from NT17 or NT3. Let me check: NT3 -> 't65' and NT17 -> 't80', so that doesn't help. Wait, wait, earlier NT34 -> 't78' and NT78 -> 't33', etc. Wait, no, maybe 't34' comes from another NT.\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nStarting from the string: t24 t62 t28 t11 t48 t60 t17 t60 t34.\n\nLet's list each token:\n\n1. t24\n2. t62\n3. t28\n4. t11\n5. t48\n6. t60\n7. t17\n8. t60\n9. t34\n\nNow, for each token, find if it's a terminal that's directly produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, here are some NT -> t:\n\n- NT33 -> 't85'? No. Wait, looking carefully:\n\nWait, the grammar has lines like NT32 -> 't24', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT33 -> 't85'? Wait, looking:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT32 -> 't24'\n\nYes, so NT32 -> 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, NT16 -> 't28'\n\nSo t28 is from NT16.\n\nt62 is from NT56.\n\nt28 is from NT16.\n\nt11 is probably from NT11, but checking the grammar: is there any production for NT11? Let me look.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT28 -> 't79', but that's a production leading to a number.\n\nWait, I need to find each token as a direct production.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\n- NT32 -> 't24' \u2192 Yes, so t24 is from NT32.\n\n- NT56 -> 't62' \u2192 Yes, t62 is from NT56.\n\n- NT16 -> 't28' \u2192 Yes, t28 is from NT16.\n\nNow, t11: I look through all the NT productions to see if any directly produce 't11'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT18 -> NT49 NT80, but no 't11'. NT23 has a production leading to t28 and t9. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 't11' comes from NT11 directly, but do any NT productions have 't11' as a terminal?\n\nLooking through all the entries, I don't see any NT -> 't11'. So perhaps 't11' comes from an NT that expands further, maybe through a chain.\n\nWait, but in this problem, we have to see if the string is generated by the grammar. If any token isn't directly produced by any NT, then the string can't be generated. So in this case, 't11' is problematic because I don't see any NT -> 't11' production in the given rules.\n\nLet me double-check to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLooking through all the productions, for NT, the rules either produce another NT or a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT16 -> 't28', so that's a terminal.\n\nBut I don't see any NT that directly produces 't11'.

{"custom_id":"request-147","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t7 t33 t71 t31 t40 t40 t29 t58 t62 t44`. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because all the production rules are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some symbols like NT7, NT21, etc., seem to be non-terminals because they have productions, while 't' followed by a number are terminals. For example, 't50' is a terminal, so when I see 't50' in the string, I know it's the end of a possible derivation.\n\nNow, the string given is `t7 t33 t71 t31 t40 t40 t29 t58 t62 t44`. Since this is a series of terminals, the derivation starts from the start symbol, which in the grammar is S. So I need to see if the string can be built by expanding the non-terminals step by step, replacing them with terminals or other non-terminals until only the terminals remain.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S can produce either NT13 and NT1 or NT4 and NT77. Wait, looking back, the production is S \u2192 NT13 NT1. Wait, no, the first rule is S -> NT13 NT1? Or wait, the first grammar line is S -> NT13 NT13 NT69. Let me check: yes, the first line is S \u2192 NT13 NT13 NT69. Wait, but in the given grammar, it's actually written as S -> NT13 NT1, but now I see the user reposted the grammar, but in the initial part, it's written as S->NT13 NT13 NT69 and S-> NT4 NT77. Wait, no, looking again, the user's grammar starts with:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n... and so on.\n\nWait, but the user's string is a single sequence, so I think the first step is to see how the string can be formed by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nEach non-terminal can be expanded into two other non-terminals or a terminal. So I need to see if the string can be broken down as a sequence of such expansions.\n\nLet me try to consider that each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal (like NT7, NT3, etc.) with two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut with a string of ten terminals, the number of derivation steps would be such that starting from S, which can be NT13, NT13, NT69 or NT4, NT77, etc., each step adds a new symbol until the entire string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nTo tackle this, perhaps I should work backwards. Starting from the string and seeing if each terminal can be matched by replacing a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build the string step by step by expanding non-terminals. But since the string is quite long, it's error-prone without any visual aids, so maybe working from the end would be better.\n\nEach terminal in the string must correspond to a rule where it's a direct production. So I'll check each terminal and see if it's present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each terminal in the string:\n\nt7: In the grammar, t7 is present as a production, for example, NT42 \u2192 t68, but wait, t7 is indeed a terminal in the grammar: in the rules, 't7' appears as NT38 \u2192 t47, but I don't see t7 being a production, but wait, checking more carefully... Let me see: in the production list, I see NT38 \u2192 t47, and also NT49 \u2192 t40, NT31 \u2192 t50, etc. Wait, is t7 a terminal? Yes, because in the grammar, the rules are in the format of NT15 \u2192 t40, etc. So t7 is a terminal rule. But looking at the rules, I don't see any NT rule producing t7. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check the provided grammar again. Scrolling through, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT31 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT49 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't48'\nNT67 -> 't6'\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT42 -> 't68'\nNT12 -> 't81'\nNT34 -> 't9'\nNT46 -> 't58'\nNT74 -> 't47'\nNT32 -> 't11'\nNT61 -> 't62'\nNT26 -> 't42'\nNT15 -> 't40'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT42 -> 't60'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nNT4 -> 't65'\nNT61 -> 't17'\nNT78 -> 't72'\nNT38 -> 't47'\nNT83 -> 't7'\nAh, here we go. In NT83 \u2192 t7. So t7 comes from NT83.\n\nSo when parsing the string from the end, each terminal must correspond to a production where it's a terminal. So the last symbol is t44. Looking for NT47 \u2192 t44? Wait, let me check the rules for t44. Wait, t44 is in the rule NT4 \u2192 t54. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking for 't44', which is a terminal. Wait, checking the production rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t44 (Yes, because in the rules: NT77 \u2192 t47, but elsewhere, NT7 \u2192 t44. Wait, looking further down:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT77 \u2192 t47 and some others. Wait, more precisely, one of the rules is NT7 \u2192 t44. Let me check: yes, in the list after 77:\n\nLooking back, I see NT38 \u2192 t47, NT73 \u2192 t9, NT47 -> t84, and then in another section:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t44.\n\nYes, so NT7 \u2192 t44.\n\nSo, starting from the end, the last symbol is t44, which comes from NT7. Before that, the symbol is t62. Let's see what leads to t62.\n\nLooking for an NT rule that leads to t62. Checking the rules: look for 't62' being the RHS. Looking through, I see NT61 \u2192 t62. So t62 comes from NT61.\n\nNext, t58. Looking for an NT that leads to t58. Checking the rules, I see NT77 \u2192 t58? Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check: the rules have NT78 \u2192 t58, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking again: Oh, I see in the production rules:\n\nWait, looking at:\n\nNT83 \u2192 t7\nNT17 \u2192 t80\nNT53 \u2192 t48\nNT73 \u2192 t9\nNT46 \u2192 t58\nNT56 \u2192 't18'\nWait, checking for 't58', I see NT46 \u2192 t58.\n\nWait, no. NT46 \u2192 t58? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the rules, under NT46: N\/A, checking the whole list. Wait, looking for where the rule is for NT46. Here's the full list again:\n\nLooking for t58: Oh, wait, in NT77 \u2192 t58 is not present. Wait, actually, looking through, I don't see NT leading to t58 except in some rules. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, in the initial part, for example:\n\nWait, let's go through each production:\n\nLooking for when a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal t58. From the rules given:\n\nLooking through, I see NT77 \u2192 t58 is not present. Instead, let's see:\n\nWait, no, in the rules above, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t58.

{"custom_id":"request-151","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine if the given string `t39 t79 t9 t60 t71 t42 t48 t84 t47 t42` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal on the left is rewritten into two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. Since the string contains several terminal symbols, I need to track the sequences that produce each of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the terminals are letters like t39, t45, etc., and some are numbers. Wait, no, actually, the CNF grammar only has two types: non-terminals and terminals. Oh, but in the given grammar, some non-terminals are rewritten into terminals, like 't50' or 't3', which are terminals.\n\nSo first, I should note down the grammar's production rules:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT69\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n  and so on; a lot more. So S has two options. The string starts with t39, which suggests that the derivation must start from S, and then go through steps that eventually produce t39.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals in the string are t39, t79, t9, t60, t71, t42, t48, t84, t47, t42.\n\nFirst, let's see how t39 can be produced. Looking at the production rules, the non-terminals that produce t39 are:\n\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT77 -> t34, but I'm not sure if that's directly t39. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT5 -> t39. Also, NT59 is mentioned, but I don't see that in the grammar. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, NT58 -> t31.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT5 -> t39\nBut looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT5 -> t39.\n\nSo to produce t39, the non-terminal NT5 must be used. So in the derivation, there must be a path where NT5 is expanded into t39.\n\nBut where is NT5? Let's look through the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, there are only a few non-terminals that expand to terminals.\n\nFor example, NT5 -> t39, which is one. Also, NT9 -> t0, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo in the string, t39 is the first symbol. So how does that happen? The start symbol S must be able to derive into a sequence that includes NT5 somewhere.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\nS can be NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLet's explore both possibilities.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 expands to NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 has two rules: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 or NT70 \u2192 NT60 NT13.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 has a rule NT46 \u2192 t58.\n\nWait, so NT46 may produce a terminal. Let me see the rules for NT46: in the given grammar, NT46 is defined in two ways, one of which is a terminal, I think no. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking for NT46:\n\nYes, I see NT46 \u2192 t58.\n\nSo if NT46 expands to t58, that could be a terminal. So, putting it together, if the string starts with t39, I need a path leading to that.\n\nBut in the first branch of S, it's NT13 NT69.\n\nWhich branches: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, and NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT13 NT69 \u2192 (NT70 NT46) (NT23 NT6) \u2192 (NT70 NT46) NT23 NT6.\n\nBut how does that ever lead to t39?\n\nLooking at NT70, which can produce NT76 NT7 or NT60 NT13.\n\nIf it produces NT70 \u2192 NT60 NT13, then NT60 can produce NT38 NT18, which would then go further.\n\nAlternatively, if NT70 is expanded as NT76 NT7, but NT76 and NT7 have their own expansions. NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 t44.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNT46 \u2192 t58.\n\nSo the part after NT13 becomes t58. So S becomes NT13 t58, but NT13 is still a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which becomes (NT70 NT46) (NT23 NT6). So NT70 can further expand into its own rules, and similarly NT46 can be a terminal.\n\nBut in this case, NT46 does produce t58, which is a terminal. So in the first part, the string would be t58 from NT46, and then other parts.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from the end. Let's look at the last symbol, t42. How is t42 produced?\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT42 has a production: NT42 \u2192 t68. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nLooking for t42:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see NT42 \u2192 t42.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, yes, I see NT42 \u2192 t68, but that's a terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking through the given rules:\n\nYes, NT42 - but looking through each line:\n\nNT42 is defined as ... Looking for any production:\n\nLooking at the list, yes, I see:\n\nNT42 \u2192 t68.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, yes, I see NT42 productions:\n\nFor example, NT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47.\n\nWait, finding NT42: Yes, I see NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68, and NT42 \u2192 ??\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm missing some. Let me go through the entire list:\n\nLooking for NT42:\n\nYes, in one rule, NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68.\n\nIs there any rule where NT42 is a non-terminal producing another NT? Or is it a terminal?\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see:\n\nNo, the grammar doesn't have NT42 \u2192 t42. Instead, any NT42 must be part of a bigger production. So in the rules above, NT42 is part of NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80, etc.\n\nWait, actually, let's check each line:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules line by line, I see:\n\nNT42 \u2192 t68.\n\nWait, no, looking at the first set of rules, I see:\n\nLooking through each production, here are the relevant ones:\n\nLooking in the first part, we have:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT68 NT58\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT38 NT67\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT73 NT53\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47\n\nNT42 \u2192 t68\n\nOkay, so NT42 \u2192 t68 is a production.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 \u2192 t58.\n\nSo t42 is not directly a terminal. The last symbol is t42, so how can that come from a production?\n\nWait, in the given string, the last token is t42. So that must be produced from a non-terminal that eventually expands into t42. But looking through the grammar, I don't see a direct production where a non-terminal leads to t42. So perhaps t42 is produced via some chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT42 \u2192 t68. So t68 is a terminal.\n\nWait, that's part of an NT42. So if we have NT42 \u2192 t68, that would produce a terminal t68, not t42.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the last token, t42, comes from another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nYes, NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80.\n\nNT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4.\n\nBut that might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me start from the end of the string and see if I can backtrack to the start."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-172","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I have to determine if a certain string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to check is `t78 t44 t58 t29 t78 t33 t84 t34 t47 t85 t23`.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific properties: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and we have productions that eventually derive into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, I see that most productions are in the form of non-terminals splitting into other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT13 NT69. But there are a few productions where a non-terminal directly leads to a terminal, like NT5 \u2192 NT83 NT9, which seems off because in CNF, a production can only have two non-terminals or a single terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production can have either two non-terminals or a single terminal, but not more than two non-terminals. So each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. The given grammar seems to follow that because most produce two non-terminals, except some that produce a single terminal. Wait, no, actually, wait: the productions are like NT41 \u2192 't9', which is terminal. So those are allowed because in CNF, a production can produce a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, that seems okay.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t78 t44 t58 t29 t78 t33 t84 t34 t47 t85 t23`. Each of these is a terminal, so I need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence starting from S.\n\nThe approach to determine this is to simulate the bottom-up parsing, starting from the string and trying to reduce it according to the grammar. Alternatively, I can look for a derivation path from S to the string, breaking it down step by step, ensuring each part is covered by the grammar.\n\nLet's break down the string into parts and see which parts can be derived from the starting symbol S.\n\nFirst, looking at the beginning of the string: t78 t44 t58 t29 t78 t33 t84 t34 t47 t85 t23.\n\nWait, that's quite a long string. Let me consider structuring it into smaller chunks that can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that certain non-terminals directly lead to terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 't39', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't54', etc. So perhaps parts of the string can be directly matched by these.\n\nLet me try to match each part step by step.\n\n1. Looking at t78. From the grammar, where do we get t78? Looking at the productions, I see NT77 \u2192 't47', but that's t47. Then NT57 doesn't exist. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT78 \u2192 't33' as a production. No, wait, let me check. Wait, looking through the list, I don't see NT78 \u2192 't33'; instead, perhaps NT33 is involved.\n\nWait, more methodically: for each terminal in the string, find which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLet me list all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT31 \u2192 't50'\n- NT58 \u2192 't61'\n- NT5 \u2192 't38' (Wait, no, looking again: in the productions, NT58 is \u2192 't61'.

{"custom_id":"request-166","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t7 t71 t71 t9 t80 t28 t58 t11 t29 t28 t78`, and the grammar is a set of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific structures where each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. So, the grammar provided seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides of the rules are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either terminals or two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the production rules, the start symbol is S. From S, it can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. These are the starting points. So, the string we're checking must be derived from S through a series of substitutions using these rules.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t7, t71, t71, t9, t80, t28, t58, t11, t29, t28, t78. Let me count the number of tokens here. There are 11 terminals in the string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or one terminal. Therefore, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n -1, where n is the number of production steps after the initial. But wait, the initial is S, which is a single non-terminal. Each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time. \n\nSo, starting from S (1 symbol), each production step adds one more symbol. For example:\n- After one step: 2 symbols\n- After two steps: 3 symbols\n- After n steps: n+1 symbols\n\nIf the string has 11 symbols, that would mean that the derivation took 10 steps. That\u2019s possible, but let's not get stuck on that. Instead, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can search for the terminals in the production rules. Notice that some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. For example, NT1 is 't3', NT3 is 't10', wait no\u2014looking at the more detailed productions, I see lines like:\nNT1 -> 't3'\nNT3 -> 't65'\n...\nWait, looking through the production rules provided:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I can list terminals that appear:\nt3, t50, t74, t9, t45, t77, t5, t69, t27 (not listed here correctly), wait no, looking at the detailed rules, I see lines where NTx becomes 'tN', like NT5->t39, NT1->t3, etc. Wait, but the string has t7, t71, t9, etc. I need to check if these terminals appear in the grammar.\n\nLet me check each terminal in the string against the production rules to see if they have corresponding rules.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT5 -> 't39', NT74 -> 't47', etc. Wait, let me list the terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions, I can see lines like:\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT41 -> 't9'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT31 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT49 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't48'\nNT67 -> 't6'\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT42 -> 't68'\nNT12 -> 't81'\nNT34 -> 't9'\nNT46 -> 't58'\nNT74 -> 't47'\nNT32 -> 't11'\nNT61 -> 't62'\nNT26 -> 't42'\nNT15 -> 't40'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT42 -> 't60'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nNT4 -> 't65'\nNT61 -> 't17'\nNT78 -> 't72'\nNT38 -> 't47'\nNT83 -> 't7'\nNT80 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't7'\nNT56 -> 't62'\nNT16 -> 't28'\nNT38 -> 't29'\nNT33 -> 't85'\nNT78 -> 't33'\nNT6 -> 't18'\nNT18 -> 't43'\nNT7 -> 't44'\nNT56 -> 't31'\nNT76 -> 't79'\nNT7 -> 't23'\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nSo, the terminals in the grammar are: t3, t50, t74, t47, t9, t40, t48, t6, t0, t68, t81, t11, t62, t42, t24, t60, t65, t17, t72, t47 (repeated), t7 (repeated), t62 (repeated), t28, etc.\n\nLooking at the string: `t7 t71 t71 t9 t80 t28 t58 t11 t29 t28 t78`. \n\nWait, t71 is not listed as a terminal anywhere in the grammar. Similarly, t80 is a terminal? Let's check. In the production rules, I don't see any NT that produces t80. So, t71 and t80 are terminals in the string that are not present in the grammar. That's a problem because if they are terminals they should be directly produced by some production rule, but since they are not in the grammar's terminal list, they cannot be derived. \n\nWait, let me make sure. Are t71 and t80 terminals that are produced by any non-terminals? Looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT rule that produces t71 or t80 directly. So, the string contains these terminals which are not part of the grammar. That suggests that the string can't be derived because it contains symbols that aren't allowed.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, let's check if any NT rule leads to t71 or t80. The rules provided don't have any NT that produce these. For example, looking at NT71\u2014if it had a rule, it would be something like NT71-> something, but since I don't see it, it's not present. Similarly for NT80.\n\nTherefore, since t71 and t80 are in the string but are not terminals in the grammar, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar. \n\nSo, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-184","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a form where all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It has a bunch of production rules starting with S and other non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals like 't50', 't3', etc. The given string is `t39 t39 t42 t6 t68 t23 t78 t71 t34 t85 t65 t33`. My task is to check if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I know that each production (except the start symbol) has exactly two non-terminals. This structure suggests that the derivation can be represented as a binary tree, which is helpful when trying to match the string.\n\nI think the best approach is to use the top-down parsing method, specifically the CYK algorithm, but since the string isn't too long, maybe a simpler approach like checking from the leaves up could work. Alternatively, since the grammar might have certain patterns, I might try to trace the string back through the productions.\n\nLet me list the string again for clarity: t39, t39, t42, t6, t68, t23, t78, t71, t34, t85, t65, t33.\n\nLooking at the terminals, I notice that each is a specific 't' followed by a number. The first step is to check if each terminal is present as a production on the right-hand side (RHS) of any non-terminal. So, let's see which non-terminals can produce each of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- 't3' is produced by S.\n- 't39' is produced by NT53 (rule NT53 \u2192 't50' isn't, wait, let me check all the rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar provided, I notice that some NT rules produce terminals, like:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't39', NT5 \u2192 't39', NT53 \u2192 't48', but I don't see NT39 in the rules. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nI see that several non-terminals end up producing 'tX' where X varies. For example:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't48'\n- NT34 \u2192 't78'\n- NT58 \u2192 't61', which produces 't62'\n- NT42 \u2192 't68'\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT62 \u2192 't71'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34' is one rule, and others might produce different things.\nWait, I need to look for all rules that produce 't's.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't78' (and another 't9')\nNT46 \u2192 't58'\nBut let's compile a list of all NTs that produce a terminal:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT53 \u2192 't48'\n- NT34 \u2192 't78' and 't9'\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n- NT77 \u2192 't47'\n- NT25 (wait, no NT25.

{"custom_id":"request-189","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: `t29 t44 t43 t54 t39 t42 t48 t9 t43 t58 t29 t54`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a terminal symbol. The left-hand side is a single non-terminal. That helps because it means each step of derivation adds exactly one non-terminal or a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which is broken down into S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. That means everything is generated from these non-terminals. \n\nSo the string starts with `t29`, then `t44`, which are both terminals. I need to find a path through the grammar that can produce these terminals in order. \n\nI should start by seeing if any of the terminals in the string match the right-hand sides of the production rules. Looking through, I notice that some NT rules produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT41 -> 't9'. So 't9' is produced by NT41.\n\nIn the string, the ninth token is `t9`. Let's see when that might appear. Let's look at the productions for NT41, which is one of the non-terminals. NT41 -> 't9'. So if I can generate NT41, that can produce 't9'.\n\nBut to generate NT41, I need to see what its productions are. Looking through the NT rules: I see NT41 -> 't9' and also NT41 isn't listed again beyond that. So the only way to get 't9' is directly from NT41.\n\nNow, looking elsewhere, I notice NT48 -> 't48' (which is part of the string) isn't there, but in the string, after `t9` comes `t43`, which is at position 9: `t9`, then `t43` at position 10.\n\nLooking back, maybe I should try to build the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if I can produce the required sequence.\n\nThe string is `t29 t44 t43 t54 t39 t42 t48 t9 t43 t58 t29 t54`. Let's break it down:\n\n1. t29\n2. t44\n3. t43\n4. t54\n5. t39\n6. t42\n7. t48\n8. t9\n9. t43\n10. t58\n11. t29\n12. t54\n\nI notice that this string seems to have repeated segments, like `t29` and `t54` appearing multiple times.\n\nLooking at the grammar, certain NTs produce these terminals. For example:\n\n- NT29 -> 't68'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT78 -> 't33'\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT34 -> 't78'\n- NT58 -> 't61'\n- NT1 -> 't3'\n- NT13 -> 't43'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT61 -> 't62'\n\nWait, maybe looking at the production rules for NT29: looking through, I see NT29 isn't listed as producing a terminal in the given rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT29: the rules provided don't directly list NT29, but looking through the list, I see NT29 is part of:\n\nWait, the list doesn't have NT29 as a terminal. Let me check again. Looking through the list, I don't see a production for NT29 beyond possibly the ones that reference it. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of NT rules. Let me look for NT29. I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT29 -> ... I don't see NT29 being directly a terminal, but looking further, I might have missed it.\n\nWait, looking back through the provided data, I see:\n\n- NT29 -> NT42 NT68\n\nYes, so NT29 is transformed into NT42 and NT68. So to get t29, perhaps it's generated through these.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t29. So how to get a t29?\n\nLooking again, in the provided NT rules, I don't see any production that leads to t29 directly. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT23 -> 't44', which is t44. So the second token in the string is t44. That's NT23 producing `t44`. So S's initial productions are S-> NT4 NT77 and S-> NT13 NT69. So to get t44, perhaps we have to go via another path, maybe through NT23.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, which is either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So how do we get NT23?\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are more complicated. Let me try to build the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar, using a top-down approach, starting from S and seeing if we can derive the string.\n\nLet me attempt to trace the string token by token.\n\n1. The string starts with t29.\n2. The next token is t44.\n\nSo I need to see if any of the derivation steps can produce these.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S:\n\nS can produce NT13 and NT69, or NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the possible T1 at the start:\n\n- If S produces NT13 and NT69, then the first two tokens would be whatever NT13 and NT69 produce.\n\nBut the first token is t29, which is 't29'. So either NT13 is t29, or NT69 is t29.\n\nLooking through NT13: NT13 has the production NT13 -> NT70 NT46. Let me check.\n\nSo NT13 branches into NT70 and NT46.\n\nThen, NT70 can be broken down as per the rules: NT70 -> NT76 NT7 or NT70 -> NT73 NT53 (Wait, looking at the list, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT70 has two productions:\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\n\nand\n\nIs there another? Checking, I don't see another for NT70. So the only production is NT70 -> NT76 NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 has the production NT46 -> 't58'. So if we have NT46, it can produce t58 directly.\n\nWait, but the first tokens are t29 and t44. Let me think step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps S can produce NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4 -> 't54'. So if S->NT4 NT77, then the first token would be 't54', which is position 4 in the string. But the string starts with 't29', so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S produces NT13 and NT69, giving the first token as whatever NT13 produces and the second token as whatever NT69 produces.\n\nWait, NT13's first production is NT70 NT46. So the first token is t29. So NT70 NT46 must produce t29, but how?\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe each terminal is generated by a specific NT.\n\nSo, for example, 't29' must come from an NT that directly produces it. Looking through the NT rules, I'm trying to find if any NT directly produces 't29'.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT58 -> 't48' ? Wait, no, look:\n\nWait, no, let me go through each production that starts with NT:\n\n- NT1 -> 't3'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n- NT15 -> t42\n- NT16 -> t28\n- NT17 -> t80\n- NT21 -> t73 t53\n- NT29 -> NT42 NT68\n- NT3 -> 't65' (from NT10->... and NT3->... maybe, but let's check the NT3 rows)\nWait, maybe I can search each"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-205","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex, with a bunch of productions, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar can produce two different non-terminals: NT13 NT69. Or, another production is NT4 and NT77. So, S can split into either [NT13, NT69] or [NT4, NT77]. \n\nNext, looking at the productions, it seems like each non-terminal can eventually produce a terminal token or another non-terminal. Some of them go directly to terminals (like 't50', 't47', etc.), while others break down further into more non-terminals. For example, NT47 produces NT66 and NT29. Each of these, when they can't produce a terminal directly, continue breaking down until they reach the terminals.\n\nThe string we need to check is: t80 t24 t11 t68 t43 t43 t18 t43 t34 t80 t85 t31 t9.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, in the case of the start symbol S, the first step is to choose one of its two productions and expand each part accordingly.\n\nBut maybe instead of starting from S, I should look at the string and see if I can reverse-engineer the possible derivations. Let's work backwards from the string.\n\nThe string starts with t80. Looking at the grammar, I need to find which non-terminal can produce 't80'. Scanning through the productions:\n\nLooking at NT80, I see NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4. Wait, but in the grammar provided, NT80 has a production? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of productions. Let's look for NT80:\n\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4\n\nBut looking through the list, actually in the grammar, NT80 has two productions: NT80->NT67 NT4 and NT80->t43. Wait, no, looking at the list, I see lines like NT80 -> NT67 NT4, and another line NT80->t43. So, NT80 can produce either NT67 NT4 or 't43'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't80', so that's a bit confusing because in the grammar, is there a production for NT80 that directly gives 't80'? Let me check the given productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT80 -> NT67 NT4\n- Another line: NT80 -> t43\n\nWait, that's all? There's no line with NT80 \u2192 t80. So that's confusing because the first token is t80 but NT80 doesn't have a production for 't80'. Hmm, did I misinterpret something? Or maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through the given grammar again carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the lines are:\n\n- NT80 -> NT67 NT4\n- ...\n- Also, another line: NT80->t43.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. So NT80 can produce t43, but that's not t80. So how does t80 come into the string if NT80 can't produce t80?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me search the grammar for 't80'. The string has t80 as the first token. Looking at the grammar:\n\nI see that NT78 \u2192 t5, so not helpful. Wait, looking here:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 t42\n- NT80\u2192t43?\nWait, no, in the grammar, the lines are:\n\nLooking again, the grammar entries are:\n\nNT80 is in the following lines:\n\nNT80-> NT67 NT4\n\nand\n\nWait, another line: NT80\u2192t43? Let me check.\n\nAh, yes, in the list, I see:\n\nNT80 -> t43\n\nSo, NT80 can produce t43 directly. But the string starts with t80, which is different. So that suggests that perhaps my approach is wrong, or perhaps there's a non-terminal that I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminal that can produce t80 isn't named NT80. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t80, so that must come from some non-terminal. Maybe I'm misnaming the non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the non-terminals are like NT1, NT2, etc., and terminals are 't' followed by numbers. So, the first token is 't80', which must come from a non-terminal that can derive t80.\n\nLooking through the grammar, is there any non-terminal that can produce t80?\n\nLet's look for lines where a non-terminal's production includes t80. Scanning through the lines:\n\nLooking for NT80: \n\n- NT80-> NT67 NT4\n- NT80->t43\n\nSo none of these produce t80. Hmm, but the string has t80. So perhaps there's a non-terminal that produces t80, but it's not in the provided productions. Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again carefully. Scanning through:\n\n- NT53 -> NT17 NT38\n- NT53 -> NT80 NT69\nAh, okay, I see. NT53 can produce NT80 NT69.\n\nSo NT53 \u2192 NT80 nt69.\n\nWait, that's a production: NT53 \u2192 NT80 NT69.\n\nBut that doesn't directly produce t80; instead, it produces two non-terminals. But perhaps in the expansion, one of those non-terminals eventually becomes t80.\n\nSo, if in a derivation, a non-terminal produces NT53, which in turn produces NT80 NT69, and then NT80 produces t43, and NT69 produces t6, perhaps?\n\nWait, that might not help because t80 isn't directly there.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting tangled up. Let me try a different approach. Let's see if the string is possible.\n\nThe string is t80 t24 t11 t68 t43 t43 t18 t43 t34 t80 t85 t31 t9.\n\nGiven that S can split into either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. Let's assume that the first step is S -> NT13 NT69, because the string starts with t80 and if NT13 can produce something that leads to t80, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but NT13 productions:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nThen, NT70 can produce NT76 and NT7, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me try building the derivation.\n\nLet me think about each token and see if I can find a production for it.\n\nFirst, 't80' must come from some non-terminal. The only non-terminal that produces t80 is... Wait, if I look at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t80. So unless a non-terminal that produces t80 is part of the chain, the string can't be generated. So unless there's a non-terminal that can produce t80 through a series of productions, but in the grammar, there's no direct production for NT producing t80.\n\nWait, but in the lines, I see NT78 \u2192 t5, which is t5, so maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t80 comes from NT53, which in turn produces NT80 and NT69. So if in the derivation, we have NT53, and that produces NT80 and NT69.\n\nBut wait, in the first step, S can only produce NT4 and NT77, or NT13 and NT69. So unless we can get NT53 in the derivation, which isn't a product of S. Or is it possible that NT53 is used in some way?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, maybe there's a rule that allows S to produce other non-terminals indirectly.\n\nWait, no, the initial productions are S -> NT13 NT69 or S-> NT4 NT77. So unless a non-terminal like NT53 can be reached, but in the initial step, S can't produce NT53.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of the NTs in the initial production of S eventually leads to t80.

{"custom_id":"request-208","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the given string `t72 t60 t9 t85 t18 t54 t34 t0 t9 t17 t78 t80 t79` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky normal form means that each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals or a single non-terminal on the right. So each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that several of the productions are actually producing terminals. For example, NT77 \u2192 't47' is a production that replaces NT77 with the terminal 't47'. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 't34' and others. These are likely the base cases or the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string provided is composed of a series of 't' terms, like 't72', 't60', etc. So, the first thing I think of is whether each 't' in the string can be derived from a single terminal production in the grammar. If that's the case, it might mean that each 't' corresponds to a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nLet me list out all the terminal symbols in the grammar. It looks like they are: t3, t5, t7, t80, t4, t0, t39, t54, t64, t65, t72, t78, t85, t50, t58, t62, t68, t79, t9, t15, t18, t21, t23, t24, t26, t31, t32, t33, t34, t36, t38, t41, t42, t45, t46, t47, t48, t49, t50, t51, t53, t56, t58, t60, t61, t62, t67, t70, t73, t74, t76, t77, t80, t9, etc. Wait, but looking at the string, the 't's are specific. So I think each 't' is matched exactly to a production in the grammar.\n\nNow, the string is `t72 t60 t9 t85 t18 t54 t34 t0 t9 t17 t78 t80 t79`. Let's break it down into each token:\n\nt72, t60, t9, t85, t18, t54, t34, t0, t9, t17, t78, t80, t79.\n\nI need to check if each of these corresponds to a terminal production in the grammar. Let's go through each:\n\n- t72: Does NT77 \u2192 't72'? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT77 \u2192 't47' and NT77 \u2192 't34'. So maybe I need to check other rules. Oh, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules again. Oh, I see at the end of the grammar, there's NT77 \u2192 't34' and NT77 \u2192 't47'. So t72 isn't any of these. Wait, did I miss any rule? Let me look again.\n\nHmm, looking through the list, let's see:\n\n- NT53 has multiple rules like \u2192 't48', but no 't72'. Wait, maybe I should look for any NTT (non-terminals that produce 't's). Wait, wait, the first few rules are S \u2192 NT13 NT13, but actually NT13 produces other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps to approach this, I should identify which non-terminals produce each 't' in the string. So for each 'tX', I'll check if there is a production rule NT... \u2192 'tX'.\n\nLooking through the list of rules:\n\n- Looking for 't72': Checking all production rules, I see NT23 \u2192 't9', NT47 \u2192 't58', NT77 \u2192 't34' and 't47', NT4 \u2192 't54', NT13 \u2192 't32' and others. Hmm. Wait, maybe I missed some rules where a non-terminal directly produces a 't' like 't72'. Let me scan through the entire list again.\n\nLooking through all the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT31 \u2192 't50'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT49 \u2192 't40'\n- NT53 \u2192 't48'\n- NT67 \u2192 't6'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT42 \u2192 't68'\n- NT12 \u2192 't81'\n- NT34 \u2192 't9'\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n- NT74 \u2192 't47'\n- NT32 \u2192 't11'\n- NT61 \u2192 't62'\n- NT26 \u2192 't42'\n- NT15 \u2192 't40'\n- NT32 \u2192 't24'\n- NT42 \u2192 't60'\n- NT3 \u2192 't65'\n- NT4 \u2192 't65'\nWait a second, NT47 \u2192 't58'? Let me see. So NT47 can be 't58'. But t72 is another 't'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rule. Let me check the list again:\n\nAt the very end, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't34', 't47'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't39', 't65'\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see that NT46 \u2192 't58', but I don't see a non-terminal directly producing 't72'. So 't72' isn't directly produced by any rule. That's a problem because if the string has 't72', and there's no rule that directly replaces a non-terminal with 't72', then the string can't be derived, right?\n\nWait, maybe I should check all the rules again to ensure I didn't miss any. Let me go through the longer productions.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 't5', 't16'\n- NT51 \u2192 't34', 't69'\n- Wait, none of these produce 't72'.\n- NT47 \u2192 't58'\n- NT53 \u2192 't48', and some other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should go through each 't' in the string and check if there's a path to it.\n\nTake the first token, t72.\n\nWe need to see if t72 can be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar. If there's a direct production, like A \u2192 t72, then it's possible. But from the rules I can see, no rule has a production to 't72'. So unless 't72' can be derived through a chain of productions, but in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals. So if 't72' isn't directly a production, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, but t72 could be a result of a sequence of productions where a non-terminal eventually produces t72 via multiple steps. Let me think. For example, if a non-terminal A can produce B and C, and B can produce some term and C can produce others, but unless a rule directly produces t72, it might not be possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe the production NT77 \u2192 't72' exists. Let me check the list again. Wait, searching through all the right-hand sides for 't72', I don't see any rule where a non-terminal is replaced by 't72'.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Did I miss any rule? Let me go line by line:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT13\n- S \u2192 NT47 NT77\n- NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29\n- NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n- NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n- NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n- NT60 \u2192 NT38 NT18\n- NT9 \u2192 NT31 NT45\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45\n- NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62\n- NT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string \"t81 t17 t3 t31 t80 t68 t42 t78 t43 t0 t65 t24 t23 t11\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it's structured in a way that makes parsing easier, especially with techniques like CYK parsing. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are terminals or non-terminals. Some terminals are labeled with numbers like t3, t4, etc., which I assume are literals in the string. Others are non-terminals that eventually derive into these literals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the rules, S can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, the string must start with a combination of these two. Let's see the string starts with t81, which isn't directly a terminal in S's productions, but perhaps through the grammar's rules.\n\nI think I should map out the string and see if each terminal can be derived by following the production rules.\n\nBreaking down the string:\n\n1. t81\n2. t17\n3. t3\n4. t31\n5. t80\n6. t68\n7. t42\n8. t78\n9. t43\n10. t0\n11. t65\n12. t24\n13. t23\n14. t11\n\nI need to check if each of these terminals can be derived from the starting symbols and the production rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two options. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So, the string must start with NT13 \u2192 T? and NT69 \u2192 T?.\n\nFrom NT13's productions: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Let's see what those become.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 \u2192 t23 and t44 (from NT76 \u2192 t79 and NT7 \u2192 t23 or t44). Wait, looking back, I see that NT77 \u2192 t47, but we have NT70 and NT76 here. Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at NT70: It's not a terminal, it produces two non-terminals: NT76 and NT7. NT76 has a production to t79, which isn't in our string, and NT7 is t44. Hmm, but our string starts with t81, which might not come directly from NT70 or NT76.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the options for NT13:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n\nNT76 \u2192 t79 (from NT76 \u2192 t79), and NT7 \u2192 t44.\n\nSo if NT70 leads to t79, which isn't in the string, this might not be the right path. Alternatively, perhaps we should consider another path.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So starting with NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT4's production: NT4 \u2192 't54'. Wait, t54 isn't in our string, but t81 is. So maybe this isn't the right path either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list out the productions for each non-terminal and see if I can track the string.\n\nLet's start with the first symbol: t81. Looking for rules that derive to 't81':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a production for 't81' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake\u2014looking at the rules, I see 't81' under NT12 \u2192 't81'. So how can t81 appear?\n\nWait, NT12 produces 't81'. But in the grammar, the start symbol S doesn't produce NT12, so that suggests that perhaps the string is not generated by S, but maybe it's from another symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps t81 comes from somewhere else. Let's check if 't81' is a terminal in the grammar. Looking at the rules, yes, NT12 \u2192 't81'. So for t81 to appear, the symbol must be NT12.\n\nBut S doesn't produce NT12 directly. So, perhaps the derivation goes through other non-terminals that eventually produce NT12.\n\nLet me think: For NT12, it's part of a larger production. Looking back, NT12's only production is 't81'. So to get 't81', the string must have a NT12 in it, and NT12 must be derived from S via some chain of productions.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol, S can only produce NT4 or NT13, followed by another non-terminal. None of the options for S produce NT12 directly. So how can NT12 be derived?\n\nI think I need to check if any of the other non-terminals produce NT12. For example, looking through all the rules, do any non-terminals have NT12 in their productions?\n\nLooking through, for example, NT3: it doesn't. NT9: doesn't. NT34: no, but looking at NT34's productions, one is 't9', another is 't78', which is used elsewhere. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace through the string step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t81, which comes from NT12. So before that, there must be a production that leads to NT12. But looking at all the non-terminals, none produce NT12 directly. The only way to get NT12 is if a higher non-terminal produces it, but I don't see any such rule.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules to see if any of them produce NT12. Looking at the rules, the only way to get 't81' is via NT12, which is S's descendant, but S doesn't produce NT12. So perhaps the string is not possible because there's no way to derive 't81' from S.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t81, which suggests that the derivation starts with NT12, which must be derived from somewhere else. But the start symbol only produces NT4 and NT13, so maybe it's impossible for the string to start with t81.\n\nTherefore, I think the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol t81 can't be derived from the start symbol S or any of its non-terminals.

This makes the parsing process more straightforward, like using the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm not coding here, I'll try another approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's structured such that each non-terminal eventually resolves to terminal symbols. The terminals used in the string are t6, t65, t54, etc. I notice that not all non-terminals in the grammar produce terminal strings; many produce other non-terminals. So the task is to see if the string can be built by following the grammar's productions step by step.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string from left to right, matching the rules. Let's break down the string: t6 t65 t54 t79 t43 t6 t58 t71 t40 t28 t7 t58 t71 t6.\n\nI think a good approach is to build a parse tree or at least outline the possible steps. Since the grammar is in CNF, each left-hand side (LHS) symbol expands into two non-terminals. So starting from the start symbol, S, which can expand into NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t6. So perhaps t6 is the result of a production that starts with S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which then leads to other symbols until we get to t6. Alternatively, S could have expanded into NT4 NT77, and then one of those leads to t6, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me look at the productions where the non-terminal leads directly to a terminal or eventually to t6. Scanning through the productions, I see NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1, and NT1 \u2192 't3'. So NT66 can produce t3 eventually. However, t6 is in the string, so maybe NT61 or another NT that leads to t6.\n\nWait, let me check NT61 \u2192 NT38 NT69. Then, NT38 can produce t47 (since NT38 has a production \u2192 t47). Or wait, looking at NT38: I see NT38 \u2192 t39. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT38 NT45 (or another rule). Wait, checking NT61: It has productions like NT61 \u2192 NT38 NT69 and NT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3. Also, NT61 \u2192 NT26 NT58.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for the string in the grammar. All the terminals in the string must be reachable through the productions.\n\nLooking beyond the grammar, all symbols in the string are t followed by numbers, like t6, t65, etc. I need to see if each of these can be the result of a production's terminal symbol. So for each t, I need to check if there's a production that produces that exact t symbol.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some non-terminals directly produce t-symbols. For example, NT45 \u2192 t40, NT77 \u2192 t47, and so on. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT45 \u2192 t40 (Yes, looking at NT45: lines show NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36 and also in another part, NT53 \u2192 t48, etc. Wait, maybe some non-terminals can produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, there are lines where non-terminals are mapped to terminals. For example, NT77 \u2192 t47, NT5 \u2192 t39, NT21 \u2192 t73, etc. So each of these NTs can produce a terminal t followed by a number.\n\nNow, the string t6 t65 t54 t79 t43 t6 t58 t71 t40 t28 t7 t58 t71 t6 has several t symbols. Each of these txx must be reachable from some production in the grammar.\n\nSo for each t in the string, I can check if there's a production for that NT which ends up producing that t.\n\nFor example, t6: looking in the productions, any NT that can directly produce t6? I don't immediately see any, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for each t symbol in the string and see if there's a path from the start symbol to that terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to see if each t symbol in the string is reachable from the start symbol in the appropriate number of steps. Or, since it's CNF, each production may involve steps where each step adds one symbol to the string.\n\nWait, since the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a symbol with two, so the length of the string after n steps is 2^n. The given string has length 14. So n would be such that 2^n >=14, so n=4 (2^4=16). But the exact breakdown may vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate the parsing process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if all the t symbols are covered by the productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, each terminal is directly produced by some NT:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT31 \u2192 t50\n- NT21 \u2192 t73\n- NT70 \u2192 t76\n- NT7 \u2192 t44\n- NT42 \u2192 t68\n- NT73 \u2192 t9? Wait the line says NT73 \u2192 t9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting some from the bottom:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t47\n- NT53 \u2192 t48\n- NT67 \u2192 t6\n- NT73 \u2192 t9\n- NT78 \u2192 t5?\n\nWait, let me go through each production rule:\n\n1.

The grammar has several production rules, and the string to check is a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers, like \"t78 t39 t47 t84 t6 t34 t78 t17 t60 t47 t47 t43 t7 t39 t11\".\n\nFirst, I need to recall how Chomsky Normal Form works. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any rule. In this case, I notice that the start symbol is S, and looking at the rules, all produce other non-terminals except in some cases where 't' tokens are produced. So each 't' is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this exact sequence through a series of productions. \n\nTo approach this, I think of the process as starting from S and trying to expand symbols step by step until I reach the terminals in the string. But since the string is quite long, I need to find a systematic way.\n\nLet me list the production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So S expands into NT13 and NT69. Then each of these can be further expanded.\n\nI think a good way to approach this is to use a top-down parsing method, starting from S and following the productions. However, since the string is a linear sequence of terminals, top-down may not be straightforward because non-terminals can spawn other non-terminals which then expand. So maybe a better approach is to parse the string from the start and see if each part can be matched.\n\nAnother method is to work backwards, starting from the string and seeing if each terminal can be matched to the productions. This is called reverse engineering. Alternatively, I can attempt to construct the derivation step by step.\n\nLet me take the string and break it down into its components: [t78, t39, t47, t84, t6, t34, t78, t17, t60, t47, t47, t43, t7, t39, t11].\n\nI'll note that each 't' is a terminal in the grammar, appearing on the RHS of some production rules. For example, t78 appears in NT78 \u2192 't78' (wait, in the given rules, I see NT78 \u2192 't78'. Similarly, other 't's are on the RHS of non-terminals.\n\nSo to parse the string, each terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule in the grammar.\n\nI need to check if the string can be generated by a series of production expansions from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct the parse tree from the string upwards, starting from the terminals and seeing if I can reach S.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be built from S by replacing non-terminals with their possible productions.\n\nLet me consider that the string is generated by a leftmost derivation. So I'll start with S and replace the nonterminals with their RHS, trying to match the leftmost symbols of the string.\n\nBut the string is 15 symbols long. That's quite a lot, so I need to find a way to model this without getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of t's and digits, and for each position, check if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, for example, NT78 \u2192 t78, NT39 \u2192 t39, NT47 \u2192 t47, etc. So many non-terminals directly produce a single t followed by a number.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to see if the sequence of t's and numbers corresponds to the possible rules leading to S.\n\nLet me look for non-terminals that can produce a sequence of t's and numbers.\n\nBut another approach: Let's look at the string and try to see if it can be split into a sequence of productions.\n\nThe string is: t78 t39 t47 t84 t6 t34 t78 t17 t60 t47 t47 t43 t7 t39 t11.\n\nLet me note that each 't' is part of a production rule in the grammar.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- t78 comes from NT78 \u2192 t78\n- t39 comes from NT39 \u2192 t39 (though I don't see NT39 in the original rules, but wait in the given rules, NT91 \u2192 t39? Wait, in the rules, I notice that NT56 \u2192 't39'? Yes, in the provided rules: \"NT56 -> 't18' NT74\" I think? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking back, under NT56: \"NT56 -> 't18' NT62\". Wait, no: I see \"NT56 -> 't18' NT74\" at the line \"NT56 -> 't62' NT57\" doesn't seem; actually, let me scan the rules properly.\n\nLooking at the initial rules, under \" Grammar: \", the rules are listed. Let me parse them correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a table of non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n- NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29\n- NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n- NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n- NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n- NT60 \u2192 NT38 NT18\n- NT9 \u2192 NT31 NT45\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45\n- NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62\n- NT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3\n- NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\n- NT5 \u2192 NT83 NT9\n- NT21 \u2192 NT73 NT53\n- NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n- NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18\n- NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT58\n- NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT10 \u2192 NT68 NT58\n- NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21\n- NT12 \u2192 NT38 NT67\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80\n- NT53 -> NT17 NT38\n- NT53 -> NT80 NT69\n- NT34 -> NT61 NT47\n- NT70 \u2192 NT60 NT13\n- NT3 -> NT10 NT9\n- NT61 \u2192 NT15 NT47\n- NT23 -> NT73 NT41\n- NT78 \u2192 't47'\n- NT51 -> NT34 NT69\n- NT56 -> 't39'\n- NT77 -> 't47' ???

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar given seems to fit that since all the productions are of the form NT_X \u2192 NT_Y NT_Z or NT_X \u2192 'tY'.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol S can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT47 (since the third option is 'S->NT4 NT77', but I see 'S->NT4 NT77' and 'S->NT13 NT69', but others are non-terminals).

{"custom_id":"request-264","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t71 t3 t85 t7 t80 t33 t78 t48 t3 t40 t80 t17 t80 t65 t34 t34`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF means. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit as each production on the left side of \u2192 has two elements on the right side, except where a terminal appears. But wait, there are some terminals already on the right side, like 't50' in one of the productions. So CNF is satisfied because the right side is either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived by the given grammar. That is, can I parse the string from the start symbol S, applying production rules until I produce the exact string.\n\nBut parsing directly might be complicated, especially with such a long string. Maybe I should look for a strategy like checking if the string can be broken down according to the productions or vice versa. Alternatively, I can perform a bottom-up or top-down parsing step by step.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t71 t3 t85 t7 t80 t33 t78 t48 t3 t40 t80 t17 t80 t65 t34 t34`. That's 16 tokens, so 16 terminals. Since the CFG in CNF has each production with either one terminal or two non-terminals, the string's length can be 2n-1 where n is the number of non-terminals in the derivation, but maybe I should think in terms of the stack during a pushdown automaton.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a tree.

{"custom_id":"request-285","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: `t48 t50 t23 t47 t62 t17 t3 t23 t6 t18 t7 t68 t47 t23 t58 t31 t3`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the grammar can be represented with rules that either replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or with a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nI see that S directly leads to NT13 NT69 and NT4 NT77. These are two production rules starting from S.\n\nThen, looking at the string, it starts with t48 and t50. Let's see if the grammar has any production rule that results in t48. Scanning through the grammar, I notice:\n\nNT53 -> 't48'\n\nThat's a rule that turns NT53 into t48. Also, looking at T53, I don't see any production for NT53 beyond that. Wait, let me check the grammar again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, no, NT53 is mentioned in two rules, but the relevant one for terminals is NT53 -> 't48'. So, to get t48 in the string, the previous non-terminal must have been NT53.\n\nSo, the string starts with t48, which comes from NT53. Before that, in CNF, the last step must be a production of NT53, which is 't48', so in the derivation tree, we have NT53 -> t48. Thus, the string starts with t48, so we need to find how NT53 is derived.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the only rule for NT53 is NT53 -> 't48', so NT53 must be derived from some production. Wait, that seems odd because in CNF, a non-terminal should either produce a terminal or two non-terminals. Here, NT53 only has a terminal production. That seems a bit off, but perhaps it's allowed in CNF. Alternatively, maybe the grammar is actually not a proper CNF because all productions in CNF must have two non-terminals except for terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the productions can be of the form A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where a is a terminal and B, C are non-terminals. So having a production A \u2192 a is acceptable, but in this case, NT53 has two rules: one producing 't48' and another 't80' via other non-terminals. So perhaps the rule NT53 -> 't48' is part of the CNF.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the grammar. Let me check again. I see:\n\nNT53 -> 't48'\nNT53 -> NT80 NT69\n\nOh, so NT53 can produce both a terminal and two non-terminals. That's okay because in CNF, it's allowed as long as all productions are of the form a, AB, etc.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t48, so the derivation must start with NT53. So we have NT53 \u2192 t48.\n\nThen, the next token is t50. So the t48 is followed by t50, which suggests that in the derivation, the root S or some non-terminal that leads to t48 and then t50.\n\nBut let's think step by step. Let's represent the string as a series of steps in the derivation.\n\nThe string is: t48, t50, t23, t47, t62, t17, t3, t23, t6, t18, t7, t68, t47, t23, t58, t31, t3.\n\nSo the last token is t3, which comes from a production rule that ends in a terminal. Let's see if t3 is produced by a rule. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 -> t11\nNT34 -> t9\nNT1 -> t3\nNT62 -> t71\nNT3 -> t65\nNT4 -> t65\nNT38 -> t47\nNT78 -> t72\nNT37 -> t7?\nWait, no. Let's check NT3:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\nNT38 -> 't47'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nBut t3 itself is a terminal. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, no. Let me find all rules that produce t3. Scanning each production:\n\nI found NT1 -> t3 and others like NT3 -> t65, which is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any rule where a terminal is 't3'. I see:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT1 -> 't3'\n\nYes, that's it. So t3 comes from NT1.\n\nSo the last token is t3, which must come from NT1 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo, to get the substring ending with t3, the derivation must have a NT1 which produces t3.\n\nNow, to get t1, the NT1 is derived from where? Looking at the grammar, only NT1 -> t3.\n\nWait, that can't be. So NT1 can only produce t3. But in the string, after t3, we have the end of the string, but in the string, the last token is t3, so before that, perhaps it's the start or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a rightmost derivation. Let's see.\n\nBut let's backtrack.\n\nTo get t3, we have to have had NT1 in the derivation, which produces t3.\n\nSo before t3, we have something. Looking at the string, before t3 is the second to last token, which is t61? Wait, no, let me count the string:\n\nThe string is t48, t50, t23, t47, t62, t17, t3, t23, t6, t18, t7, t68, t47, t23, t58, t31, t3.\n\nWait, the last token is t3, which is at position 17. Before that, it's t31. So before t3, we have t31.\n\nt31 comes from NT31. Looking through the grammar, I find NT31 -> 't50'.\n\nSo NT31 \u2192 t50. But in the string, the token before t3 is t31, which is t31 (no, wait, no: the string is ... t31 t3. So the last part is t31 followed by t3.\n\nSo to get t31 and then t3, the derivation must have something like A \u2192 B C, where B is a non-terminal that produces t31, and C is the rule that produces t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT31:\n\nNT31 -> 't50', right? So NT31 \u2192 t50. So t31 is derived from NT31 \u2192 t50.\n\nBut t50 is a terminal, so NT31 must have been part of the previous step. But in the string, we have t31 followed by t3.\n\nSo for the derivation to have NT31 \u2192 t50, and then t50 is the terminal. But then, how does t50 lead to t3? Because t50 is a terminal, it can't be further decomposed.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the complete structure of the string.\n\nPerhaps it's better to process the string from the end and see if each terminal can be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nt3 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 t3. So that's fine.\n\nBefore t3, we have t31. So t31 must come from a production that results in t31. Looking at the grammar, I see NT31 \u2192 't50'. So t31 is 't50', but in the string, t31 is followed by t3, which is 't3'. So t31 is 't50', but how?\n\nWait, maybe the t31 is generated as t50, but in the string, it's a token 't31'. That can't be, because in the grammar, NT31 \u2192 't50', so t31 is replaced by 't50', which is a different terminal. But in the string, the token is 't31', which is a single terminal. So that's a problem because the grammar doesn't have a production for NT31 \u2192 t31. It only has NT31 \u2192 't50'. So how can the string have 't31' as a token?\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated because t31 is not in the language of the grammar.\n\nWait, but that's too quick"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided seems to fit this structure since all the productions either combine two non-terminals or end with a terminal.\n\nThe string given consists of a sequence of terminals. The grammar has several productions that directly produce terminals, such as NT4 -> t54, NT5 -> t39, and so on. My approach should be to work backwards from the string, trying to reduce it using the grammar's productions until I reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual tokens:\n1. t47\n2. t54\n3. t6\n4. t11\n5. t9\n6. t33\n7. t62\n8. t23\n9. t50\n10. t11\n11. t6\n12. t23\n13. t44\n14. t78\n15. t85\n16. t84\n17. t81\n18. t18\n\nStarting from the right, I'll try to find the leftmost production that matches a token.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is t18. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT7 -> t44, NT6 -> t18. So, the last part could be NT6 \u2192 t6 \u2192 t18? Wait, wait. Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, the productions for NT6 are: NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45, etc. There's no direct production for NT6, but there is NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80. Hmm, so perhaps I need to see if any of these can be reduced to terminals.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. I see that NT7 \u2192 t44, and DT6 is perhaps involved elsewhere. Wait, perhaps I should start from the end and work my way back.\n\nThe string ends with t18. From the productions, I see NT7 \u2192 t44, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking for productions that result in t18. Scanning the list, the production NT7 \u2192 t44 is not t18, so perhaps looking for a production that results in t18.\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see any rule that produces t18 directly except NT18 \u2192 t43, which doesn't help. Wait, perhaps I'm missing that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all direct terminators:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT6 \u2192 t18? No, looking back. Wait, the production NT6 appears in NT60 \u2192 NT38 NT18, and NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, and so on. I don't see a direct NT6 production. Wait, in the list provided, under NT6: The production NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18, so NT61 can produce t18 when reduced twice.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for a path where a combination of non-terminals reduces to the terminals in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the first term, t47. There's a production NT47 \u2192 t84, which is in the grammar. Wait, but t47 isn't a terminal, it's a non-terminal. So, if I start from the beginning, perhaps I can see which non-terminals can produce t47 as a result.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The string is a sequence of terminals, so to derive it, I must start from the start symbol S and build up via productions until I match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string from right to left, building a parse tree. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from the right end, looking at the last token, t18. From the grammar, I see that NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, looking for any production that can reduce to t18. Looking through the list, production NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18. So, if we have t18, maybe it's from reducing NT61 twice.\n\nSo the last two t18s would come from NT61 \u2192 t18 t18, but in the string, the last two tokens are t18 and t18? Wait, no, let's count:\n\nWait the string is:\nt47, t54, t6, t11, t9, t33, t62, t23, t50, t11, t6, t23, t44, t78, t85, t84, t81, t18.\n\nWait, the 18th token is t18, the 17th is t81. Hmm. So maybe t18 is at the very end. Let me think again.\n\nLet me list the string step by step:\n\n1. t47\n2. t54\n3. t6\n4. t11\n5. t9\n6. t33\n7. t62\n8. t23\n9. t50\n10. t11\n11. t6\n12. t23\n13. t44\n14. t78\n15. t85\n16. t84\n17. t81\n18. t18\n\nI think I may have confused the count earlier. So the last token is t18, the 18th.\n\nSo perhaps starting from the end, we can see that the last two tokens could be part of a production.\n\nLooking for productions that result in t18. From the list, I don't see an NT -> t18, but looking at NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18. So to produce t18, that would require that two NT61s reduce to t18 each.\n\nSo, in the string, the last two tokens are t18 and ...? Let's see, counting from the end:\n\nToken 18: t18\nToken 17: t81\nToken 16: t84\nToken 15: t78\nToken 14: t44\nToken 13: t23\nToken 12: t23\nToken 11: t6\nToken 10: t11\nToken 9: t50\nToken 8: t23\nToken 7: t62\nToken 6: t33\nToken 5: t9\nToken 4: t11\nToken 3: t6\nToken 2: t54\nToken 1: t47\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Let me just outline them in order:\n\nPositions 1 to 18:\n\n1. t47\n2. t54\n3. t6\n4. t11\n5. t9\n6. t33\n7. t62\n8. t23\n9. t50\n10. t11\n11. t6\n12. t23\n13. t44\n14. t78\n15. t85\n16. t84\n17. t81\n18. t18\n\nSo, the last token is t18. To get t18, we have the production NT61 \u2192 t18 t18. So the last two tokens must be t18 each. But in the given string, the last token is t18, so the previous one is t81. Hmm. So can t81 reduce to t18? Or maybe t18 reduces in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t81 is part of a larger production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see what NT81 produces. From the list, NT81 \u2192 NT18 NT9. Wait, NT81 \u2192 NT18 NT9. So to produce t81, we'd have to have NT18 and NT9 producing t18 and t9 respectively. But wait, that would mean t81 is represented by NT18 NT9, which would be t18 followed by t9. But in the string, after t81 comes t18. So perhaps that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and maybe it's not possible to reduce it back correctly.\n\nLet me try a different"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-312","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it belongs to the language. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has several non-terminals and terminals, like 't50', 't47', etc. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t40, t62, t50, t68, t58, t79, t42, t71, t34, t40, t48, t54, t50, t0, t85, t9, t39, t60. That seems quite long, but maybe it can be broken down into the grammar's rules.\n\nFirst, I should try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Let's see if I can find a way from the start symbol S. The start symbol S can go to either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let me note that.\n\nSo, the string starts with t40. Let me look at the productions that lead to t40. Looking through the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 t39, NT58 \u2192 t61, NT53 \u2192 't48' and 't34', NT67 \u2192 t6, NT4 \u2192 t54, NT31 \u2192 t50, NT5 \u2192 t39, NT49 \u2192 t40. Oh, wait, I see NT49 \u2192 t40. So, if I have NT49, it produces t40. That might be useful.\n\nLooking at the string, after t40 comes t62, which is another terminal. So, maybe after t40, there's another non-terminal that produces t62. Let me check the productions that produce t62.\n\nLooking at the grammar: I see NT61 \u2192 't17', NT78 \u2192 't33', NT33 \u2192 't85', but that's not relevant here. Wait, NT17 \u2192 't80', NT77 \u2192 't34', but that's not t62. Hmm. Alternatively, looking for NT producing t62. Oh, I see NT61 \u2192 't17' and 't62'? No, wait, looking again: NT61 \u2192 't62' is one option, because one of its productions is NT61 \u2192 NT17 NT38, and NT17 is t80, NT38 is 't47', but that's not t62. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT49 \u2192 t40, which is useful. Next, after t40 is t62. So, perhaps after NT49, which is t40, there's another non-terminal that can produce t62. Let me look for a production where X \u2192 t40 t62. Or perhaps, the string is a sequence of t40 followed by t62. So, maybe the initial S can go to NT49 NT62 or something, but I don't see NT62 in the grammar. Wait, perhaps 't62' is an alternative from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT1 \u2192 't3', NT62 \u2192 't71', NT56 \u2192 't62'. Oh, wait, NT56 \u2192 t62. So, does any non-terminal produce t62 and then t68, etc.?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start trying to parse the string step by step. Let me consider the string as a series of symbols and see if I can find a parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's take the first option: S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Then, NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So, S can produce NT70 NT46 NT69. Now, looking at NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, which is a split into two non-terminals. But our string starts with t40, which is much earlier. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path because t40 is early in the string, but this S production would first go to NT70, which likely starts with non-terminals that produce t40 later.\n\nWait, maybe the string is produced by another path. Let me check if there's a way S can start with t40. But I don't see any production from S that starts with t40. Unless S goes through another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. All the strings generated by the grammar start with a non-terminal, since S is the start symbol and its productions are to non-terminals. So, the very first symbol in the string must be a terminal produced by a non-terminal. Let's check the possible starts.\n\nLooking at the productions, S can go to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Now, looking at those non-terminals:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nNT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n\nSo, the string starts with t40, which is a terminal. So, maybe the sequence of non-terminals starting S must first reach a non-terminal that can produce t40, and then the rest follow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the S can be rewritten into multiple symbols through several steps, but since it's a context-free grammar, the parsing process builds the tree step by step.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach is to look for the entire string being derived from S. Let me see if the string can be split into components that match the productions.\n\nThe string is: t40, t62, t50, t68, t58, t79, t42, t71, t34, t40, t48, t54, t50, t0, t85, t9, t39, t60.\n\nI notice that t50 appears a few times. Checking the grammar, NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6, and NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41, and NT41 \u2192 't9', and NT6 \u2192 't18'. So, maybe 't9' and 't18' can combine to produce 't50' via another production. Wait, looking back, I see NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, NT46 \u2192 't58'. Hmm, no, but NT31 \u2192 t50. So, somewhere in the string, we might have NT31 producing t50.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down into components that correspond to specific non-terminals. Let's try to map it.\n\nLooking at the string: t40 t62 t50 t68 t58 t79 t42 t71 t34 t40 t48 t54 t50 t0 t85 t9 t39 t60.\n\nStarting after t40 comes t62. Wait, earlier, I saw that NT56 \u2192 t62. So, perhaps after t40 comes a non-terminal that produces t62 and t68, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should map the entire string as a sequence of productions. Let me try to find a way step by step.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to construct a parse tree. Let me try to see the first few symbols and see if I can find a path.\n\nThe first symbol is t40, which is produced by NT49 \u2192 t40, but where does that fit in the structure. So, perhaps the S starts with NT49 NT something. But looking back, S's productions are either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, that can't be the case.

{"custom_id":"request-331","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, so I need to analyze them step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the problem. Context-free grammars (CFGs) consist of a set of production rules that generate strings through a series of substitutions starting from the start symbol. Chomsky normal form is a specific way to write these rules, which in this case, all the production rules either produce two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. This structure simplifies parsing because each production directly corresponds to a single step in the derivation of a string.\n\nThe given grammar has a start symbol S and several non-terminals (like NT13, NT47, etc.) leading up to terminal symbols (like 't3', 't5', etc.). The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: `t3 t29 t60 t85 t60 t58 t29 t78 t80 t65 t68 t79 t39 t17 t29 t72 t33 t3 t6`.\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from S using the given production rules. To do this, I can try to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the leaves of that tree match the given string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the start symbol S has two productions:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT69\n2. S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with one of these two combinations. Let's break down each option.\n\nStarting with the first production: NT13 and NT69.\n\nLooking at NT13's production rules:\n\nNT13-> NT70 NT46\n\nNT70 has two options:\n\nNT70-> NT76 NT7 or NT70-> NT60 NT13\n\nSimilarly, NT46-> NT58 or NT46-> NT62.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complex. Let's try to find the terminals that might appear in the string.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string, we have t3, t29, t60, t85, t60, t58, t29, t78, t80, t65, t68, t79, t39, t17, t29, t72, t33, t3, t6.\n\nI need to see if any of the non-terminals can derive to these terminals. From the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4->t54, NT6->t18, NT9->t0, NT3->t3, NT5->t39, NT7->t44, NT1->t3, etc.\n\nWait a minute, some non-terminals map directly to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT9 -> t0\n- NT3 -> t3\n- NT1->t3\n- NT5->t39\n- NT7->t44\n- NT58->t61 (Wait, no, NT58-> something? Let me check:\n\nLooking up NT58's productions:\n\nNT58-> NT61 NT3. But wait, NT3->t3, which is a terminal. So NT58 can derive to t61 NT3 or further, depending on NT61.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the grammar rules are a bit confusing because some symbols are repeated. Let me make sure I read them correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some entries:\n\n- NT58-> NT61 NT3\n\nBut then NT3-> t3. So NT58 can produce NT61 and then t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT78-> NT5 NT16, and NT16->t28. So NT78 can produce NT5 and t28.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a series of terminal symbols and try to see if each can be matched by the start symbol and the required productions.\n\nAnother approach is to model the derivation as a sequence of steps, starting from S and substituting non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to see if I can derive exactly that sequence by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the parse tree. The string must correspond to a valid left or right (or any) derivation from S.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a better way is to use a recursive descent parser approach, starting from S and trying to match the first symbols of the string, recursively handling each non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting with S, the string starts with 't3'. Looking at the productions of S: S can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nThus, the first step is to see if either NT13 or NT69 can produce a 't3' in the first position. Wait, no, S produces a sequence of two non-terminals, so the string starts with a 't3', so perhaps one of these NTs must derive to 't3' followed by another NT.\n\nBut that's not possible, because S produces two non-terminals in sequence, so the first terminal in the string must come from the first non-terminal in S's expansion.\n\nWait, let's see. S -> NT13 NT69. So the first symbol in the string should come from NT13. Similarly, if S uses the second production, NT4 NT77, then the first symbol comes from NT4.\n\nSo looking at the string, the first character is 't3', so I need to check if NT13 can generate 't3' as its first terminal symbol, followed by NT69 generating the rest.\n\nAlternatively, if the first terminal is 't3', perhaps it's derived from NT13.\n\nLooking at NT13-> NT70 NT46.\n\nSo the derivation would proceed as:\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n\nThen, NT70 can be expanded, and so on.\n\nBut this seems like a long chain. Another approach is to see which NTs can directly produce 't3'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3-> t3, and NT1-> t3 as well. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT3: NT3-> t3\n- NT1-> t3\n\nSo both NT3 and NT1 produce 't3'.\n\nTherefore, if in the parse tree, a node is NT3, it produces 't3', or if it's NT1, it also produces 't3'.\n\nThat's helpful.\n\nNow, looking back at the grammar, for example, NT49->t40, but the string has a t40 (I think not; checking the string: no t40, so perhaps irrelevant.)\n\nWait, the string is t3 t29 t60 t85 t60 t58 t29 t78 t80 t65 t68 t79 t39 t17 t29 t72 t33 t3 t6.\n\nSo the first symbol is t3.\n\nSo, starting with S's first production, S->NT13 NT69.\n\nSo the first symbol is t3, so NT13 must produce t3. But let's confirm:\n\nLooking at NT13's productions:\n\nNT13-> NT70 NT46.\n\nSo NT13 can only produce NT70 and NT46. So when expanded, the first symbols after S would be from NT70, which then expands to more NTs until we get a terminal.\n\nWait, this suggests that the first symbol in the string must come from NT70 after some expansions. But the first symbol is 't3', but NT70's production is NT76 NT7 or NT70 NT60 NT13.\n\nSo perhaps let's see if NT70 can eventually produce 't3' as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since NT3-> t3 and NT1-> t3, perhaps the derivation at some point produces NT3 or NT1 which then directly produce 't3'.\n\nBut wait, the initial expansion from S is NT13 NT69. So the first symbol would be the first terminal of NT13's expansion, which starts as NT70, which then has to produce some terminal.\n\nWait, but NT13 is NT70 followed by NT46. So the expansion would have to go until both NT70 and NT46 have been expanded to terminals.\n\nThat suggests that the first symbols are 't3 t29...' or similar.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to try step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with 't3' which could be from NT3 or NT1. Let's assume it's from NT1.\n\nSo maybe we have a parse tree starting with S -> NT1 NT69, where NT1-> t3, and the remaining NT69 has to generate the rest of the string: 't29 t60 t85 t60 t58 t29 t78 t80 t65 t68 t79 t39 t17 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-328","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's see. The string is \"t31 t85 t23 t40 t58 t34 t28 t42 t54 t0 t44 t80 t18 t7 t33 t29 t65 t60 t0\". \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) work by expanding symbols according to production rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), all the productions are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which makes parsing easier, but I'm not sure if that helps directly here.\n\nThe grammar provided has non-terminals like S, NT13, NT47, etc., leading down to terminals which seem to include 't' followed by numbers and some other letters. Each rule on the left side of the arrow is a non-terminal that can be expanded into two non-terminals or a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some non-terminals expand into terminals like 't' followed by a number. For example, NT46 \u2192 't58' and NT9 \u2192 't0'. So these are terminal symbols. The others expand into two non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t31, which I assume is a terminal symbol. Let's see where that comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT31 \u2192 't50' isn't a direct production, but looking further, there's an NT31 \u2192 NT56 NT61, right? So if NT31 is in the parse, it must be broken down into NT56 and NT61.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree for the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string corresponds to an expansion path in the grammar.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens: t31, t85, t23, t40, t58, t34, t28, t42, t54, t0, t44, t80, t18, t7, t33, t29, t65, t60, t0.\n\nI'll need to check if each of these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nStarting with S, which has two rules from the grammar: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Let me see which of these rules can produce the string.\n\nLooking at the first production, S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Let's see if starting with NT13 can lead to the first token, t31.\n\nNT13 has a production: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So NT13 expands into NT70 and NT46.\n\nThen, let's look at the second production from the given string's first token: t31 comes from either NT56 or something else? Wait, in the grammar, NT31 \u2192 NT56 NT61, but I don't see NT31 as a non-terminal; perhaps I misread. Wait no, looking back, the grammar includes:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT50. Wait, no, let me check. Wait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT31 \u2192 NT50, but that can't be right because NT31 is a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nWait, no, I think NT31 is part of the grammar. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT31 \u2192 NT50, but actually, that's not a typical CNF production because in CNF, each production must have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Wait, wait, the initial grammar is in CNF, so all productions should be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So for NT31, looking at the grammar, I see NT31 \u2192 NT50. Wait, no\u2014that would not be a terminal symbol because NT50 is a non-terminal. But wait, in the given list, some rules end with 't' followed by a number, like NT46 \u2192 't58' or NT77 \u2192 't47', which are terminals.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me re-examine it carefully. I think I got confused when scanning through the rules. So, for example, I see this line: NT31 \u2192 NT50. But wait, that can't be a terminal because NT50 is a non-terminal. Looking further, I see another rule: NT31 \u2192 NT56 NT61. Ah, okay, that's correct for CNF.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought NT31 was producing a terminal 't31'. Looking over again, I don't see any rule like NT31 \u2192 t31. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, let's look for 't31' in the grammar. The last few rules I see are:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't31' \u2014 yes, so NT56 expands to 't31'.\n\nSimilarly, I see NT34 \u2192 't9', NT61 \u2192 't62', and so on.\n\nSo, for the string starting with t31, we need a production that leads to 't31'.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 't31', so perhaps the string starts with an NT56 and an NT... Let me think.\n\nThe string starts with t31, so that would come from NT56. Now, how does the rest of the string continue? Let me see.\n\nThe string is t31, t85, t23, t40, t58, t34, t28, t42, t54, t0, t44, t80, t18, t7, t33, t29, t65, t60, t0.\n\nSo after t31, the next is t85. So after t31, we have t85. How do these tokens connect?\n\nEach token in the string is a terminal, so the derivation would involve a series of non-terminals that expand into these terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each rule expansion is a step where a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, the first step: S can be either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let me consider both options.\n\nOption 1: Start with S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 can produce NT70 NT46 (from NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46). Then, NT70 can produce NT76 NT7 (from NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7). Then, NT76 produces NT79 NT76 (from NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT76), but wait, let me check the actual rules.\n\nWait, I need to clarify. Let me check the production rules for NT76. Looking through the rules, I find: NT77 \u2192 't47' is a terminal. Wait, but that's a terminal, not a non-terminal. Oh, I think I misread that. Let me look again:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47' is a terminal. And looking at S's production, the second option is S \u2192 NT4 NT77. If we take that, S \u2192 NT4 \u2192 't54' (since NT4 \u2192 't54'). Then NT77 is a terminal 't47', which is another token. So that would be 't54 t47', but the string is longer, so that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back. Option 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Then NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, so S becomes NT70 NT46 NT69. Then, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, so S becomes NT76 NT7 NT46 NT69. Then, NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT76 (from NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT76), which seems recursive and potentially problematic, but let's see.\n\nAfter NT79, which is another non-terminal, which might produce NT72 NT6 (from NT79 \u2192 NT72 NT6). NT72 is a terminal, I think. Wait, looking at NT72, I don't see it in the given grammar, so maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's NT65 \u2192 't60', which is a terminal, but not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost in the parsing. Let me approach this differently. Let me pick the start symbol S and see which production can generate the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t31. So I need to find if any production starts with t31. From the grammar, NT56 \u2192 't31' is a production.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My task is to check if the string can be derived by some sequence of these productions starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. My guess is that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so each of these is a literal in the string. Therefore, whenever I see a production that directly produces a terminal (like NT4 \u2192 't54'), that part is straightforward.\n\nI notice that the start symbol is S, which can go to either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So the string must start with either NT13 or NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t23. Let's check the productions for NTs leading to t23. Wait, in the grammar, the production NT23 is defined as NT73 NT41. Then, NT73 is NT9, which is 't44', and NT41 is 't9'. So NT23 = 't44' 't9' which is 't44t9'. \n\nBut the string starts with t23. So how can we get from NT23 to t23? Let's check if there's a production for NT23 that gives t23 directly, but in the grammar, NT23 isn't part of the right-hand sides of any productions. Instead, NT23 goes to NT73 NT41, which doesn't produce t23. That seems problematic.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check the NTs again. Hmm, I think I missed that NT23 is defined as NT73 NT41, but looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT23 that produces t23. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I'm trying to find if any symbol leads directly to t23. Scanning through, I see that NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41, which is 't44' and 't9', so that's 't44 t9', which is 't44t9'. But the first token is 't23', so that's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps NT23 is a non-terminal that can produce t23 via some other path. Let me trace the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me see: If we have NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41, and then each of those NTs can produce something.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT9, which is 't44', and NT41 \u2192 't9', so NT23 produces 't44 t9'. But in the string, the first token is 't23', not 't44 t9'. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first part is t23, but the grammar can't directly produce t23 through any of its productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misread the grammar or made a mistake in understanding which symbols produce t23. Let me check each production rule again thoroughly.\n\nLooking through each rule, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't23'. The production for NT23 is NT73 NT41, which as I saw earlier becomes 't44 t9'. So 't23' doesn't appear as a terminal in any production except where NT23 is part of the right-hand side.\n\nWait, maybe the string is supposed to start with t23, but the grammar doesn't have a production that produces t23. So that would automatically mean the string cannot be generated because S starts with either NT13 or NT4, and neither of those would directly lead to t23.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The grammar's start symbol is S. S can become NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's see what's produced when expanding these.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Then NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. NT7 \u2192 't44'. NT76 \u2192 't79' (if I look at production NT76 \u2192 NT79). So NT70 is 't44' and 't79'. Then NT46 \u2192 t58, so NT13 becomes 't44 t58' followed by 't79'?\n\nWait, let me break it down step by step.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT13 NT69,\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7.\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT79.\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT77.\n\nNow, NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78,\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69,\n\nand so on. This seems convoluted, and I'm not sure if any of these will produce a 't23' at the beginning. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting stuck in the expansion.\n\nGiven that the initial step from S cannot produce a 't23' as the first token, it's impossible for the string to start with t23. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, with B and C not both being the empty string. Also, the start symbol S can only appear on the left-hand side of the productions.\n\nFirst, I should note that in CNF, every string derived from the grammar consists of the start symbol S expanded through a series of productions, and the process stops when only terminal symbols are left. Each production can have at most two non-terminals on the right side. If the right side had more than two, it would still be CNF, but during parsing, it would require more than one production.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each production either ends with two terminals or a non-terminal. For example, NT47 \u2192 NT23 NT41, where both NT23 and NT41 are non-terminals, and then NT23 and NT41 have further productions ending in terminals or other non-terminals. However, some non-terminals seem to directly produce terminals, like NT4 \u2192 't54'. These would correspond to the 't's in the string.\n\nSo, to check if the string can be generated, I can perform a parsing approach, starting from S, expanding non-terminals step by step, ensuring that each expansion matches the string tokens. Since the string has 20 tokens, I need to see if each can be the result of expanding the non-terminals correctly.\n\nBut parsing a potentially ambiguous grammar can be tricky. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parsing can be done using a method like the CYK algorithm, but I might not have the time to implement that for each symbol. Alternatively, I can try to manually trace the derivations step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking at the string: `t23 t44 t85 t0 t34 t42 t84 t79 t79 t78 t42 t17 t54 t80 t42 t17 t34 t71 t62 t58`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So S must start with either NT13 followed by NT69 or NT4 followed by NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't23'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't23'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41. NT73 \u2192 t9, and NT41 \u2192 t9. But wait, no, I think I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41\n\nBut looking for how NT23 produces a terminal. It doesn't directly. Wait, perhaps other non-terminals lead to NT23.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's check which production rule directly produces 't23' or leads to it.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't23'. So perhaps 't23' is the result of a non-terminal that eventually reduces to it. Wait, looking at NT23's production:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41\n\nThen, looking at NT73: NT73 \u2192 t9.\n\nAnd NT41: NT41 \u2192 t9.\n\nSo, NT23 \u2192 t9 t9, but that's not 't23'. So 't23' doesn't appear in any of the productions directly as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I need to find a non-terminal that eventually can produce 't23'. Maybe I should look for how 't23' is generated.\n\nWait, perhaps the production rule for NT23 includes 't23'? Or maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a parse tree starting from the string and see if it can be built using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find which symbols can produce the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each production splits the non-terminals into two. So each step of the derivation splits a non-terminal into two parts, each of which must be expanded into terminals. Therefore, the length of the derivation tree could be tracked.\n\nThe string has 20 't's, but in the grammar, each production reduces the number of non-terminals by one. Since we start with one non-terminal (S), and each step adds one non-terminal, the maximum possible length is 2^n -1 where n is the number of productions, but perhaps it's better to see how the string's tokens can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write out possible expansions starting from S.\n\nLet me first note down the string tokens:\n\n1: t23\n\n2: t44\n\n3: t85\n\n4: t0\n\n5: t34\n\n6: t42\n\n7: t84\n\n8: t79\n\n9: t79\n\n10: t78\n\n11: t42\n\n12: t17\n\n13: t54\n\n14: t80\n\n15: t42\n\n16: t17\n\n17: t34\n\n18: t71\n\n19: t62\n\n20: t58\n\nNow, S can be NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nI'll try both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's assume S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be derived from NT13 and NT69. Looking at the string, the first token is t23.\n\nSo NT13 should derive into t23... Wait, does NT13 produce t23?\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT13:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nThen NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n\nNT76 \u2192 t79\n\nNT7 \u2192 t44\n\nSo NT70 \u2192 t79 t44\n\nThen NT46 \u2192 t58\n\nSo NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46 \u2192 t79 t44 t58\n\nWait, but in the first step, the first token is t23, which doesn't fit here. So S \u2192 NT13 NT69 would start with t79, t44, t58, which doesn't match the string starting with t23.\n\nSo perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, let's see: first, NT4 \u2192 't54', which is token 14: t54. The string starts with t23, which is token 1. So even if the first production is NT4, which produces 't54', which isn't the first token. So this approach seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the string starts with t23. So in the derivation, the first token must be a terminal, which must come from a non-terminal that ultimately produces t23. But in the given grammar, does any non-terminal directly produce t23?\n\nLooking through the rules for t23:\n\nLooking at all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't23'. The rules that produce 't's are for NT5, NT4, etc. For example, NT4 \u2192 't54', NT3 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps 't23' is the result of a non-terminal that is expanded through several steps, each of which is a binary split, and finally ends up producing 't23'. For example, maybe some NT eventually splits into t23, perhaps through a chain.\n\nLet me check NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41. Then NT73 \u2192 t9, NT41 \u2192 t9, so NT23 \u2192 t9 t9. Not t23. Wait, but maybe the parsing builds up more steps. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to see if 't23' can be the result of a non-terminal. Wait, in the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't23'. But perhaps through the rules, a non-terminal can be split into multiple non-terminals until a 't' is reached.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's impossible for the grammar to generate 't23' because none of the non-terminals expand into it. Therefore, the string may not be in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and overlooked a production for 't23'. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules provided:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41\n\nAnd NT73 \u2192 t9, NT41 \u2192 t9. So NT23 can't produce 't23'.\n\nSimilarly, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal directly produces 't23' or any leading up to it."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But since it's a long string, I might need to work backwards, trying to parse the string using the given rules.\n\nParsing with a top-down approach, starting from S. The string starts with t28, but looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see any rule that produces 't28'. Wait, looking through the rules, I notice a rule: NT76 \u2192 't79'. Also, NT7 \u2192 't23'. Hmm, but 't28' isn't directly a terminal in the grammar. Let me check if I missed any. Scanning through all the rules, I don't see any production that directly outputs 't28'. That's a problem because if 't28' isn't in the grammar's terminals, then it can't be generated.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure I didn't skip a rule. Looking through all the rules, I see NT76 \u2192 't79', NT7 \u2192 't23', but I don't see any production that gives 't28'. That seems like a red flag. If the string starts with 't28', which isn't a terminal in the grammar, then the string can't be generated by any derivation because the grammar can't produce 't28' directly or through any intermediate rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me double-check. scrolling through all the rules again, no 't28' is present. So the first token is 't28' which can't be derived from the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't28', but 't28' is not a terminal in the grammar, so it can't be generated.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-392","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's see. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar here starts with S and has several rules leading into various non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like 't62 t18...', and I need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I think about how the grammar works. Each non-terminal can split into two non-terminals or a terminal. The string provided seems to consist of terminals, so the challenge is to see if each terminal can be generated by some production rule.\n\nI start by looking for terminals in the grammar and seeing how they correspond to parts of the string. For example, I notice that NT1 -> 't3', which is a terminal. So 't3' would come from NT1. Similarly, NT4 \u2192 't54', so 't54' comes from NT4, and so on.\n\nThe given string is: `t62 t18 t17 t18 t28 t72 t9 t34 t62 t33 t68 t50 t54 t17 t60 t3 t78 t18 t39 t68 t48 t23`.\n\nBreaking this down, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So the first step is to identify which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nLet's go through each terminal in the string and see if they match any production rules.\n\n1. t62: Looking for NT where the production is 't62'. Scanning the rules, I see NT23 \u2192 't9' and NT12 \u2192 't81', etc., but nothing directly gives 't62'. Wait, maybe through non-terminals that lead to 't62'. Looking at rules, I see NT62 \u2192 't71'? No, wait, looking again. The grammar has NT62 \u2192 't71'? No, wait, the given list: looking for NT whose production is 't62'. Let's check each rule where a terminal is on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, I'll scan all the rules for production's right-hand side being a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't10'? Wait, no, looking again. Wait, the rules: I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't62' \u2014 that's one. So NT56 can produce 't62'. Okay, so when the string has t62, it must come from NT56.\n\n2. t18: Looking for rules that produce 't18'. Checking the rules, I see NT42 \u2192 't68', NT18 \u2192 't43', and looking through, maybe NT18 is involved. Wait, no, looking again: The rules for 't18' \u2014 wait, no, in the rules, I see NT61 \u2192 't17', NT70 \u2192 't76', etc. Hmm, wait, let me look for any rule where the RHS is 't18'. For example, I see NT5 \u2192 't39' but that's not it. Wait, maybe NT18 is a non-terminal that itself can produce a terminal or split further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't18'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't44'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, no, checking each line:\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\n\nNT6 -> 't18' \u2014 wait, I see NT6 in the rules: looking at the grammar, I see a line: NT61 \u2192 't62', another: NT6 \u2192 't18'? Wait, looking back: Yes, in the provided grammar, there's a line: NT6 \u2192 't18'. So that's one. So when we have 't18' in the string, it comes from NT6, which can produce 't18'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me make sure. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't18' \u2014 yes.\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't40'\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't9'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't47'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't71'\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me scan all the production rules to find which produce terminals.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT13 or S -> NT4 NT77: But these are non-terminals combining, not terminals.\n\n2. NT47 -> NT66 NT29: Both non-terminals, no terminal.\n\n3. NT45 -> NT46 NT36: Non-terminals.\n\n4. NT18 -> NT49 NT80: Non-terminals.\n\n5. NT13 -> NT70 NT46: Non-terminals.\n\n6. NT69 -> NT23 NT6: NT69 is a non-terminal. Its RHS is NT23 and 't6' \u2014 so here's a terminal. So 't6' is produced by NT69, because NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6 and NT6 \u2192 't18'. Wait, but no, the RHS of NT69 is a combination of non-terminals and a terminal? Wait, no, the rule is NT69 -> NT23 NT6. It doesn't directly produce a terminal. Wait, but NT6 is a non-terminal that can produce 't18'. So NT69 would produce NT23 and NT6, which when processed further, would give 't18' for NT6, but wait, the RHS of NT69 doesn't contain a terminal, just two non-terminals. Hmm, that's a problem. Because to have a terminal in the string, the derivation must replace all non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The production NT69 is defined as NT23 NT6. So if NT23 can produce a terminal, then NT69 would produce that terminal. Or does it have to be that NT69 can directly produce 't18'?\n\nWait, looking at NT69's production: NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6. So to get a terminal from NT69, both NT23 and NT6 must be terminals, which they are not. Because NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41 and NT6 \u2192 't18', but NT41 is another non-terminal. So perhaps this production can't directly produce a terminal, but this would mean that NT69 can't produce a terminal, which would complicate things because the string has 't6'?\n\nWait, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me look again at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n\n- NT7 -> NT44, but wait, NT7's production is?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, line by line:\n\n1. S-> NT13 NT13\n\n2. S-> NT4 NT77\n\n3. NT47 -> NT66 NT29\n\n4. NT45-> NT46 NT36\n\n5. NT18-> NT49 NT80\n\n6. NT13-> NT70 NT46\n\n7. NT69-> NT23 NT6\n\nWait, line 7: NT69-> NT23 NT6. So the RHS is two non-terminals, so this rule can't directly produce a terminal. Similarly, other rules:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, the only terminals are:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n\n- NT7 -> 't44'\n\n- NT4-> 't54'\n\n- NT3-> 't10'\n\n- NT41-> 't9'\n\n- NT21-> 't73'\n\n- NT73-> 't9'\n\n- NT50 is mentioned but perhaps as a terminal when it appears in production rules? Wait, looking back: NT15-> 't42'? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar rules:\n\nLine looking for terminal on RHS:\n\nLooking for any rule where RHS is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n\n- NT10 -> NT68 NT58; both non-terminals.\n\n- NT18-> NT49 NT80"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-407","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string to check is `t54 t60 t47 t3 t7 t28 t9 t47 t39 t58 t85 t58 t60 t79 t29 t50 t54 t47 t85 t44 t23 t81 t54`. \n\nFirst, I notice that each token in the string is either a non-terminal symbol or a terminal ('t' followed by a number). In CNF, terminals are the end points of the derivations, so the entire string must be formed by terminals produced from non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules like S -> NT13 NT69, S -> NT4 NT77, etc. Each step involves non-terminals splitting into other non-terminals until they eventually reach terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t54, which I see in the grammar: NT41 -> 't9', but also look for where 't54' appears. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT4 -> 't54'. So 't4' would produce 't54'. But that's not the start of the string. Wait, no, looking again, the rule NT4 -> 't54' exists. So 't4' can be replaced by 't54'.\n\nBut let's parse the string step by step. The string starts with t54, which is a terminal, so it must come from a production where one of the non-terminals produces it. Similarly, the end of the string is another t54.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backward from the string, trying to find a sequence of productions that can generate it. Alternatively, I can also try to parse the string using the grammar, seeing if each part can be derived.\n\nBut since parsing can be complex, maybe I can look for the number of symbols. The string has 21 symbols, each being either a terminal or a non-terminal, but in the grammar, non-terminals are prefixed with 'NT'. For example, NT13, NT69, etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the tokens are 't54', 't60', etc. So these are terminals, meaning they must be leaves in the parse tree.

No, wait looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, here's the relevant part: NT60 -> NT38 NT18, and in the production for NT38, it's 't47'.

{"custom_id":"request-411","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has some specific characteristics. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't produce any terminals directly. So, looking at the grammar provided, I should check if all the productions fit this structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most production rules seem to fit. They have two non-terminals on the right side, except for a few that have terminals. Wait, some of the rules have a terminal and a non-terminal, like S -> NT13 NT69. So that's fine because in CNF, the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So the grammar appears to be in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to see if the string provided can be derived from the start symbol S. The string given is: `t18 t33 t3 t85 t50 t24 t80 t0 t47 t24 t40 t50 t62 t54 t68 t80 t0 t39 t39 t72 t81 t47 t84`.\n\nI think the standard approach is to try to parse the string from left to right, matching the symbols with the productions. Since it's a context-free grammar, top-down parsing (like using the CYK algorithm) would be appropriate, but maybe I can try a more manual approach since the string isn't too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help. Let's see.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S can be split into NT47 NT4 or NT69 NT6. So the initial productions from S are two non-terminals, each followed by another non-terminal. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Wait, in the initial grammar, I'm a bit confused because I'm listed all the  production rules, not just under S. Wait, no, the grammar provided has multiple rules, I think I misread it before. Wait, wait, actually, the grammar in the problem is given as a set of productions, each starting with a symbol, like S \u2192 NT13 NT69, etc. So the start symbol is S, and it can be replaced by either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, to generate the string, the first step is to choose between these two options. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So the first two symbols of the string must be the result of expanding NT13 and NT69.\n\nWait, but NT13 and NT69 are non-terminals as well, so we'll need to expand them further.\n\nLooking back at the productions, NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, and NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nWait, so the first part after S is NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, which would expand into two more non-terminals. The next terms in the string are t18, t33, t3, etc. Hmm, but let's see if the expansion of NT13 can produce t18.\n\nLooking at NT70's productions: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. Wait, that's in the productions, right? So NT70 expands into two non-terminals. But the terminal symbols start with t18, which would require one of these productions to directly produce a terminal or a path that leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, some of the productions have terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 't39', NT4 \u2192 't54', etc. So the terminals are the a's in the normal CNF where a production can produce a terminal. So, any production rule that ends with a terminal symbol would correspond to a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nSo, I should try to see how each part of the string can be generated.\n\nLet me outline each production:\n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nWe'll need to check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's try S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nThen the string starts with t18. So t18 should be matched by one of the leaves of NT13 or NT69, or a combination of their expansions.\n\nBut wait, t18 is a terminal symbol, so either NT13 or NT69 must derive t18 through their productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7, NT7 \u2192 t44.\n\nSo, NT70 can't directly produce t18. Wait, but looking at other NT70 productions... Wait, I think I need to check all possible productions from NT13, NT69, etc., to see if any of them can produce 't18'.\n\nLooking at NT13:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70's productions are NT76 NT7 and NT7 \u2192 t44. So NT70 as a whole can't produce a terminal, it produces two non-terminals until they can derive a terminal. So expanding NT70 will eventually produce t44, which is a t44, not t18.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT46 does.\n\nLooking up NT46: It's listed as NT46 \u2192 t58, right? Because in the productions, I see 'NT46 -> 't58''. So NT46 can directly produce 't58'.\n\nSo, from NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, when fully expanded, it will produce something like (something derived from NT70) t58. But we need it to produce t18.\n\nWait, but looking at NT13's expansion: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, which leads to NT70 producing some non-terminals, but to get t18, it must appear somewhere in a chain that starts from NT13.\n\nSo, perhaps we can follow the expansion of NT13.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try the second option first, S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the first part of the string would be matched by NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 't54', so that can produce t54.\n\nBut the string starts with t18, which would require that either NT4 or NT77 (or somehow a combination) can produce t18.\n\nWait, maybe that's not possible. So perhaps S must expand via NT13 NT69.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me check:\n\nFrom the initial S, the first production is S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Then, for t18 to appear, perhaps the first non-terminal (NT13) needs to derive t18 somehow. But NT13's expansion goes through NT70 and NT46, which can't produce t18 directly.\n\nWait, looking more closely, perhaps I've missed something. Let's check the NT13 production again. NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Then, I need to expand NT70 and NT46.\n\nBut what about NT70's productions:\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 or NT76 can expand into other things?\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I don't see NT76, but perhaps I need to check the grammar again for any other rules.\n\nWait, yes, looking at the list:\n\nIn the grammar, NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6, and NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41, etc.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing some paths. Wait, I'm going to look for any rule where a terminal is the left-hand side, like NT5 \u2192 't39', which would mean NT5 directly produces 't39'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't80'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't78'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't80'\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, that's important. So NT46 can produce 't58' directly.\n\nSo, going back: Let's try again.\n\nS can expand as NT34 \u2192 't9'.\n\nWait, but I'm getting mixed up. Let's think step by step.\n\nWe have the string: t18 t33 t3 t85 t50 t24... etc.\n\nWe need to parse this string from left to right, following the grammar.\n\nLet me think of this as a sequence:\n\n1. t18\n\n2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-428","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t71 t3 t34 t34 t84 t34 t40 t34 t31 t78 t60 t24 t42 t31 t31 t47 t34 t17 t42 t7 t31 t72 t0 t68`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. That should make parsing easier. I'll note that some of the productions directly result in terminal symbols, indicated by 't' followed by a number or 't' alone.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is rewritten as NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So any valid sentence starts with one of these two options.\n\nThe string starts with 't71', which I notice is a terminal symbol. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT62 -> t71. So the first part of the string must come from NT62. Let me write that: NT62 starts, which ends with 't71'. So the first part of the string is covered.\n\nNext, I look at the rest of the string and try to find a way to parse it using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't71', the next token is 't3'. From the grammar, NT77 -> t3. So that's possible. But wait, the first expansion from S would be NT4 NT77 or NT13 NT69. So the string needs to come from one of these options.\n\nWait, the first part is 't71', which comes from NT62. But S is rewritten as NT4 NT77 or NT13 NT69. So for S to start, the first symbols should be a combination of these. But the first symbol here is 't71', which can't be obtained directly from NT4 or NT13, unless those non-terminals can somehow produce t71, but looking at the grammar, neither NT4 nor NT13 expand into 't71'. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT62. The production NT62 -> t71. But S is derived into NT47 and NT69, or other combinations. So the initial step is S -> NT47 NT69 or others. So 't71' would have to come from a non-terminal that's a child of S. That suggests that maybe I'm looking at a substring that's part of a larger production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, perhaps using a recursive descent parser or similar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to break down the string into components that match the grammar.\n\nStarting over, the string is:\n\nt71, t3, t34, t34, t84, t34, t40, t34, t31, t78, t60, t24, t42, t31, t31, t47, t34, t17, t42, t7, t31, t72, t0, t68.\n\nBreaking this into possible segments. The first token is t71, which is from NT62. Let's look at the grammar for NT62: NT62 -> t71. So S can derive to something that starts with NT62, but S itself doesn't directly produce t71. So perhaps the entire string is derived from a production that includes NT62 as part of it.\n\nWait, no. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the entire string must be derived from the start symbol S through the productions.\n\nLooking at S, it's either NT47 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So the first two non-terminals would start the derivation. Let's assume S -> NT47 NT69. Then, each of these non-terminals would need to expand into the corresponding string.\n\nBut the string starts with t71, which would have to come from NT62, which isn't directly part of S's first production. Similarly, S could be NT4 NT77, which would mean the first two symbols come from NT4 and NT77.\n\nBut NT4's productions are NT47 -> NT70 NT46, and so on, but looking at the string, after t71 is t3. So perhaps the initial part is NT77 -> t3.\n\nWait, NT77's only production is -> 't47'. But no, in the grammar, NT77 is rewritten as 't47' once, but also has another production NT77 -> NT51 NT78. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78\n\nAnd another production for NT77:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nWait, that might be an error, because both can't be true unless one produces a terminal and the other a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me look again carefully.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at NT77: \n\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78  \n NT77 -> 't47'\n\nSo yes, NT77 can produce either NT51 NT78 or 't47'. That's fine in CNF.\n\nSo, in that case, to get a terminal 't47', we can use NT77. Similarly, 't3' comes from NT77 -> 't47' (no, that's 't47', which is different). Let me check other NTs.\n\nLooking for terminal 't3', I see in the grammar:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't3'. I find NT31 -> 't50', but that doesn't help. Other entries:\n\nLooking for 't3' as a terminal, perhaps somewhere. Oh, I see:\n\nNT31 -> 't50'  \nNT33 -> 't85'  \nNT78 -> 't33'  \nNT73 -> 't9'  \nNT46 -> 't58'  \nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT23 -> 't73'  \nNT78 -> 't5'  \nWait, no, let me check each line carefully.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'  \nAnd also NT77 has another production, so that's fine.\n\nOther NTs:\n\nNT37 -> 't40' (if present) \u2013 do I see that?

{"custom_id":"request-424","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t9 t62 t58 t29 t71 t80 t78 t44 t71 t24 t48 t54 t71 t33 t31 t47 t54 t50 t48 t7 t17 t80 t81 t72`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and see how the string can be derived from it. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the terminal symbols are things like 't9', 't62', etc. Each of these is a single terminal. The non-terminals are all the others, like S, NT13, NT47, etc., except for those that end with 't', which are terminals.\n\nThe start symbol seems to be S because the first rule is S -> NT13 NT69. So, S is the root.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a sequence of terminals: `t9 t62 t58 t29 t71 t80 t78 t44 t71 t24 t48 t54 t71 t33 t31 t47 t54 t50 t48 t7 t17 t80 t81 t72`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. In CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so the derivation will generate a tree where each node has exactly two children. The string must be a result of applying productions step by step until all non-terminals are resolved to terminals.\n\nOne approach is to use the concept of the CYK algorithm, but since this might be time-consuming, I'll try to find a bottom-up or recursive way to see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each production rule as needing to generate pairs of non-terminals. For each production that generates a pair of symbols, we can split the string accordingly and check if each part is valid.\n\nAnother idea is to represent the string as a sequence and recursively check each rule. For example, the first symbol is 't9', which comes from a production rule. Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 is a terminal, and 't9' appears in a few productions:\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT9 can go to NT46 NT62 or NT58 NT61 or NT77 NT4 or NT9 NT45 or others. Wait, let me check each rule:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT45 -> NT46 NT36\n- NT5 -> NT38 NT74\n- NT68 -> NT12 NT69\n- And so on.\n\nWait, the terminal symbols are things like 't9', 't62', etc. So, 't9' is directly produced by some NT rules.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT9:\n\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45 (wait, but checking the given rules, let me go through them. The rules provided are as follows:\n\nNT9 appears in several productions:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT69\n- NT9 -> NT31 NT45\n- NT9 -> NT46 NT62\n- NT5 -> NT83 NT9 (but that's for NT5; not NT9)\n- Wait, no\u2014looking back:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, I need to carefully list each production rule to see how 't9' is generated.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT9 -> NT31 NT45\n- NT9 -> NT46 NT62\n- NT5 -> NT83 NT9 (this is for NT5, not NT9)\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- Wait, let's see the first few productions:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\n\nThen NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nWait, let me go one by one:\n\nLooking for NT9 rules: I think in the rules, NT9 is present as:\n\n- NT9 -> NT31 NT45\n- NT9 -> NT46 NT62\n\nAlso, looking for other NT9 productions, perhaps more via other rules.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT9 -> NT46 NT62\n\n- NT9 -> NT31 NT45\n\nWait, that's in the rules.\n\nAdditionally, maybe NT9 is part of other productions. For example, NT5 -> NT83 NT9, but that's for NT5.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, 't9' can be generated by NT9, and NT9 can be derived from either NT31 NT45 or NT46 NT62.\n\nSo, to start, our string begins with 't9', which presumably comes from a production like NT9 -> 't46' 't62', where 't46' is 't46' and 't62' is 't62'. Wait, no: NT9 can be split as (NT31 NT45) which would become 't46' (from NT45 perhaps?) or (NT46 NT62) which is 't46' 't62'.\n\nWait, no: let's think about what each part becomes. If 't9' comes from NT9 -> (something). Let's say the first part is NT9, then the string must have been split as 't9' followed by other parts, but maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer to think of each production starting from the start symbol S and seeing where the string can fit.\n\nBut since the string is a linear sequence, maybe it's better to approach it by seeing if the entire string can be covered by a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can try to split the string into pairs of symbols each corresponding to a production.\n\nAnother approach is to try to reconstruct the parse tree bottom-up. However, that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in CNF produces two symbols, we can model the string as a tree where each node has two children. Starting from the start symbol S, each step splits into two parts, each of which needs to be valid.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire string has a length of 23 symbols (including 't72'), but since S starts with two symbols, each step produces two parts. Let's see how many levels deep this might be.\n\nWait, the string length is 23 symbols. Since each production applies to two symbols, the start symbol S must produce two parts, each of which may themselves produce two parts, etc. So the number of levels should satisfy 2^n = 23 + 1? Wait, no, maybe it's better to compute the number of symbols as 2^k - 1. Let me check: 2^5 = 32, so 31 symbols. 23 is less than that, but perhaps the string isn't a perfectly balanced tree. Alternatively, perhaps the string's length doesn't fit neatly into a binary tree structure, which suggests that it might not be a valid derivation, but I need to check more thoroughly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to look for a possible parse by trying to apply the productions.\n\nLet me see the string again: `t9 t62 t58 t29 t71 t80 t78 t44 t71 t24 t48 t54 t71 t33 t31 t47 t54 t50 t48 t7 t17 t80 t81 t72`.\n\nSo, 23 tokens.\n\nSince each production is two non-terminals, the total number of symbols (including the start symbol) being derived would be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. Wait, not exactly, but in terms of the parse tree, the number of leaves would be 2^k, where each application doubles the number of nodes. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, each production takes two non-terminals and replaces them with two symbols or two non-terminals. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to see where each terminal symbol can come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals produce other non-terminals, which in turn produce terminals or other non-terminals. So, to get a terminal, we need a production that directly replaces a non-terminal with that terminal.\n\nLooking for the terminals in the string:\n\nThe string has 't9', 't62', 't58', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the 't's correspond to productions where the non-terminal is replaced by a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT5 -> 't38' 't74' (well, wait, looking again, I think some rules are like NT10 -> NT68 NT58, but where do the 't's come from?\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n- NT70 -> NT76 NT7\n- NT76 -> NT79\n- NT79 -> NT5 NT16\n- NT77 -> 't47'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

If 't60' is in the string, but there's no production that directly yields 't60', then the grammar can't generate the string.

{"custom_id":"request-452","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t18 t72 t85 t72 t28 t6 t85 t29 t9 t6 t43 t7 t40 t50 t39 t33 t6 t84 t50 t34 t65 t24 t7 t47 t60`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is left-angled, like A -> BC, and terminals are also allowed as final productions. The given grammar seems to have various non-terminals that eventually produce terminal strings, ending up with 't' followed by some number.\n\nThe string starts with 't18', which suggests that one of the productions leads directly to that. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT13 -> 't3' and NT1 -> 't3', as well as others. Hmm, let me check the productions for NT18.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I find that NT18 -> NT49 NT80, and each of these has their own productions. NT49 -> 't40', NT80 -> 't43'. So the sequence t40 t43 would come from NT18. But the string starts with t18, so maybe the start symbol S produces something that eventually leads to NT18.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce NT47 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's see what NT47 and NT69 produce. NT47 -> NT66 NT29. NT66 is from a production that goes to NT13 NT1, and NT13 -> NT70 NT46, and NT70 -> NT76 NT7, etc. This seems a bit long.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, after t18, we have t72. So, if NT47 produces t84, then maybe NT47 somewhere on the production line. Wait, NT47 has a production to NT66 NT29, but I don't see any direct terminal. Hmm, maybe another path.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I missed some rules. Let me scan through the grammar rules again. Oh, there's NT77 -> 't47'. So if any production leads to NT77, then 't47' would be produced. That could help.\n\nAnother thought: the string ends with 't60', so I need to find a non-terminal that produces 't60'. Looking at the rules, NT10 -> NT68 NT58. NT68 -> NT12 NT69, and NT12 -> NT38 NT67, NT38 -> 't47', and NT67 -> 't6'. So NT12 would produce 't47' and 't6', right? But where does 't60' come from?\n\nWait, looking at NT60: NT60 -> NT38 NT18. NT38 -> 't47', NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80 \u2192 't40' and 't43'. So that would give us 't47 t40 t43' somewhere in the string. But the string has 't60' towards the end. Maybe another route.\n\nLooking for 't60', I see NT60 has a production to NT38 NT18, which gives 't47 t40 t43'. Or is there another production elsewhere leading to 't60'? Wait, maybe I missed one. Let me check: yes, 'NT60 -> NT38 NT18.' So 't47 t40 t43' and 't18' again. Hmm, not matching 't60' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should break down the entire string step by step to see if it can be derived from the productions. The string is quite long, so it's going to take time.\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\n1. t18: So we need to find a production that starts with t18. Looking at the grammar, NT18 is one of the non-terminals, but I don't see NT18 -> anything that starts with 't18'. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, I don't see any production that directly gives 't18' except maybe through other non-terminals. So perhaps the production that brings us closest is NT18 -> NT49 NT80, which then becomes 't40 t43', but that doesn't match 't18'. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol S can produce NT47 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's explore NT4 NT77.\n\nNT47 has productions leading to NT66 NT29, etc., which eventually might result in 't84' and other t's, but I need to reach 't18'.\n\nAlternatively, NT77 -> 't47', which would give 't47', not helpful for 't18'.\n\nWait, is there a production that directly gives 't18'? Looking through all the rules, I don't see a production where a non-terminal becomes 't18' directly. So I'm a bit confused.\n\nBut wait, maybe S can produce NT4 NT77. Let's see: NT4 -> 't54', which is not helpful, and NT77 -> 't47'. So combining 't54 t47' doesn't give 't18'.\n\nAlternatively, starting with NT18: NT18 -> NT49 NT80, which is 't40 t43', but that's not 't18'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the structure. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT9 -> NT46 NT62, and NT46 -> 't58', NT62 -> 't71', so NT9 would produce 't58 t71'. Hmm, not helpful for t18.\n\nWait, maybe the production chain involves more rules. Let me try to map out a possible derivation.\n\nThe string's first token is 't18', which must come from some non-terminal. Looking at the productions, perhaps NT1 or NT4 can do that.\n\nLooking at NT1 -> 't3' and NT4 -> 't54'. So starting with NT1 or NT4, but 't18' is not one of those.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the string is generated, but the breakdown requires multiple steps. Let me try to see if the string can be split into parts derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t18 t72 t85 t72 t28 t6 t85 t29 t9 t6 t43 t7 t40 t50 t39 t33 t6 t84 t50 t34 t65 t24 t7 t47 t60.\n\nLet me split it into segments that might correspond to non-terminals. For example:\n\n- t18: Perhaps from NT18, which can split into 't40 t43', so that could be t40 t43: t40 is 't40', t43 is 't43', but the string starts with t18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't18' comes from a longer chain. Let me see if any non-terminals can produce 't18' indirectly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see a production that leads to 't18' directly, so maybe the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t18. Since none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't18', and all paths seem to involve 't3' or other ts. Therefore, it's impossible for the grammar to derive the string starting with t18 because that production is not available.\n\nWait, but in the rules, I'm not sure. Let me check again: NT37 is present but no production starts with 't18'. So if no production leads to t18, then the string can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is quite long, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should make parsing a bit more manageable.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The string starts with 't6', so that's the first part. Looking at the grammar, I see 't6' is produced by the production NT66 -> 't6'. So the first symbol in the string matches the first part of some production.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the production for NT66 is NT66 -> 't1', but 't6' is a separate production. Let me check. Hmm, in the grammar, I see NT66 -> 't1', and 't6' is NT66? Or is it another rule.\n\nWait, no. Let's list out the rules that produce terminals. Looking through the grammar rules, the terminals are symbols like 't50', 't9', 't3', etc., and 't6', 't29', 't28', etc.\n\nFor example:\n- NT53 -> 't80' (twice)\n- NT53 also has another production, but that's the terminal one.\n- Others like NT5 -> 't39', NT4 -> 't54', NT34 -> 't78', and so on.\n\nThe string starts with 't6 t29 ...'.

Let me check where 't6' comes from.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT60 -> NT38 NT18, and NT60 also has another production. Wait, no, I'm looking for terminals. Wait, no, actually, looking directly, I don't see a rule where NT is directly producing 't6'. So perhaps my mistake: perhaps 't6' comes from some non-terminal that produces it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT with the terminals. Let me clarify: in the grammar, the non-terminals are prefixed with NT. The terminals do not have that prefix; they are just like 't5', 't6', etc.\n\nLooking at the productions, I can spot where terminals appear. For example, NT66 can produce 't1', but I don't see any rule for NT66 producing 't6'. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT66 -> 't1' is under NT66, but I'm not sure about 't6'. Let me go through the grammar again to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, maybe I missed the rule for 't6'. Let me scan through the entire list.\n\nYes, here's the relevant part:\n- NT66 -> 't1' (from line 129)\n- NT5 -> 't39' and 't3' (from lines 113, 165)\n- NT4 -> 't54' (line 145)\n- NT68 -> 't12' (line 169)\nWait, no, the string starts with 't6', so perhaps 't6' is an output of some NT. Wait, in the list I have:\n\nLooking through the rules, I think I have to find which non-terminals produce 't6'. Wait, I don't see any rule where NTx produces 't6'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again:\n\n- NT42 -> 't68' (line 146)\n- NT62 -> 't71' (line 163)\n- NT77 -> 't47' (line 147)\n- NT78 -> 't5', 't6'? Wait, no, for NT77, I see in line 83: NT77 -> 't47', and in line 106: NT77 -> 't34'. Wait, no, line 106 says NT77 -> 't34', but line 94 says NT77 -> NT51 NT78. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, looking at line 17: NT78 -> NT5 NT16. Line 26: NT75 -> NT45 NT80. Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing 't6' anywhere. Maybe the first term in the string is 't6', which is problematic because I don't see a production that directly starts with 't6' as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe 't6' is a result of a longer derivation starting from S. Let me think about how the string starts. The string is t6 t29 t28 t33... So it's a sequence of terminals. Maybe these terminals are produced by a series of NTs.\n\nTo check, I'll try to find a leftmost derivation. Starting from S, which can expand into either NT13 NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT4 or something else, but wait, looking at the rules, the start is S -> NT13 NT13 or S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, let me confirm the start symbols again. The grammar starts with S, which can go to NT13 NT13 (line 24) or NT4 NT77 (line 35). So any derivation starts from one of these two.\n\nThe initial string starts with 't6', so let's see if that can be produced by either NT13 or NT4.\n\nLooking at NT13: it can produce NT13 -> NT66 NT46 (line 134). NT66 can produce 't1', which is under NT66 (line 129). So if NT13 produces NT66 NT46, which produces 't1' and 't58' respectively. Wait, NT47 -> 't58' as per line 152. So NT13 -> NT66 NT46 can produce 't1 t58'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't6', so that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe NT13 can produce other things.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I made a mistake. NT13 can produce NT13 -> NT66 NT46 (line 134), or NT13 -> NT32 NT21 (line 100). NT66 -> 't1' (line 129), so that would give 't1 t59' (since NT46 is part of line 152, which is NT46 -> 't58'). But again, that's 't1 t58', not 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong rules. Let me see which NTs produce 't6'. Wait, looking through all the lines, I don't immediately spot any NT that directly produces 't6'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, looking back: line 165 says NT5 -> 't39' and 't3' (line 113 and 165), but not 't6'. Line 152 is NT46 -> 't58'. Line 172: NT26 -> 't42' (line 162). Line 156: NT77 -> 't47', etc. Hmm, perhaps 't6' is a terminal that's part of some non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's produced by NT13 or NT1? Let me check NT13's expansions again: NT13 can expand to NT66 NT46 or NT32 NT21. NT66 is 't1', NT46 is 't58' as per NT46 -> 't58' in line 152.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT13 can go to NT32 NT21, which would produce NT32 and NT21. Looking at NT32, it can produce NT13 NT1 (line 106), which would then produce 't1' and 't3' perhaps, but not 't6'.\n\nWait, maybe NT32 -> NT13 NT1. So NT13 is S -> NT13 NT13 or NT4 NT77. Alternatively, maybe NT4 can start.\n\nWait, let's consider the other option for S: S -> NT4 NT77. NT4 can produce NT47 -> 't9' (line 140). So S can produce NT47 NT77.\n\nWait, but 't6' is the first symbol in the string. Let me see what NT47 can produce. Looking at the rules, NT47 can produce NT56 NT61 (line 137) or NT46 NT62 (line 153), or even directly 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single terminal symbol on the left with two non-terminals on the right. The string we need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so we'll have to see if we can break it down according to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the string to have it clearly in front of me: `t24 t47 t18 t0 t6 t6 t78 t60 t71 t80 t3 t3 t60 t79 t71 t29 t43 t47 t28 t7 t48 t18 t81 t18 t54 t6`.\n\nI remember that in a Chomsky normal form grammar, the top-down approach involves using the start symbol, which in this case is S, and applying productions step by step to expand it into the string. Each step should replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and this continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, and according to the two rules provided, S can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, the string should begin with either \"t24\" and \"t69\" or \"t4\" and \"t77\". Wait, let me check what these terminals correspond to.\n\nWait, no, the terminals in the string are 't24', 't47', etc., which are not directly in the NT's. Hmm, maybe I need to look up which NT rules produce these terminals. Each rule in the grammar ends with either a terminal or a production for NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some NT rules produce terminals. For example, NT4 is 't54', NT24 isn't present, but let's see.\n\nWait, I think I need to map which NT rules produce which terminals. Let me list all the NT->terminal productions:\n\n- NT1 -> 't3'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT7 -> 't65'\n- NT7 -> 't44' (another one)\n- NT8 -> 't43' (Is there an NT8?)\nWait, I don't see NT8 in the grammar, so maybe that's not present. Let me check all NTs with terminals:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT41 -> 't9'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT44 -> 't65' (from NT7, seems duplicate)\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT5 -> 't39', 't83', 't65' (multiple rules)\n- NT7 -> 't44', 't65'\n- NT10 -> 't68', 't58'\n- NT18 -> 't43', 't71'\n- NT31 -> 't50', 't50' again?\n- NT32 -> 't11', 't24'\nAh, there we go. So, NT32 has 't24' as one of its productions. Similarly, NT69 has 't6' as a terminal (from NT66 -> NT13, NT1 -> 't3', etc.)\n\nWait, looking at the NT32 rule: `NT32 -> NT11 | NT24`, so yes, it can produce 't24' and when that's the case, in the string, we see 't24' occurring once early on. So that's a match for NT32 -> 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, for NT69: looking through the rules, NT69 -> 't6' is present because `NT69 -> NT23 NT6` and wait, is NT6 a terminal? Let me check: I don't see any NT6 produce a terminal, but looking at other NTs, there's `NT68 -> NT12 NT69`, but that's not a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm looking incorrectly.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, I don't see NT6 producing a terminal. Let's check all NTs:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT5 -> nt39, nt83, nt61 (Wait, no, let me check all NTs with terminal symbols.\n\nLooking for NT -> terminal:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT58 -> 't61'\n- NT62 -> 't71'\n- NT68 -> 't12' (Wait, NT68 -> NT12 NT69. So NT68 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Wait, actually, NT62 -> 't71' and NT67 -> 't6'.\n\nHmm, alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nGiven the start symbol S, which can be NT4 NT77 or NT13 NT69. So, the string starts with two NTs. So, the first two tokens in the string should correspond to two NTs. Looking at the string, the first two are 't24' and 't47'. So, those are two terminals, meaning the initial expansion is from S -> NT32 (since NT32 can produce 't24') and something else.\n\nWait, no, S can only expand to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, the first two symbols must be either 't24' and 't69' or 't4' and 't77'. Wait, but 't69' isn't a terminal in the grammar because looking at all NT -> terminal rules, I don't see any NT producing 't69'. So that suggests that S expanding to NT4 NT77 would produce 't4' (from NT4) and some other NT (but NT77 may not directly produce a terminal, I'm checking that.\n\nWait, looking at NT77: in the grammar, NT77 is `-> NT51 NT78`. Then NT51 -> NT34 NT69, NT78 -> 't5' (from the rule NT78 -> 't5'). Wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT78 does produce 't5' because `NT78 -> 't5'`. Wait, let me check the provided rules:\n\nLooking for 't5' in the grammar:\n\nYes, there's a rule `NT78 -> 't5'`. So, NT78 produces 't5'. So, starting with S -> NT4 NT77, NT4 is 't54' and NT77 is, let's see, what is NT77?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT77 ->NT51 NT78. Then NT51 is NT34 NT69, and NT78 is 't5'. So, let's trace that.\n\nWait, but that would make the initial expansion for S -> NT4 NT77 to produce 't54' (from NT4) and then the production for NT77, which is NT51 NT78.\n\nBut NT51 is NT34 NT69, and NT34 -> 't78' (because NT34 has a production 't78'). Meanwhile, NT69 -> 't6' (from NT69's rules: because looking at the grammar, NT69 is defined as NT60 NT18 and some others, but no, wait, maybe not. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking back: NT69 is in two rules: `NT69 -> NT23 NT6` and `NT69 -> NT18 NT58`. Neither of these produce terminals, except perhaps for another NT inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to retrace.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the string as a sequence of NTs and see if we can find a way to split them into pairs that fit the grammar.\n\nThe string is 26 tokens. Let's see: t24, t47, t18, t0, t6, t6, t78, t60, t71, t80, t3, t3, t60, t79, t71, t29, t43, t47, t28, t7, t48, t18, t81, t18, t54, t6.\n\nWait, but each production step from S starts with two NTs. So, each step in the expansion should be a non-terminal becoming two NTs, and so on until we have a string of terminals.\n\nBut the string length is 26, which is even, so maybe starting from S, which is two NTs, each step increases the number of NTs by one, so length increases by one each time. Hmm, so let's see: 2,3,4,... but the string is 26, which is even. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This structure makes it easier for certain parsing algorithms and can help in determining derivations step by step.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, all the productions seem to be in CNF. Each production either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. There are no productions like A \u2192 BCD or A \u2192 aB.\n\nNow, the string starts with a series of 't's and numbers, which are likely terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S. From the given derivations, S can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, S expands into two non-terminals, which themselves can be terminals or produce more non-terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to check if each production step consumes the correct terminals in order. Each production that consumes a terminal (like A \u2192 't12') will produce that 't12' in the string.\n\nLet me outline a possible approach:\n1. Start with S.\n2. For each step, choose a production that starts with S, replacing it with the corresponding non-terminals.\n3. Continue this process until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals, forming the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parsing process where I try to derive the string step by step, consuming the terminals as I go, matching the grammar's productions.\n\nGiven the structure, perhaps a recursive descent parser would be appropriate.

Each production has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. Now, the given grammar seems to have all such forms, so that's good.\n\nThe strategy I'll use is to parse the string top-down using the CFG. Since it's CNF, I can apply the CYK algorithm, but I'm not super familiar with that, so maybe I'll try a simpler approach.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol, it's S. The start production is either S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Since all symbols are non-terminals except the terminals given in the string, I'll assume S is transformed into some sequence of non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by noting that the entire string must be derived from S. The string provided is a sequence of terminals, so each part after S's transformation must generate these terminals.\n\nLet me list the productions again for clarity.

{"custom_id":"request-511","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token seems to correspond to a terminal symbol. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the grammar's start symbol, S.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have each production rule on the left side involving only a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side having exactly two non-terminals. But looking at the grammar provided, I see that some rules are more complex. For example, S->NT13 NT69, but NT13 and NT69 might themselves have productions. However, looking closely, all the rules seem to be in the form of non-terminals on the right side, either two or sometimes more symbols, but some of them have terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, only non-terminals can produce on the right side\u2014terminals are leaves. So in the given grammar, some rules produce terminals. That seems inconsistent with standard CNF, which requires all productions to be non-terminals splitting into two non-terminals. So perhaps this is a mix, or maybe the grammar is not in proper CNF. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, most rules have two non-terminals on the right, like S->NT13 NT69, or NT47->NT66 NT29. But some have a mix, like NT18->NT49 NT80, which is two non-terminals. But Wait, looking at some of them, like NT5->NT38 NT74, which is fine, but also some have one non-terminal and a terminal, like NT77->'t47', or NT4->'t54'. Hmm, so that contradicts CNF because in standard CNF, all productions must be of non-terminals split into non-terminals. So perhaps the grammar is not properly in CNF as some rules produce terminals. But the user said it's in CNF, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the terminals are allowed in this way. Maybe the grammar is transformed into CNF with some rules allowing terminals. But I'm a bit confused. Let me proceed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t78 t81 t78 t31 t7 t43 t81 t62 t31 t72 t39 t58 t47 t18 t48 t7 t11 t85 t78 t79 t65 t42 t48 t47 t85 t50 t42 t28.\n\nSo, I need to check if this sequence can be derived from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, I might be able to use a method like the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But I'm more comfortable manually trying to trace through the possible derivations, but that could be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions: S->NT13 NT69 and S->NT4 NT77. So the string must start with either of these two options.\n\nLet's check the string. The first token is t78. So I need to see if any of the non-terminals that can derive t78 have a production that starts with t78. Scanning the productions, I see:\n\nLooking for NT where NT->'t78' or something that can lead to t78.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT77 has a production NT77->'t47' and NT77->'t34'... Wait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar: NT77 has productions like NT77->'t47', NT77->'t34', and another production? Wait, in the given rules:\n\nLooking through, I see NT77 has two rules:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nNT77 -> 't34' NT69\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the provided grammar has:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nNT77 -> 't34' NT69\n\nSo, NT77 can produce 't47', or 't34' followed by NT69.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t78, which isn't 't47' or 't34'. So perhaps the string doesn't start with NT77-derived tokens.\n\nAlternatively, S has another production: S->NT4 NT77. So maybe the string starts with NT4 followed by NT77. But the first token is t78, which is neither NT4 nor NT77's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. In the given grammar, S->NT4 NT77, but that would mean the first step is S -> NT4 NT77, which would produce two parts, say A and B. Then, A must derive into a string ending with t78, and B must derive into an empty string? Or perhaps the entire string must be built from these non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to look for a way to derive the string starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built step by step, and each non-terminal splits into others recursively.\n\nGiven the string, I can break it down into individual tokens and try to match each part from the start.\n\nThe string is: t78, t81, t78, t31, t7, t43, t81, t62, t31, t72, t39, t58, t47, t18, t48, t7, t11, t85, t78, t79, t65, t42, t48, t47, t85, t50, t42, t28.\n\nSo, I need to see if this sequence can be generated starting from S.\n\nLooking at the first token, t78. Let's see if any of the non-terminals can produce t78 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT47 -> 't9' or other non-terminals\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that have a production starting with t78.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- Is there any NT where NT->'t78'?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking at NT78: I don't see NT78 in the productions as a left-hand side. Wait, scanning all the LHS of the productions:\n\nS, NT4, NT47, NT45, NT18, NT13, NT69, NT60, NT9, NT36, NT80, NT5, NT68, NT61, NT29, NT9, NT58, NT77, NT5, NT21, NT73, NT70, NT61, NT53, NT23, NT78, NT51, NT53, NT17, NT32, NT42, NT61, NT34, etc.\n\nBut the NT78 production is in the RHS. For example, NT75 is not present, but NT78 is in the RHS as part of NT75->'t75' or something? No, actually, looking through:\n\nWait, let me list all NT78 instances:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT78->'t47' (I think not, because in the given grammar, I see NT53->'t48' as a production, for example. Wait, more carefully:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT53->'t48'\n\nNT78 isn't a left-hand side. However, in the RHS, some NTs have terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The grammar's rules as given include lines like NT38 -> 't47', etc. Let's check carefully:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only non-terminals on the LHS are NT68, NT12, etc., and some have terminal symbols on the RHS. For example:\n\nNT38->'t47'\n\nSo, in the RHS, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, then that could be the start of building the string.\n\nBut, the start symbol is S, which is a non-terminal, so the first step is S deriving into two non-terminals, each of which may derive into more symbols or terminals.\n\nGiven that the string beings with t78, perhaps the first step is S->NT4 NT77. Let me see:\n\nIf S->NT4 NT77, then NT4 could produce something, and NT77 could produce something else.\n\nLooking at NT4: The production is NT4->'t54', so it directly produces the terminal 't54'. But the first token is t78, which is not t54.

{"custom_id":"request-512","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making each production rule have either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string I'm given is: `t81 t39 t28 t60 t23 t81 t9 t68 t39 t33 t34 t33 t18 t18 t34 t23 t43 t65 t18 t81 t62 t84 t71 t9 t33 t9 t54 t65`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to break down the string and see if it can match any of the production rules. Since the grammar is CEFN, each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, I'll look for matches of the terminals in the string to see if they can be directly generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I have several non-terminals that expand into terminals. For example:\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT73 -> 't9'\n- NT83 -> 't7'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT34 -> 't78'\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT58 -> 't61'\n- And so on.\n\nThe string contains terms like 't81', 't39', etc. So I need to check if these are present in the grammar.\n\nBreaking down the string token by token:\n\n1. t81: Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal expand to 't81'? Let's see. I see NT12 -> 't81' as one of the rules. So t81 can come from NT12.\n\n2. t39: Does any non-terminal expand to t39? Checking the grammar, NT3->'t3' and NT5->'t39' (wait, let me look again). No, wait. The rules I see:\n   - NT5 -> 't39'\n   Yes, so 't39' comes from NT5.\n\n3. t28: Looking for terminal t28 in the grammar. Checking all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't28', except perhaps in some production. Wait, let me check. The grammar's terminals are listed under some rules. Looking, I don't see 't28' listed directly. Wait, no, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the list again. Oh, I see NT17 -> 't80', NT16->'t28'. Wait, no: looking back, NT16 is 't28'? Or am I looking at the wrong place. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT16 -> 't28'\n\nYes, so t28 comes from NT16.\n\n4. t60: Check for terminal t60. Looking for NT rules that produce t60. Let's see: NT15->'t47'... Wait, I might have to look for any NT60. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT60-> NT38 NT18. But in the string, the next term after t28 is t60. So t60 might come from NT60, but NT60 itself is a non-terminal, so I need to check if there's a production for it in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see NT60-> NT38 NT18, but that's two non-terminals, which can further expand. So to get 't60', I need to see if any of NT38 or NT18 have a terminal. Wait, let me check: NT38 is in NT38 -> 't47' and in some other rules. Wait, let me look at the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT38 -> 't47'\n\nSo NT38 can produce 't47', and NT18 according to the rules is in two places: S -> NT18 NT67, and NT18 -> NT49 NT80.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. The string is t81 t39 t28 t60. So after t28 comes t60. So t60 should come from a rule where a non-terminal expands to 't60', but from the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't60'. Instead, NT60-> NT38 NT18, which are both non-terminals. So t60 would be part of a longer derivation, but the string has t60 as a terminal. So that suggests that t60 must be generated directly by some NT that has 't60' as a terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't60' except perhaps in the rules given. Let me check again the list of grammar rules. I see NT18 -> NT49 NT80, and NT80-> 't43'. So if I have NT18, it can produce NT80, which is 't43' and others. But in the string, after t28 is t60. So I need to see if 't60' is present as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't60' as a terminal. So perhaps this string can't come from the grammar. But wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT60 -> NT38 NT18. Neither of those produce t60. So to get 't60', I would have to go through some expansion. For example, if I have NT60, which expands to NT38 and NT18, and then those could further expand. But the string has 't60' as a terminal, meaning it must be generated directly. Since none of the NTs directly produce 't60', the string can't be generated. So 't60' is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that produces 't60'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any. The only NT that produces 't60' as part of a longer chain would be if some other NT expands to it, but in the grammar, it's producing two non-terminals each time.\n\nSo if the string has a 't60' as a terminal, that can't happen because the grammar doesn't have any NT directly producing 't60'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. So I would answer 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-529","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t68 t11 t84 t24 t84 t60 t0 t47 t84 t84 t85 t28 t62 t84 t72 t11 t81 t28 t44 t11 t6 t42 t40 t48 t62 t44 t65 t50 t44` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure, so I can move forward.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, each presumably correspond to leaves in the parse tree. The approach here is to check if the string can be derived by the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nEach of these leads directly to a start of the derivation. So, the string should be broken down into parts that match these initial productions.\n\nI notice that the first two symbols in the string are 't68' and 't11'. Let's look at the productions involving NT4 and NT68. Checking the rules, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54' (a terminal). Wait, but NT4 also has another production: NT4 \u2192 't54', but in the string, the first is 't68', which is not 't54'. Hmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe 't68' corresponds to a non-terminal. Let me check the grammar rules where a non-terminal produces 't68'. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41\n- NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16\n- NT53 \u2192 't48'\n- Wait, but 't68' doesn't directly appear as a production from any non-terminal. That's odd because the first symbol is 't68', which is a terminal, so it must come from a production that directly outputs a terminal. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't68'. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each rule to check if any non-terminal produces 't68' directly. Looking at the list:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39', etc.\n- NT77 \u2192 't47', 't34'\n- NT73 \u2192 't91' but that's not present either.\n\nLooking for 't68', I see NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41, but that doesn't give 't68'. Similarly, other rules don't have 't68' as a terminal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, no, the rule NT42 \u2192 't68' is there. Oh! Yes, looking at the list:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't68'\n\nSo the first production could be S \u2192 NT4 NT77, which leads to NT4 \u2192 't68'. So the first part of the string 't68' would be covered by NT4. Then, the next part after 't68' should be whatever NT77 produces.\n\nLooking at NT77, the grammar has:\n- NT77 \u2192 't47' and 't34'\n\nWait, but 't47' and 't34' are terminals? Or are they non-terminals? Wait, no\u2014the rules that produce terminals end with 'a', so for example, NT46 \u2192 't58' is a terminal. So 't47' would be a terminal, but looking at the grammar, is there a production where NT77 \u2192 't47'?\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't47' and another production 't34', but that might not be correct. Wait, the grammar provided seems a bit unclear, perhaps some entries are duplicated or miswritten. Let me list the productions more clearly.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47' and NT77 \u2192 't34'? Or is NT77 \u2192 't34' another rule? Wait, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me try to reconstruct the grammar properly.\n\nThe grammar seems to be a list of productions, each on a separate line. Each line is something like \"NTx \u2192 NTy NTz\" or \"NTx \u2192 a\", where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, the first few lines are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nNT47 -> NT66 NT29\n\nNT45 -> NT46 NT36\n\nNT18 -> NT49 NT80\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nNT60 -> NT38 NT18\n\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45\n\nNT36 -> NT56 NT61\n\nNT80 -> NT67 NT4\n\nNT5 -> NT38 NT74\n\nNT68 -> NT12 NT69\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT45\n\nNT29 -> NT42 NT68\n\nNT9 -> NT46 NT62\n\nWait, wait, the line for NT9 is written twice: first as NT9 -> NT46 NT62, and later again as NT9 -> NT46 NT80. That can't be right. Maybe it's a typo. Perhaps the second occurrence is meant to be another production, so NT9 has two productions: one is NT46 NT62, the other is NT46 NT80.\n\nThat's a bit confusing, but I can proceed.\n\nSo, looking back at the string: first symbol is 't68', which must come from NT42 \u2192 't68'. So the first part is:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nThen, NT4 \u2192 't68' (so first 't68' matches), and then NT77 needs to produce the rest of the string after 't68'.\n\nLooking at NT77, the productions are:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47' and NT77 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, 't47' and 't34' must be terminals. So the next symbol in the string after 't68' is 't11', which would need to be produced by NT77.\n\nBut NT77 produces either 't47' or 't34', neither of which is 't11'. That's a problem. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production is S \u2192 NT47 NT68? Or did I get the productions mixed up?\n\nWait, no, the first productions are S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So if the first symbol is 't68', then S must derive NT4 NT77, leading to 't68' followed by NT77's production.\n\nBut NT77 produces 't47' or 't34', neither of which is 't11'. So that suggests that the initial production S \u2192 NT4 NT77 can't lead to the rest of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the correct path. Maybe the initial S uses the other production, S \u2192 NT47 NT68. But wait, in the given grammar, the first two productions are S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So there's no production for S \u2192 NT47 NT68. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the grammar provided, or perhaps I'm misreading it.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, I see NT47 \u2192 't84', right? Let me check:\n\nNo, looking again, NT47 is defined as NT66 NT29, not a terminal. Wait, no, I think I might have misread the rules earlier.\n\nWait, let me check NT47:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29\n\nSo NT47 doesn't produce a terminal. Then, where does 't47' come from? Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for any NTx that produce 't47' as a terminal. I see:\n\nNT50 is a terminal, but I don't see any NTx producing 't47' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions to see if any produce 't68' or 't11', etc., directly.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT68 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-525","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The start symbol can also produce the empty string, but in this case, I don't see any production leading to the empty string.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to be in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT13 NT69 is a production that breaks down S into two non-terminals. Similarly, other productions are either combining two non-terminals or terminals, which fits the CNF structure.\n\nNext, the string given is `t58 t0 t9 t39 t60 t80 t84 t58 t47 t7 t31 t6 t58 t60 t43 t7 t3 t84 t65 t48 t68 t85 t54 t23 t11 t84 t18 t31 t31`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S following the given production rules.\n\nOne approach is to use the concept of parse trees. If the string can be constructed by starting from S and replacing non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals, then the string is in the language.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a CNF grammar, it's suitable for using the CYK algorithm for parsing. The CYK algorithm efficiently determines if a string is in the language of a grammar in CNF. However, I might not remember all the details of the CYK algorithm by heart, so maybe another approach is to track the possible non-terminals that can produce each substring.\n\nBut since this might get complex, perhaps I can look for a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the terminal symbols in the productions.\n\nLet me list out the productions for clarity. The start symbol is S, which can be replaced by NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. These are two possible paths. Let me see what each path leads to.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each production in CNF can split the problem into smaller subproblems, I can try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the terminals in the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t58, t0, t9, etc. So I need to see if any production has t58 as the left-hand side (LHS). Scanning through the productions, I see NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36, NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61, etc. Wait, looking for 't' symbols, in the productions, some NT symbols are replaced by 't' symbols.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t40\nWait, looking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't81'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't62' ? Wait, no, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, let me look through the productions to find all NT symbols that produce 't' symbols.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't68'\n- NT12 \u2192 't81'\n- NT34 \u2192 't9'\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n- NT61 \u2192 't62' (wait, no: looking at NT61 productions: one of them is NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45, which then could produce t's. But let's see. Also, NT5, NT7, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the NT symbols that directly produce a 't' symbol.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't68'\n- NT12 \u2192 't81'\n- NT34 \u2192 't9'\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n- NT58 \u2192 't62' (Wait, no: NT58's production is NT58 \u2192? Let me check: I see 'NT58 -> NT61 NT3', but that seems to produce a non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nWait, in the given productions, I need to find which NT symbols have production rules that directly lead to terminal symbols. For example:\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't68' (this is a production)\n- NT12 \u2192 't81'\n- NT34 \u2192 't9'\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n\nYes, these four NTs (42, 12, 34, 46) directly produce terminal symbols.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs may produce more NTs, but some produce direct terminals.\n\nSo, for the string, when a 't' appears, it should correspond to the LHS of a production that leads to that 't' terminal.\n\nSo for example, if in the string there's a 't58', that must come from an NT production where LHS is NT46 (since NT46 \u2192 't58').\n\nSimilarly, 't0' would need to come from an NT that produces 't0'; looking through the productions, perhaps NT77 \u2192 't47' and others, but let's see.\n\nWait, the 't' symbols go from t3 to t85, so each tX is a terminal. So for each tX in the string, it must be produced by a specific NT.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t40 \u2192 so when we see 't40' in the string, it must come from NT45.\n- NT42 \u2192 t68 \u2192 so 't68' comes from NT42.\n- NT34 \u2192 t9 \u2192 't9' comes from NT34.\n- NT46 \u2192 t58 \u2192 't58' comes from NT46.\n\nNow, looking at the string, let's break it down into segments corresponding to possible NT productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model this as a parse tree. Each symbol in the string must be a terminal, so the grammar must generate it through a series of productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be divided into parts that match the NTs that can directly produce these t's.\n\nBut since this might get lengthy, perhaps we can approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLet's explore both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nThen, NT13 and NT69 must produce the parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the productions, S could be divided into NT13 NT69, so the string would need to be split into a left part generated by NT13 and a right part generated by NT69.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see:\n\nThe first three symbols are t58, t0, t9.\n\nSo if we consider this as the beginning of NT13, but wait, NT13's production is NT70 NT46. So NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nSo, if NT13 is part of S's production, then S would split into NT13 NT69, so NT13 would generate the first part of the string and NT69 the second.\n\nBut the string starts with t58, which would have to come from a terminal production.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, t58 comes from NT46 \u2192 t58. So, if S is NT13 NT69, then the string should start with NT13 producing t58...\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: if S produces NT13 NT69, then NT13 must generate a substring, and NT69 must generate the rest.\n\nSo the string would have to start with whatever NT13 can produce, followed by whatever NT69 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT13's production: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nSo NT13 produces NT70 NT46. Now, each of these are NTs, so each needs to produce their own terminals or further split.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 produces NT23 NT6, according to one of the productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions for NT69: 'NT69 -> NT23 NT6'.\n\nYes, so NT69 produces NT23 and NT6.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then the string starts with NT13, which is NT70 NT46. So the first symbol in the string would be from NT70.\n\nLooking at NT70's productions: I see a few entries. Let's check:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n- NT70 \u2192 NT60 NT13\n- NT70 \u2192 NT18 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-549","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me take this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But since the string is given and I need to check if it's a valid derivation, I might try to reconstruct the parse tree or production steps that lead to this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar should start with either NT13 followed by NT69 or NT4 followed by NT77. My input string starts with 't29 t71 ...', which doesn't seem to match the start symbols directly. Wait, actually, let me check again. The string provided is:\n\nt29 t71 t34 t9 t47 t81 t72 t39 t47 t7 t42 t48 t0 t79 t28 t44 t7 t60 t44 t58 t28 t6 t17 t3 t50 t0 t84 t79 t24 t81.\n\nHmm, so it starts with t29. Let me check the grammar to see if 't29' can be derived from S. But looking through the rules, I notice that several of the non-terminals have productions that produce terminals.\n\nWait, let's start from the beginning. The string doesn't begin with a non-terminal, but with 't29', which suggests that 't29' is a terminal. So, perhaps the start symbol S produces something that leads to a sequence starting with t29.\n\nBut looking at the start symbols: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So, the first step is to see if any derivation from S can start with t29.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT29. Looking through the rule list, I see NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68. So, NT29 is a non-terminal that produces NT42 and NT68. Neither of these are terminals, so that might not be the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for productions that produce 't29' directly or through intermediate steps. Scanning the rule list, I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly produces 't29'. Let me check if any non-terminals have 't29' in their productions.\n\nLooking through the rule list, the only terminal is 't29' inside NT29's production. So NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68, and both NT42 and NT68 have their own productions. Let me trace this path:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68.\n\nLooking for NT42: NT42 \u2192 NT34 NT61. Both are non-terminals.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47. Both non-terminals.\n\nNT61 \u2192 DT15 NT47. Hmm, 't15'? Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT61 appears on the left side? Wait, the rules have NT61 on the left, like NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18, wait no, let me check:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the given grammar rules. It's a bit confusing. Let me list the rule for NT61:\n\nFrom the given list:\nNT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18? Wait, no, looking at:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18 is not present. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking for NT61:\n\nHere's one line: NT61 -> NT18 NT69. Another: NT61 \u2192 't33' from elsewhere? Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, in the list provided, there's:\n\nNT61 -> NT34 NT47.\n\nYes, the 15th line is NT61 -> NT34 NT47.\n\nSo, going back up:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT34 NT47.\n\nNow, NT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47.\n\nWait, that's a cycle. NT34 depends on NT61, and NT61 depends on NT34 and NT47. That could complicate things.\n\nThis suggests that this could be a loop, but since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals. So, it's possible that this could lead back to itself.\n\nHmm, but this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of trying to parse the entire string at once, maybe break it down into parts and see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to use CYK parsing. However, since the string is quite long, writing it out step by step might be error-prone. But perhaps I can check key points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reconstruct the derivation step by step, seeing if each symbol in the string can be generated by expanding the start symbols and their productions.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't29', which is a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals produce 't's. For example, NT77 produces 't47' (from NT77 \u2192 't47') and NT74 \u2192 't47', etc.\n\nWait, looking for where 't29' appears as a production. It's in NT29 \u2192 't29'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68.\n\nBut where is 't29' directly produced? Scanning the list, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly gives 't29' as a terminal. Instead, NT29 produces two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the entire list again carefully.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nDoes any non-terminal produce 't29' directly? Let me go line by line.\n\nNT53 \u2192 't50', 't58', etc.\n\nLooking specifically:\n\nLine 53:\nNT53 -> 't80'\nNT53 -> 't74'\n\nOther lines:\n\nNT23 -> NT73 NT41\nNT42 -> 't68'\nWait, looking for 't29':\n\nWait, line 44: NT42 is in multiple productions, but looking for 't29':\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go line by line.\n\nWait, here's a list of some non-terminal productions:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't9'\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n- NT53 \u2192 't80', 't74'\n- NT46 also \u2192 't58'\n- NT34 \u2192 't9', 't78', etc.\n- NT73 \u2192 't9'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT31 \u2192 't50'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39', 't83'\nWait, no 't29' is mentioned directly as a production. So, perhaps 't29' is produced indirectly through some chain.\n\nBut looking through, none of the non-terminals have 't29' as a terminal. Hmm. That might be a problem. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go back.\n\nLooking for 't29' in all the rules. Let me read all the lines:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT69\n2. S -> NT4 NT77\n3. NT47 -> NT66 NT29\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-552","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC, except the start symbol which can have a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me parse the grammar to understand the non-terminals and their possible derivations. The start symbol is S, and S has productions like S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. Each of these NTs (non-terminals) can produce pairs of other NTs or terminals.\n\nThe string to check is `t29 t3 t60 t31 t79 t68 t65 t48 t47 t33 t50 t28 t9 t39 t60 t72 t43 t40 t48 t71 t31 t11 t60 t78 t80 t72 t24 t50 t58`. This string consists entirely of terminal symbols, so we need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals produce pairs where one is a terminal. For example, NT46 -> 't58', NT4 -> 't54', NT3 -> 't3', etc. So, the derivation will involve choosing S's productions and then breaking down each into terminals and further non-terminals as needed.\n\nI'll try to construct a parse tree from the string. Starting from S, which has two possible productions. Let's pick one at a time and see if it can match the string.\n\nFirst, let's see if the string starts with any of the initial productions. S can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's consider NT13 NT69 first.\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46. So, this would contribute 't46' if NT46 is a production. Alternatively, NT69 might produce something else. Let's check NT69: it can be 't47' or continues via production rules. Wait, looking back, NT69 is defined as NT23 NT6. NT23 is NT73 NT41, and NT73 is 't9'. NT41 is 't9'. So NT23 could be 't9' 't9', giving 't9t9'. But NT69 has a production NT23 NT6, which would be 't9t9' followed by whatever NT6 can produce. Wait, NT6 has a rule: NT6 -> 't18' and the production NT6 can also go further? Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT6 -> 't18', no further rules. So, NT6 is 't18'.\n\nSo NT69 would be NT23 NT6, which would give 't9 t9 t18'. But NT23 is NT73 NT41, both of which are 't9's. So NT69 would produce 't9 t9 t18' as a terminal string. Wait, but that's three terminals. Hmm, but in the given string, the first few terms are 't29 t3 t60 t31 t79 t68 t65 t48 t47 t33 t50 t28 t9 t39 t60 t72 t43 t40 t48 t71 t31 t11 t60 t78 t80 t72 t24 t50 t58'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me approach this differently. Perhaps I should look for the units that produce terminals. For example, NT56 -> 't62', NT76 -> 't79', etc. Let me see which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice NT46 -> 't58', NT23 -> 't9', NT73 -> 't9', NT41 -> 't9', NT34 -> various, but some like NT34 -> 't9' in some cases. Also, NT83 -> 't7', NT42 -> 't68', NT12 -> 't81', etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the third word is 't60', which is a terminal. So in the derivation tree, we need a non-terminal that can produce 't60'. Looking at the grammar, let's see if any NTs produce 't60'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT10 -> NT68 NT58, and NT68 -> NT12 NT69. NT12 is 't81' and NT69 is 't47' or NT23 NT6, which I already think is 't9 t9 t18'.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe it's easier to start from the string and try to see if it can be broken down into the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string: the first few terms are 't29 t3 t60 t31 t79 t68 ...'\n\nLooking at 't29', where can that come from? Let's check the NTs that produce 't29'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't29'. So perhaps we need to look for NTs that eventually produce 't29' via other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT29 -> NT42 NT68. Oh, wait, no, the NT29 production is NT42 NT68. But that's two non-terminals, not a terminal. So NT29 doesn't directly produce 't29'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go back to the grammar rules to see if any NT directly produces 't29'. Scanning through:\n\n- NT10 -> NT68 NT58\n- NT12 -> NT38 NT67\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n- NT18 -> NT49 NT80\n- NT21 -> NT73 NT53\n- NT23 -> NT73 NT41\n- NT29 -> NT42 NT68\n- NT34 -> NT61 NT47\n- NT36 -> NT56 NT61\n- NT42 -> NT60 NT69\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT5 -> NT38 NT74, etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT42: in my earlier check, I see NT42 -> NT60 NT69. So 't29' would come from NT42, which is 't60 t69', but 't29' isn't a terminal, so perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me see if there's another NT that produces 't29' eventually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't29' comes from a production that I missed. Let's look again:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT29 is only produced by NT42, which is 't60 t69', so NT42 is not directly 't29'. Hmm. So perhaps I need to consider that 't29' is produced by a non-terminal that's further down in the derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me take the string and see if I can split it into units that match the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. 't29'\n2. 't3'\n3. 't60'\n4. 't31'\n5. 't79'\n6. 't68'\n7. 't65'\n8. 't48'\n9. 't47'\n10. 't33'\n11. 't50'\n12. 't28'\n13. 't9'\n14. 't39'\n15. 't60'\n16. 't72'\n17. 't43'\n18. 't40'\n19. 't48'\n20. 't71'\n21. 't31'\n22. 't11'\n23. 't60'\n24. 't78'\n25. 't80'\n26. 't72'\n27. 't24'\n28. 't50'\n29. 't58'\n\nI need to split this into parts that match the grammar's non-terminals. Let's try starting with the start symbol S.\n\nS can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me try the first option: S -> NT13 NT69.\n\nNow, let's see what NT13 and NT69 can produce.\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n\nSo, from S, we have NT13 NT69 splitting into (NT70 NT46) NT69.\n\nSo, the string can be broken down as 't70 t46 t69', but wait, in the string, after"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-564","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the production rules, making them easier to analyze. Each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of tokens like `t11`, `t65`, `t43`, etc. This suggests that the string is being generated by the terminals in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to map out the grammar's structure. Let me see the initial rules:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. These seem to be the main branches of the grammar.\n\nI should look for how these can lead to terminals. So, I need to see if any of these NT rules directly produce a terminal or lead to a string of terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals produce terminals with numbers. For example, NT61 -> NT33 NT45, but both of these are non-terminals, so I have to look deeper. Wait, some of these non-terminals directly produce 't' followed by numbers. Like NT5 -> 't3', NT4 -> 't54', etc. So, I need to see if the given string can be broken down into these terminal sequences.\n\nNow, the string is: `t11 t65 t43 t43 t81 t7 t44 t11 t65 t58 t17 t78 t43 t23 t39 t80 t23 t31 t11 t33 t23 t42 t18 t7 t71 t48 t17 t42 t31 t39 t43`.\n\nThat's 31 tokens.

NT32's only production is NT32 -> NT42 NT68, which are both non-terminals. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Looking back, the rule for NT32 is: NT32 -> NT42 NT68? Or perhaps another rule. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the list, under NT32:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT32 -> NT42 NT68? Or am I mixing up? Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nWait, here's the rule: NT32 -> NT42 NT68, I think. But that doesn't help me, because that's two non-terminals. Hmm, perhaps NT24 is something else. Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I'm supposed to evaluate is: `t84 t7 t78 t60 t11 t84 t39 t54 t3 t42 t44 t65 t7 t17 t18 t81 t58 t48 t23 t18 t80 t62 t85 t71 t80 t3 t85 t85 t68 t43 t7`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given starts with S, and I suppose that S is the start symbol. \n\nLooking at the initial productions of S: S->NT13 NT69 and S->NT4 NT77. NT stands for non-terminal, so S can only derive into combinations of these non-terminals, which then further expand into other non-terminals and eventually terminals.\n\nNext, I think about how the string is built. Since the string consists of a bunch of t followed by numbers, I should check if each t corresponds to a terminal production in the grammar. Each of these tX must correspond to a production where the non-terminal expands into that tX.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that some of these are directly mapped: for example, NT5 -> 't3' and NT4 -> 't54'. So whenever I see 't3' or 't54' in the string, there's a rule that allows them. \n\nI'll go through the string step by step.\n\nStarting with 't84': Is there a production where a non-terminal expands into 't84'? Looking at the rules, I see NT77 -> t47, which doesn't help, and NT83 -> 't7', which also doesn't. Wait, looking again, I might have missed some. Oh, looking more carefully, there's NT4 -> 't54' and NT56 -> 't62', but 't84' isn't directly mapped. Wait, maybe I missed it. Oh, checking again, perhaps I should look more carefully. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, NT77 -> 't47' and NT42 -> 't68', but I don't see 't84' directly. Hmm, maybe I should re-examine the rules more thoroughly.\n\nWait a minute, I think I missed looking at some rules. Let me scan through all the rules again for t followed by numbers:\n\n- NT42 -> t68\n- NT32 -> t11\n- NT77 -> t47\n- NT4 -> t54 (so 't54' is allowed)\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT33 -> t85\n- NT46 -> t58\n- NT47 -> t84 (Wait, looking through, I see NT47 -> 't84' Yes! So 't84' corresponds to NT47's production. So the first character 't84' is allowed since NT47 -> t84 is a valid production.\n\nWait, yes, I'm a bit confused because in the initial rules, S is using NT13 and NT69 as the initial productions. So the entire expansion must start from S and go through NT13 and NT69.\n\nWait, I'm a bit lost now. Maybe I should think about the structure of the string. The string is a series of tX tokens. Each tX must come from some non-terminal.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck because I'm not seeing a direct t84. Wait, looking back at the rules, I see:\n\nNT47 -> t84, which is a rule. So 't84' must be the result of expanding NT47. \n\nNow the string starts with 't84', so that would require that in the first expansion, the current symbol is a non-terminal that can produce 't84'. But 't84' is a terminal, so it's a leaf in the parse tree. \n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the string length is compatible. Since each step in the derivation in CNF either introduces two non-terminals (redundant) or eventually a terminal. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for where the string starts. The string starts with 't84 t7 t78...', so the first token is 't84'. So, in the derivation, the first part must expand into a sequence where the first terminal is 't84', which points to NT47 -> t84. Then, the rest of the string must follow the expansions of the other symbols.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the entire string can be generated this way. Maybe another approach is to think about the entire string and see if it can be split into a series of expansions according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each non-terminal has a specific production that can generate certain strings. For example, NT13 -> NT70 NT46, and if NT70 can produce 't7' and NT46 can produce 't58', then NT13 can produce 't7 t58', but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step following the grammar. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t84, t7, t78, t60, t11, t84, t39, t54, t3, t42, t44, t65, t7, t17, t18, t81, t58, t48, t23, t18, t80, t62, t85, t71, t80, t3, t85, t85, t68, t43, t7.\n\nGiven that S is the starting symbol, which must expand into NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me take the first production, S->NT13 NT69.\n\nSo, N13 and N69 expand from NT13 and NT69.\n\nLooking for N13: NT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n\nSo N13 is NT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n\nNow, N70 can expand into various terms. Looking at the rules, NT70 -> NT76 NT7 or NT70 -> NT76 NT7 (same as earlier?) Wait, looking at the rules again:\n\nNT70 has two rules: NT70 -> NT76 NT7 and NT70 -> NT60 NT13.\n\nSo N70 can produce NT76 followed by NT7 or NT60 followed by NT13.\n\nIf N70 produces NT76 NT7, then NT76 -> NT47 NT78.\n\nAnd N78 can produce NT5 NT16 or something else. Wait, looking at NT78, it has two rules: NT78 -> NT5 NT16 and NT78 -> NT34 NT69.\n\nIf NT78 can go to NT5 and NT16, then NT5 is t39. Wait, so if N78 -> NT5 NT16, then N78 would generate 't39' followed by whatever NT16 produces.\n\nBut NT16 is another rule: NT16 -> t28. So NT78 could produce t39 t28.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to follow each step more carefully.\n\nLet me try expanding S->NT13 NT69.\n\nN13 expands into N70 N46.\n\nSo the string starts with N70 N46. Now, N70 can expand into two options.\n\nOption 1: N70 -> N76 N7.\n\nThen N76 can expand into N47 N78.\n\nThen N47 can expand into t84.\n\nSo the first part would be N76 -> N47 N78: so t84 followed by N78.\n\nThen N78 can expand into N5 N16.\n\nN5 can expand into t39, and N16 can expand into t28.\n\nSo up to this point, the string would be t84 t39 t28.\n\nBut the actual string starts with t84 t7..., so that might not match.\n\nAlternatively, let's see another route. N70 could expand to N60 N13.\n\nN60 -> NT38 NT18.\n\nN38 can expand into N47 N62.\n\nWait, let me think again. N60 is N60 -> NT38 NT18.\n\nSo N38 expands into N47 and N62.\n\nN47 -> t84.\n\nN62: looking at the rules, NT62 -> t42. So N62 is t42.\n\nSo N38 -> t84 t42.\n\nN18 is the next component: N18 is S18"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-588","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what I have here.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, and the start symbol is allowed to have a single terminal to finish. Hmm, looking back at the grammar, I see some rules have a single terminal. Like S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which is two non-terminals. But other rules like NT77 \u2192 't47', where 't47' is a terminal. So the grammar allows terminals in the right-hand side, which makes sense.\n\nThe string given is: `t50 t0 t0 t17 t68 t39 t9 t43 t6 t18 t18 t54 t54 t34 t85 t6 t62 t23 t18 t0 t68 t40 t34 t42 t40 t80 t34 t44 t17 t60 t58 t3`.\n\nThat's a long string, 35 tokens. Now, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So the initial symbols are two non-terminals: either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nThe string starts with 't50', which is a terminal. So I need to check if either NT13 or NT69 can produce a string that starts with 't50' when combined with another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT56 \u2192 't62', NT77 \u2192 't47', NT47 \u2192 't84', etc. Also, some rules produce terminals, like NT4 \u2192 't54', NT9 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nLet me see if any NT rule produces 't50'. Looking through the rules, I see NT56 \u2192 't62', NT41 \u2192 't9', NT26 \u2192 't42', NT31 \u2192 't50'. Oh wait, NT31 \u2192 't50'. So NT31 can produce 't50', a terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the initial expansion:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69\nThen, let's see what NT13 can produce. From the rules, NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, which are both non-terminals. Then each of these again:\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18, etc.\n\nBut let me see if any rule leads to 't50' in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: the second token is 't0'. So let's see if a production can lead to 't0'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't0', so NT9 must produce 't0' at some point. But how does that connect?\n\nAlternatively, the first token is 't50', which comes from NT31 \u2192 't50'. So in order to get 't50' as the first token, I need NT31 to appear somewhere in the derivation.\n\nBut since the start symbol is S, which produces either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77, I need to see if these can lead to NT31 somehow.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT13:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47' (directly produces a terminal). Also, NT77 appears in another production: NT77 \u2192 't34'. So, NT77 can produce either 't47' or 't34'.\n\nWait, so S can produce NT47 \u2192 which can produce 't47' or other things. But I'm trying to get 't50' as the first symbol. Since 't50' comes from NT31, and I don't see any rule connecting NT13 or NT77 to NT31, this might not be the right path.\n\nAlternatively, the other option for S is S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54' (from the rules: NT4 \u2192 't54'). So NT4 produces 't54' directly. Then NT77 can produce either 't47' or 't34'.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT77, the first symbol from NT4 is 't54'. But looking at the string, the first symbol is 't50', which matches NT31, not NT4. So this path might not give us 't50' as the first symbol.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should try to break down the string step by step, token by token, to see if each token can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the string upwards to see if it connects back to the start symbol S. Let's try that.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt50 t0 t0 t17 t68 t39 t9 t43 t6 t18 t18 t54 t54 t34 t85 t6 t62 t23 t18 t0 t68 t40 t34 t42 t40 t80 t34 t44 t17 t60 t58 t3\n\nThe first symbol is 't50'. So a non-terminal must produce 't50'. The only way that can happen is if that non-terminal is NT31, because NT31 \u2192 't50'. So somewhere in the derivation, we need to have NT31.\n\nSo, let's see: the entire string must be a combination of two non-terminals, which are then both expanded into the string. So, perhaps the string can be split into two parts, each derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, so the string should be the concatenation of the strings derived by those two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the entire string is the concatenation of two parts: say, left part from NT13 and NT69, or left part from NT4 and NT77.\n\nIn the string, let's split it into two sections after the first symbol since each production starts with two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, each production of S is two non-terminals, so the string must be the concatenation of two parts, each derived from one of the non-terminals in the S production.\n\nBut to see that, perhaps the string can be split into two substrings, each starting with the first symbol of each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see which non-terminals can produce 't50' and see if the rest of the string can come from the other non-terminal.\n\nSince the first token is 't50', which comes from NT31, perhaps the first non-terminal is NT31, and the second non-terminal is something else.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the only way to get 't50' is from NT31. So, for example, if one of the non-terminals is NT31, then the string would need to start with 't50', which is the case here.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part is 't50', which comes from NT31, and the second part is the rest of the string: t0 t0 t17 t68 t39 t9 t43 t6 t18 t18 t54 t54 t34 t85 t6 t62 t23 t18 t0 t68 t40 t34 t42 t40 t80 t34 t44 t17 t60 t58 t3\n\nNow, the second part of the string starts with 't0'. Looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't0'. So, the second non-terminal could be NT9.\n\nBut wait, how? Because the grammar for S is either S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. If one of the non-terminals is NT31 (which produces 't50'), then the other non-terminal is either NT13 or NT77.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because NT31 is not part of the S productions. Wait, no, S is only NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. So the two non-terminals derived from S are either (NT13, NT69) or (NT4, NT77). So in this case, the entire string must be the concatenation of, say, NT13's derivation and NT69's derivation, or NT4's derivation and NT77's derivation.\n\nWait, so if the first part is 't50' (from NT31), but NT31 is not directly part of S's productions"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step because it seems a bit complex, but I'll try to manage it.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It has several productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminal symbols. Each production is in CNF, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing, although in this case, I'm just trying to generate the string, not parse it.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n\n`t80 t44 t72 t31 t28 t11 t58 t42 t33 t40 t33 t39 t0 t84 t31 t0 t84 t72 t34 t71 t48 t0 t24 t11 t62 t81 t39 t84 t62 t54 t42 t68`\n\nI notice that most of the symbols are 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.

So NT4 is a non-terminal, so to match 't54', NT4 must be expanded. Then, the next part would be 't42 t68', which is NT42 and NT68, both terminals? Wait, wait, I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, each production in Chomsky normal form has exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. But some may produce terminals, so perhaps in the reverse derivation, when a pair of terminals are found, they can be considered as the result of a production that directly produces those terminals, if such a production exists.\n\nSo in this case, perhaps the pair 't54 t42 t68' is a trio of terminals, but since each step of the reverse derivation can only handle two symbols at a time, I need to group them in pairs.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify: in reverse derivations, when you have a string, you try to find a production whose RHS matches the current string, starting from the start symbol. So, if you have the string 'ABCD', you look for a production with RHS 'ACB D' or something? No, wait, you would look for each possible pair in order.\n\nWait, actually, in reverse derivations, you take the string and split it into possible pairs (since each production step adds two symbols). So for the string 't80 t44 t72 t31 ... t54 t42 t68', the last part is 't54 t42 t68'. But wait, that's three symbols. That's problematic because each production step in the RHS of the grammar is two non-terminals, so any derived string via reverse steps would have an even number of symbols, unless it's the starting symbol which generates two symbols. Hmm, but in the given string, I see an odd number of symbols: let's count.\n\nThe string is: t80 t44 t72 t31 t28 t11 t58 t42 t33 t40 t33 t39 t0 t84 t31 t0 t84 t72 t34 t71 t48 t0 t24 t11 t62 t81 t39 t84 t62 t54 t42 t68\n\nCounting the number of terms: Let me count each 't' followed by a number. Hmm, it's probably a lot, but the last part I noticed is t54 t42 t68. Wait, that's three, which suggests that this method may not work because each step reduces the string by two symbols. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that in some productions, the RHS consists of two non-terminals, but during reverse derivations, when you have a pair of terminals, you can match them as if they came from a production with two non-terminal left-hand sides, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The starting symbol is S, and it produces two NT3 symbols, which likely combine into the terminal strings in the string. The string provided has several 't' tokens followed by numbers, like 't50', 't58', etc. These are likely terminal symbols, so each 'tX' represents a terminal, and the other symbols like NT4, NT5, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce a 't' and a number. For example, NT41 -> 't9', NT78 -> 't47', etc. My job is to parse the string step by step using the grammar to see if it can be derived.\n\nLet me write down the string: `t50 t58 t6 t58 t9 t85 t9 t47 t62 t33 t47 t72 t42 t23 t78 t84 t81 t84 t72 t17 t28 t43 t71 t44 t48 t33 t71 t31 t85 t42 t24 t28 t0`.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the start symbol S, which produces S -> NT13 NT69. So the derivation would be S => NT13 NT69.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, it starts with 't50'. So perhaps 't50' comes from NT13. Let me check the NT13 productions: NT13 -> NT70 NT46 or NT13 -> NT32 NT21 (but wait, NT13 has two entries, maybe I miswrote it). Wait, in the given grammar, NT13 appears twice, once producing NT70 NT46 and another producing NT32 NT21. So yes, NT13 can be either NT70 NT46 or NT32 NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't50' comes 't58'. So if NT13 produces 't50' and something else, what next? Let me see:\n\nIf NT13 -> NT70 NT46, then the first part could be 't50' from NT70? Or is it from NT13 itself? Wait, perhaps I need to see which non-terminals directly produce 't50'. Let me look through the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT5 -> t39, NT6 -> t18, NT13 -> t7, NT26 -> t42, NT56 -> t31, NT76 -> t79, etc. Hmm, I don't see a direct production for 't50'. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let's scan through all the entries under 'NTX' that have 't' as a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT57 -> hmm, not listed. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT3: 't65', NT4: 't65', NT3: 't7'. That might be a typo. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, under NT61: 't62', and so on. But I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly produces 't50'. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string uses 't50' multiple times, so I need to figure out how 't50' is derived.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce 't' symbols. For example, NT5 -> 't39', NT6 -> 't18', NT13 -> 't7', NT26 -> 't42', NT56 -> 't31', NT77 -> 't47', NT41 -> 't9', etc. But I don't see a direct production for 't50'. Hmm, that's a problem because 't50' cannot be directly derived from any non-terminal, as per the given rules. That would mean that 't50' cannot be part of the grammar, so the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check. The grammar lists several NT productions, but none seem to directly produce 't50'. For example, NT50 is not present; instead, NT67 -> 't6', which isn't 't50'. Wait, perhaps I misread the initial grammar. Let me go through each production to check.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT61 -> 't62'\n- NT66 -> 't13 nt1'? No.\n- NT23 -> 't73 t41'\n- NT78 -> 't5 nt16'\n- NT47 -> 't48 nt...' Hmm no.\n- NT58 -> 't47 nt...' No.\n- NT42 -> 't60'\n\nWait, I don't see any production that generates 't50'. That's a critical point. If the string starts with 't50', but no non-terminal directly can produce 't50', then the string cannot be part of the language defined by this grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a way to combine non-terminals that indirectly produce 't50'. For example, maybe through a chain of productions. Let me see. Let's say a non-terminal A produces 't13 nt1', and then NT13 itself has a production. But actually, the NT13 productions don't directly produce 't50'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't50' is a result of a longer production chain. But given the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't50', so it's impossible.

{"custom_id":"request-610","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The task is to evaluate the string `t80 t28 t34 t44 t47 t78 t33 t6 t72 t62 t50 t7 t11 t29 t34 t72 t11 t58 t18 t39 t60 t68 t29 t78 t3 t47 t71 t24 t11 t65 t33 t62 t6` against the provided grammar and decide whether it's generated or not.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of CFGs where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Additionally, the start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any production. Each production has either two non-terminals or one terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nGiven the grammar provided, I can see that all production rules are indeed in CNF because each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. For example:\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT77\nEach of these right-hand sides has two non-terminals, which fits the CNF structure.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols (like t80, t28, etc.). My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol (S) by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process corresponds to a parse tree where each non-terminal has exactly two children (either terminals or non-terminals). This suggests that the string's length is directly related to the number of non-terminals in the parse tree. Specifically, for a string of length n, the parse tree will have n leaves, and the number of internal nodes will be n-1, leading to a total of 2n - 1 nodes. Since each production splits a non-terminal into two, the number of steps to derive the string is equal to the number of non-terminals, which might be a bit complex to follow manually, but perhaps we can find a pattern or see if any production leads to the string's terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to reverse-engineer the process. Let's consider that to generate the string, each terminal in the string must be produced by a production rule that directly produces that terminal. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t18\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT49 \u2192 t40\n- NT58 \u2192 t31\n- NT67 \u2192 t6\n- NT33 \u2192 t85\n- NT72 \u2192 t72 (Wait, this seems like an error because NT72 isn't a terminal; perhaps it should be another rule. Let me check the given grammar to make sure I'm reading it correctly.)\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar rules include:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't47'\n- NT78 \u2192 't5'\n- NT79 \u2192 't78'\n- NT58 \u2192 't61'\n- NT56 \u2192 't62'\n- NT38 \u2192 't47'\n- NT39 \u2192 't60'\n- NT66 \u2192 't13'\n- NT10 \u2192 't68'\n- NT13 \u2192 't32' and so on.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some production rules have terminals on the right-hand side.

Wait:\n\n- NT80 \u2192 t43. So, that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT44 \u2192 't3', NT47 \u2192 't84', etc.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT80 \u2192 't43' (rule: NT80 \u2192 't43')\n- NT44 \u2192 't3' (rule: NT44 \u2192 't3')\n- NT47 \u2192 't84' (rule: NT47 \u2192 't84')\n\nSo, in the given string, we have t80, t44, t47, etc. So, we can see:\n\n- t80 is directly produced by NT80 \u2192 t43 wait, no, looking again, the rule for NT80 is:\n\nWait, in the given rules, I need to search for any where the non-terminal corresponds exactly to a terminal.

Wait, looking at the grammar, yes, 't17' is a terminal as per the given rules.\n\nSimilarly, NT62 \u2192 't71', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, so in the given grammar, NT61 can produce t17, which is a terminal. So, in the string, t71 appears, which is produced by NT62.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that each terminal in the string must appear as a direct production from a non-terminal. So, for example, 't80' must come from NT80 \u2192 't43', 't44' comes from NT44 \u2192 't3', etc. But that's not an exact match because 't44' is a different terminal than 't43'. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because in some cases, the same non-terminal might produce different terminals? No, in the given grammar, each non-terminal has specific productions either leading to other non-terminals or specific terminals. So, for example, NT77 \u2192 't47' is a terminal, so whenever NT77 appears, it only can produce t47. Similarly, NT77 can't produce anything else.\n\nSo, now, in the string, let's look at each terminal:\n\nt80: This must be from NT80 \u2192 't43', which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-628","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF looks like. CNF grammars have production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. All non-terminals are on the left, and the right side has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, most of the productions seem to fit this structure\u2014either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. For example, S -> NT13 NT69. Wait, but S itself is a non-terminal, right? So in CNF, the start symbol can also have two non-terminals, but in this case, S is the start symbol, so that's okay.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals separated by spaces. The string starts with 't81', then 't43', 't33', and so on. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should work backward from the string. Each terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule that ends with that terminal. So I'll try to construct a parse tree starting from the string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nStarting with the string: t81 t43 t33 t68 t43 t6 t33 t9 t7 t24 t7 t47 t71 t48 t23 t43 t28 t65 t34 t85 t48 t40 t6 t40 t84 t18 t58 t9 t84 t33 t29 t50 t84 t62.\n\nFirst, I see that the string has multiple 't's. I need to map each of these to non-terminals in the grammar. The grammar has rules where certain non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT5 -> 't3', NT4 -> 't54', etc. So each terminal 'tX' is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe strategy is to group the string into parts that correspond to the production rules. Since each production in CNF can produce at most two non-terminals, the string can be split into chunks where each chunk of two tokens corresponds to a single non-terminal. However, some productions might have only one 't', which would mean the string must fit one of those cases.\n\nWait, no\u2014since each production in CNF can generate either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string should be an interleaving of these. But the way to parse it is to look for sequences that can be derived by two non-terminals or just a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can apply production rules in reverse to reach the string.\n\nLet me see the start symbol: S. S has two productions: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nLet's consider the first production S \u2192 NT13 NT69. If I can derive the string starting from NT13 and NT69, then it's possible. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT4 NT77; if the string can be derived from NT4 and NT77, also possible.\n\nSo I need to see if the string can be divided into two parts, each part starting with NT13 and NT69 respectively, or NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, how long is it? Let's count the tokens: 1 (t81) + 1 (t43) + ... up to 39 tokens. So 39 tokens.\n\nSince each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of tokens in the string should be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree. For a context-free grammar in CNF, the number of symbols in the string at any step is n, and the derivation length is O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nBut perhaps a more direct approach is to recursively check if the string can be split into two parts, each starting with the two non-terminals from S's productions.\n\nLet me see the first production of S: S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo if I can split the string into two parts, starting with the symbols for NT13 and NT69 respectively, then I can proceed.\n\nBut how do I know which symbols correspond to which non-terminals? Each non-terminal has specific productions.\n\nLooking at NT13: From the grammar, NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So NT13 can only be split into two non-terminals, NT70 and NT46.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nSo if I can split the string into parts where the first part starts with NT13 (which is t81?), or maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each 'tX' to a specific non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can make a list of terminals (each 'tY') and the non-terminals they come from.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t3\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT61 \u2192 t62 (since NT61 \u2192 NT26 NT58, but NT26 is another non-terminal; wait, no\u2014it ends in t62, but NT61's production includes other rules. Hmm, maybe I need to look further.)\nWait, perhaps the terminals are only the 'tX' symbols, so t3, t4, t5, etc. up to t9, t18, t23, t24, t28, t33, t34, t40, t43, t47, t48, t50, t54, t58, t62, t65, t68, t71, t77, t79, t83, t84, t85.\n\nEach of these terminals corresponds to a rule where the non-terminal produces that terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-631","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols, specifically `t` followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have production rules of two types: either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals, like A \u2192 BC, or a non-terminal producing a single terminal symbol, like A \u2192 a. This structure makes it easier to parse strings, often using techniques like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not going to code it out, I'll have to think about how the string can be broken down using the given grammar rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals include S, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, etc., up to NT97 or so. The terminals start with 't' followed by numbers like t5, t7, t8, etc. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of these terminals: `t24 t80 t78 t78 t23 t11 t60 t9 t44 t48 t29 t31 t72 t17 t85 t34 t31 t3 t11 t23 t29 t42 t29 t34 t84 t58 t72 t65 t11 t58 t34 t71 t60 t33`. That's a lot of symbols, so I need a systematic way to see if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to split the string into components that match the right-hand sides of the given production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either emits a single terminal or breaks down into two non-terminals. So, each token in the string should either be a single terminal derived directly from a production or part of a larger structure.\n\nStarting from the beginning, I'll examine each token and see if it can be found as a left-hand side (LHS) of any production or if it's a terminal. Wait, actually, the grammar's LHS are all non-terminals except for the two-step productions in the start rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the start symbols are S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So S is the start symbol, and it produces two non-terminals. Therefore, the string must start with a series of derivations from these non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see how each part can be built up. Let me list out all the production rules again to see which terminals they produce.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't9'\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'\n- NT51 \u2192 't34' (but wait, NT51 \u2192 't34' might be a typo because NT51 is earlier?

{"custom_id":"request-644","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to evaluate. My goal is to determine whether the string can be generated by the grammar. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Also, in CNF, all productions either expand a symbol into two others or a single terminal. This structure means that each derivation step corresponds to a parse tree where each internal node has exactly two children. That's useful because it often corresponds to a divide-and-conquer parsing strategy, like the CYK algorithm, but for this problem, maybe a parse tree approach would work.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all productions are in CNF because each right-hand side is either two symbols (NT or terminal) or a single terminal. So that's good. Now, the given string is `t11 t40 t18 t78 t43 t23 t6 t84 t50 t0 t84 t68 t50 t50 t9 t9 t68 t3 t18 t78 t43 t7 t43 t0 t6 t79 t62 t29 t81 t43 t31 t80 t85 t6 t68`. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I'll try to construct a parse tree for the string. If I can successfully parse the entire string using the grammar, then the answer is \"Yes\". Otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\nI'll start by identifying the start symbol. In the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial expansion of S is either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. Looking at the string, it starts with `t11`, which doesn't match directly, so maybe the start production is NT4 and NT77. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no. The NT4 production is `NT4 -> t54`, but in the string, the first symbol is `t11`, not `t54`. So perhaps the initial production is NT13 and NT69. Let me check the NT13 and NT69 productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, `S -> NT13 NT69` or `S -> NT4 NT77`. The first symbol is `t11`, which doesn't match NT4 (which is `t54`). So it must be the other option, `NT13 NT69`. So the start symbol derivation starts as NT13 followed by NT69.\n\nNow, NT13 expands to NT70 and NT46. So after the first step, we have NT70 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t11`. Let's see if `t11` is in any of the productions. Looking through the productions, I see that `NT32 -> t11`. So maybe NT32 is part of the derivation.\n\nWait, but in the current step, we're trying to expand NT70 and NT46. Let me see what NT70 and NT46 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT70 is `NT70 -> NT76 NT7`. So after this expansion, NT70 becomes NT76 and NT7.\n\nNow, NT7 is `NT7 -> t44`. So that gives `t44`.\n\nWait, but the first token is `t11`, not `t44`. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe I should consider the entire string and work through possible expansions.\n\nLet me list out the productions again to see if I can map the tokens to the terminal symbols.\n\nThe first token is `t11`, which is produced by NT32. So if NT70 is split into NT32 and NT45? Wait, wait, no, NT70 is `NT70 -> NT76 NT7`. So, that would require NT70 to first split into NT76 and NT7. But in the string, the first token is `t11`, so unless NT76 produces something that can lead to `t11`, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to backtrack. Maybe the initial S derivation is not into NT13 and NT69 but into NT4 and NT77. But then, NT4 is `t54`, and NT77 is `t47`. The string starts with `t11`, which doesn't match `t54` or `t47`.\n\nSo the only option is S -> NT13 NT69. So the first two symbols must be the result of NT13 and NT69.\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7. NT7 is `t44`. So the first few symbols would be `t44` after expanding NT70.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is `t11`. This suggests that perhaps I'm missing some steps. Wait, maybe the NT76 or NT7 itself can produce the needed tokens. Let me check.\n\nNT76 is `NT76 -> NT79 NT7`. NT7 is `t44`. NT79 is `NT79 -> NT5 NT16`. NT5 is `t39`, and NT16 is `t28`. So expanding NT76 would give `t39 t28`. But that's not matching the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the overall structure of the string. Let's list out all the tokens:\n\nt11, t40, t18, t78, t43, t23, t6, t84, t50, t0, t84, t68, t50, t50, t9, t9, t68, t3, t18, t78, t43, t7, t43, t0, t6, t79, t62, t29, t81, t43, t31, t80, t85, t6, t68.\n\nThat's quite a long string. Maybe I can group them into larger chunks that match non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT can expand into two non-terminals, which in turn can expand into other symbols. So each step doubles the number of symbols, leading to strings of length 2^n. Let's see how long the given string is.\n\nCounting the tokens: 35 symbols. Hmm, 35 is not a power of two. Wait, because each production step can expand one NT into two, so starting from S, we have two. Each expansion step on each NT would double the count, but in the case of a mix of NTs expanding, the total count could vary. Wait, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find a possible path.\n\nLet me consider that the entire string must be broken down into a series of productions.\n\nStarting with S -> NT13 NT69.\n\nSo first, NT13 and NT69 will each be expanded. Let me see if I can traverse the string according to this.\n\nFirst, after expanding S, the first part is NT13. Let's see what NT13 can produce. It's NT70 and NT46.\n\nNow, NT70 can be expanded into NT76 and NT7. NT7 is t44. But the string starts with t11, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT70 can be expanded further. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should look for a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and seeing if I can reduce it to S.\n\nLet's see if the last token is something that can be derived from a single NT. Looking at the grammar, several NTs have terminal symbols.\n\nFor example, NT5 is `t39`, NT6 is `t18`, NT9 is `t46`, etc. But let me look at the last token in the string: `t68`. Let me see which NTs can produce `t68`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT42 -> t68. So if somewhere in the expansion, we have NT42, which then expands to t68. So the string ends with t68, which is the expansion of NT42.\n\nTherefore, the last step must involve NT42 -> t68.\n\nSo the last two tokens would be something like ... NT42, then t68.\n\nBut in the string, the second last token is `t68`, the last is `t68`. Wait, no, in the string, the last token is the 35th token, which is `t68`. Wait, the last token is the last element: `t68`. So it's just one token. Therefore, in the parse tree, that would be the terminal `t68` from NT42.\n\nSo the last step"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for terminals which are single symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t42 t47 t31 t7 t44 t9 t18 t3 t23 t24 t17 t29 t72 t18 t81 t11 t7 t81 t80 t72 t78 t24 t33 t24 t3 t58 t50 t85 t44 t7 t17 t68 t72 t48 t40`.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules to see how terminals are derived. Each rule either produces two non-terminals or eventually leads down to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT47 -> t9\n- NT34 -> t9\n- NT23 -> t7\n- NT42 -> t68\n- NT3 -> t65\n- NT4 -> t54\n- NT5 -> t39\n- And so on, with many rules leading to terminals like 't0', 't1', up to 't85'.\n\nThe string is a sequence of these terminals. I think the approach is to try to parse the string from the start symbol S and see if it can be completely broken down according to the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Let's see the productions for S:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69: Wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, S is actually two productions: S -> NT13 NT13 NT69? Or is it S -> NT13 NT13 and another production S -> NT4 NT77. Wait, no\u2014each line is a separate production. So S has two rules:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT13 NT69\nWait, no\u2014let me check the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar as presented is split into lines. It starts with S -> NT13 NT13 NT69, then another S production, etc. Wait, looking again:\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\nNT47 -> NT66 NT29\nNT45 -> NT46 NT36\nNT18 -> NT49 NT80\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\n... and so on.\n\nWait, the first line is S -> NT13 NT13 NT69, which is S -> NT(13) NT(13) NT(69). So S produces three NTs. The second line is S -> NT4 NT77, which is S -> NT4 NT77. So two NTs.\n\nWait, that complicates things because the start symbol S can produce different numbers of NTs. The input string has a certain number of terminals.\n\nWait, let's count the number of tokens in the string. Each 't' is a token. The string has tokens: t42, t47, t31, t7, t44, t9, t18, t3, t23, t24, t17, t29, t72, t18, t81, t11, t7, t81, t80, t72, t78, t24, t33, t24, t3, t58, t50, t85, t44, t7, t17, t68, t72, t48, t40. Let's count them: 34 tokens.\n\nEach production for S either has 2 or 3 NTs. Since the string is 34 tokens, which is even, that might be a clue because each production contributes a certain number of NTs. Wait, let me think: Let's see, 34 tokens. If each step contributes 2 tokens, that would require 17 steps. If any step contributes 3 tokens, it would mess that up, but in the grammar, S only produces 2 or 3 NTs. Wait, no: S directly produces NTs, each NT can then produce more NTs or terminals.\n\nBut the total number of symbols in the string is 34. Each production of S leads to a certain number of NTs, which can then eventually produce terminals. Let's see:\n\nEach NT can be either a terminal or a non-terminal. The number of terminals directly depends on the structure.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the parsing as a leftmost derivation. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nBut first, let me look at the grammar rules for symbols that lead directly to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT47 -> t9\n- NT45 -> NT46 NT36 (but NT46 and NT36 may lead to terminals)\nLooking at NT36: NT36 -> NT56 NT61. NT56 -> NT62 NT58. NT62 -> NT18 NT71. NT18 -> NT49 NT80. NT49 -> NT40. NT80 -> NT67 NT4. NT67 -> NT6. So NT36 would become NT56 NT61, and so on. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should create a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with higher-level symbols. Let me see if the string starts with a known terminal that comes from a certain NT.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t42. Which NTs produce t42?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT42 -> t68\nWait, no: in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT42 -> t68\n\nWait, no, checking the rules: the lines after 47 and so on, I need to check each rule for nt.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nYes, in the given grammar, NT42 has a production NT42 -> t68.\n\nSo t42 in the string must come from NT42, which then goes to t68. Then t68 is another terminal. So first, NT42 is involved.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t42, so we need to find a production that starts with NT42. Looking at the grammar:\n\nI think in the given grammar, NT42 -> t68, right?\n\nYes, the rules say:\n\nNT42 -> t68.\n\nSo the first step is that t42 comes from NT42 producing t68. Then, after t42 comes t47. So next would be NT47. Looking at the grammar for NT47:\n\nNT47 -> NT66 NT29.\n\nSo NT47 produces NT66 and NT29. Now, both NT66 and NT29 are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT66: The rules say NT66 -> NT13 NT1. NT13 is another non-terminal. So NT66 would expand to NT13 and NT1.\n\nLooking at NT13: NT13 -> NT70 NT46. Both are non-terminals. NT70: looking at the rules, NT70 -> NT76 NT7. NT76 is a non-terminal, and NT7 is a terminal. NT7 is 't7' according to the rules.\n\nWait, so NT70 -> NT76 NT7. So NT70 would have to produce something else? Or is NT76 another non-terminal? Let's check NT76: NT76 -> NT79 NT77? Wait, no\u2014looking at the rules, I don't see NT76 being defined. Maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, let's list all the rules. The user provided a long list of grammar rules, but perhaps I can pick relevant ones.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I find:\n\n- NT47 -> NT66 NT29\n- NT66 -> NT13 NT1\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n- NT70 -> NT76 NT7\n- NT76 -> NT79 NT77? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT77 -> NT50? No, wait:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nWait, I notice that in the grammar, some of the NTs are assigned to other NTs, but perhaps it's too extensive to list all. Alternatively, perhaps I can focus on the string and see if the symbols make sense.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see if the entire string can be parsed using the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backwards. The last token is t40, which corresponds to a production.\n\nLooking at the rules, which NT produces t40?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT5->t39, NT4->t54, NT3->t65, NT21->t73, etc. Hmm, looking for a rule where NT produces t4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So I need to see if the grammar can produce NT46 followed by '...'.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce NT4 NT77. So, starting with the second option: S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 has a production NT4 -> 't54', so that would give 't54' as the first character, but the string starts with 't58'. So maybe the first option is correct: S -> NT13 NT69.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't58', which comes from NT46. So let's see if the first production starting with NT13 or NT4 can lead to NT46.\n\nLooking at NT13 and NT69.\n\nNT13 has a production NT13 -> NT70 NT46. So that would generate NT70 and NT46. NT46 produces 't58'.\n\nSo, after the first symbol, we have NT70 and NT46. NT46 gives 't58', so that's correct.\n\nNow, NT70 has a production NT70 -> NT76 NT7. NT76 -> 't79', so the next symbol is 't79', which is correct. So after NT70, we get 't79'.\n\nSo far, the string is 't58 t79 ...' which matches.\n\nNext, NT76 is 't79', followed by NT7. NT7 -> 't44'. So the next symbol should be 't44'. But the string after 't79' is 't78 ...'. Wait, the string is t58 t79 t78 ... Hmm, that's an issue because after 't79', NT7 would be producing 't44', not 't78'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake.

Let's see if I can group the string into parts that correspond to certain non-terminals.\n\nSince the grammar uses Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each 't' in the string must come from a direct production of a non-terminal.\n\nSo I can try to parse the string into a series of non-terminals that each produce a single 't'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see the string as a sequence of non-terminals, each of which must be a direct production.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t58, which comes from NT46.\n\nThen t79, which is NT76, because NT76 -> t79, as per the grammar.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, from S -> NT13 NT69, NT13 generates NT70 and NT46 (from NT13 -> NT70 NT46). So the first two symbols would be NT70 (generates t79?) No, NT70 -> NT76 NT7. So NT70 would produce 't79' (via NT76) and 't44' (via NT7).

So the string should have 't79' and then 't44' after some steps.\n\nBut according to the string, after t58 (which is from NT46), the next symbol is t79.

{"custom_id":"request-665","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure makes parsing more straightforward because each production either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly introduces a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of production rules. Let me see if any of them directly match the terminals in the string. The string is a sequence of tokens starting with 't85' and ending with 't62', all separated by spaces. So each word like 't85', 't18', etc., is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of these terminals are directly produced by the rules. For example, I see:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't3'\n- NT17 \u2192 't80'\n- NT34 \u2192 't78'\n- NT73 \u2192 't9'\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT62 \u2192 't71'\n- NT54 \u2192 't65' (Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Oh, actually, looking again, I don't see NT54 in the grammar directly. Maybe I'm confusing with another rule. Let me focus.)\n\nWait, the string has 't54' twice. Hmm, is there a production for NT54? Let's look through the rules again.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't34' and 't78'? No, wait, looking carefully, the grammar rules for NT51 and others. Let me check each production.\n\nLooking for 't54' in the grammar. I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT53 \u2192 't48' (and another one) but no t54.\n- NT58 \u2192 't61' and 't3' (I think). Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3 and possibly more. But no 't54' is direct.\n\nWait, the string has 't54' as a terminal. So how does NT54 get to 't54'? Looking through the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't54' directly? Let me go through each production.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly goes to 't54' except maybe I missed one. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39' (t39 is a string, not a single t)\n- NT58 \u2192 't61' and 't3', but 't3' is 't3' which is a single t.\n- NT31 \u2192 't50', which is another token in the string.\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'! Ah, here we go. So NT4 \u2192 't54', so 't54' is produced by NT4.\n\nWait, no. Let me see. In the grammar, there's a production for NT4 \u2192 't54'. Yes, that's correct. So 't54' is directly produced by NT4.\n\nSo, when I see 't54' in the string, that corresponds to the non-terminal NT4. So now, I can write the string as:\n\nt85, t18, t58, t60, t40, t31, t78, t0, t54 (NT4), t71, t44, t43, t78, t7, t54 (another NT4), t85 (t85, which is 't85'), t54 (another NT4), t65 (which is 't65'), t62 (which is 't62'), t68 (t68), t84 (t84), t50 (t50), t62 (t62), t50 (t50), t50 (t50), t3 (t3), t62 (t62), t81 (t81, 't81'), t9 (t9), t33 (t33, which is 't33'), t71 (t71), t3 (t3), t17 (t17), t39 (t39, which is 't39'), t6 (t6), t58 (which is 't58'), t77 (t77 is 't77').\n\nWait, no, each 't' with a number is a terminal. So 't85' is one, 't18' another, etc.\n\nNow, the strategy is to see if, starting from the start symbol S, the grammar can derive this string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the grammar has two initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT1 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nBut wait, I need to double-check the initial productions. Let me see:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nS -> NT13 NT1\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo S can split into either NT13 NT1 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part starts with t85, which is 't85'. So in the string, the first 't' is t85, then t18, t58, etc.\n\nWait, but the first two symbols are 't85' and 't18'. Let me see what the grammar can generate from the start.\n\nSince S can go to either NT13 NT1 or NT4 NT77, perhaps I need to see which path can incorporate t85 first.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT1.\n\nFrom NT13, looking at the productions, one of them is NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nSo NT13 can split into NT70 and NT46.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 could produce 't3' directly, which is 't3'. But in the string, the second symbol is 't18', which is 't18'. So let's see if that works.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT13 NT1, NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, and NT1 \u2192 't3'. But then we'd get 't70' and 't46' next, but the string starts with 't85', 't18', ... So that doesn't fit. So maybe this path isn't working.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo S becomes NT4 and NT77. Now, let's see:\n\nNT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't54'. So 't54' comes directly from NT4.\n\nNow, in the string, the first part has 't85', 't18', 't58', ... So if we take S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the first symbol would come from NT4 or NT77.\n\nSince NT4 \u2192 't54', which is a single t54 in the string at position 8 in the string: t54 comes at position 9th in the sample string? Wait, let's count the string:\n\nThe string is: t85 t18 t58 t60 t40 t31 t78 t0 t54 t71 t44 t43 t78 t7 t54 t85 t54 t65 t62 t68 t84 t50 t62 t50 t50 t3 t62 t81 t9 t33 t71 t3 t17 t39 t6 t58.\n\nWait, positions start at 0 probably, but let's count each word. The total is 33 tokens.\n\nThe 9th token is t54, which is after 8 others. So perhaps after NT4 produces t54, what comes next?\n\nWait, no. If S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the derivation would be S \u2192 NT4 NT77 \u2192 't54' NT77. So the first symbol is 't54', which is the 9th token in the string, but in the string, the first symbol is t85, followed by t18, etc. So that doesn't align.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial path is different. Maybe the string starts with t85, which is 't85', so perhaps the start symbol S must go through a production that starts with 't85'. Let's see if any of the productions lead to t85.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't85'. So how would 't85' come into the string?\n\nWait, perhaps it's produced by a chain of productions. Let's check the grammar:\n\nLooking for productions that can terminate with 't85'.

{"custom_id":"request-688","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structurize grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should make parsing easier, but for this task, I just need to check if the string can be derived.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and the productions seem to have many rules, mostly splitting into two non-terminals. Some have terminals, like 't50' or 't3'. So, my string consists of these terminals: t84, t39, t6, etc., all the way to t42, t78, t3, t84, and so on.\n\nMy string is `t84 t39 t6 t85 t84 t72 t29 t33 t9 t85 t34 t72 t7 t48 t42 t85 t65 t72 t78 t54 t84 t6 t34 t78 t3 t7 t84 t62 t80 t44 t65 t0 t42 t24 t78 t17 t39`. I need to see if this string can be derived from S using the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string should be broken down as a series of such replacements, leading from S to the given string.\n\nI think I should start by examining the string and see if it can be parsed backward, checking if each terminal can be matched by a production's terminal rule. For example, do any of the productions have a terminal as their right-hand side?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, there are several that end with a terminal:\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT77 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't44'\n- NT56 \u2192 't62'\n- NT74 \u2192 't47'\n- NT32 \u2192 't24'\n- NT72 \u2192 't48'\n- NT48 \u2192 't42' (Wait, NT48 isn't in the grammar, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check: Oh, looking at the grammar, I see NT53 \u2192 't48'. So it's NT53 that produces 't48'.\n\nSo, in the given string, the terminals are t84, t39, t6, t85, etc. I need to see if each of these can be matched by some production's terminal.\n\nBut to do that, I think I should try building a parse tree starting from S, expanding it, and see if I can match the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. But since the string is long, that might take some time.\n\nWait, the CYK algorithm works by decomposing the string into parts and checking possible non-terminals at each step. But without knowing the specific grammar's structure, maybe it's easier to look for the start symbol and see if the entire string can be derived step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be divided into a series of productions, ensuring that each step expands a non-terminal into two components, which can themselves be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few symbols: t84, t39, t6, t85, t84, t72, t29, t33, t9, etc.\n\nI know that t84 appears multiple times, so perhaps that's a key point. Let's see if the grammar has any productions that produce t84. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for 't84', I see that:\n- NT53 \u2192 't48' (Wait, no, that's 't48'.)\n- NT5 \u2192 't39' (t39 appears in the string.)\n- NT61 \u2192 't62' (t62 is a t in the string)\nWait, the string has t62, which is from NT61 \u2192 t62. So maybe one part of the string is from NT61 \u2192 t62.\n\nLooking back at the string, the last part is ... t84 t62 ... Let me check the last t62, which comes from NT61. So for that, there's a production NT61 \u2192 't62'.\n\nNow, looking before that, I see another t84, which comes before t62. So the string segment before t86 is t84 t34 t72 t7 t48 t42 t85 t65 t72 t78 t54 t84. Hmm, wait, the string before the last t62 is ... t84 t6 t34 t72 t7 t48 t42 t85 t65 t72 t78 t54 t84. Wait, no, let me parse the string correctly.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt84 t39 t6 t85 t84 t72 t29 t33 t9 t85 t34 t72 t7 t48 t42 t85 t65 t72 t78 t54 t84 t6 t34 t78 t3 t7 t84 t62 t80 t44 t65 t0 t42 t24 t78 t17 t39.\n\nLooking in reverse, the last part is t39 at the end. So the string ends with t39, which in the grammar is produced by NT5 \u2192 't39'. So that's one symbol, which makes sense because the string ends with t39, so it's generated by NT5.\n\nSo the last symbol is from NT5. Then moving backward, the previous is t78, which is from NT78 \u2192 't33', which matches t33. Wait, no, NT78 \u2192 't7' according to the grammar? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT78 \u2192 't7'. So 't78' would also correspond to 't7', but in the string, the symbol before t39 is ... t78..., no. Wait, let me index the string:\n\nLet me number each symbol for clarity:\n\n1. t84\n2. t39\n3. t6\n4. t85\n5. t84\n6. t72\n7. t29\n8. t33\n9. t9\n10. t85\n11. t34\n12. t72\n13. t7\n14. t48\n15. t42\n16. t85\n17. t65\n18. t72\n19. t78\n20. t54\n21. t84\n22. t6\n23. t34\n24. t78\n25. t3\n26. t7\n27. t84\n28. t62\n29. t80\n30. t44\n31. t65\n32. t0\n33. t42\n34. t24\n35. t78\n36. t17\n37. t39\nSo the string has 37 symbols.\n\nThe last symbol is t39, which is produced by NT5.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I remember that in such a grammar, the string has to be a sequence of productions starting from the start symbol S and breaking down into terminals and non-terminals until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. Since the string starts with t11, I need to see how that connects back to the grammar rules.\n\nI look at the grammar rules provided. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT13 NT69. So, S breaks down into two parts: NT13 and NT69. Each of these is a non-terminal that needs to be expanded.\n\nLooking at how NT13 and NT69 are used in other productions, I see that NT13 is used in several rules like S, NT13 -> NT70 NT46, and so on. NT69 appears in the same and others too.\n\nThe string starts with t11. I go through the rules for NT13 and NT69 to see if they can produce t11. Let's start with the first production of NT13: NT18 -> NT49 NT80. But wait, in the string, after t11, the next is t47, so maybe NT13 is not directly starting here. Alternatively, perhaps looking deeper.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree from the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each part must connect via the productions.\n\nI notice that the first part is t11. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rules that produce t11 directly. Looking at the rules, most non-terminals when expanded result in a pair of terminals and other non-terminals. For example, NT13 -> NT70 NT46, but NT70 and NT46 themselves are further broken down.\n\nBut in the string, after t11 comes t47 twice. So perhaps t11 is part of a larger production. Maybe looking for a rule that includes t11 as one of the expanded symbols.\n\nWait, looking at rule NT61 -> NT18 NT18. If NT18 is broken down further, maybe it contributes to some terminals. Let's see: NT18's productions are NT49 NT80, which again break down into more non-terminals and some terminals. For example, NT49 -> t40, so t49 would appear in the string. But the string doesn't show t40.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for NT62 -> t71. Wait, no, the string has t71. Let me check the grammar. NT36 -> NT56 NT61. NT56 -> t62. So, if NT56 is expanded, it gives t62. But in the string, t62 appears before t71. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, the second part is t47 t47. Where do t47s come from? Looking at the grammar, NT47 appears in some rules like S -> NT47 NT6. NT47 expands to NT84, and NT84 expands to t47 and t9, I think. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT47 -> t84\n\nAnd NT84? Wait, actually, looking again, the rule for NT47 is in the grammar as NT47 -> t84, so NT47 is a terminal and expands to t47. Then, looking up how S starts, S can go to NT47 NT6, perhaps?\n\nWait, the start symbol S -> NT13 NT69. But then from the string, the first t11 is in the beginning, which suggests perhaps NT13 or NT69 is producing t11. Let me check the rules for NT13.\n\nLooking back, the grammar for NT13: I see NT13 -> NT32 NT21. Then NT32 -> t11. Oh! So NT13 can produce t11 directly through the production NT13 -> NT32 NT21, and then NT32 is a terminal t11.\n\nWait, so S breaks down into NT13 and NT69. If NT13 is broken down, it goes to NT32 and NT21. NT32 is t11, so that starts the string with t11.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t11, matching NT32. Then, the next production from NT13 is NT21, which I believe leads into another part.\n\nWait, NT13's production is NT32 NT21. So S's production is NT13 NT69, which would result in NT32 NT21 NT69.\n\nSo the string would have to match NT32 NT21 NT69, which is t11 followed by (something) followed by 69, but the string starts with t11, then t47, t47, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to map this out step by step.\n\nThe string starts as t11 t47 t47 t6 t48 t9 t6 t71 t42 t6 t6 t68 t62 t78 t54 t48 t48 t80 t6 t85 t7 t7 t34 t44 t6 t79 t72 t42 t0 t29 t78 t68 t7 t23 t0.\n\nFirst, the beginning is t11, which must come from NT32, as per NT13 -> NT32 NT21.\n\nSo the first part is t11 (NT32), then the next part is NT21. But looking at the grammar, NT21's production is NT73 NT53. So NT21 -> NT73 NT53.\n\nThen, each of these would have to be expanded.\n\nWait, the second element after t11 is t47. So after t11, the next elements should be NT21 expanded into something that starts with a t47.\n\nBut NT21's first production is NT73 NT53.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT73: NT73 -> NT42 NT69.\n\nWait, the string after t11 is t47, t47, which suggests that the next non-terminals after t11 would have to produce those t47s. Maybe I'm going the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT13 is followed by NT69.\n\nSo from S: NT13 -> NT32 NT21, which gives us t11 and then NT21. But after that, we have NT69 in the production.\n\nWait, NT69 is in S's production as well: S -> NT4 NT77. Maybe looking at where else NT69 is used. NT69 -> NT23 NT6.\n\nSo NT69 breaks down into NT23 and NT6. NT23's production is NT73 NT41, which then breaks down into t73 and t41.\n\nBut in the string, after t11, the next is t47, t47, so that might not align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is different. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t11, so that's likely from NT32, as per NT13 -> NT32 NT21.\n\nSo after NT32 (t11), we have NT21 -> NT73 NT53, which would produce something like t something t something.\n\nBut the next elements are t47s. Let me check the rules of NT73 and NT53.\n\nNT73 -> NT42 NT69.\n\nNT42 can be NT60 NT68. NT60 is NT38 NT18, which then is NT38->t39 and NT18->t43.\n\nWait, this seems a bit tangled. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for where t47 comes up. t47 comes from NT47, which is in the rule S -> NT47 NT6. So if part of the string starts with NT47, then it would produce t47 and t6.\n\nBut in the string, the second term is t47, so that might be from an NT47.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT47's expansion is:\n\nWait, I look again and see that NT47 -> t84, but actually, in the initial rules, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT47: It"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which simplifies parsing. \n\nFirst, I'll jot down the grammar rules to understand how the non-terminals expand into terminals and other non-terminals. The terminals here are strings like 't72', 't81', etc., which appear in the target string we need to evaluate.\n\nThe given string is: `t72 t81 t85 t18 t33 t29 t33 t50 t6 t3 t17 t7 t68 t18 t0 t24 t78 t71 t9 t6 t84 t62 t9 t71 t50 t24 t58 t28 t33 t40 t80 t71 t39 t17 t84 t48 t60 t24`.\n\nI notice that this string has 40 tokens. My plan is to work backward from the start symbol S, expanding the rules to see if I can reach this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me first check if the string starts with 't72'. Looking at the right-hand sides of the grammar, I see some transitions. For example, NT77 can produce 't47', which is a terminal. But NT77 also has another rule: NT77 \u2192 't34'. Wait, no, looking back, actually, NT77 has two rules:\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT77 -> 't34'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT77 -> 't34' \u2192 Wait, no, the last line shows NT77 -> 't34'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT77 has two productions: \"t47\" and \"t34\"?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the provided grammar, lines end with \"t34\" and \"t78\", etc. Wait, I need to look for where NT77 is defined.

Let me find all the NT77:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- Line: NT77 -> 't47'\n- Line: NT77 -> 't34'\n\nWait, no, I think I missed it. Let me scan through all the NT77 rules. Oh, wait, in the provided grammar, there's:\n\nNT77 -> 't47' and then another line?\n\nWait, looking carefully, towards the end of the grammar:\n\n\"Here is the string...\" section shows:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nWait, wait, in the list, under NT77, there's:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would produce two different terminals for NT77. Wait, no\u2014the actual grammar provided has:\n\nLooking at the grammar list:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT77 -> 't34' \u2192 That would allow NT77 to produce either 't47' or 't34'.\n\nBut in the string, the string starts with 't72', which is not 't47' or 't34'. So if the first part is 't72', but NT77 can only produce 't47' or 't34', then S can't produce 't72' directly.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So to get the string, the entire string must be derived from S. Let me check the start symbol again.\n\nS -> NT13 NT69: So S produces NT13 and NT69. Both of these are non-terminals, so the string must be a combination of the terminals generated by NT13 and NT69.\n\nSimilarly, S can produce NT4 and NT77.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't72', which is a terminal. So 't72' must come from either NT13 or NT69, because those are the two non-terminals that seem to appear in the production.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT13 appears in rules like NT70 -> NT76 NT7, NT13 -> NT70 NT46, etc. But does any NT13 produce 't72'? Looking through all NT13 rules, I don't see a terminal production. NT13 only seems to expand into other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT69: in the grammar, NT69's rule is NT69 -> NT23 NT6, and other expansions. Again, does it have a terminal? Let me check all productions for NT69.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT69 has at least two rules:\n\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nand possibly others. Wait, let me check each rule involving NT69.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLine: NT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nNo, I don't see any NT69 -> 't' terminal. So that suggests that NT69 can't directly produce any terminal except perhaps in recursive expansions.\n\nSimilarly, for NT13: all the productions are non-terminals.\n\nThis is a problem because the string starts with 't72', which would have to be produced by either NT13 or NT69. But from the grammar as given, neither NT13 nor NT69 have any direct terminal productions. They all expand into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check all the production rules again to see if any of the non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal's productions:\n\nNT4: NT38 NT74\nNT3: NT10 NT9\nNT10: NT68 NT58\nNT68: NT12 NT69\nNT12: NT38 NT67\nNT67: NT6 NT18\nNT6: NT18\nNT18: NT49 NT80\nNT49: NT46 NT5\nYes! Here we go. NT49 can produce NT46 and NT5. Wait, looking at grammar:\n\nThe line says NT49 -> NT46 NT5. But wait, under NT49, is there any terminal? No, because NT49's production is to NT46 and NT5, both non-terminals.\n\nWait, is there any non-terminal that directly expands into a terminal?\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\nWait, let me check NT47: it has a production NT17 NT38, but that's non-terminals except for a terminal? No, let's see: NT47's rules are NT66 NT1 and NT62. Wait, NT47: \n\nWait, looking for any NT production that ends with a terminal or a single terminal. For example, does any NT have a production where the right side is just a terminal?\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\nNT10: NT68 NT58 \u2192 no terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Looking more carefully:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74 \u2192 non-terminals.\n\nNT74 \u2192 't47' \u2192 Yes! So, NT74 can produce 't47'.\n\nWait, let me check NT74:\n\nLine: NT74 -> 't47'\n\nYes, NT74 has a production to 't47', which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking through other NTs:\n\nNT78: NT5 NT16 \u2192 but no terminals.\n\nNT51: NT34 NT69 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, did I miss NT7? Let me check.\n\nNT77: 't47' or 't34' \u2192 no.\n\nNT5: NT38 NT74 \u2192 so if NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74, and NT74 \u2192 't47', then NT5 can produce 't47' via NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74 \u2192 ... eventually 't47'.\n\nBut looking back, the target string starts with 't72', which would require a NT that can produce 't72', which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-705","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is long, and the grammar is quite extensive, so I need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF entails. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the right-hand side can have a literal (terminal) if it's in the augmented grammar where the start symbol can also produce a single terminal. Wait, no\u2014actually, in standard CNF, all productions either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal? Or is that a separate form like Greibach Normal Form where you can have a terminal on the left?\n\nWait, CNF requires that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Oh right, so in some variants, the productions can have a single terminal as the right-hand side. So looking at the given grammar, I should check if all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems mostly rules are of the form NT -> NT NT, like S -> NT13 NT69, or S -> NT4 NT77. But some rules have a terminal on the right-hand side, such as NT46 -> 't50', NT77 -> 't47', etc. So this might actually be a mix of CNF and something else, but the overall idea is that the terminals are the atomic symbols there.\n\nWait, but standard CNF only allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So yes, this grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals on the right-hand side, so it's in CNF with terminals allowed on the right. So the grammar is valid in CNF with terminals as possible right-hand sides.\n\nThe next step is to parse the input string using this grammar. The string given is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. The string is: `t9 t62 t47 t3 t85 t18 t0 t54 t34 t40 t42 t71 t24 t43 t9 t34 t23 t11 t6 t47 t28 t43 t84 t62 t31 t28 t58 t79 t84 t11 t47 t29 t54 t62 t85 t3 t9 t80`.\n\nSo the string consists of 34 symbols, all of which are 't' followed by digits. Each seems to correspond to a terminal in the grammar, specifically NT numbers or other terminals.\n\nWait, actually, some of these look like they could be terminals: 't50', 't47', etc., but in the string, it's 't9', 't62', which are just terminals.\n\nSo to parse this, I can treat each 'tX' as a terminal, where X is a number. So each token in the string is a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the strategy would be to perform a top-down parsing using the given grammar. Alternatively, maybe converting the grammar into a parser or using a recursive descent approach.\n\nBut given the size, maybe it's easier to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the string as a series of steps where each step involves matching a production rule from the start symbol S.\n\nBut another approach is to check if each token in the string can be produced by the grammar, starting from S, and ensuring that the entire string is consumed.\n\nWait, but the grammar is given in CNF, which is a way that makesParsing algorithms, like recursive descent or shift-reduce, feasible. Since it's also a single context-free grammar, perhaps we can simulate the parsing steps.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to represent the string as a list and attempt to break it down using the grammar rules, ensuring that each part of the string corresponds to a production.\n\nAnother thought is to see if the string can be generated by the given grammar, so perhaps we can model the possible expansions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each token can be matched to a rule that directly produces it as a terminal symbol. For example, looking at the terminals in the string: t9, t62, t47, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, certain non-terminals produce certain terminals. For instance, NT46 -> 't50', NT77 -> 't47', NT7 -> 't44', etc.\n\nBut in our string, we have 't9'. Looking at the grammar, is there a rule that produces 't9'? Let's see: the production '1' -> 't3', but in the provided grammar, 1 is mapped to t3. Similarly, NT7 -> 't44', NT21 -> 't73', etc.\n\nWait, but I think in the grammar, some Nts produce single terminals, like NT77 -> 't47', which is the production. So 't9' probably comes from a production that has 't9' on the RHS, but in the provided grammar, the rule is: NT34 -> 't78', NT62 -> 't71', etc.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT that produce 't9' as a terminal: In the list, I see NT1 -> 't3', NT4 -> 't54', NT13 -> 't70', etc. Hmm, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't9' as a terminal. So 't9' must be part of a production where the top symbols include a production rule that has 't9' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's part of a two-step process where, for instance, an NT like NT56 could produce a combination that includes 't31' and something else. But maybe it's better to see what each terminal in the string can be generated by.\n\nWait, let me check: the string is a sequence of terminals, each is a 't' followed by a number. Let me list all the terminals the string has: t9, t62, t47, t3, t85, t18, t0, t54, t34, t40, t42, t71, t24, t43, t9, t34, t23, t11, t6, t47, t28, t43, t84, t62, t31, t28, t58, t79, t84, t11, t47, t29, t54, t62, t85, t3, t9, t80.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the grammar. Alternatively, if the entire string can be broken down into productions starting from S.\n\nLet me start at S. The initial S is S -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77. So the string must start with either NT13 and NT69, or NT4 and NT77.\n\nLet's check if the first token 't9' is produced by either NT13 or NT4. But looking at the rules:\n\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46: so NT13 expands into two non-terminals.\n- NT4 -> 't54': Oh wait, so T4 can produce 't54' directly.\n\nHmm, so T4 can produce 't54', but in the string, the first token is 't9'. So 't9' wouldn't come directly from NT4, as NT4 can only produce 't54'.\n\nSo perhaps the string doesn't start with NT4 as the first symbol. Let's see if T9 can come from NT3. Looking at NT3: The rule is NT3 -> NT10 NT9. So NT3 would expand into NT10 and NT9. So perhaps NT9 can produce 't9'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT9 -> NT46 NT62, and NT46 -> 't50', so that can't directly produce 't9'. Wait, but maybe through other steps. Let me see NT9 -> 't46' and 't62', but NT9 isn't a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with some other symbol. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the string starts with t9, so let me check if any production could directly produce it as a terminal. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT1 -> 't3'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT13 -> 't70'\nNT47 -> 't84'\nBut that's from the expansion leading to single terminals.\n\nLooking at more Nts produced as terminals:\n\nLooking at all possible NTs that have a production to a single 't' followed by a number. For example, NT46->t50, NT77->t47, NT7->t44, etc.\n\nLooking for 't9': is there any NT that produces 't9' directly?

{"custom_id":"request-724","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. The grammar provided fits that since most rules have two non-terminals or terminals on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if this string can be derived step by step from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules.\n\nLet me write down the grammar again to keep track:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT69\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with the concatenation of either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.

Wait, let me check the NT rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal symbols are mostly single letters, like t47, t39, t54, etc. So, for example, NT77 has production rules:\n\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n\nBut in the string, it starts with t78. Hmm, wait, is t78 a terminal or a non-terminal?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, all rules where the left side is a non-terminal have right sides with combinations of non-terminals or specific terminals. For example, NT78 -> 't78', but wait, does NT78 exist?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT78 as a non-terminal. Instead, I see entries like NT78 -> 't77' and maybe others? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT56 -> 't62'\n- NT78 -> 't72'\n- NT34 -> 't9', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see a rule that defines NT78; instead, I see NT77 has 't47' and 't34', but t78 is a separate terminal. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string as a series of terminals, each of which may be a single letter, and check if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see the entire string and see if it can be split into the right sequence of non-terminals expanding down.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can try to work backwards from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that match the left-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nBut wait, the string is long, so let me see: the string starts with t78. Is t78 a terminal that appears on the right-hand side of any rule? Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT78 -> 't72' (but that's generating a terminal, so maybe NT78 is not a terminal that appears in the string.)\nWait, actually, I think I'm mixing up NTs and terminals. Let me re-express the rules:\n\nFor example, some rules produce terminals directly, like NT5 -> 't39', or NT4 -> 't54', etc. So 't's are terminals, and the non-terminals (NTx) are the non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which is a single letter from the grammar's production rules.\n\nSo in the string, each 't' is a terminal, and I need to check if the entire string can be a result of expansions of the start symbol S leading to these terminals.\n\nSo starting from S:\n\nS can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nSo the string must start with NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t78. Let me check if either NT13 or NT4 can produce a terminal that starts with t78, but wait, NT13 and NT4 are non-terminals, so they can produce combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the productions of NT13 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n- NT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nSo NT13 and NT69 expand to other non-terminals first. Similarly, NT4 -> 't54', which is a terminal. So if S expands to NT4 NT77, the first part is NT4, which directly produces 't54'. So the string would start with 't54 t...', right?\n\nBut in our case, the string starts with 't78', which is not 't54', so maybe S is expanding to NT13 NT69. Let's see what NT13 and NT69 can produce.\n\nWait, NT13 -> NT70 NT46. So first, let's see what NT70 and NT46 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT70: NT70 -> NT76 NT7. So NT70 expands further.\n\nNT7 -> 't44', so that's a terminal. So NT70 -> NT76 NT7; then we need to see what NT76 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT76: NT76 -> 't79'. So NT76 is a terminal 't79'. So NT70 expands to 't79 t44'.\n\nWait, so NT70 becomes 't79 t44'.\n\nThen NT13 -> NT70 NT46 becomes 't79 t44 NT46'.\n\nNow, NT46: looking at its production, NT46 -> 't58', which is a terminal. So NT46 is 't58'.\n\nPutting it together, NT13 -> 't79 t44 t58'.\n\nThen, NT69 -> NT23 NT6. Let's see NT23 and NT6.\n\nNT23 -> NT73 NT41. NT73 -> 't9', NT41 -> 't9'. So NT23 becomes 't9 t9'.\n\nNT6: NT6 -> 't18', which is a terminal.\n\nSo NT69 becomes 't9 t9 t18'.\n\nTherefore, the expansion of S as NT13 NT69 would be:\n\n' t79 t44 t58 t9 t9 t18 '.\n\nBut the string starts with t78, which is not in this first expansion. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, so perhaps the string does not start with 't79' but with 't78', which is different. So S must expand to NT4 NT77. Let's check that.\n\nNT4 -> 't54', NT77 can produce 't47' or 't34'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t78, which isn't t54 or t47 or t34. So that doesn't match either.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked that some non-terminals produce terminals that are combinations of other non-terminals. Let me see other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's quite long, but let's see the first few tokens: t78, t85, t68, t11, t3,...\n\nWait, t78 is not a terminal node in the grammar as far as I can see. The only terminals are combinations like 't47', 't34', etc. So if the string includes t78 somewhere, perhaps that's a problem unless that t78 is part of some larger production.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that all terminals are single characters. The string has tokens like 't78', which is a two-character terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-729","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Wow, that's a bit intimidating, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing algorithms and theoretical studies because it simplifies the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the non-terminal symbols are things like S, NT13, NT47, NT45, and so on. The terminals are a bunch of t followed by numbers, like t54, t71, up to t85. The start symbol is S, which according to the rules, can go to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So the initial step is to see if the string can be derived from either of these starting productions.\n\nThe string given is quite long: `t42 t34 t18 t47 t34 t24 t78 t33 t48 t48 t6 t48 t48 t62 t81 t65 t71 t58 t43 t68 t34 t43 t43 t72 t31 t31 t65 t72 t58 t7 t81 t85 t62 t71 t17 t43 t6 t68 t43`. I notice that it's a series of t followed by numbers, which are likely the terminal symbols from the grammar.\n\nMy plan is to try to parse this string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or a method like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to see how the string can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nStarting with the first part, S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So the string must start with the sequence of symbols generated by either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t42. Let's check if t42 can be generated by any of the non-terminals in the grammar. Scanning through the rules, I see that NT42 has a production: NT42 \u2192 t68. Wait, that's t68, not t42. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the entire string and see if it can be split into parts that match the productions. Each step in the parsing would involve expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the right-hand sides of the production rules. For example, starting with NT13 and NT69:\n\nNT13 can produce things like NT70 NT46 or NT32 NT21. Wait, but NT32 can produce t11 or something else. Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at NT32, in the grammar, it's written as NT32 \u2192 t11. But in the string, I see later on t11. Hmm, not sure if that's relevant yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each non-terminal has several productions. For example, S can split into different combinations. So the string needs to be split into such combinations.\n\nBut this approach might take too long. Maybe a better way is to look for the overall structure. The string starts with t42, which perhaps is part of a larger non-terminal production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT47 \u2192 t9, and NT77 \u2192 t47. So maybe somewhere in the string, there's a occurrence of t47 following t42. Let me check: Yes, after t42 comes t34, then t18, t47, etc.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this by trying to match the string to the grammar using the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is just a sequence of terminals, the parser will have to expand the non-terminals step by step until everything is terminals.\n\nLet me try to analyze the string:\n\n1. t42 t34 t18 t47 t34 t24 t78 t33 t48 t48 t6 t48 t48 t62 t81 t65 t71 t58 t43 t68 t34 t43 t43 t72 t31 t31 t65 t72 t58 t7 t81 t85 t62 t71 t17 t43 t6 t68 t43\n\nI can try to split this into parts based on the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So the string starts with NT4 and NT77.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t54 (from the rules), but wait, the string's first symbol is t42, not t54. So maybe S \u2192 NT4 is not the right path here. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT13 NT69 is the path.\n\nLooking at NT13, it can produce NT70 NT46 or NT32 NT21.\n\nIf I choose NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, then I have to split the string as t70 t46, but looking at the string, after the first symbol is t42, not t70.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21. Then t32 t21. But t32 in the string isn't present right after t42.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should look for parts of the string that can be generated by the given rules.\n\nWait, another idea: the string is t42 t34 t18 t47 t34 t24 t78 t33 t48 t48 t6 t48 t48 t62 t81 t65 t71 t58 t43 t68 t34 t43 t43 t72 t31 t31 t65 t72 t58 t7 t81 t85 t62 t71 t17 t43 t6 t68 t43.\n\nI notice that t47 is present several times, which appears in the grammar as NT47 \u2192 t9. That might be a stepping stone.\n\nLooking at the string, t47 occurs at position 4 (0-based?), so after t34, t18, and so on. Maybe the t47 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, let me think about the grammar. Each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So a valid string must be generated by a series of such productions.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be broken into parts where each part is a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and I can look for any known patterns or repetitions in the string that match the grammar's rules.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider how the string could be grouped. For example, the start symbol is S, which is NT4 NT77 or NT13 NT69. So the entire string must be generated from either NT4 and NT77 or NT13 and NT69.\n\nLooking at NT4 \u2192 t54, which is a terminal. So if the string starts with t54, that's possible. But the string starts with t42, so perhaps the other production, NT13 NT69.\n\nSo NT13 produces various things. Let's see. NT13 can be NT70 NT46 or nt32 nt21. Also, looking at the string: perhaps the first part after S is t42 t34, which could correspond to NT13's production.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for any known patterns. I see that t47 appears in the string, and in the grammar, NT77 can produce t47, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the string has t47, which is generated by NT47 \u2192 t9. But I don't see t9 in the string. Unless it's part of a longer production, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be broken into smaller parts that correspond to the productions. For example, looking for a t42, which perhaps is generated by NT42 \u2192 t68. But in the string, after t42 comes t34, not t68.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the end of the string. The last part is t43 t6 t68 t43.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT43 \u2192 t45. But I don't see t45 in the string. Alternatively, maybe NT43 \u2192 t something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's part of a longer production."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar presented. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except possibly the start symbol. However, in this grammar, all the productions except the start symbol S have two non-terminals. The start symbol S produces NT13 NT69, which are also non-terminals. So, the grammar is correctly in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: \n\nt58 t0 t60 t24 t62 t9 t3 t24 t48 t78 t17 t40 t65 t43 t3 t29 t43 t18 t11 t24 t34 t48 t85 t39 t79 t39 t23 t47 t62 t54 t29 t72 t62 t60 t34 t54 t31 t68 t42 t34.\n\nEach token represents a terminal symbol, and I need to check if this can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince this is a parsing problem, the standard approach is to use a parser, but given the complexity, maybe I can manually trace the reductions or see if each token can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to look for the sequence in the grammar's productions. Each production seems to break down into specific t tokens. So, perhaps each 't' token corresponds to a terminal from a production.\n\nLet me list out some key productions:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT69\n- NT47 -> NT66 NT29, which eventually leads to t when it reaches the base cases like NT66 -> NT13 NT1, and nt13 -> t5, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the 't's and see if they correspond to the rules. For example, looking at the 't's:\n\nt58 appears first. Let me find if any production leads to t58. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT that reduce to t58.

{"custom_id":"request-746","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the rules, most of them are non-terminals expanding into two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Each rule starts with S and then two NT symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals, and I need to check if it can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the grammar step by step. The string is: `t62 t58 t18 t71 t23 t79 t11 t81 t68 t29 t24 t54 t50 t33 t50 t11 t48 t6 t47 t33 t68 t9 t60 t78 t31 t62 t80 t65 t9 t85 t24 t54 t54 t54 t23 t65 t84 t34 t17 t42`.\n\nLet me list down the steps I can take:\n\n1. **Parse the String as a Sequence of Terms:**\n   The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, like `t62 t58...t42`. Each token represents a terminal symbol.\n\n2. **Start with the Start Symbol S:**\n   S is the starting point, so we'll build the string from S. Each expansion will replace a non-terminal with symbols and eventually reach the terminals.\n\n3. **Expand S and Its Rules:**\n   From the start, S \u2192 NT4 NT77 or S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\n4. **Visualize the Expansion Tree:**\n   The string is a long sequence, so I'll need to see if it can be constructed by breaking it down into segments that match the grammar rules.\n\nLet me look more closely at the grammar rules. Each rule with S has two non-terminals. Let's take S \u2192 NT4 NT77. NT4 expands into 't54', and NT77 into 't47'. So S \u2192 NT4 NT77 can produce the string 't54 t47'. But our target string is much longer, so I'll need to see if it's made up of such segments.\n\nLooking at the string, after t58, the next token is t18. Since the grammar uses CNF, each production step splits into two non-terminals. The string must be decomposable recursively, building up from smaller pieces.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string from left to right, checking each pair of symbols to see if they can be derived by any NT rule.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, perhaps it's better to check the possible expansions step by step.\n\nLet me consider the first few tokens:\n\nt62, t58, t18, t71...\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see NT56 \u2192 't62', NT78 \u2192 't33', NT53 \u2192 't80', etc. Wait, looking for rules that produce 't62' as a terminal. From the list, NT56 \u2192 't62', NT61 \u2192 't71' (wait, no, looking back: some rules transform into a terminal, like NT78 \u2192 't33', NT42 \u2192 't68', NT46 \u2192 't58', etc.\n\nWait, actually, some NT symbols directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't58' (from NT46 : 't58')\n- NT5 \u2192 't39' (but that's a single terminal, which would not fit in CNF since each production splits into two)\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, each production must consist of exactly two non-terminals or terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, productions can only be A\u2192BC (two non-terminals) or A\u2192a (a terminal). So, if an NT rule produces a terminal, that's fine.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, let's list the NT symbols that produce terminals:\n\n- NT46: 't58'\n- NT29: 't73' (Wait, no, looking at the given rules, let me check each line.)\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47' (line 22 and 7)\nNT78 \u2192 't5' (line 26)\nWait, no, looking at line 4: NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29\nLine 5: NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\nLine 6: NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80\nLine 7: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nLine 8: NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\nLine 9: NT60 \u2192 NT38 NT18\nLine 10: NT9 \u2192 NT31 NT45\nLine 11: NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61\nLine 12: NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4\nLine 13: NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74\nLine 14: NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\nLine 15: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45\nLine 16: NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68\nLine 17: NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62\nLine 18: NT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3\nLine 19: NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\nLine 20: NT5 \u2192 NT83 NT9\nLine 21: NT21 \u2192 NT73 NT53\nLine 22: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\nLine 23: NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18\nLine 24: NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT58\nLine 25: NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1\nLine 26: NT10 \u2192 NT68 NT58\nLine 27: NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21\nLine 28: NT12 \u2192 NT38 NT67\nLine 29: NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80\nLine 30: NT53 \u2192 NT17 NT38\nLine 31: NT53 \u2192 NT80 NT69\nLine 32: NT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47\nLine 33: NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16\nLine 34: NT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69\nLine 35: NT56 \u2192 't62' (Hmm, no, line 11 says NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61, but looking for NT that produce a terminal, perhaps lines with 'a' would be non-terminals.)\n\nWait, perhaps looking for NT that produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through all lines, I see:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT67 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, checking the lines, perhaps these are not terminals.

I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. Hmm. The string is a bunch of 't' followed by numbers, like t79 t54 t62 and so on. \n\nFirst, I should probably understand what this grammar is generating. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production is either combining two non-terminals or producing a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several non-terminals, like S, NT13, NT47, etc., but the terminals are all 't' followed by numbers. So, each terminal is a 't' plus a digit. The start symbol is S, and the grammar seems to have rules where S branches into different combinations of NTs.\n\nThe first step might be to reverse the string because building parse trees usually starts from the beginning, but longer strings can make parsing difficult. Alternatively, maybe I can try to find a leftmost derivation or see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building an automatic parser or using memoization to check if the string is acceptable. Since the grammar is small, maybe manually breaking down the string into parts that fit the productions.\n\nLooking at the terminals, the string is t79 t54 t62 t29 t28 t3 t40 t71 t11 t6 t0 t62 t44 t65 t44 t80 t24 t39 t23 t78 t50 t81 t7 t85 t39 t68 t78 t33 t3 t68 t17 t47 t81 t34 t58 t58 t7 t7 t11 t81 t84.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of terminals. Let's see if any of these can be formed directly from the grammar. Looking at the productions, I see that some NTs produce terminals like 't3', 't50', 't54', etc. For example, NT4 produces 't54', NT5 produces 't39', NT1 produces 't3', NT78 produces 't72', but wait, in the string, we have t79, which is a terminal I don't immediately see in the productions.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again.

No, in the initial grammar, I see things like NT16 \u2192 t28, but in the given grammar, I have to look through the rules.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is given with various NT rules. Let me go through each to see which produce terminals.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t47\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT62 \u2192 t71\n- NT38 \u2192 t47\n- NT34 \u2192 t9 (but is that a terminal? Wait, the string has t34, which is a combination of 't' and '34', which is a terminal.\nWait, looking at the productions, some NTs produce a string of terminals. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either to a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, 't' followed by numbers must be a single terminal, or maybe not.\n\nWait, this might complicate things. Perhaps I should note which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT13 ... etc.\n- NT77 \u2192 t47\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT38 \u2192 t47 (Wait, but 't47' is a single terminal? Or is that a mistake? Let me check: in the given grammar, one production is NT77 \u2192 t47, another is NT38 \u2192 t47. So, 't47' is a terminal? Similarly, NT77 \u2192 t47, so any occurrence of 't47' in the string must have been derived from NT77.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 \u2192 t39, so 't39' is a terminal. NT4 \u2192 t54, so 't54' is a terminal. NT1 is 't3', so 't3' is a terminal.\n\nSo, in the string, whenever we see a 't' followed by a one or two-digit number like t3, t7, t28, t39, t47, t54, etc., these must be terminals produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nSo, any occurrence of 'tX' in the string where X is a number\u2014let's see if any of these correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t79 t54 t62 t29 t28 t3 t40 t71 t11 t6 t0 t62 t44 t65 t44 t80 t24 t39 t23 t78 t50 t81 t7 t85 t39 t68 t78 t33 t3 t68 t17 t47 t81 t34 t58 t58 t7 t7 t11 t81 t84.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminal occurrences:\n\n- t79\n- t54\n- t62\n- t29\n- t28\n- t3\n- t40\n- t71\n- t11\n- t6\n- t0\n- t62\n- t44\n- t65\n- t44\n- t80\n- t24\n- t39\n- t23\n- t78\n- t50\n- t81\n- t7\n- t85\n- t39\n- t68\n- t78\n- t33\n- t3\n- t68\n- t17\n- t47\n- t81\n- t34\n- t58\n- t58\n- t7\n- t7\n- t11\n- t81\n- t84\n\nNow, let's see which of these are in the set of terminals given by the grammar.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT4 \u2192 t54, so 't54' is present.\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3, so 't3' is present.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t39, so 't39' is present.\n\nNT77 \u2192 t47, so 't47' is present.\n\nNT47 \u2192 t84?

{"custom_id":"request-765","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I know that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal directly. The grammar provided seems to have all rules in CNF except maybe the start symbol S, which is not explicitly shown. Wait, looking back at the grammar, S is the start symbol, and it's only rewritten into two non-terminals, so that's fine.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terms separated by spaces, like \"t0 t39 t33 t40...\" and so on, all the way up to \"t37\". Each of these terms looks like a terminal symbol because they are single letters with a number. In CNF, the derivation process only involves non-terminals until terminals are reached. So, the string consists entirely of terminals, meaning that the entire string must be derived directly from the start symbol through some sequence of productions.\n\nNow, the process would involve tracing from the string back to the start symbol S by reversing the productions. Each term in the string must come from a terminal production, so I can check if each term is accounted for in the grammar. \n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal is listed as a production, except maybe some. For example, NT4 -> 't54' is a production. Wait, but in the grammar provided, all the terminals are represented as 'tN', like 't0', 't3', etc. So, each term in the string must match one of these 't' productions.\n\nLooking at the string: let's break it down. The first term is 't0', which in the grammar is generated by NT9 -> 't0'. So, that's valid. Next is 't39', which is from NT5 -> 't39'. Then 't33' is from NT33 -> 't33', and so on.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the entire string can be built step by step from S. Let me consider the structure of the grammar. The start symbol S is defined as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\n   | NT4 NT77\n\nSo, the string starts with NT13 or NT4. Let me check the given string. The first term is 't0', which is from NT9. But S doesn't directly produce NT9, it produces NT13 or NT4 on the first step. So, that's a problem. Wait, that would mean that the string starts with a terminal that's only produced by NT9, but the start symbol S can't directly produce that because S's only productions are NT13 NT13 or NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, if the first production is 't0', there's no rule that starts S with 't0'. That would immediately mean the string isn't possible, right? Because S can't directly derive 't0'; it has to go through NT9, but NT9 is a non-terminal in the string. Hmm, but in the string, the first symbol is 't0', so that's a terminal, so it must come directly from a non-terminal rule that directly produces a terminal. So, does any non-terminal in the grammar produce 't0'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, yes: NT9 -> 't0' is one of the productions. Wait, but that's correct. So, the first symbol in the string is 't0' which comes from NT9. But the start symbol S can't directly use NT9 because S's only productions are NT13 NT13 or NT4 NT77. So, the initial symbols in the string can't be 't0' unless S somehow produces something that leads to 't0', but that's only possible through NT9, which isn't part of S's direct productions.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with 't0' because some other path through the grammar. Let me think. Maybe it's derived through a longer chain. For example, starting from S, which goes into NT13 or NT4, then each of those goes into more non-terminals, eventually leading to 't0'.\n\nI need to check if there's a derivation path from S to the string starting with 't0'. Let's try to see. If the first term is 't0', which is from NT9, then S must have produced NT9. But in the grammar, NT9 can come from where? Let's look at the productions for NT9:\n\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45\n         NT46 NT62\n         NT53\n         Maybe others? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45\nNT9 -> NT46 NT62\nNT9 -> NT53\n\nWait, no, actually in the grammar, for NT9, the productions are:\n\nLooking back:\n\nLine by line:\n\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45\n\nWait, hold on, no:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLine 2: NT4 -> 't54'\n...\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the NT9 productions from the grammar. Let me scan through the grammar.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Line 1: S -> NT13 NT13\n\n- Line 2: S -> NT4 NT77\n\n- ... etc.\n\nNow, looking for NT9:\n\nLooking for lines starting with NT9:\n\n- Line ... Let me search through each line:\n\n- Line 20: NT18 -> NT49 NT80\n\n- Line 21: NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\n- Line 22: NT12 -> NT38 NT67\n\n- Line 23: NT9 -> NT46 NT62\n\n- Line 24: NT53 -> NT17 NT38\n\n- Line 25: NT53 -> NT80 NT69\n\nWait, so looking at line 24: NT9 -> NT46 NT62\n\nAnd line 21: NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nSo, NT9 produces NT46 and NT62. So, NT9 could be part of a derivation path from S.\n\nSo, starting from S, if S goes to NT4, which is:\n\nLooking back: S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 is defined as:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT4 has a production: line 17: NT4 -> 't54'.\n\nSo, NT4 directly produces 't54', which is one of the terminals in the string. Wait, but in the string, the second term is 't39', which is from NT5.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to map out the string and see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nThe string is: t0 t39 t33 t40 t68 t31 t9 t47 t54 t33 t78 t80 t43 t17 t65 t33 t23 t44 t79 t50 t18 t17 t72 t24 t58 t29 t71 t42 t85 t31 t47 t28 t81 t79 t47 t43 t85 t6 t31 t48 t50.\n\nWait, that's 40 terms. Let me see if each term corresponds to a production that can be part of a larger derivation.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backward from each terminal in the string to its production and see if the entire string can be built by combining these productions in a way that ultimately comes from S.\n\nEach terminal in the string must be part of some NT's production, and these NT's must form a chain that can be connected through the start rule.\n\nSo, let's start with the first term: 't0' comes from NT9, as per NT9 -> 't0'.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is 't0', which implies that in the derivation, NT9 is the first non-terminal to produce it.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol S produces non-terminals, so the initial step from S can't directly produce 't0'. Instead, perhaps the derivation is as follows:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 (rule 1)\nThen, one of the NT13's must produce something. Let's look at NT13's productions.\n\nNT13 has a production NT13 -> NT70 NT46 (line 7: NT13 -> NT70 NT46) and another production? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, line 7 is NT13 -> NT70 NT46. Is there another production for NT13? Yes, line 6: NT13 -> NT32 NT21.\n\nSo, NT13 can go to NT70 NT46 or NT32 NT21.\n\nIf one of the NT13's in the S split goes to NT70 NT46, then NT70 is produced. Let's check NT70's production.\n\nNT70 is defined as:\n\nLooking through the grammar, line 9: NT70 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-788","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like \"t65 t9 t31 t54...\". \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, so each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is 'S', which branches into NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Each of these non-terminals further breaks down into other non-terminals until they reach terminals (indicated by the apostrophes, like 't50'), which are the actual terminal symbols.\n\nMy goal is to parse the given string against this grammar. Since it's a tree-like structure, I might need to use a top-down parsing method like the CYK algorithm, but given the complexity, maybe a recursive descent approach could work too. Alternatively, I can try to construct the parse tree manually.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of 't's followed by numbers, so each of these is a terminal symbol. The numbers from 65 to 79 suggest these are indices into the grammar's production rules. For example, 't65' corresponds to NT65, which is a production rule, but in the grammar provided, I notice that some NTs resolve to terminals, like NT53 producing 't50' or 't80'.\n\nWait, looking more closely, the grammar has rules where NTx resolves to two other non-terminals on the right, which eventually lead to terminals. Some of these terminals are 't' followed by a number. So each 'tX' in the string corresponds to a specific production rule in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the NTs that produce terminals. For example, NT36 becomes NT56 NT61, which then resolve to 't56' and 't61'. Wait, but in the grammar, some of these are direct terminals. For instance, NT5 becomes 't39' and 't74', but looking at the given grammar, I see NT5 has two rules: one producing 't39' and another producing 't74'. So NT5 is a terminal symbol, not a non-terminal? Or maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, each rule like NT5 -> 't39' or NT5 -> 't74' implies that NT5 is a non-terminal that can produce either of those two terminal strings. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals, so perhaps some of these are further breakdowns.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, all productions are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So any production that has a symbol like 't54' as a terminal must be handled by a production that directly gives that terminal. So looking at the grammar, I see NT46 -> 't58', which would mean that NT46 is a non-terminal that can produce 't58', and similarly NT53 can produce 't34' or 't47' or others.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, there are some entries where NTx is defined as two NTs, and some where NTx is defined as 'tX'. For example, NT5 -> 't39' and 't74'\u2014but that's not possible because each production in CNF must have two non-terminals. So perhaps I misinterpreted the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, for example, the production is written as \"NT5 -> 't39'\" which would mean that NT5 can produce the terminal 't39'. Similarly, NT56 -> 't31', etc. So these are productions where the non-terminal NTx produces a single terminal symbol, hence they are directly a terminal, not further broken down. That's important because it means that once a NTx is a terminal, it's a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nSo putting this all together, the grammar has a mix of terminal symbols (those with direct definitions to 'tX') and non-terminals, which can break down into other non-terminals (each with two elements on the RHS). \n\nNow, the string provided starts with 't65 t9 t31 t54 t71 t80 t60 t23 t29 t11 t18 t60 t60 t33 t0 t65 t34 t79 t47 t33 t34 t60 t39 t24 t71 t84 t7 t47 t7 t18 t3 t84 t18 t40 t24 t9 t39 t78 t84 t79 t65 t44'.\n\nEach token is separated by a space, so I need to split this string into individual tokens. Let's list them:\n\n1. t65\n2. t9\n3. t31\n4. t54\n5. t71\n6. t80\n7. t60\n8. t23\n9. t29\n10. t11\n11. t18\n12. t60\n13. t60\n14. t33\n15. t0\n16. t65\n17. t34\n18. t79\n19. t47\n20. t33\n21. t34\n22. t60\n23. t39\n24. t24\n25. t71\n26. t84\n27. t7\n28. t47\n29. t7\n30. t18\n31. t3\n32. t84\n33. t18\n34. t40\n35. t24\n36. t9\n37. t39\n38. t78\n39. t84\n40. t79\n41. t65\n42. t44\n\nNow, the first step is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Let's tackle this step by step.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. Looking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n- S -> NT13 NT69\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo the start is either the combination of NT13 and NT69, or NT4 and NT77. Therefore, the string must start with the symbols generated by either NT13 and NT69, or NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the first token, it's t65. So let's see which of these NTs can produce t65.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, I don't see NT13 or NT69 directly producing t65. Let me search through the grammar for NT13 and NT69.\n\nLooking at NT13: From the given rules, I see NT13 -> NT70 NT46, and NT69 -> NT23 NT6.\n\nSo, in the first token, t65, but neither NT13 nor NT69 directly produce t65. So perhaps the first step isn't S -> NT13 NT69, but S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nCheck NT4 in the first token? NT4 -> 't54' according to the grammar. Oh! Wait, look at the rules: \"NT4 -> 't54'\". So NT4 can produce 't54'. \n\nBut the first token is t65, not t54. Hmm. Wait, that suggests a discrepancy. If S branches into NT4 NT77, then the first token should be t54, but it's t65. Similarly, if we take S -> NT13 NT69, the first tokens should be whatever NT13 and NT69 produce. Let's see: NT13 is \"NT13 -> NT70 NT46\", so it will generate two symbols after that. Let me see what NT70 and NT46 produce.\n\nLooking at NT70: \"NT70 -> NT76 NT7\". NT7 is 't44', as per \"NT7 -> 't44'\". So NT70 produces the pair (NT76, t44). Now, NT76 isn't explicitly a terminal in the given rules, but looking through, for example, NT66 -> 't13' in some other rule. Wait no, wait.

{"custom_id":"request-809","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm presented with a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to evaluate whether it's generated by this grammar. My task is to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar and respond with \"Yes\" or \"No.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make it a bit easier because the derivation will follow a binary tree structure, and each step will produce exactly two symbols until all are terminals.\n\nLet's parse the given string: `t54 t80 t50 t17 t84 t3 t24 t54 t29 t44 t31 t68 t44 t78 t85 t11 t18 t47 t60 t44 t62 t23 t7 t17 t0 t39 t24 t3 t54 t0 t72 t44 t33 t40 t65 t60 t62 t40 t54 t58 t24 t7 t84`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' plus number seems to correspond to a symbol in the grammar, perhaps a terminal. My initial thought is to map each token in the string to the grammar symbols and see if they can be derived through the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can represent the parsing as a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S. However, given the string's complexity, perhaps bottom-up parsing (like the CYK algorithm) would be more efficient, but I'll try to approach it step by step manually.\n\nLet's start by looking at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which can produce two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nEach of these non-terminals (like NT13, NT4, NT69, NT77) can further produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'll need to see if the string can be constructed starting from these initial productions.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules to get a better sense:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see all the productions either lead to terminals (e.g., 't54') or other non-terminals, each with two parts.\n\nFor example, NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29, and NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1.\n\nSo, each non-terminal is split into two parts, and so on until terminals are reached.\n\nGiven the string, each 't' + number corresponds to a terminal. So, the string is a sequence of such terminals. I'll need to see if each element can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to map each token to the possible productions they can come from and see if the entire string can be constructed by following the productions.\n\nBut considering the length of the string (39 tokens), it's quite extensive, so I might need a systematic way.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be generated by either starting with S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nFirst, let's see the start rule:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nWhich would produce two parts: NT13 and NT69.\n\nLooking at the first tokens of the string: t54, t80, t50, etc.\n\nWait, but at the beginning, the first symbol after S would be NT13 or NT4 depending on which production we take.\n\nWait no. If S produces NT13 and NT69, each of those can produce more non-terminals until they terminate. So the first symbol would be the start of the first non-terminal, and the second symbol the start of the second.\n\nBut in the string, the first two tokens are t54 and t80. Wait, but let's look at the string again:\n\nThe string starts with t54 t80 t50 t17 t84 t3 t24 t54 t29 t44 t31 t68 t44 t78 t85 t11 t18 t47 t60 t44 t62 t23 t7 t17 t0 t39 t24 t3 t54 t0 t72 t44 t33 t40 t65 t60 t62 t40 t54 t58 t24 t7 t84.\n\nWait, so the first step is to see how the string can be divided into two parts, each corresponding to a production starting with the start symbol.\n\nGiven S can produce two parts, let's see if the entire string can be split into two equal parts, each starting with NT... and then see if those can be derived.\n\nBut the string has 39 tokens. Since 39 is odd, it can't be exactly divided into two equal parts, which is required for a derivation starting with S\u2192NT13 NT69 or S\u2192NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If each production of S splits into exactly two non-terminals, and each non-terminal splits similarly, then the entire string must have an even number of symbols because each step adds two symbols until they terminate. But the string has 39 symbols, which is odd, which would be impossible.\n\nWait, let me think: Starting with S, each step in the derivation adds two symbols (since it's CNF: each production is two non-terminals, which themselves can produce two, until you reach terminals). But the starting point is S, which is one symbol, and each production introduces two, so the number of symbols at each level would be:\n\n- Start: 1 (S)\n- After first expansion: 2 (e.g., NT13 NT69)\n- Then each of those can split again, but each production is two, so the total number would remain a multiple of 1, but in reality, each split doubles the number. Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the derivation tree.\n\nEach expansion step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time. Wait, no: at each step, you substitute one non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the total number increases by one. Starting from 1 (S), then 2, then 3, etc. So 1 \u2192 2 (after one expansion), then 2 \u2192 3 (another), etc. Therefore, the total number of symbols is 1 + the number of expansions.\n\nHence, the number of symbols in the derived string should be 1 + number of productions. But wait, for a string of length n, starting from S, the number of expansions would be n-1, making the total number of symbols n.\n\nBut wait, when S derives into two non-terminals, each of those can further derive into two, etc. So for the string length, it's actually 2^k, where k is the number of steps, but that's only if the entire string is broken down into individual terminals. But in this case, each intermediate step may not necessarily reduce to single terminals, but eventually, each symbol must terminate.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each non-terminal expansion adds one more symbol until the entire string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think with a small example.\n\nSuppose S \u2192 A B, and A \u2192 t, B \u2192 t. Then the string is \"tt\", which has length 2.\n\nAnother example: S \u2192 A B, A \u2192 C D, B \u2192 E F, and C \u2192 t, D \u2192 t, E \u2192 t, F \u2192 t. Then the string would be \"tttt\", which has length 4.\n\nSo the length of the string should be a power of 2, or perhaps dependent on the expansion steps.\n\nBut in our case, the input string has 39 symbols, which is not a power of 2, nor is it even. 39 is equal to 32 + 7, but regardless, it's not a power of 2. Given that the grammar is in CNF, each step doubles the number of non-terminals, but each non-terminal must eventually terminate into a single terminal.\n\nWait, but in our case, the string is a derived string where each symbol is a single terminal, and the order in which they appear corresponds to the leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's impossible to have a string with an odd number of symbols, because each production adds two symbols from one, so the total count increases by one each time a non-terminal is expanded.\n\nBut from S (1 symbol) to NT13 NT69 (2 symbols) \u2013 that adds one symbol. Then, each of those NTs can expand into two, so from 2 symbols to 4, each step adding one symbol, then to 5, 7, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the derivation steps. Let's take the string and see if its length is possible.\n\nGiven the string has 39 symbols, which is an odd number.

{"custom_id":"request-808","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it has a certain structure that might make parsing easier.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol (like S, NTx, etc.) can be replaced by two other symbols. The terminals are the tokens with 't' followed by numbers, like t54, t6, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t54 t50 t78 t79 t3 t42 t7 t31 t72 t31 t50 t54 t78 t48 t18 t18 t78 t78 t44 t34 t40 t33 t84 t78 t79 t39 t80 t71 t0 t79 t33 t44 t17 t6 t58 t18 t78 t62 t33 t79 t31 t6 t68.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are symbols. In terms of parsing, this often suggests that a recursive descent parser or a top-down approach could work. However, considering that the string is quite long, I might need a more systematic way to check each production.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT13 NT69 (Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, S is actually not S -> NT13 NT13 NT69. Hmm, looking at the initial grammar provided, I see:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\n\nHmm, maybe I misread earlier. Let me confirm. Actually, the grammar provided says:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nWait, each S production is two non-terminals. So S must be the start symbol. So any string generated by this grammar should start with either the first or the second production of S. That is, the first token should be either the concatenation of two non-terminals derived from NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54. So I need to see if t54 can be the result of either S's production. Alternatively, perhaps I need to trace back through the productions.\n\nBut wait, actually, the string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the entire string can be parsed by the grammar. Each step in the parse must consist of replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check the first token, t54. Looking at the grammar rules, which non-terminals produce t54? Checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the RHS of the productions, I see rules like:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't9'\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT62 \u2192 't71'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54' (Ah, here it is. The production NT4 \u2192 't54'. So if I have NT4, it can be replaced by 't54'.\n\nSimilarly, checking other rules, for example:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't9'\n- NT42 \u2192 't68'\n- NT49 \u2192 't40'\n- NT53 can produce 't47' or 't80'\n\nSo, the string starts with t54, which must come from NT4 \u2192 't54'. So the first part of the string is 't54', which corresponds to NT4. Therefore, to produce this, we must have a production where NT4 is derived from something. Let me check the grammar for productions that have NT4 as the left-hand side (LHS). Scanning through the grammar rules:\n\n- Looking for A \u2192 ... where A is NT4.\nWait, the grammar is all in the form X \u2192 YY, where X is a non-terminal and YY are two symbols. So I need to look for which productions have NT4 on the LHS.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production where NT4 is the LHS. Hmmm. That means NT4 is a terminal because in CNF, the LHS is a non-terminal, and the RHS is two non-terminals. Wait, no: in some cases, a production can have a single terminal as the only symbol on the RHS, but in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the RHS.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols. If a non-terminal can produce a terminal, that's part of the grammar. Looking at the grammar rules, I see some have 't X' where X is a number, like 't54', that's a terminal.\n\nSo NT4 \u2192 't54' is a production, meaning NT4 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal symbol t54. Then, to produce NT4, we need to replace it with something else. But in the grammar, does any production produce NT4? Let's check all the production rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production where the LHS is NT4. So NT4 is a non-terminal that only has one production, which is to produce the terminal 't54'. Therefore, NT4 is a leaf node. So, in the string, any occurrence of 't54' must come from NT4, but since CT4 has no other productions, it's a leaf. Therefore, the string can have 't54' only if it's at the top level of a derivation. But in our case, the first token is 't54', so the start symbol S must derive into something that starts with NT4.\n\nWait, the start symbol S has two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo, the start symbol S can derive into two possible combinations. For the string to start with 't54', the first production must be S \u2192 NT4 NT77, because NT4 \u2192 t54, and NT77 \u2192 ... let's check NT77.\n\nLooking at NT77's production: NT77 \u2192 't47'. Wait, does NT77 produce 't47'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT77 \u2192 't47' and also NT77 \u2192 't34'. So, NT77 can be replaced by either 't47' or 't34'.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT4 NT77, and NT4 \u2192 t54 and NT77 \u2192 t47, then the first two symbols would be t54 t47. But the string starts with t54 t50. So that wouldn't match. Alternatively, if S \u2192 NT4 NT77, and NT77 \u2192 t34, then the first part would be t54 t34. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me verify: the grammar as provided has S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, S must start the string with either the combination of NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t54, which comes from NT4. So the first production must be S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Because S \u2192 NT13 NT69 would start with NT13, which isn't t54.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nTherefore, the first two symbols in the string must be the result of NT4 and NT77 being processed. But since we have S \u2192 NT4 NT77, which are non-terminals. So each of these non-terminals must produce a sequence of symbols.\n\nWe already said NT4 \u2192 t54.\n\nNow, what about NT77? NT77 can produce t47 or t34. So, the production could be t47 or t34, but the string is t54 t50..., so after t54, the next token is t50. So after NT4 (t54) and NT77, it must produce t54 followed by something that starts with t50.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT4 NT77 would produce t54 (from NT4) and whatever NT77 produces. But in this case, NT77 is the next non-terminal (A) that needs to be expanded.\n\nSo, the first two tokens are t54 and (the first symbol from NT77's expansion). Let's check NT77's productions:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47' or 't34'\n\nBut the second token in the string is t50. So, t54 is from NT4, and the second symbol is t50. So, we need NT77 to produce something that starts with t5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-830","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I have to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar provided. CNF has two main rules: each production is either A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, I notice that some productions have non-terminals on both sides, like S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Wait, but in CNF, right-hand sides can have at most two non-terminals. Hmm, actually, in some cases, it's allowed to have one non-terminal and a terminal because we can represent terminals as A \u2192 a, and S is the start symbol, which is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, CNF requires that each production be either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So in that case, a production like S \u2192 NT13 NT69 would be a valid CNF production because NT13 and NT69 are non-terminals, but right-hand sides with two terminals are not allowed. Wait, no, that's a production from S, which is a terminal? Or no, S is a non-terminal, so it's allowed to produce two non-terminals. Wait, but in that case, then S can lead to two non-terminals, which then themselves can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut looking again at the grammar, the right-hand sides have some terminals, for example, NT5 -> 't39', which is a production where NT5 is a non-terminal that produces the terminal 't39'. Similarly, other non-terminals produce terminals like 't50', 't47', 't9', etc.\n\nSo the grammar has a mix of productions: some produce terminals (e.g., NT5 \u2192 't39'), and others produce pairs of non-terminals (e.g., S \u2192 NT13 NT69, NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29).\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t40 t72 t34 t17 t47 t65 t3 t80 t47 t72 t50 t6 t3 t65 t31 t3 t84 t29 t68 t79 t81 t40 t33 t68 t78 t7 t62 t48 t47 t3 t0 t78 t72 t84 t80 t54 t79 t39 t23 t33 t62 t7 t40 t6`.\n\nSince this is a sequence of terminals, the string must be fully derived from the start symbol S, meaning the entire string must be a series of terminal symbols derived directly or indirectly from S.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to model this as a parsing problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can try to parse the string using the grammar's rules, step by step, ensuring that each production is followed correctly.\n\nTo make this manageable, I'll try to construct a parse tree for the given string. Each production in the grammar either introduces a terminal or breaks down into non-terminals. However, since the string is a linear sequence of terminals, each step in the parse tree must correspond to the production rules that generate these terminals directly or through non-terminals.\n\nWait a second, this seems a bit complicated. Another approach might be to represent the grammar's non-terminals as variables and see if the given string can be generated by building a tree that matches the sequence step by step, processing the string from left to right.\n\nAlternatively, because the grammar is context-free and can be parsed in a certain way, perhaps using recursive descent parsing or another method, I could try to simulate the parsing of the string through each non-terminal's rules.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, the string has 54 elements. I need to see if each of these can be generated by the grammar's terminals and the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a rule that can help me quickly determine whether the string is possible.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string contains a mix of terminals like 't40', 't72', etc. Looking at the grammar, some of these terminals are produced by specific non-terminals. For example, NT5 produces 't39', NT39 produces 't23', and so on.\n\nTo break this down, perhaps I can create a dictionary mapping each non-terminal to the terminals it can produce. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT39 \u2192 't23'\n- NT23 \u2192 't68'\n\nSo, the sequence 't39 t23 t68' in the string corresponds to NT5 \u2192 't39' followed by NT23 \u2192 't68', with 't40' and other terms in between. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to represent the grammar as a set of production rules and simulate the parsing process. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step can either consume one terminal and split into two non-terminals, or proceed through the production chain.\n\nBut without knowing the exact parsing rules, this might get too involved. Maybe an alternative approach is to consider that each production in the grammar is either a terminal or a non-terminal split into two non-terminals. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be generated by some rule.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt40 t72 t34 t17 t47 t65 t3 t80 t47 t72 t50 t6 t3 t65 t31 t3 t84 t29 t68 t79 t81 t40 t33 t68 t78 t7 t62 t48 t47 t3 t0 t78 t72 t84 t80 t54 t79 t39 t23 t33 t62 t7 t40 t6.\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step, breaking it down into segments that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So, S must split into two non-terminals.\n\nLet's pick the first option: S \u2192 NT13 NT69. This would mean that the first part of the string should be the sequence NT13 followed by NT69.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46 (from the grammar). So NT13 produces NT70 and NT46.\n\nNow, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 or NT70 \u2192 't7'. From the grammar, there are multiple productions for NT70. For example, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 and NT70 \u2192 't7'. So, it can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal 't7'.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 \u2192 NT47 NT65 from the grammar (looking at the rules: NT46 \u2192 NT47 NT65. So NT46 -> a production of NT47 and NT65.\n\nNow, this suggests that S would generate 't76 t7' or 't7' or something else. Wait, but this seems a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a leftmost derivation approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the string is quite long, perhaps I can look for any non-terminals in the string that do not have a valid production. If any terminal is produced by more than one possible non-terminal, it might complicate things, but given the structure, perhaps each terminal corresponds to exactly one non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each terminal is produced by only one non-terminal. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT39 \u2192 't23'\n- NT23 \u2192 't68'\n\nSo, the sequence 't39 t23 t68' corresponds to NT5 => 't39', then NT23 => 't68'.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the beginning of the string: 't40 t72...'.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce 't40' and 't72'.

{"custom_id":"request-831","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of symbols including 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is about. CNF means that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol is S.\n\nThe given grammar has S as the start symbol, and other non-terminals like NT47, NT45, etc., with various productions. Some of these non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols ending with 't' and a number. For example, NT5 \u2192 't39', NT9 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t34 t78 t31 t85 t65 t42 t62 t39 t18 t84 t9 t58 t47 t58 t0 t31 t6 t23 t31 t65 t17 t40 t29 t50 t54 t40 t29 t6 t54 t71 t6 t50 t72 t11 t62 t79 t85 t47 t24 t60 t78 t17 t18 t9.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. To do this, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for CNF grammars. CYK works by parsing the string and checking if each substring can be derived from a non-terminal at each level.\n\nLet me try to break down the string. The string starts with t34, which must be produced by some non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT34 \u2192 't78' and also NT34 has a production with NT33 and NT45. So t34 is directly 't78' or NT33 followed by NT45.\n\nBut the string starts with t34 as the first symbol, so it must be the direct production. From the grammar, NT34 can produce 't78', which is the third symbol in the string. So the first symbol t34 is matched by 't78' from NT34. Wait, no, NT34 produces 't78' as a terminal, so in the string, t78 comes directly after t34. But the string starts with t34 followed by t78 as the second symbol. Wait, no: the first symbol is t34, then the second is t78.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the string again:\n\nt34 t78 t31 t85 t65 t42 t62 t39 t18 t84 t9 t58 t47 t58 t0 t31 t6 t23 t31 t65 t17 t40 t29 t50 t54 t40 t29 t6 t54 t71 t6 t50 t72 t11 t62 t79 t85 t47 t24 t60 t78 t17 t18 t9.\n\nHmm, let me think step by step. Maybe I should structure this as the CYK table.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I can parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t34, t78, t31, t85, etc. Let me consider that each 't' followed by a number is a leaf node in the parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is a combination of two non-terminals, except the terminals. So, each terminal is a leaf, and internal nodes are non-terminals.\n\nThe CYK algorithm starts by creating a table where each cell corresponds to a substring of the string, and fills it level by level.\n\nLet me denote the string as s = [t34, t78, t31, t85, t65, t42, t62, t39, t18, t84, t9, t58, t47, t58, t0, t31, t6, t23, t31, t65, t17, t40, t29, t50, t54, t40, t29, t6, t54, t71, t6, t50, t72, t11, t62, t79, t85, t47, t24, t60, t78, t17, t18, t9].\n\nWait, that's 37 symbols. Hmm, the length is 37, which is not a power of 2, so CYK's levels are from 0 to log2(n), which for 37 would go up to 5 or 6. But maybe I can proceed.\n\nThe first step in CYK is to note all terminals that directly produce a single token. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT0 is not in the grammar? Wait, no, I need to check all non-terminals. Looking back:\n\nLet me list all terminals and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT6 \u2192 t18\n- NT18 \u2192 t43 (but also has other productions)\nWait, no.

S \u2192 NT13 NT13\n2.

So does NT13 \u2192 't3'?\n\nWait no, NT1's production is NT62 and NT9, which produce 't71' and 't0', so the terminal 't71' is from NT62, and 't0' from NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider. Maybe only specific non-terminals produce terminals, and others have to be built from other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, in CNF production, any non-terminal that has a production of a terminal must be a single symbol. So for each NT, if any of its productions is a terminal, it can produce that terminal.\n\nSo I'll go through each NT and list which terminals they can produce:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT6 \u2192 t18\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT34 \u2192 t78\n- NT46 \u2192 t58\n- NT74 \u2192 t47\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT13 \u2192 doesn't directly produce a terminal, instead NT70 and NT46, which may or"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't84 t43...', and I have to figure out if each part of this string can be derived from the grammar's rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, all the productions seem to fit this form. The left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to check is a series of terminals. So, for each production rule in the grammar that ends with a terminal, I should check if that terminal matches the corresponding part in the string.\n\nI think the approach here is to reverse the string and work backwards through the grammar's rules to see if it can be derived step by step. Starting from the beginning of the string, each 't' should correspond to a unit production in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the string: 't84 t43 t29 t7 t28 t18 t9 t3 t44 t44 t58 t68 t31 t43 t23 t47 t58 t29 t33 t31 t80 t3 t62 t6 t11 t17 t40 t50 t48 t80 t71 t48 t7 t7 t6 t54 t60 t58 t33 t50'.\n\nI'll go step by step:\n\n1. The first symbol is 't84'. Looking at the grammar's unit productions, I see that 't84' is derived from NT41 \u2192 't80'. Wait, but in the grammar, I see 'NT41 -> 't9''. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, is that correct? Let me check the list again.\n\nWait the grammar rules: \n\nLooking through, I don't see a 't84' in the unit productions. Only 't50', 't39', 't47', 't40', etc. So 't84' isn't present. That's a problem because the string starts with 't84', which isn't a unit production in the grammar.\n\nWait, did I miss any unit productions? Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking for 't' followed by numbers. \n\n- 't50' is there (NT1 -> 't3', NT62 -> 't71', NT5 -> 't39', NT49 -> 't40', etc.)\n- 't3' is another one (S -> NT13 NT69, which are further units)\n- 't44' is present (like NT53 -> 't47' etc.)\n- So, in the grammar, I don't see any rule that ends with 't84'. That might mean the string is invalid from the start.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- For example, NT46 \u2192 't58'\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- So, 't84' isn't present. Therefore, the first symbol in the string 't84' cannot be derived from any of the grammar's unit productions. Hence, the string can't be generated by this grammar. \n\nWait, but I should double-check if any non-terminal can produce 't84'. Because the grammar might have longer productions that result in 't84'. But since the grammar is in CNF, all the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the only way to get 't84' is from a unit production directly. If the grammar doesn't have a rule that ends with 't84', then 't84' can't appear in the string.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string starts with 't84', which is not present in the grammar's unit productions. Therefore, the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nI think that's solid reasoning.

So that checks out with CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces. The string is:\n`t39 t62 t60 t9 t58 t81 t62 t71 t18 t81 t3 t18 t78 t60 t23 t47 t44 t68 t50 t7 t47 t0 t48 t44 t72 t62 t54 t18 t0 t9 t11 t6 t84 t48 t48 t60 t50 t17 t24 t65 t50 t23 t50 t60 t79`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. That means starting from the start symbol S and applying productions step by step until I derive the entire string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the grammar, S can produce two options:\n1. NT13 NT69\n2. NT4 NT77\n\nEach of these consists of two non-terminals, so I need to see if each part of these can be expanded further until I reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLet's start with the first option, S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo, I would have to expand NT13 and NT69 until they become terminals, matching the beginning of the string. Similarly, for the second option, S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me look at NT13 and NT69 in the grammar.\n\nFrom the rules given:\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nNT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n\nWait, but NT6 is a terminal. Let me check the production for NT6: looking through the rules, I don't see NT6; perhaps it's another way. Wait, the initial rules don't list all the non-terminals, but I can see that in the rules, NT61 \u2192 't6' and others. Wait, no, looking at the rule list:\n\nWait, let me check through the rules. For example, NT6 \u2192 't18' is there. So NT6 is 't18'.\n\nWait no, looking at the rules, I see NT61 \u2192 't62' and some others. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list out all the productions to see which ones end in terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string as a sequence of terminals and see if it can be derived from the grammar step by step.\n\nBut manually expanding this entire string would take a lot of steps, so maybe I can find a pattern or a way to quickly see if the string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the string can be split into the terminals produced by each production.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t39, t62, t60, etc.\n\nLet me see if these correspond to the terminals in the productions.\n\nLooking at the production rules, for example, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t39\nNT61 \u2192 t62\nNT5 \u2192 t42\nWait, let me look through all the production rules for terminals.\n\nFor example:\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT61 \u2192 t17\n- NT18 \u2192 t43\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT62 \u2192 t71\n- NT38 \u2192 t47\n- NT47 \u2192 t84\n- etc.\n\nHmm, I see several options where non-terminals lead to terminals, like t39, t62, t43, etc.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into these terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be divided into the subparts generated by each production.\n\nWait, the input string is a large sequence of t's and numbers, but perhaps some of these correspond to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar only generates a specific set of terminals, so any symbol in the string not in that set would immediately make it invalid.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals (like NT13, NT18, etc.) lead to terminals like t39, t43, t3, t62, etc. So perhaps all the symbols in the string are valid terminals, but some might not have a corresponding production.\n\nWait, let's check if each symbol in the string is present in the terminal part of the productions. The terminals are: t39, t5, t62, t60, t9, t48, t44, t72, t3, t47, t44 (maybe dups), t65, t18, t78, t79, etc. Wait, but the string has symbols like t81, t11, etc. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nI don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces t81. Similarly, t81 is in the string. So that's a problem because if t81 is a terminal, but there's no production for any non-terminal that leads to t81, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, do any produce t81? Let's see.\n\nLooking at all the productions:\n\nIs there any rule like NT23 \u2192 t81, NT22 \u2192 t81, or something? Looking through the list:\n\nWait, the given production rules don't have any that produce t81. The highest I see is t79, t72, t78, t77, t76, t79, etc., but not t81.\n\nTherefore, the string contains the symbol t81, which is not a terminal generated by any non-terminal in the grammar. So that symbol is not present, meaning the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe t81 is a non-terminal that can produce itself, but that's not allowed in CNF. Wait, no, in CNF, the productions are for non-terminals to produce either terminals or two non-terminals. So a non-terminal cannot produce itself because that would require a production like A \u2192 A, which isn't allowed in CNF (except possibly in left recursion, which needs to be eliminated). Wait, but in any case, if t81 is a terminal, it must have a production from a non-terminal.\n\nSince there is no production that produces t81, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-869","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is quite long, so I need to break it down step by step. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is useful because each production is either a single symbol or two symbols.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT13 NT69. Each NT can be expanded into other symbols until we reach terminal characters, which are the 't's followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate starts with 't29', 't80', and then 't81', etc. I know that each NT production either leads to two other NT symbols or terminates with a 't' and a number.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the start, using the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, parsing is feasible, but a bit time-consuming. Let's see.\n\nThe string is: `t29 t80 t81 t42 t72 t85 t72 t48 t62 t72 t50 t11 t6 t60 t3 t34 t9 t68 t11 t54 t60 t80 t81 t79 t34 t0 t85 t54 t84 t40 t47 t47 t29 t17 t29 t81 t3 t78 t84 t85 t3 t48 t48 t43 t34 t65`.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT13 NT69. The first symbol is 't29', which comes from NT13. Looking at NT13's productions: I see NT13 -> NT70 NT46. Let's follow that.\n\nSo, after NT13 (which is t29), the next symbol is NT46. NT46's productions: looking through the grammar, I see NT46 -> 't58' 't54'. 't58' comes from NT26, which is 't58' -> 't17', but wait, more accurately, in the grammar, NT46 is 't58' 't54', right? So, 't58' corresponds to the production of NT26, which in the grammar is NT26 -> 't42' 't38'?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar has:\n\nNT46 -> 't58' 't54'\n\nAnd looking up 't58' is in NT26's production:\n\nLooking, NT26 is defined as: NT26 -> 't42' 't58'\n\nWait, but according to the list:\n\nNT26: 't42' 't58'\n\nSo, 't58' is in NT26, which is part of 't46' -> 't58' 't54'? Wait, that's in NT46's production.\n\nWait, no. Looking at NT46: NT46 -> 't58' 't54'\n\nBut NT58 is 't54' because looking up, NT58 is 't31' 't47', wait no. Wait, actually in the grammar, the productions are listed as:\n\nLooking for 't58' in the string to NT productions:\n\nThe string starts with t29, which is part of NT13, which is NT70 and NT46.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me list out the relevant parts of the grammar that produce 't's followed by numbers.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT46 -> 't9' -> 't47' 't58' ?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> 't0' (produce t0)\nNT46 -> 't58' 't54'\nWait, let's see. The grammar has:\n\nNT46: 't58' 't54'\n\nSo, 't58' is part of NT46. Then, 't54' corresponds to NT54, which is a rule:\n\nNT54 -> 't39' 't'\n\nHmm. So, NT46 -> 't58' 't54' would lead to 't58' being produced, but I'm not sure if NT58 is a terminal or an expansion point. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar list, I don't see NT58 having a production that starts with 't's. Wait, check the list:\n\nLooking for NT58: I see nt58. Oh, actually, I see:\n\nNT58 -> 't14' 't53'\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't's. Let's scan the list.\n\nLooking for any NT with a production into 't58' or 't54'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me reapproach.\n\nThe string is t29, which comes from NT13. NT13's production is NT70 and NT46.\n\nSo after NT13 (t29), NT70 and NT46 need to produce the next symbols.\n\nSo, NT70, looking at the grammar, can produce NT76 and NT7. NT7 can produce NT44 and 't43'. Wait, that seems a bit more detailed.\n\nWait, let's try to construct a derivation step by step.\n\nLet me start:\n\nThe string starts with t29. From the grammar, NT13 -> t29. So, NT13 is t29. The next symbols are t80 and t81.\n\nSo, NT13 (t29) -> next parts must produce t80 t81...\n\nWait, maybe this approach is better: for each 't' in the string, track back to see if they can be produced by a single NT symbol. If not, then check if the current structure can be expanded.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a parsing approach, building a parse tree. Given that the starting symbol is S, which is two NTs: the first is NT13, the second is NT69.\n\nSo, the first step is S -> NT13 NT69. The first symbol in the string is t29, which should come from NT13. So, look at NT13's productions. From the list:\n\nLooking for NT13:\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nYes, that's one option.\n\nSo, NT13 (t29) is replaced by NT70 and NT46.\n\nSo the string so far: t29 (NT13 -> NT70 NT46), then the next symbol is t80. Let's see.\n\nNow, we have to parse t80, which comes from NT70 or NT46.\n\nNT70 is in the grammar. Its productions are: NT70 -> NT76 NT7.\n\nLet's see if NT7 can produce t80 or if it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, that might not be the case. Let me look at NT7:\n\nLooking for NT7 in the grammar, I don't see it as a non-terminal, so perhaps NT7 is actually a terminal. Oh, wait, I'm not sure. Wait, in the grammar list, are all symbols NTs or are some terminals? In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is to two symbols, which can be NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is either a single NT or two NTs, or a terminal?\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, the productions are all of the form NT->NT NT or NT-> terminal.\n\nWait, checking the grammar list: for example, NT9->t0, which I assume is 't' followed by a number, i.e., 't0'. Similarly, NT45->t46 t36?\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the productions are written as two NTs, like 'NT45 -> NT46 NT36', so no, the terminals are the 't's followed by numbers, like 't50', 't39', etc.\n\nSo, when I see a production like NT9 -> t0, that would mean 't0' is a terminal symbol, i.e., it's just 't0' as part of the string.\n\nTherefore, in the string, when we see 't29', that may be directly from NT13 or another NT. Let's proceed.\n\nThe first part is that S produces NT13 and NT69. The string starts with t29, which must come from NT13.\n\nLooking at NT13's productions:\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nSo, after 't29', the next symbols are t80, t81, etc.\n\nWait, but 't29' is just one symbol, so the production of NT13 is t29, but in reality, NT13 expands into two NTs: NT70 and NT46.

{"custom_id":"request-867","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is a non-terminal symbol expanding into two other non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, any string generated must consist of terminals derived by expanding non-terminals step by step. The string provided starts with 't85', which suggests it's a terminal symbol. So, let me look for productions that start with terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some productions leading to 'tX'. For example:\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT68 -> 't12' which eventually leads to tX's, but in the string, 't85' is the first symbol.\n\nWait, there's a NT33 production that goes to 't85': NT33 -> 't85'. Is there a production for NT33?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT33 -> 't85'. So, that means NT33 can produce 't85' directly. Now, how do I get to NT33 from the start symbol S?\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions for S are:\n- S -> NT13 NT69\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, from S, it can expand into either NT13 and NT69, or NT4 and NT77. Then, each of these non-terminals should eventually derive the corresponding terminals in the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is 't85'. To produce 't85', we have NT33 => 't85'. So, the string starts with NT33. Let's break down how to get to NT33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what can produce NT33? The only production is NT33 -> 't85', which is a terminal. But in the context of deriving, NT33 must have been derived from something else. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT33 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't85', so NT33 is not a non-terminal that needs to be further expanded; it's a terminal symbol. That can't be right because non-terminals can only expand into other non-terminals or terminals. If a non-terminal can only produce terminals, that's allowed.\n\nBut in that case, the production NT33 -> 't85' is a terminal, which is part of the language. So, the string starts with 't85', which could come from NT33. Now, how do we get to NT33 from the start symbol S?\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, we have to have a derivation where the left-hand side is S, and the right-hand side is a combination of two non-terminals that derive the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLet me see: The first symbol is 't85', which comes from NT33. So, the string is 't85 t78 t34 t3 ...' So, the first part is 't85', then 't78', then 't34', etc.\n\nSo, I need to see if the entire string can be broken down into terminals that correspond to the production rules of the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the 'tX' symbols in the string and see if they can fit into the grammar.\n\nt85, t78, t34, t3, t9, t43, t29, t11, t42, t48, t29, t58, t40, t28, t71, t72, t84, t78, t54, t34, t54, p50, t58, t54, t33, t3, t47, t54, t17, t11, t29, t28, t23, t43, t48, t0, t31, t48, t65, t44, t9, t0, t71, t34, t80, t39.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I don't miss any 't...' symbols. Let me count them:\n\nFirst, 't85', 't78', 't34', 't3', 't9', 't43', 't29', 't11', 't42', 't48', 't29', 't58', 't40', 't28', 't71', 't72', 't84', 't78', 't54', 't34', 't54', 't50', 't58', 't54', 't33', 't3', 't47', 't54', 't17', 't11', 't29', 't28', 't23', 't43', 't48', 't0', 't31', 't48', 't65', 't44', 't9', 't0', 't71', 't34', 't80', 't39'.\n\nThat's 38 't...' symbols, so the string must be a concatenation of 38 such terminals.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these can be generated by some non-terminals in the grammar, and whether the derivation from S can produce this exact sequence.\n\nLooking at the first 't85', which comes from NT33. So, NT33 must be the root of a derivation leading to 't85'. The production for NT33 is:\n\nNT33 -> 't85'\n\nSo, NT33 is a terminal, which can't be further expanded. Therefore, NT33 must be the first non-terminal in the derivation. But the start symbol is S, so how does S lead to NT33 and NT... ?\n\nWait, let me consider that perhaps the string is built by expanding S into NT13 and NT69, then each of those must expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals that produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nBut wait, no, because S expands into two non-terminals, each of which must be expanded into two non-terminals or terminals. Since the string is longer than 2, we need to see if it can be broken down into parts that correspond to the expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be derived by starting with S and expanding each non-terminal step by step, resulting in the given string when all non-terminals are replaced by their terminals.\n\nLet's try to approach this step by step. Suppose S expands into NT13 and NT69:\n\nFirst, NT13:\nLooking at the production for NT13:\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nSo, NT13 becomes NT70 NT46. Now, each of these non-terminals must be expanded.\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\nWait, let me check the productions:\nLooking at NT70's production: NT70 -> NT76 NT7.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, there is NT70 -> NT76 NT7. Wait, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me look back.\n\nOh wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7.\n\nBut in the initial productions, I also see NT70 -> NT60 NT13.\n\nBut I'm trying to find NT70's production, and I think in the data it's written that NT70 -> NT76 NT7, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions. Let me search for NT70. Looking through the productions:\n\nYes, I see NT70 -> NT76 NT7 and NT70 -> NT60 NT13.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Let me proceed.\n\nSo, NT13 becomes NT70 NT46. So, each of these must eventually produce the leading 't85' and other symbols.\n\nWait, but according to the string, the first symbol is 't85', which is from NT33.\n\nBut if S starts by producing NT13 and NT69, then how can we get 't85' as the first symbol? Because NT13 expands into NT70 and NT46, which would produce sequences starting with NT70 and NT46, which could generate their own symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. Let me check if there's a longer production that can lead to the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by expanding S into NT4 and NT77, as another production.\n\nLooking at NT4 -> 't54', which is a terminal. So, if we start with S -> NT4 NT77, the first symbol would be 't54', but the string starts with 't85', so that can't be the case.\n\nSo, the only other option is S -> NT13 NT69"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nChomsky Normal Form (CNF) is when each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The given grammar has several productions, some of which are the latter type, like 't50' being derived from NT5. So the terminals are 't0', 't3', 't4', etc., up to 't90-something', and non-terminals like S, NT4, NT13, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t42 t42 t71 t68 t44 t81 t62 t62 t72 t42 t80 t3 t48 t24 t72 t72 t54 t11 t85 t34 t54 t44 t79 t85 t9 t0 t50 t34 t40 t79 t40 t9 t85 t48 t65 t17 t78 t71 t6 t79 t3 t9 t78 t6 t18 t50 t78.\n\nFirst step: break down the grammar to see if there's a way to parse this string.\n\nStarting symbols: The productions all start from S. So S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT47 NT32 (since NT47 is another production).\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: I see a lot of t's with numbers. Notably, some 't's appear multiple times. The string starts with t42 twice, which suggests that the grammar has t42 generated multiple times.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals produce t's. For example, NT67 \u2192 't6', so 't6' is a terminal. Similarly, NT41 \u2192 't9', NT42 \u2192 't68', NT46 \u2192 't58', NT36 \u2192 't56', etc.\n\nWait, let me look for the 't's in the grammar to see how they're derived.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which uses only two symbols on the right-hand side of the productions. Each production is either S -> AB, where A and B are non-terminals, or terminal symbols only, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a sequence of these tX symbols. My first thought is to map each of these tX parts to see if they correspond to the productions or as terminals in the grammar. But wait, looking at the grammar, the terminals are only the 't' followed by numbers, so each tX must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar as they are already provided.\n\nI notice that the grammar has a series of productions where certain non-terminals directly map to these 't' symbols. For example, NT46 -> 't47', which I can see in the production. So each occurrence of 'tX' in the string should align with a production that directly produces that 'tX'.\n\nLet me start by listing all the 't' tokens in the string and see if each has a corresponding production in the grammar:\n\n- t3\n- t47\n- t60\n- t71\n- t28\n- t72\n- t68\n- t29\n- t0\n- t6\n- t17\n- t68\n- t60\n- t72\n- t34\n- t0\n- t71\n- t3\n- t72\n- t0\n- t24\n- t84\n- t71\n- t71\n- t78\n- t71\n- t48\n- t68\n- t18\n- t72\n- t18\n- t79\n- t72\n- t80\n- t85\n- t3\n- t44\n- t33\n- t47\n- t44\n- t62\n- t80\n- t0\n- t72\n- t28\n- t72\n- t24\n\nNow, I'll check if each of these corresponding 'tX' exists as a production from a non-terminal.

Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking carefully, under the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n\nSo, 't54', 't50', 't39', 't40', 't48', 't47' are all directly derived from their respective NTs.\n\nNow, the string has 't3', which would require NT3 -> 't3', which is present.\n\nSimilarly, 't47' is from NT77.\n\n't60' is from NT60.\n\n't71' is present? Wait, in the grammar, I don't see a production for 't71'. Let's check the production list again.\n\nLooking further down, I see:\n\n- NT71 isn't a non-terminal; perhaps it's mistakenly included. Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT71 isn't listed as a non-terminal, but I see:\n\nWait, I'm mixing up the non-terminals with the terminals. Let's make sure. The terminal symbols are all the 'tX' strings. The non-terminals are everything else except the 'tX' strings.\n\nSo the 'tX' strings like 't3', 't47', etc., are terminals. The non-terminals are all the NTs.\n\nSo in the string, when I encounter a 'tX', it's a terminal, and I need to check if there's a production from some NT to that 'tX' terminal.\n\nWait, but wait: each production in the grammar is either A->BC or A->t, where t is a terminal. So every production in the grammar ends with a terminal. So every non-terminal must derive into a terminal, perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nBut this is a context-free grammar, so we have to see if the string can be built by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nBut in the given grammar, each production either goes to two non-terminals or directly to a terminal. So the 't' symbols are direct terminals derived from some NT.\n\nSo, for example, NT77 -> 't47' means that the non-terminal NT77 can directly produce the terminal 't47'.\n\nSimilarly, when the string has 't47', that corresponds to NT77.\n\nBut the string also has 't71', which isn't a terminal in any production. Because looking at the grammar, none of the productions end with 't71'. So 't71' can't be derived from the grammar. That means if the string has 't71', it's not possible to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I need to look again at the grammar. Did I miss any 't71' production?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT71 isn't present. So perhaps there's a typo or I miscounted.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT71 isn't one of the NTs. Wait, is it? Let me scan the list:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT77 is present, and its production is 't47'.\n- NT72 isn't a production. Wait, no, NT72 would be if the right side includes 't72', but in the given grammar, I don't see such a production.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the provided grammar:\n\nThe grammar has the following productions ending with 'tX':\n\n- S -> NT13 NT15\n- But wait, S is a non-terminal in the grammar, so S can produce two NTs. But S is not a terminal.\n\nWait, correcting myself: the productions in the grammar are:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT15 (but looking at the provided list, actually, the S productions are the first two: S -> NT13 NT15 and S -> NT4 NT77? Wait, no, let me correct.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the first two rules are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT15\nWait, no, let me check the initial lines correctly.\n\nWait, the user gave a long list:\n\nThe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-912","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It seems to consist of a starting symbol S that branches into various non-terminals (NT), and the production rules are all in the form of NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal, so that's consistent.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t58 t11 t28 t33 t29 t11 t6 t34 t85 t48 t28 t31 t85 t44 t34 t81 t18 t43 t81 t42 t68 t11 t6 t24 t39 t85 t58 t44 t71 t11 t79 t50 t9 t80 t23 t34 t85 t81 t39 t48 t48 t31 t23 t48 t17 t65 t3 t34`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from S by applying the production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can probably use a parsing approach, maybe like a recursive descent parser, or use the CYK algorithm to see if the string is in the language.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to backtrack through the string, seeing if each terminal can be matched by the right-hand side of some production, and if the non-terminals can be reduced to other strings that ultimately reduce to S.\n\nLet's see, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string must be built by sequences where the non-terminals correspond to the structures in the grammar.\n\nI think I should start by looking at the string and seeing if I can find a way to break it down into parts that match the production rules. But since the string is quite long, I'll need to be systematic.\n\nAnother approach is to represent the string as a sequence of symbols and see if it can be generated starting from S. I can try to see if the entire string can be generated by recursively expanding S, using the productions.\n\nWait, but that might take a long time. Maybe instead, I can use memoization or memoizing the possible reductions, but that might get complicated without a clear path.\n\nAlternatively, think about the start symbol S. The two productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, the string must start with one of these two pairs. Let me check the beginning of the string. The first token is t58. Let's see which productions can start with t58.\n\nLooking at the productions for non-terminals that produce t58. Scanning the production list, I see NT56 -> 't62', NT15 -> 't40', NT31 -> 't50', NT5 -> 't39', NT49 -> 't40', NT53 -> 't48', NT67 -> 't6', NT9 -> 't0', NT42 -> 't68', NT12 -> 't81', NT34 -> 't9', NT46 -> 't58', etc. Wait, looking at NT46 -> 't58'\u2014so if a production for (NT46) would produce 't58', so perhaps part of the string starts with NT46.\n\nBut looking back, S's productions are either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. So, the string must start with either NT13 or NT4 followed by their respective other NT.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t58, which comes from NT46. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps NT46 is involved, but in S's productions, I don't see NT46 being part of the S's left-hand side.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the initial S productions are S\u2192NT13 NT69 and S\u2192NT4 NT77, so any string generated must start with either NT13 and NT69, in that order, or NT4 and NT77, in that order.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t58 t11... So, the first two symbols are t58 followed by t11. But looking at the productions, I don't see a production where the first symbol is t58 or t11.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production is two non-terminals, and each of those non-terminals can further expand.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to see if the string can be split into a combination of NT productions that match the string.\n\nWait, let's take the first part of the string: t58 t11 t28 t33 t29 t11 t6 t34 t85 t48 t28 t31 t85 t44 t34 t81 t18 t43 t81 t42 t68 t11 t6 t24 t39 t85 t58 t44 t71 t11 t79 t50 t9 t80 t23 t34 t85 t81 t39 t48 t48 t31 t23 t48 t17 t65 t3 t34.\n\nI need to see if this string can be built by expanding S into the given string.\n\nWait, another idea: since S can be split into two parts, maybe I can partition the string into two parts, each of which can be generated by the two branches of S.\n\nFor example, the first part from S -> NT13 NT69, and the second from S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nBut given the string is long, that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be reduced step by step back to S.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if each terminal in the string can be matched by some production, starting from the end.\n\nWait, CYK algorithm might help. It's used for parsing context-free grammars, determining whether a string is in the language.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm can be applied efficiently.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\n2. For each position in the string, check the productions where the right-hand side (RHS) matches the current and adjacent symbols.\n\n3. Fill the table by expanding possible non-terminals and their productions.\n\n4. If the start symbol S is in the cell (0, n-1), where n is the length of the string, then the string is in the language.\n\nGiven the complexity, let me outline the steps I would take:\n\n- List all possible non-terminals and their productions.\n\n- For each position in the string, for each possible pair of adjacent symbols, check if there are productions that can produce those two symbols, in that order, as a result of a single non-terminal.\n\n- Build the table incrementally, from length 1 to length n.\n\nLet me try to see if I can apply CYK here, step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is of length 64. Wait, no, let me count the tokens:\n\nLooking at the string, it seems to be a list of t followed by numbers, each as separate tokens. So, each t followed by digits is a separate token, like t58, t11, etc.\n\nCounting each of these, the total number of tokens is 62. So, the string is 62 symbols long.\n\nBut applying CYK manually for a 62-symbol string is impractical. I must think of a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, look for the starting productions and see if they can generate the string.\n\nGiven that S branches into either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, the string should split into two parts: one derived from NT13 paired with NT69, and the other from NT4 paired with NT77.\n\nHmm, perhaps the string should consist of two interleaved parts, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, any derivation will consist of a leftmost derivation where each step splits a non-terminal into two parts, until all are terminals.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So, starting from S, we can only have derivations that go through productions, each producing two symbols each time.\n\nBut the string given is a flat list of terminals, so perhaps the process is to split the string into pairs that are produced by each non-terminal's productions.\n\nWait, no\u2014the string is a flat list of terminals, so the only way the string can be generated is if the entire string can be constructed by expanding the starting symbol.\n\nBut given that, I think the easiest way is to look for possible starting points.\n\nLooking at the first token: t58.

{"custom_id":"request-924","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see several non-terminals on the left and right sides. Some of these seem to lead directly to terminals. For example, NT5 is \"t39\", so when we expand NT5, we get a 't39' as a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these \"t\" strings and numbers. The string is: `t65 t31 t54 t24 t50 t24 t18 t3 t9 t6 t31 t47 t17 t72 t3 t18 t29 t60 t17 t11 t78 t80 t39 t3 t84 t0 t80 t85 t3 t11 t40 t65 t39 t50 t0 t47 t50 t33 t65 t80 t29 t47 t11 t9 t44 t54 t31 t0 t80`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it according to the grammar. Let's break down the grammar to see the possible starting points and the terms they can produce.\n\nThe start symbol S can go to NT13 NT15 or NT4 NT77. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT13 NT69. NT13 expands to NT70 NT46. Let's expand NT13 further:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT32\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 t44\nSo, NT70 would become 't44' when fully expanded. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nWait, no. Actually, NT70 has a production rule NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. So each step is an expansion until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for chains that produce the terminals we see. Let me look at each terminal in the string and see if any rule leads to it.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t65. Checking the grammar, does any non-terminal expand into t65? Looking at the rules:\n\nCheck if t65 is a terminal for any non-terminal. Scanning the grammar:\n\nYes, NT3 \u2192 't65'.\n\nSo, when expanding NT3, we get 't65'. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the second token is t31. Looking for rules that expand to 't31'. Checking NT31 \u2192 't50'.\n\nWait, let's see: Are there any non-terminals that directly produce t31?\n\nLooking through the rules: NT31 \u2192 't50'. That's a terminal. So if a non-terminal can expand to t31, it must be that it's t31, but t31 is a terminal. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, most non-terminals on the left side have rules that produce other non-terminals. So, for example, NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61, which are both non-terminals, so they aren't terminals. The only place a non-terminal is a terminal is when it has a rule that ends with 'a' like 'tX' where X is a digit.\n\nWait no, in the grammar, the non-terminals on the left produce strings of non-terminals or terminals. So the rules ending with 't' or 'tX' are terminals. So, for example, NT5 \u2192 't39' is a rule where NT5 is replaced by the string 't39' which is a terminal.\n\nSo any non-terminal that has a production rule where a terminal 'tX' appears is a terminal in that production.\n\nSo, for example, in the string, the first token is t65. We can see if any non-terminal can produce t65 as a terminal. Looking through the production rules, do any non-terminals have a production that includes 't65'? Scanning the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the last part of the rules, I see NT16 \u2192 't28', NT23 \u2192 't9', NT26 \u2192 't42', NT29 \u2192 't68', NT34 \u2192 't78', and so on. Hmm, I don't see any rules that produce 't65' as a terminal.\n\nWait a second. Let's check all the production rules to see if any of them have 't65' as a terminal. It seems that 't65' is not listed as a terminal in any production. The terminals are things like 't3', 't6', 't9', etc., but not 't65'.\n\nWait, but maybe 't65' is a terminal string. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nI see NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, which then NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7, etc. Some of these produce terminals like 't34', 't33', etc. But wait, 't65' is not in any of the rules as a terminal.\n\nIs it possible that 't65' is a result of a certain expansion path? For example, maybe a chain that ends with a production that includes 't65'. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the grammar. Let me list all rules again and see if any have 't65' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't9' \u2014 no\nNT3 \u2192 't65' \u2014 yes, as per rule NT3 \u2192 't65'\nSo, NT3 can produce 't65'. So in the string, when we have 't65', it must come from expanding NT3.\n\nWait no, the production NT3 \u2192 't65' is a single terminal, so in the string, 't65' must be the result of expanding NT3. But earlier, the string has 't65' as part of it, but looking at the string, the first token is 't65', so perhaps the derivation starts with S producing something that includes NT3 leading to 't65'.\n\nWait, but S leads to things like NT13 NT15 or NT4 NT77. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's see: Perhaps the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT47 NT47. Wait, no\u2014 the rules say S \u2192 NT13 NT15 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Let me focus on S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, no: The specific rules given are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT15\nWait, no\u2014the user provided the grammar as a list of rules, starting with S -> NT13 NT15 and others. Wait, actually, in the first line, the grammar is presented with S -> NT13 NT15, but the user's provided lines are:\n\nThe first line is S -> NT13 NT15?\n\nWait, no, let me look again:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT15\nS -> NT4 NT77\nAnd other rules for NT47, NT45, etc.\n\nWait, in the initial provided grammar, the user wrote:\n\nThe grammar is:\nS -> NT13 NT15\nS -> NT4 NT77\n... (and other rules)\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck. Wait, in the first message, the user wrote:\n\nThe initial grammar is:\nS -> NT13 NT15\nS -> NT4 NT77\nNT47 -> NT66 NT29\n... [and so on, many rules]\nAnd then the string.\n\nWait, the first line is S -> NT13 NT15, so I have to read that correctly. That's a big confusion point. Earlier, in the user's first line, the grammar rules are written as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT15\nS -> NT4 NT77\nNT47 -> NT66 NT29\n...\nSo the start symbol S can go into two options: either NT13 and NT15 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nSo, in this case, S can produce NT13 followed by NT15 or NT4 followed by NT77. So, the first step is to choose one of these.\n\nNow, the string starts with t65. But in the given grammar, only NT3 \u2192 't65', as per the non-terminal NT3. So, if any branch of the derivation includes NT3, it can produce 't65'.\n\nBut the S \u2192 NT4 NT77 option would require that NT4 and NT77 both are expanded. Let's see what NT4 and NT77 expand into.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT4 \u2192 't54'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar.

So, in the string, the first 't50' is at position 1, so the initial symbol must derive into something that includes NT31.\n\nSo, starting with S, which can be NT4 or NT13. Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then NT13 can produce something, and NT69 can produce something else. Let's track this path.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Now, NT70 has two options: NT76 NT7 or NT60 NT13. Wait, so NT70 can branch into those. Since the string starts with NT31 \u2192 't50', let's see if we can link NT70 to NT31 somehow.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe I should approach this using a top-down parsing method, tracing the possible derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to build the parse tree starting from S and see if we can generate the string. Alternatively, I could try to reverse engineer the process.\n\nWait, let's start from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with 't50', so the first part of the derivation must involve NT31, since that's the only non-terminal that directly produces 't50'.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT13 NT69, but now, either NT13 or NT69 must be producing something that starts with NT31. Alternatively, maybe another option for NT13 or NT69 can lead to 't50'.\n\nLooking at NT69: checking the rules, NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6. Then, NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT53. NT73 \u2192 't9', and NT53 has two options: NT17 NT38 or NT80 NT69.\n\nWait, this might not directly link to 't50'. Let's try NT13 again. NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Then, NT70 can either be NT76 NT7 or NT60 NT13. Hmm. Alternatively, NT46 \u2192 't58', which would produce 't58', but the first symbol is 't50', so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the initial S is not using NT13.

It's given in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. Also, the right-hand side can be terminals or non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, the only terminals I see are the 't' followed by numbers, like t50, t68, etc. So, the goal is to see if the given string can be derived starting from the start symbol, which I believe is S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So, any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the first part: t68 t50 t47 t50 t84... The string has a lot of t followed by numbers, so I need to see how these fit into the productions. Each production in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since some rules generate a terminal, at some point the string must transition from non-terminals to terminals.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string from the end, using the reverse approach since Chomsky Normal Form allows for easy parsing from the bottom up. This is like using theCYK algorithm but in reverse. So, I'll start from the end of the string and check if each part can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the entire string to analyze it better:\n\nt68 t50 t47 t50 t84 t31 t50 t54 t48 t84 t34 t65 t50 t43 t68 t81 t78 t33 t65 t6 t23 t62 t42 t81 t43 t31 t65 t31 t80 t6 t58 t71 t39 t78 t18 t58 t33 t44 t17 t7 t72 t39 t50 t62 t47 t47 t42 t72 t65 t79.\n\nI'll start from the end.

Wait, in the rules, I see NT42 \u2192 't68' and also NT32 \u2192 't24'. So NT42 \u2192 t68, so NT42 can produce t68.\n\nWait, wait, let me go step by step:\n\n1. The last symbol is t79.

That means every non-terminal must expand directly to two other non-terminals until we reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. So, the string we're given is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation must end when each non-terminal in the starting symbol S has been expanded entirely into terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a list of tokens starting with t3 and ending with t81. Each token is a terminal, so each must be the result of a non-terminal expanding to that terminal. \n\nStarting with the top-level rule S -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77. So the string must start with either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. Let's look at the string: the first token is t3. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, where does 't3' come from? Scanning through the productions, I see NT1 -> 't3' and NT3 -> 't3' as well. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions, I find NT1 -> 't3' and NT3 -> 't3'. Also, looking further down, NT4 -> 't54' and NT5 -> 't39', etc. So the first term 't3' could come from either NT1 or NT3.\n\nBut in the top-level rule, S branches into NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. So let's check:\n\n- If S expands to NT13 NT69, then the first non-terminal in the string's expansion is NT13, which should generate 't3' as the first token. Looking at the grammar, does NT13 produce 't3'? Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking through, I see NT13 -> NT70 NT46. So no, NT13 doesn't directly produce 't3'. \n\nSo, if the first token is 't3' and the initial expansion is S-> NT13 NT69, then the first 't3' would have to come from NT13, but NT13 doesn't produce 't3' because it goes to NT70 and NT46. So that's a problem because the first token is 't3', so that would mean S must expand to a non-terminal that can derive 't3'. \n\nAlternatively, maybe S expands to NT4 NT77. Let's see: NT4 -> 't54' and NT77 -> 't47' from the rules. So that would produce 't54 t47', but the string starts with 't3', which doesn't match. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nHmmm, that's a problem because both top-level options don't start with 't3'. So that suggests that perhaps the string doesn't start with the initial symbol correctly, which might imply that it's not generated by this grammar. But let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking NT13. Let me see: the production for NT13 is -> NT70 NT46, and then I need to see what those produce. Let's trace down:\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7. Now NT76 is not a terminal. NT76 -> 't79'. NT7 -> 't44'. So NT76 is 't79' and NT7 is 't44'. So NT70 would become NT76 NT7, which is 't79' 't44'. Then NT46 is a non-terminal. Wait, NT46 is a separate production.\n\nLooking at NT46, I see NT46 -> 't58'. So putting it all together, NT13 -> 't79 t44 t58'? Wait no, because it's two steps. NT13 expands to NT70 NT46, which then NT70 expands to NT76 NT7, which is 't79' and 't44'. So from NT70, we get 't79' 't44'. Then NT46 -> 't58'. So NT13 becomes NT70 NT46 -> 't79' 't44' 't58'. But that's three tokens, which would mean the expansion would generate three tokens, but 't3' is only one token. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a different sequence that I'm not considering. Maybe I should check whether any of the non-terminals can directly produce 't3' in the initial step.\n\nLooking back, the non-terminals that can produce 't3' are NT1 -> 't3' and NT3 -> 't3'. So if the top-level expansion is S -> NT1 NT69 or S-> NT4 NT77, neither of these directly produce 't3' as their first token. Therefore, the first symbol being 't3' would require that one of the initial expansions starts with 't3', which isn't the case here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. The initial S expansion is either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. If the string starts with 't3', that must come from one of these initial non-terminals expanding directly, but as we saw, that's not possible since NT13 goes to NT70 NT46, which then produce 't79', 't44', and 't58', but in the string, the next token is 't33', which doesn't match.\n\nSo this suggests that the string can't be derived from S because it starts with 't3', which isn't produced directly by any initial non-terminal in S's expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the initial expansions. Let's make sure: S's options are S-> NT13 NT69 or S-> NT4 NT77.\n\n- If S-> NT13 NT69, then what's NT13's start? It produces NT70 NT46, which produce 't79' 't44' and 't58' (but in two steps). So the first token would be 't79', then 't44', then 't58', none of which is 't3'. So the first token in the string is 't3', which can't come from NT13 NT69's expansion.\n\n- If S-> NT4 NT77, then NT4 produces 't54' and NT77 produces 't47', so the first two tokens would be 't54 t47', but the string starts with 't3', so that doesn't fit either.\n\nTherefore, since the string starts with 't3', which can only come from NT1 or NT3, but these don't appear as the first non-terminals in S's expansion, the string can't be generated by this grammar. Wait, but wait another moment. Maybe I'm missing a step. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the string is a result of multiple steps where a non-terminal can produce multiple steps to reach 't3'. For example, maybe one of the productions in the grammar chains up to 't3', but it's a tree that's too deep. But in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals, so unless a non-terminal X can produce a series of steps that end with 't3', but if X itself is not a non-terminal that can produce 't3' directly, but rather via two steps.\n\nBut looking at the productions, I don't see any way for NT1 or NT3 to be reached via the top-level start of S. Because S directly expands to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77, and those don't lead to NT1 or NT3.\n\nSo for the string to start with 't3', either S must expand into an NT1 or NT3, which it doesn't, or the initial expansion must be into something that can derive 't3', but since the starting point is always either NT13\/NT69 or NT4\/NT77, and those don't produce 't3' either, the string can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, after this analysis, I conclude that the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string 't65 t47' is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the rules. Each production rule on the left side has exactly two non-terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to identify the start symbol. Usually, the start symbol is 'S', but I see that the only rule that starts with S is S -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77. Both are productions from S to two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking closely, the rules are all in the form A \u2192 BC, except for the one rule where it seems like a terminal is at the end, like 't50'. For example, NT56 -> 't18' or NT67 -> 't6'. So some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals, which are part of the string.\n\nThe string we're checking is 't65 t47'. So we need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string using the given grammar. Parsing can be done using top-down methods like recursive descent or bottom-up methods like the CYK algorithm. Since this is a small string, maybe I can try a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to break it down into the components of the string.\n\nLet's start by seeing which production rule from S can derive the string. The S has two options: S -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't65' and ends with 't47'. So perhaps NT13 and NT69 can derive 't65' and something else, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules for NT13 and NT69 to see if they can produce 't65' or 't47'.\n\nLooking at NT13: The rule is NT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n\nHmm, NT70 can be broken down further. Looking at NT70, it has two rules: NT70 -> NT76 NT7 and NT70 -> NT60 NT13.\n\nLet's pick one. Let's say we take NT70 -> NT76 NT7.\n\nNow NT76 is another non-terminal. Looking up its productions: NT76 -> t79 or if I'm not seeing any rule for NT76, maybe NT76 is a leaf.\n\nSo NT76 -> t79, but our string starts with 't65', so that might not help. Alternatively, maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps NT70 -> NT60 NT13.\n\nSo NT60 is another non-terminal. Looking it up: NT60 -> NT38 NT18.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't65' comes 't47', so maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for rules directly leading to terminals. For example, NT56 -> t18, NT77 -> t47, and others.\n\nWait, our string ends with 't47', so perhaps one of the non-terminals can produce 't47'.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT77 -> 't47'. So if we have a production where a non-terminal is directly 't47', that's helpful. So if one part of the string is 't47', and the other part is 't65', maybe we can have the production S -> NTx NTy, where one of NTx or NTy leads to 't65' and the other leads to 't47'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't65' is produced by a non-terminal, and 't47' by another. But since S's productions have two non-terminals, maybe one of them is 't65' and the other is 't47' or something else.\n\nWait, let's see which non-terminals can produce 't65'. Looking through the rules, I see NT78 -> t5, NT51 -> t34, NT47 -> t84, NT53 -> t48, etc. Not seeing any non-terminal directly producing 't65' except maybe by a chain of rules.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see the terminal symbols in the string: 't65' and 't47'. \n\nLooking at the production rules, for 't47', I see NT77 -> 't47' and also NT40 -> 't39' and others. So NT77 produces 't47'.\n\nSimilarly, 't65' might come from a non-terminal. Let's check NT4: It can be NT4 -> 't54' via a rule. Hmm, not. Wait, NT41 -> 't9', so maybe through a more complex chain.\n\nWait, wait. 't65' is in the string. Let me look if any non-terminals can directly produce 't65'. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any '-> t65' in the right-hand side. Hmm, I don't see any. So we have to derive 't65' via a series of productions until it reaches a terminal.\n\nSimilarly for 't47', we have a direct rule NT77 -> 't47', so that part is easy.\n\nSo perhaps the string 't65 t47' is derived from a production where S -> NTx NTy, where NTy is 't47' (say, S -> NTx NT77). Then NTx would have to produce 't65'.\n\nSo let's suppose NTx is 't65'. Wait, no, NTx is a non-terminal, so it must produce 't65' via some chain.\n\nBut wait, 't65' is not directly a terminal, but it can be produced via NT4's production? Wait, NT4's rules: NT4 -> 't54', or perhaps through other non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a way for a non-terminal to produce 't65'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT78 -> 't5', NT41 -> 't9', NT46 -> 't58', NT13 -> 't... wait, NT13's production is NT70 NT46, and looking at NT70's productions, which eventually may lead to 't47' or 't79', but not 't65'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the production rules for each non-terminal that might eventually result in 't65'. Let me parse this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string 't65 t47' can be derived from S via two steps:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT69\n2. Then, NT13 -> NT70 NT46, and NT69 -> NT23 NT6.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, it's 't65 t47', so after S, we have NT13 and NT69. But if NT13 produces 't65', and NT69 produces 't47', then that would fit.\n\nWait, does NT13 have a production that can lead to 't65'? Let me check:\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\nNT70 has two rules: \n- NT70 -> NT76 NT7\n- NT70 -> NT60 NT13\n\nSo starting with NT70 -> NT76 NT7.\n\nNT76 is another non-terminal. Looking at its productions: I see NT76 -> t79, but not t65.\n\nAlternatively, can we have a chain that leads to 't65'?\n\nWait, another route: NT70 can go to NT60 NT13.\n\nSo NT60 -> NT38 NT18.\n\nThen, NT38's productions: NT38 -> 't47' or maybe others. Wait, looking for NT38's rules, I don't see a direct production to 't47'; it's in another rule.\n\nWait, looking for NT38, I see NT38 -> t29, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's think about the string: 't65' and 't47'. We know 't47' is directly produced by NT77. So maybe the string is part of a derivation where S -> NTx NT77, and NTx produces 't65'.\n\nSo now, can NTx, for example NT13, produce 't65'? Let's see:\n\nNT13's production is NT70 NT46. Can NT70 NT46 somehow combine to 't65'? Let's see how each of these can produce a terminal.\n\nNT46: Let me see its productions. Looking through the rules, I don't see a direct terminal for NT46, but it's involved in more rules. Wait, looking for NT46's production: I see NT46 -> 't58' via the rule"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-58","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t65 t78 t9 t9 t18 t33`, and the grammar consists of a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF entails. CNF is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol doesn't have a production. So, all productions here seem to fit that structure, except for some that have multiple non-terminals on the right side. Wait, looking back, some productions have more than two non-terminals? Hmm, no, actually all productions are either two symbols or terminals. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to approach the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if each non-terminal in the grammar can be expanded into a sequence that matches this string.\n\nI think the best way is to try to parse the string using the given grammar, starting from the start symbol S. The string is `t65 t78 t9 t9 t18 t33`, so we have six terminals. Let me list their positions:\n\n1. t65\n2. t78\n3. t9\n4. t9\n5. t18\n6. t33\n\nI need to see if S can derive this string in zero or more steps.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo S can go to either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. I need to see which one is possible.\n\nLet me first consider the first option: S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 has the production NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So the first symbol is NT70 followed by NT46. Then, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 t44. So, NT70 is t44 followed by what? Let's see: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, and NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT77? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT76 is not defined. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, the productions for NT76 might not exist. Wait, looking at the productions, I don't see NT76 being defined. Hmm, that might be an issue. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, perhaps I should look at each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT4 NT77 is better. Let's see.\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT54. So starting from NT4, it goes to 't54' because in the productions, NT4 \u2192 't54'. Wait, looking at the productions: NT4 is defined as NT49? Wait no, looking again, the productions under NT4 are:\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar entries:\n\nNT41 \u2192 't9'\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\nNT49 \u2192 't40'\nNT42 \u2192 't68'\nNT46 \u2192 't58'\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, for NT4, the production is NT4 \u2192 't54'. So NT4 is a terminal; it directly produces 't54'.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the first part is 't54' and the second is whatever NT77 produces.\n\nLooking at NT77: the productions are NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78 and NT77 \u2192 't47'. So NT77 can also go directly to 't47'. But in the string we have, the first terminal is 't65', not 't54' or 't47', so S \u2192 NT4 NT77 can't be part of the derivation since the first symbol in the string is 't65'.\n\nSo that rules out the S \u2192 NT4 NT77 production. Therefore, we must take S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNow, the string is 't65 t78 t9 t9 t18 t33'. If S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then we have to expand NT13 and NT69.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So the first two symbols are NT70 and NT46, which should be expanded into 't65' something, but let's see.\n\nWait, looking at NT70: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. NT7 \u2192 't44'. NT76 doesn't seem to have a production because in the grammar, I don't see any rules for NT76. That might be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if NT70 can produce 't65'. Because in the string, after NT13, NT69, we have 't65', which is the first symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the order. Let's correct this. The string is `t65 t78 t9 t9 t18 t33`. So for S \u2192 NT13 NT69, we have NT13 deriving 't65' and NT69 deriving the rest.\n\nWait, no, not necessarily. Because S \u2192 NT13 NT69, so when expanding NT13 and NT69, their expansions should result in the entire string.\n\nSo let me think: NT13 is the first part, so its expansion needs to start with 't65', and NT69 needs to expand into the rest of the string.\n\nBut looking at NT13's production: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So the first symbol is NT70, which needs to derive to 't65...'.\n\nBut looking at NT70's productions: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, and then NT7 \u2192 't44'. That would give 't44' as part of NT70, not 't65'. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way for NT70 to produce 't65'? Looking at the productions, I don't see NT70 being able to produce anything except NT76 and NT7. So unless NT76 produces a further symbol, which seems not to be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider other productions. Let me check if any NT can derive 't65'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that:\n\nNT32 \u2192 't24'\nNT62 \u2192 't71'\nNT31 \u2192 't50'\nNT49 \u2192 't40'\nNT53 \u2192 't48'\nNT74 \u2192 't47'\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\nNT42 \u2192 't68'\nNT77 \u2192 't47' or NT51 NT78\nNT19 \u2192 some symbols.\nWait, is there any production that results in 't65'?\n\nLooking through the terminals, the only one that comes to mind is NT32 \u2192 't24' and NT62 \u2192 't71', but not t65.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me recheck the productions for NT62 and others.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't65'. So if the first symbol is 't65', then it must be produced by some NT, but in the given grammar, none of the NTs produce 't65'. That's a problem.\n\nThis suggests that the string cannot be generated because 't65' is not a terminal in any production. But wait, maybe 't65' is part of a non-terminal's expansion. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals and their productions, I see:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 't71' (from the production NT61 \u2192 't71'?), wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the provided productions for any NT that produces 't65' or that can produce 't65'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't65'\nWait, NT3 is a non-terminal. So NT3 \u2192 't65' + something else.\n\nLooking at NT3's production: NT3 \u2192 't65' 't3', meaning NT3 can produce 't65 t3'. So NT3 is one such non-terminal that directly produces 't65' followed by 't3'.\n\nSo in the string `t65 t78 t9 t9 t18 t33`, the first part is 't65', which could come from NT3's production NT3 \u2192 't65' 't3'. But wait, that would produce two symbols, 't65' and 't3', but in the string we have the first symbol as 't65' followed by 't78', so that would require the NT3 to produce 't65' followed by 't78', but that's not possible because NT3 only produces 't65'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF), and I need to determine whether the string `t54 t78 t9 t9 t18 t33` is generated by it. Okay, so CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, or a single terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Right.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the productions seem to be either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Hmm, maybe except for some. Wait, let me check a few. For example, S -> NT13 NT69, that's two non-terminals, so that's fine. Another rule is NT77 -> 't47', so that's a terminal production, which is allowed in CNF.\n\nThe string to analyze is `t54 t78 t9 t9 t18 t33`. So it's a sequence of terminals. My approach would be to try to find a derivation starting from S and ending with this string.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual tokens: t54, t78, t9, t9, t18, t33.

Looking at the grammar, which rule produces a terminal starting with t5? Let's see:\n\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT45 -> t46\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT42 -> 't68'\nNT12 -> 't81'\nNT34 -> 't78'\nNT46 -> 't58'\nNT74 -> 't47'\nNT26 -> 't42'\nNT15 -> 't40'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT42 -> 't60'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nNT4 -> 't65'\nNT61 -> 't17'\nNT78 -> 't72'\nNT38 -> 't47'\nNT83 -> 't7'\nNT80 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't7'\nNT56 -> 't62'\nNT16 -> 't28'\nNT38 -> 't29'\nNT33 -> 't85'\nNT78 -> 't33'\nNT6 -> 't18'\nNT18 -> 't43'\nNT7 -> 't44'\nNT56 -> 't31'\nNT76 -> 't79'\nNT7 -> 't23'\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nHmmm. So the terminal productions are all single terminals which are assigned to different non-terminals.\n\nSo, to get t54 as the first symbol, I need to find a production that starts with NT54. Wait, but in the grammar provided, the non-terminals are things like NT3, NT4, NT5, etc. There's no NT54 in the grammar. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check the initial production rules. Wait, no, the grammar only has certain non-terminals. Looking at the productions, I don't see a rule where NT54 -> something. So t54 is a terminal, but in the grammar, it's only produced if there's a rule NT54 -> t54, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t54, so the production must start with a non-terminal that can derive t54. Let's check which NT can derive t54. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t54, except perhaps in the production where NT... is equal to 'something'.\n\nWait, let me go through each production and see if any of them produce t54 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT5 -> 't39' (and also NT5 -> NT38 NT74)\n- NT42 -> 't68' (and also NT42 -> NT12 NT69)\n- NT12 -> 't81' (and also NT12 -> NT34 NT67)\n- NT34 -> 't78' (and also NT34 -> NT61 NT47)\n- NT46 -> 't58' (and also NT46 -> NT74 NT36)\n- NT74 -> 't47' (and also NT74 -> NT32 NT26)\n- NT26 -> 't42' (and also NT26 -> NT15 NT58)\n- NT15 -> 't40' (and also NT15 -> NT32 NT61)\n- NT32 -> 't24' (and also NT32 -> NT42 NT68)\n- NT42 -> 't60' (and also NT42 -> NT3 -> ...)\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nI need to find which NT can derive t54. Looking at all the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing t54, except perhaps indirectly via some productions.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe some NT rules have terminals in them. Let me check the production rules:\n\nLooking at all the rules, the only t's are:\n\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT34 -> 't78'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT74 -> 't47'\n- NT26 -> 't42'\n- NT15 -> 't40'\n- NT32 -> 't24'\n- NT42 -> 't60'\n- NT78 -> 't72'\n- NT38 -> 't47'\n- NT83 -> 't7'\n- NT80 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT61 -> 't17'\n- NT78 -> 't33'\n- NT33 -> 't85'\n- NT78 -> 't33' (duplicate)\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n- NT18 -> 't43'\n- NT7 -> 't44'\n- NT56 -> 't31'\n- NT76 -> 't79'\n- NT7 -> 't23'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n\nSo t54 is not produced directly by any NT. That means the first symbol t54 cannot be derived from the grammar, as the grammar does not have any NT production that directly or indirectly leads to t54. Therefore, the string `t54 t78 t9 t9 t18 t33` cannot be generated because the first token is t54, which is not present in any NT production.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I miss any NT production that leads to t54?\n\nNo, all the NTs either produce other NTs or t's listed above, and none of them produce t54. So yes, the string starts with t54, which the grammar can't produce.

{"custom_id":"request-78","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have to determine whether the given string `t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t39 t28` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT13, NT47, etc.) and terminals (like 't54', 't9', etc.). My task is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo the initial step is for S to expand into either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nBut wait, the string given is all terminals, so I need to see if any of these production paths can lead to this exact sequence of terminals.\n\nI think the best way is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using either top-down or bottom-up methods. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might be suitable, but I'm more comfortable with the CYK algorithm or using a parse tree approach. Alternatively, since it's small, I can try to build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can trace back from the string to see if it can be built up by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t39 t28.\n\nLet me list them in reverse: t28, t39, t18, t9, t9, t9, t54.\n\nI think it's better to start from the end since the earliest symbols in the string must be the leaves of the parse tree, and the start symbol is at the root.\n\nBut let's start from the beginning.\n\nt54 is in the string. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals derive to t54? Checking the production rules, under 't54', which non-terminals have it as a terminal?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54' (Yes, line: NT49 -> 't40' is not relevant, wait. Let me check again. Oh, I see under 't54': NT4 \u2192 't54'. So NT4 can directly produce 't54'.\n\nSo the first part of the string starts with t54, which comes from NT4.\n\nSo the first part would be S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Because S can go to NT4 NT77, right? So S produces NT4 followed by NT77.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t54, which is from NT4, and then after that, we have t9, t9, t9, etc. Let's see.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the next step is NT4 and NT77.\n\nNT4's production is t54, so NT4 directly becomes 't54'.\n\nNow, NT77's production possibilities: Looking at the grammar, there are two productions for NT77:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47' (line: NT77 -> 't47')\n\nand\n\nNT77 \u2192 't34' (line: NT77 -> 't34' under NT77 -> 't34'? Wait, looking back, I might have missed that.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nHmm, the user provided a long list. Let me scan for NT77.\n\nI see:\n\nNT77 -> 't47' (line: NT77 -> 't47')\n\nand another production: NT77 -> 't34' somewhere? Let's check.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT77 -> 't34' is present under NT34 -> 't78'. Wait, no, no, perhaps I'm mixing lines. Wait, the user provided a long list, but perhaps I should check each production for NT77.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see two for NT77:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nWait, no, I think maybe I misread. Let me re-examine the lines:\n\nLooking through the provided lines, I see:\n\n- NT77 -> 't47' (line: line: NT77 -> 't47')\n\n- Another line: NT53 -> 't48'\n\nWait, no, maybe I missed. Wait, here's a breakdown of the productions:\n\nLooking for NT77:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- line: \"NT77 -> 't47'\", so that's one production.\n\nAnother line: \"NT77 -> 't34'\"? Let me check. Here's the full list:\n\nThe user provided:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nYes, I think the user provided both:\n\nLook at the grammar:\n\nLines:\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nYes, so NT77 can produce either 't47' or 't34'.\n\nBut in the string, after 't54' (from NT4), the next is 't9's and others. So if NT77 produces 't47' or 't34', which are terminals.\n\nIn our string, after 't54', the next term is 't9', so neither 't47' nor 't34' is 't9', so this can't match.\n\nWait, but I'm getting something wrong here. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nThe string is t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t39 t28.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT4 NT77, NT4 becomes 't54'. Now, what about NT77? It needs to produce a sequence that, when combined, forms the remaining part of the string: t9 t9 t9 t18 t39 t28.\n\nSo what is the remaining part? Starting after 't54', which is the first element in the string, the next six elements are t9, t9, t9, t18, t39, t28.\n\nWait, no, wait. The string is seven elements: t54 followed by six more. Let's clarify the structure.\n\nWait, if S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the entire string must be generated as the concatenation of the sequences generated by NT4 and NT77.\n\nNT4 generates 't54' directly. So the first element of the string is 't54'. Now, we need the rest of the string (t9 t9 t9 t18 t39 t28) to be generated by NT77.\n\nBut NT77 is a non-terminal. Let's see what it can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT77 can produce 't47' or 't34', both of which are terminals. But in our string, after 't54', we have 't9'... so for NT77 to contribute to the rest of the string, it would need to produce something that starts with 't9'.\n\nBut 't47' is 't47', which is a terminal, not 't9'. Similarly, 't34' is 't34'.\n\nWait, that can't happen. So maybe my initial assumption that S \u2192 NT4 NT77 is the correct pathway is wrong.\n\nPerhaps we should consider the other option for S, which is S \u2192 NT4 NT77 or S \u2192 NT47 NT69.\n\nWait, wait. The productions are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo those are the two options. So S can either become NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nEarlier, I considered NT4 leading to 't54', but that caused a problem because NT77 can't produce the remaining sequence.\n\nPerhaps the correct pathway is S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nLet's explore that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Then, each of these NT13 and NT69 will be expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nLet me check what NT13 and NT69 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT13 has a production: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nSo NT13 can produce NT70 followed by NT46.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, and NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals can be expanded further.\n\nSo, for NT13:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nNT70 has a production: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n\nand NT70 \u2192 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The rules for NT34 are:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47\nNT34 \u2192 't78'\n\nSo, 't78' is an terminals. So where does t11 come from?

{"custom_id":"request-94","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t65 t9 t9 t9 t18 t7 t0 t28\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either two terminals or a non-terminal. \n\nFirst, I think about how to derive the string by working backwards. The string starts with \"t65\". Looking at the grammar, \"t65\" comes from the production \"NT4\" -> 't65'. So that means NT4 must be part of the derivation.\n\nNext, \"t9\" appears three times. Each \"t9\" can come from two different productions: either NT60 -> NT38 NT18 (and then later converting to 't9'), or NT9 -> NT46 NT62 (which then turns into 't9'). I'll need to see which ones are connected here.\n\nAfter the three \"t9\"s, the substring is \"t18 t7 t0 t28\". Let's break that down. \"t18\" can come from NT18 -> 't18' or from NT9 -> 't0' but wait, NT18 is 't18' directly, so that's straightforward. Then \"t7\" is from NT7 -> 't7'. Next, \"t0\" is from NT9 -> 't0'. Finally, \"t28\" is from NT42 -> 't28'.\n\nPutting this together, I think the derivation might involve the following steps:\n\n1. Start with S -> NT47 NT69. NT47 -> NT66 NT29. NT66 -> NT13 NT1. NT13 -> NT32 NT21. NT32 -> NT24 NT43. Wait, but in the string, we have \"t65 t9...\". Maybe that's a different path.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the path that produces \"t65\" first. So S starts with NT47 and NT69. NT47 is 't65', so one chain starts there. Then NT69 is 't23 NT6'. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT69 -> NT23 NT6. Wait, that's NT23 and NT6. But in the string, after \"t65\" comes \"t9\" three times. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, S could have another path. Let me think about NT6: NT6 is 't18', as per the grammar: NT6 -> 't18'. So if I have NT6, that becomes 't18'. But in the string, the last part is \"t18 t7 t0 t28\". So \"t18 t7 t0 t28\" might come from a longer chain.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string ends with \"t18 t7 t0 t28\".\n\n- \"t18\" comes from NT18 -> 't18'.\n- \"t7\" comes from NT7 -> 't7'.\n- \"t0\" comes from NT9 -> 't0'.\n- \"t28\" comes from NT42 -> 't28'.\n\nSo putting these together: ... -> NT42 (-> 't28') AND something that leads to NT18 (-> 't18'), then NT7, then NT9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, how do we get from S to these terminal symbols? Let me try to find a branch.\n\nS can produce either NT47 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, NT47, which produces t65. Then NT69 is next. NT69 -> NT23 NT6. NT6 is 't18'. So, from NT69, we get 't23' and 't18'. But in our string after t65, the next is 't9'. So that path doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, check the other branch: S -> NT4 NT77. NT4 is 't54'. Not matching 't65'. Wait, but in the string, after t65, it's t9, t9, t9, etc. So perhaps the correct path is from NT69 but leading to something else.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine NT6: The grammar says NT6 -> 't18'. But perhaps I'm supposed to look deeper, but according to CNF, all non-terminals are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production leads directly to a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT69: NT69 -> NT23 NT6. So NT23 and NT6. If NT23 leads to 't9' and NT6 leads to 't18', then NT69 would produce 't9 t18'. So in the string, after 't65', 't9' comes up. So that suggests that after NT69 produces 't23 t6', but how does that lead to 't9'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong about NT23. Let me check NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT23 is 't80' or maybe it's a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT23 is produced by which production? Let me go through each line:\n\nLooking for NT23: I see NT42 -> 't28', NT61 -> NT18 NT18, NT53 -> NT17 NT38 or NT80 NT69, NT67->'t6', etc. Wait, I don't see NT23 being a non-terminal. It might have been a typo or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check again. Oh, here's NT23: NT23 is in the production N23 -> something? Wait, in the provided productions, is there any line that starts with NT23? Let me scan the list:\n\nYes, here's NT23: NT23 -> NT73 NT41. So NT23 is a non-terminal, as it's on the left side of a production. So NT23 is produced by NT73 and NT41. So to find what NT23 produces, I have to look into those.\n\nLooking at NT73: NT73 -> NT9 NT41. Wait, but wait, in the grammar, it's written as NT70 -> NT76 NT7, etc. Let me parse each.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nSo the string is t65 t9 t9 t9 t18 t7 t0 t28. Let's split it into individual tokens: [t65, t9, t9, t9, t18, t7, t0, t28].\n\nWe need to see if this sequence can be derived from S.\n\nLooking for t65: It comes from NT4 -> t65. So in the string, the first token is t65, which must come from NT4, so NT4 must be a start of the derivation.\n\nBut according to the grammar, S can produce either NT47 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nIf we choose S -> NT47 NT69, then NT47 would start the derivation. But the first token is t65, which comes from NT4. So that suggests that S must derive through NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, if S->NT4 NT77, then NT4 would produce 't54' perhaps, but our first token is t65. So that path can't be because 't54' is different from 't65'.\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming the first production. Maybe it's the other way.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIf the string starts with t65, and NT65 is not a non-terminal (since all non-terminals in the grammar have left-hand sides as two non-terminals or a terminal). So t65 is the production of NT5: NT5 -> 't39' or NT62 -> 't71' or NT5-> 't39' etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, I'm confused because in the grammar, all the non-terminals are either followed by two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, S -> NT47 NT69, so NT47 and NT69 are non-terminals. NT47 -> NT66 NT29, and so on.\n\nSo looking back, the first token is t65, which comes from NT47-> 't65' or somewhere else?\n\nWait, let me look for t65 in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the lines, I see:\n\nBTW, looking at the grammar, for example, NT78 -> 't5'. So some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. Let me go through each production to see which terminals are produced.\n\nLooking for t65: Yes, looking through,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-102","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the given string `t65 t40 t84 t84 t9 t9 t18 t72` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that this grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This should make parsing easier, but I'm not actually using a parsing algorithm here; I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string we have consists of a sequence of terminal symbols. So I need to see if this string can be built by expanding S and substituting non-terminals with terminals until only the string remains.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only start symbol is S, and S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSince the string starts with 't65', I'll check the possible productions that could lead to a 't65'. Looking through the non-terminal productions, I notice that some non-terminals have productions that evaluate to terminals.\n\nFor example, 't65' is a terminal, and I can check which non-terminals produce it. Looking through the rules, I spot:\n- NT5 \u2192 't65'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54' which isn't useful here.\n- Other non-terminals have more complex productions but only some of them produce terminals like 't50', 't39', etc.\n\nSo the only non-terminals that produce 't65' directly are NT5. So to get 't65', I must have a production that leads to NT5, and then NT5 \u2192 't65'.\n\nLooking at the production NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1, I don't immediately see 't65' there, but wait, I should focus on direct terminal outputs first.\n\nWait, another thought: the string is `t65 t40 t84 t84 t9 t9 t18 t72`. How long is it? It has 8 terms, so when expanded, the parse tree would have to have 8 terminal symbols. In CNF, each production adds exactly two non-terminals, so starting from S, each expansion doubles the number of non-terminals until we reach the terminals. Wait, no, that's not quite right because in CNF, a production can be a single terminal, so the derivation can vary in length.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to find a derivation tree that leads to the given string. Let me see if I can backtrack from the terminals to the start symbol.\n\nThe string ends with 't72', so perhaps I should see which non-terminals can produce 't72'. Looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't72'. Hmm, maybe there's a path through multiple non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list the productions that produce terminals directly. That might give me clues.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't0' (I think)\nWait, actually, looking more carefully:\n\nI see NT9 \u2192 't0' as well as NT9 \u2192 't46'. Also, NT9 \u2192 't46' and 't0'.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, I'm seeing NT9 has several productions, some are non-terminals, and some produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45\nNT9 -> NT46 NT62\nNT9 -> NT46 NT80\nWait, does any rule directly produce 't65'? Let me check.\n\nLooking again, I see NT5 \u2192 't65' and NT4 \u2192 't54' (not helpful), NT42 \u2192 't68', etc. So 't65' is only directly produced by NT5.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is 't65', which must come from NT5. So the initial step is to have the production S \u2192 NT4 NT77 or S \u2192 NT13 NT69. But NT5 is neither of those, so we need to see if either of S's productions can derive into producing NT5 somewhere in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps S can expand into either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77, but we need to see if any of those can produce a subsequnce that leads to the terminals in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string: `t65 t40 t84 t84 t9 t9 t18 t72`\n\nWe can attempt to split this string into possible parts that each correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step will split a non-terminal into two. So starting from S, which can produce NT13 and NT69. But the string starts with 't65', so maybe through a chain of non-terminals leading to NT5, which produces 't65'.\n\nWait, so perhaps S \u2192 ... and eventually one of the non-terminals in the left part would produce 't65' via a chain.\n\nLet me explore each production step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I'll see which non-terminals can eventually produce the initial 't65'. Since only NT5 \u2192 't65', so somewhere in the derivation, NT5 must be present.\n\nLooking for a chain that leads to NT5 from S.\n\nLooking at the left-hand side of S's productions:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nSo suppose S splits into NT13 and NT69. Now we have to see if these can produce the string.\n\nBut the string starts with 't65', so NT13 or NT69 must eventually produce a part of the string. Let me check what NT13 and NT69 produce.\n\nLooking at NT13's productions:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nSo NT13 splits into NT70 and NT46. NT70 has a production NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. So NT70 splits into NT76 and NT7.\n\nNT7's production is NT7 \u2192 't44'.\n\nSimilarly, NT76 \u2192 't79'.\n\nSo putting that together: NT70 \u2192 't76' and 't44'.\n\nWait, no, because in CNF, each production is split into two non-terminals. So let's see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7.\n\nSo the string from NT70 would have a 't76' and a 't44' as the end terminals, perhaps. But in our string, the first few terms are t65, t40, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other path: S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo if we have two branches: NT13 and NT69.\n\nLet me explore NT13:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nThen, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7.\n\nThen NT76 \u2192 't79' (if there's a production NT76 \u2192 't79'?), but checking the given grammar:\n\nWait, looking back, the production for NT76 is not present in the given rules. Wait, actually, looking through the list again, I see:\n\nAh, yes, looking for NT76:\n\nNT76 \u2192 't79'\n\nSo yes, NT76 \u2192 't79'\n\nAnd NT7 is:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't44'\n\nSo NT70 \u2192 't79' 't44'\n\nSo the path would be NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46 \u2192 't79' 't44' and then NT46.\n\nWhat is NT46's production?\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT47 NT5.\n\nSo NT46 \u2192 't47' 't65' (since NT5 \u2192 't65').\n\nWait, NT47's production is NT34 NT69.\n\nSo NT46 \u2192 't47' and 't65' would be produced from NT47 and NT5.\n\nSo putting it all together, the left part of S (NT13 NT69) would first expand as:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46 \u2192't79' 't44' and 't47' 't65'.\n\nWait, no, because in leftmost derivation, we replace the leftmost non-terminal first.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nFirst step: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nThen, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 \u2192 't79' 't44'.\n\nSo the first part after S \u2192 NT13 NT69 would be 't79' 't44' and then we have NT46 from the right part.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-118","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t54 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t0 t28` is generated by the given grammar. First, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces various combinations of non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals eventually expands into a string of terminals or possibly other non-terminals. The string I'm evaluating consists of terminal symbols, all of which seem to have corresponding productions in the grammar.\n\nThe string has 9 tokens: t54, t17, t84, t9, t9, t18, t7, t0, t28. Each of these is a terminal, so I need to trace if each can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list each terminal and see if it's directly produced by a production:\n\n- t54: Looking at the grammar, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't54'. So t54 comes from NT4.\n- t17: NT17 \u2192 't80'. Hmm, t17 is 't80'? Wait, no. Wait, NT17 is a different symbol. Checking NT17's production, it's NT17 \u2192 't80'. So t17 must be 't80'. But in the string, it's t17, which is just 't17', not 't80'. Wait, no. Wait, NT17 is a non-terminal that produces 't80'. So t17 must be 't80', but the string has t17, which is 't17', not 't80'. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, NT17 \u2192 't80' means that wherever there's NT17, it can be replaced by 't80'. So in the string, when we have t17, it implies that it's generated from NT17, but only if t17 is 't80'. So in this case, the string has 't17', which is t_17, not t80, which is 't80'. So that might not align. Unless perhaps the indices in the string correspond differently.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, each non-terminal's production has specific terminals. For example, NT4 \u2192 't54', which is terminal 't54'. So in the string, the first token is t54, which matches NT4.\n\nNext, t17: In the grammar, NT17 is defined as \u2192 't80'. So the string has t17, which is a different terminal. So that might not match, but perhaps I'm miscalculating. Wait, perhaps the non-terminal is named differently. Wait, maybe the non-terminals have the same indices as the string, but looking at the productions, I don't see any non-terminal named 't17'. The string has t17, which suggests that the non-terminal producing 't17' is called NT17, but in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 't80' is not 't17'. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. \n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT54 \u2192 't54' is defined. Because in the list, under NT54: 't54'. So t54 is generated by NT54. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 't80' is defined. So t17 is from NT17, but that's 't80', not 't17'. Therefore, the string has 't17', but according to the grammar, NT17 produces 't80', not 't17'. So that might be an inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the indices in the string directly correspond to non-terminals. Wait, let's think: The string is `t54 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t0 t28`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So t54 is produced by NT54, t17 by NT17, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't54': So t54 is okay.\n- NT17 \u2192 't80': So in the string, t17 should be 't80', but the string has t17. That's a conflict.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe the indices in the string are just part of the terminal symbols, not the non-terminals. So, if I have NT17 \u2192 't80', then in the string, if there's a t17, that non-terminal must have produced it. But in the grammar, it's 't80', so if the string is using t17, that would not be possible because NT17 can't produce t17. So that suggests the string has a mismatch because t17 can't come from NT17; instead, 't80' would have to be in that spot.\n\nSimilarly, looking at other terminals:\n\n- t84: Looking for a non-terminal that produces t84. Scanning the grammar, I see NT54 \u2192 't54', NT17 \u2192 't80', NT5 \u2192 't39', NT49 \u2192 't40', NT53 \u2192 't48', etc. Looking for t84, I don't immediately see a production that ends with 't84'. Wait, perhaps it's another non-terminal. Maybe NT84? But the grammar I was given doesn't show any non-terminal NT84. So it's possible that 't84' isn't produced by any non-terminal, which would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t84 comes from a different non-terminal. Scanning through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to 't84'. So maybe the string contains a terminal that's not produced by any rule, meaning it's impossible, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but let me go through each token systematically:\n\n1. t54: NT54 \u2192 't54' \u2705\n2. t17: NT17 \u2192 't80' \u274c (It would require 't80' here, not t17)\n3. t84: I don't see any production that gives t84 \u274c\n4. t9: Looking through, I see NT9 \u2192 't0' and NT9 \u2192 't46' and others, but none directly produce 't9'. So t9 cannot be produced by any non-terminal \u274c\n5. t9: Same as above \u274c\n6. t18: NT18 \u2192 't43' and others, no direct production for 't18' \u274c\n7. t7: Looking through, NT7 \u2192 't44' and others, but no direct nt for 't7' \u274c\n8. t0: There's a production NT9 \u2192 't0' \u2705\n9. t28: NT28 \u2192 't79' and others, but no direct nt 't28' \u274c\n\nSo, from step 2, t17 would require NT17 to produce 't80', not 't17', which is a mismatch. Also, t84, t9, t18, t7, t28 are terminals that aren't produced by any non-terminal, which means the string can't be generated by this grammar. So, putting that together, the string isn't possible because several terminals are absent from the grammar's productions.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: t54 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t62 t65 t28.\n\nChomsky normal form for a context-free grammar consists of two types of rules: productions that produce two non-terminals and productions that produce a single terminal. The provided grammar seems to handle both since some rules have non-terminals on both sides and others produce terminals, like S -> NT... something, and then some rules like NTX -> 't...'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that the right-hand sides of the production rules are either two non-terminals (like S->NT13 NT69) or one terminal, sometimes more? No, wait, looking closer, the grammar seems to have rules like \"NT41 -> t9\" and so on. So some productions are two non-terminals, others produce a single terminal. So the entire grammar can generate terminals, but maybe it's a two-step process.\n\nBut the input string is a series of terminals, so I need to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar. Since the production rules can produce either non-terminals or terminals, the process of checking the string would involve figuring out how each part of the string is generated.\n\nI think I can model this using the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. The CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, CYK can be applied more straightforwardly. Alternatively, I can manually check if the string can be derived by the grammar. Let's consider the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t54 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t62 t65 t28.\n\nLet me note the positions as 0: t54, 1: t17, 2: t84, 3: t9, 4: t9, 5: t18, 6: t42, 7: t62, 8: t65, 9: t28.\n\nGiven that the grammar starts from S and the first productions are S->NT13 NT69 or S->NT4 NT77. So S can produce either of these pairs. Each of these non-terminals likely leads to a chain that will be used to generate the string.\n\nLet me look at the rules that produce 't' terminals. For example, NT41 -> t9, NT80 -> t43, NT83 -> t7, etc. Each production that ends with a terminal like 't54' must come from a non-terminal that directly produces that 't' value.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is t54. Looking at the rules, I see that NT4 -> 't54' and NT4 again appears in S's productions: S->NT4 NT77. So perhaps the first production of S is using NT4, which directly produces t54. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the second terminal is t17. Let's check if any non-terminal can derive t17. Looking through the rules, I see NT17 -> t80. Wait, and then I need to see how t80 can lead to t17, but that might not be a direct production. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: each terminal in the string must be the result of a production rule that can produce it. So t54 can come from NT4 (NT4 -> t54). Then t17: looking at the rules, there's NT17 -> t80, so t17 can't be directly produced, but maybe it's through another production. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look up all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules: I see that NT77 has productions like NT77 -> NT51 NT78, and then later rules like NT51-> NT34 NT69, and NT78-> NT5 NT16, etc. Hmm, maybe it's better to approach this step-by-step using CYK.\n\nUsing CYK algorithm steps:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each cell (i,j) will hold possible non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j.\n\n2. The length of the string is 10, so i ranges from 0 to 9, j from i to 9.\n\n3. For the terminal symbols, we look for production rules where the right-hand side can directly produce that symbol, such as two non-terminals that when expanded, result in 't...', or a direct t production.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for each terminal 't...', we can check if there's a production NTx -> t..., and if so, that NTx can generate that 't...'.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production is at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. But sometimes, in CNF, terminals can only appear as single symbols on the right, meaning that each production must have exactly two non-terminals or exactly one terminal. So each production is either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, the first step is to build a lookahead table that maps each terminal symbol to the set of non-terminals that can directly produce it. For example, NT4->t54, so 't54' can be generated by NT4.\n\nSimilarly, 't17' should be in the production list of some NT. Looking through the given rules:\n\n- looking for 't17': I see NT17 -> t80, but I don't see any NT producing t17 directly. Hmm, so maybe t17 is part of a production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider if there's a production that can derive t17 by a chain. Let's see.\n\nFor example, is there a production that can lead to t17 via other productions? Let's see the rules. Looking up NT17, it's NT17 -> t80. So to get t17, we need to see how t80 is derived and if it can include NT17 in the chain. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis might get too complicated manually, so perhaps a better approach is to model the entire process step by step, checking if each symbol in the string can be generated.\n\nAnother way is to see if each terminal can be generated by some NT, and that the NT in question is part of a production path that can cover the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built in such a way that each terminal corresponds to a non-terminal that's part of a production chain that can generate it.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the initial productions. The start is S, which branches into NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. So, for the string to start with t54, which comes from NT4, which is derived from S's S->NT4 NT77. So that's the first part.\n\nSo S produces NT4 and NT77, NT4 is t54, and NT77 must produce the rest of the string: t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t62 t65 t28.\n\nWait, no, because the initial string is t54 followed by the rest, so S->NT4 NT77, so S can produce t54 and then NT77, which must produce the remaining t17 t84... t28.\n\nSo now, focusing on NT77. The productions for NT77 are:\n\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78\n\nAnd then NT51 -> NT34 NT69\n\nNT78 -> NT5 NT16\n\nWait, let's track this:\n\nNT77 can produce NT51 and NT78.\n\nSo, the next part of the string is t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t62 t65 t28.\n\nSo NT77 must produce this. So the first symbol is t17. Let's see NT77 produces NT51 NT78. So to get t17, perhaps NT77 -> NT51 NT78, and then NT51 generates t17 somehow.\n\nLooking at NT51: NT51 -> NT34 NT69. Then NT34 can produce 't9' or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nOption 1: Start with S->NT4 NT77, which gives us t54"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-143","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is `t65 t62 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t58 t43 t28`. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are used to generate specific structures, and each non-terminal symbol has production rules that can be expanded into other symbols, eventually leading to terminal symbols (the actual strings we see). The grammar provided starts with S, which is the starting symbol. Each production rule is in the form A \u2192 BC, which is a classic Chomsky Normal Form setup.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's a bit extensive with many production rules. Each rule either combines two non-terminals or pairs them with a terminal. My task is to see if the given string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe string given is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like `t65`, `t62`, etc. I notice that a lot of these look like terminal symbols because they start with 't'. So, the idea would be to see if each 't' in the string is matched by a rule in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the production rules that end with a terminal symbol 't' to see the possible ways they can appear in the string. Scanning through the grammar:\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT34 -> 't78' (Wait, no, NT34 is \u2192 't78' in one rule, but also has other rules. Let me check.)\nWait, looking again, I see NT34 has two production rules:\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\nand\nNT34 -> 't78'\n\nSo 't78' is a terminal production for NT34. Similarly, other NT symbols have some terminal productions.\n\nNow, the string is made up of several 't's followed by numbers. So each 't' could be the result of an NT symbol that has a production ending with that 't'. The numbers following each 't' would be the next symbols, which could be results of other NT symbols or terminals.\n\nSo, let's start from the given string and try to parse it backward, using the grammar to see if each terminal can be matched.\n\nStarting with the string: `t65 t62 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t58 t43 t28`\n\nLet me split it into individual tokens: [t65, t62, t84, t9, t9, t18, t7, t58, t43, t28]\n\nI'll start from the beginning, trying to match t65.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what NT symbols produce 't65'? Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT3: 't65'\n- Also, NT4: 't54' and NT5: 't39', but not 't65'.\nSo, the only way to get 't65' is from NT3.\n\nSo, the first symbol, t65, comes from NT3. Then the next symbol is t62, which must come from the next NT symbol in the production chain.\n\nSo, after NT3, what? Let's see how NT3 is produced. In the grammar, NT3 has two rules:\n\nNT3 -> NT10 NT9\nand\nNT3 -> 't65'\n\nWait, so to produce 't65' directly, NT3 just becomes 't65'. But since the string starts with t65, that can be matched directly, but that would mean NT3 is the start symbol. Wait, no\u2014it's more about the entire derivation.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me take a different approach. Since the start symbol is S, I need to see if S can derive this string.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S, which has two rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT1 (for the first part) \u2014 Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar is as follows, so let me correct that. The first two rules under S are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT1\nWait no, the initial two S rules are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\nWait, wait, let me re-read the given grammar correctly.\n\nLooking back, the grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nWait, maybe that's the first two rules. So, S can produce NT13 followed by NT13 or NT4 followed by NT77.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, it's a bit confusing, but probably each production is listed as S -> NT13 NT13 and S -> NT4 NT77, etc.\n\nBut actually, the user provided the grammar in a way that each line is a production. For example:\n\n``` Grammar:\nS -> NT13 NT13\nS -> NT4 NT77\n...\n```\n\nWait, no, looking at the initial part, the user wrote:\n\n```\nGrammar: ```S -> NT13 NT13\nS -> NT4 NT77\nNT47 -> NT66 NT29\n...\n```\n\nSo, each '->' represents a production rule. So S has two rules: S \u2192 NT13 NT13 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, to derive the string, S must produce a sequence of NT symbols that can expand into the given string.\n\nLet me consider each possibility.\n\nFirst Approach: Try to match the string starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the string starts with NT4 and then NT77. Each of these needs to produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at our string, the first two symbols are t65 and t62. So, after S, the first part would be NT4 producing t65 and something else.\n\nWait, let's see: NT4 can produce 't54' directly, but if NT4 is followed by NT77, which in turn produces 't47'.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the string. The string starts with t65, so that would have to come from NT3, because NT3 \u2192 t65.\n\nWait, but S first goes to NT4 or NT13. So, S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, after S, we have NT4 and NT77. Let's see what NT4 and NT77 can produce.\n\nLooking at GT4 rules, NT4 can produce 't54' or NT6 NT7. Since 't54' is not in our string (our first symbol is t65), let's see if NT4 can produce a combination that gives us t65.\n\nWait, according to the grammar, NT4 \u2192 't54' or NT6 NT7. So, if we go through NT6 and NT7:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t18, but wait, looking at the NT6 rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT38 NT67\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT47, 't47', or 't29'\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting too deep. Let me take the string and see if I can match each 't' in sequence.\n\nStarting with t65:\n\nLooking for rules where NT symbol \u2192 't65'. Only NT3 \u2192 t65, as per the grammar. So first NT3 \u2192 t65.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is covered by NT3.\n\nNow, the next token is t62. So, immediately after NT3, the next NT symbol must produce t62.\n\nWhat produces t62? Looking through the grammar:\n\nI see NT74 \u2192 t47, but that's not t62.\n\nWait, looking for 't62'\u2014any NT symbol directly producing t62?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT61 -> 't42' (wait, no, look again.)\n\nWait, let me check each rule for terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT34 -> 't78' (but also others)\nWait, perhaps I missed some.\n\nLooking back, in the given rules:\n\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't39' etc.\n\nWait a second, in the original grammar provided, the production rules include:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't62'. Oh, right, yes, looking back, a few of the NT rules produce t27, t28, t31, etc.\n\nWait, I see several rules where NT symbols produce 't' followed by a number.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 't62' (from a line: NT61 -> 't62')\n- Also, some others like NT15 -> 't42', NT36\u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, to determine if the string is generated, I'll probably need to use a method suitable for CNF grammars. Parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm are efficient for this, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break down the string step by step, ensuring each symbol is generated by the rules.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse engineer the string from the top of the grammar. Let's see:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the grammar seems to have two options:\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nThe string starts with 't54', which probably comes from one of the productions of NT13 or NT4. Looking at the RHS of NT13: it's NT70 and NT46. Both NT70 and NT46 might produce terminals.\n\nWait, for NT13, the production is NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 t44. So NT70 would break down into sequences that eventually produce terminals. Similarly, NT46 \u2192 t58.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't54', but in the grammar, NT13 is used, which doesn't directly produce t54. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT4, which is one of the options in the start symbol S. NT4 \u2192 t54. So 't54' is produced by NT4. So S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So the string starts with NT4, which is 't54', and then NT77.\n\nNow, looking at NT77, the productions are:\n- NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\n- NT77 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't54' followed by 't78', so that suggests the second part of NT77 is 't78'. Let me check NT78.\n\nLooking at NT78, it produces two possibilities:\n- NT78 \u2192 t5 NT16\n- NT78 \u2192 't33' via another production. Wait, checking the grammar, I see NT78 has two productions: one is NT5 (which is t39) and NT16. Let me check: NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16 and also NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT69, but wait, no, in the given grammar, it's actually:\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT78: \u2192 t5 NT16, and another production is NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT69. But earlier in the initial answer, there was a discrepancy. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the initial thought process, I thought NT78 has two productions: NT5 (t39) and NT16. But looking again, I see in the grammar:\n\nThe productions for NT78 are:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 t5 NT16\n- NT78 \u2192 t33 NT69 (because of the production NT33 \u2192 t85, and NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6 \u2192 't6')\n\nWait, that's a bit more accurate. So NT78 can produce 't5' followed by whatever NT16 is, or 't33' followed by whatever NT69 is.\n\nIn the string, after 't54' comes 't78', so we take the second production of NT78, which is 't33' followed by NT69.\n\nWait, that doesn't align because the string after 't54' is 't78'. Maybe I need to parse step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should parse the entire string step by step using the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is: t54 t78 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t31 t17 t28\n\nLet me break it down into tokens: [t54, t78, t9, t9, t18, t7, t50, t58, t31, t17, t28]\n\nStarting with S. S can split into either NT4 and NT69 or NT47 and NT5. Let's see which makes more sense.\n\nThe string starts with t54, which matches NT4 \u2192 t54. So S \u2192 NT4 NT69. Now we need to parse the second part, which is 't78 t9 t9 ...' Wait, no, wait, S is NT4 NT69, so after the first part (t54), the next part starts with t78. So we need to see if NT69 can produce 't78 t9 t9 ...'.\n\nWait, let me correct. The entire string is a single sequence of symbols, so when S splits into NT4 and NT69, each part must produce a sub-string.\n\nSo, starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT69\n\nSo the string starts with NT4 producing 't54', and then NT69 must produce the remaining part of the string: t78 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t31 t17 t28.\n\nSo we need to parse 't78 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t31 t17 t28' using NT69.\n\nLooking at NT69's productions:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6 and NT67 NT4.\n\nSo NT69 can split into either NT23 NT6 or NT67 NT4.\n\nLooking at the remaining string, the first token is 't78'. Let's see which production starts with 't78'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT23 and NT67.\n\nFor NT23: 't78' is one of its productions.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t73 NT41 (t9) and also NT23 \u2192 t9 NT17? Or wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t73 NT41, which is 't73' followed by NT41. But in the initial response, when the user wrote the grammar, under NT23: \u2192 t73 NT41 and another production \u2192 t9 NT17.\n\nWait, I might have misread that. Let me double-check:\n\nFrom the original grammar provided by the user:\n\nNT23 \u2192 \u2192 t73 NT41\n\nIs that right? No, looking again:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT23 -> t73 NT41\n\nAh, yes. So NT23 \u2192 t73 followed by NT41. But t73 is a terminal for NT73 \u2192 't9'.\n\nSo, let's examine NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6. So NT23 here would produce t73 and NT41. But the string we're processing starts with t78, so perhaps NT69 \u2192 NT67 NT4.\n\nWait, let's check NT67: according to the grammar, NT67 \u2192 t6 NT18. So it's t6 followed by something.\n\nIn the string, after t78, the next token is t9, which doesn't match the start of NT67 (t6), so maybe we need to use the other production of NT69, which is NT67 NT4.\n\nWait, but NT67's first element is t6, not t78. That doesn't fit. So that suggests that perhaps the split of NT69 is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial split of S is wrong. Let me try the other option for S: S \u2192 NT47 NT5.\n\nIn that case, the string starts with NT47 and then NT5. NT47 might produce something else, but let's look at NT47's productions.\n\nIn the grammar, NT47 is: \u2192 t84 and \u2192 NT48 NT67.\n\nt84 is a terminal. In the string, the first token is t54, so that doesn't fit. Therefore, this option for S doesn't make sense. So S must split into NT4 NT69.\n\nBut earlier, when attempting NT69's first production, NT23 NT6, that doesn't fit the initial 't78', so perhaps we need to take another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let's consider that NT69 can produce 't78 t9 ...', but how?\n\nLooking again at NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), where each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. In CNF, derivation steps are two symbols long: one non-terminal, then another non-terminal, and so on. Since the string provided has elements separated by spaces, each being a terminal, I'll consider each token as a step in the derivation.\n\nThe string is: t65 t85 t58 t62 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t39 t28\n\nI need to check if each of these terminals corresponds to a rule in the grammar. Also, the order in which they appear must follow the derivation steps.\n\nLet me list the productions that generate each terminal from left to right.\n\n1. t65: Looking at the grammar, NT65 isn't directly a non-terminal. Wait, but looking at the productions, I notice that NT65 is generated by NT3, right? The production NT3 -> 't3', but I'm looking for t65. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, let me go through each terminal step by step.\n\n1. t65: Is there a production that results in t65? Looking through the grammar, I see that NT62 -> 't62', and I also see that NT45 -> NT46 NT36. Hmm, not directly. Wait, let me check all terminals.\n\nLooking through each terminal:\n\nt65: Is there any production that produces t65? Let me scan:\n\nLooking at NT26: NT26 -> 't42', but I'm looking for t65.\n\nWait, let me check each possible terminal:\n\nt65 appears in NT3 -> 't3' but t3 isn't t65. Wait, maybe I'm looking for the rule that assigns a production leading to t65.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look for 't65' in the grammar's terminal productions:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n\n- NT7 -> 't44'\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n\n- NT10 -> NT68 NT58\n\nBut none of these produce t65. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, maybe 't65' is generated by some non-terminal that has a rule leading to it. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, some rules produce terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't3'\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\n\nNT6 -> 't18'\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\n\nNT7 -> 't44'\n\nNT9 -> 't0'\n\nBut I don't see any rule that produces 't65' directly. Hmm, that\u2019s a problem because the first symbol is 't65'. Since the grammar starts the derivation with S -> NT13 NT69, but S produces two non-terminals, which then have to derive the entire string as a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait a minute, but the string starts with t65. Since the start symbol S breaks down into two non-terminals, say A and B, then the derivation process would need to produce A followed by B, which then results in the string. So each symbol in the string is a terminal resulting from the non-terminals in the derivation chain.\n\nBut if the string starts with t65 and the grammar doesn't have any production that directly yields 't65', that could mean either the string is not in the language (No) or I might have missed something in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's list each terminal and see if it's generated by any rule.\n\nStarting with the first token: t65. Does any NT produce 't65'? Let me scan the productions:\n\nLooking systematically:\n\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n\n- NT7 -> 't44'\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n\n- NT10 -> NT68 NT58\n\nWait, no NT in the grammar produces 't65'. That would mean that unless I forgot a production, it's impossible to generate a string that starts with 't65', so the string isn't in the grammar's language.\n\nWait, but I don't see any production that ends in 't65'. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nLooking at NT4: It's defined as NT47 -> NT56 NT61, NT45 -> NT46 NT36, etc. But nowhere does any NT lead to 't65'.\n\nSo 't65' is not a terminal produced by any NT in the grammar, which would mean the string can't be generated because the first token isn't present in any rule.\n\nTherefore, the string is not in the language, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-176","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if this string `t65 t40 t84 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t84 t7 t28` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, understanding the grammar would help. The grammar has a start symbol S, and it seems like it produces strings made up of terminals (like t50, t4, etc.) and non-terminals. Each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> terminal, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. So I guess I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules.\n\nSo, the string is: [t65, t40, t84, t84, t9, t9, t18, t42, t40, t84, t7, t28]. That's 12 tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. Eventually, each non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the provided grammar, there are a lot of production rules. Some of them are terminals, like S->NT13 NT69, but then NT13 has its own productions, like NT13->NT70 NT46, and so on. Finally, some of these non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nSo, I think each non-terminal can be either replaced by two other non-terminals or a terminal. The string provided is all terminals, so the derivation path must replace all non-terminals with their terminal equivalents.\n\nThe length of the string is 12. The start symbol S is the root, and each production of S (e.g., S->NT13 NT69) will generate two non-terminals. Then, each of those non-terminals will need to produce their respective terminals or further split into more non-terminals.\n\nSince the grammar has a lot of production rules, perhaps I can construct a parse tree for the string and see if it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work backwards from the string, trying to match the string with the possible expansion paths in the grammar.\n\nLet me see: for the string to be produced, the entire sequence must be generated from S through leftmost derivations. Since each step in CNF either splits non-terminals into two or more, but in this case, each production is two or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each rule has exactly two non-terminals, so each production splits into two non-terminals. The only way to reach terminals is through the productions that directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT41->'t9' directly produces terminal t9. Similarly, others like NT56->'t62', NT15->'t40', etc.\n\nLet me see the start symbol S. S has two productions: S->NT13 NT69 and S->NT4 NT77. So the start can expand into two options. Then, each of those can expand further.\n\nBut for the given string, it's 12 terminals. Let me think about how many steps would be needed to derive this.\n\nEach step replaces a non-terminal with two others until all are terminals. So the number of terminals can be 2^n, where n is the number of expansions from the start. Wait, no: in each step, you have to replace all non-terminals, so the number of symbols increases by a factor of two each time. But if some non-terminals are expanded directly to terminals, that complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of non-terminals involved in the parse.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is t65 t40 t84 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t84 t7 t28, I need to see if this can be built by concatenating the results of the leftmost derivations of the grammar.\n\nLet me consider that the string starts with t65. Now, looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t65. Scan through the productions:\n\nLooking for non-terminals whose expansion leads directly or indirectly to t65.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S, which is either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. From NT13, looking at the productions:\n\nNT13->NT70 NT46\nNT70->NT76 NT7\nNT76->NT79 NT7\nWait, NT70 has a production that leads to NT76 and NT7, and NT76 leads to NT79 and NT7.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me check each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step. Starting from the beginning.\n\nFirst token is t65. Looking at the grammar, the only non-terminals that produce 't65' are NT4 (if it exists) or perhaps others. Wait, looking through the productions:\n\nWait, looking for any rule where the production is directly a terminal. For example, NT4->'t54', NT56->'t62', etc.\n\nBut in the given list, NT62->'t42', NT42->'t60', etc. So t65 is produced by which non-terminal?\n\nWait, let me look through the list carefully.\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't65'. So perhaps t65 is the result of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through, for example, NT4->'t54', NT56->'t62', NT15->'t40', NT74->'t47', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see a terminal 't65'. So maybe 't65' is produced by a non-terminal that itself is derived via other rules.\n\nWait, the first token is t65. So somewhere in the derivation, a non-terminal must produce t65, but that non-terminal must be built up from other non-terminals or directly via a production rule.\n\nBut in the current list of production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t65 directly. Let me check again...\n\nLooking through the productions (list provided), I don't see any rule like NTx -> 't65'. So perhaps 't65' is the result of a non-terminal that itself is derived from other non-terminals, which eventually derive to t65. However, without any production rule leading to t65, this seems impossible.\n\nWait, but 't65' isn't in the list, so unless it's produced by some non-terminal that isn't present in the list, which would mean it's impossible. So the first token is t65, which the grammar can't produce, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any production rules.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT31->'t50'\n- NT49->'t40'\n- NT53->'t48'\n- NT67->'t6'\n- NT9->'t0'\n- NT42->'t68'\n- NT12->'t81'\n- NT34->'t9'\n- NT46->'t58'\n- NT74->'t47'\n- NT32->'t11'\n- NT61->'t62'\n- NT26->'t42'\n- NT15->'t40'\n- NT32->'t24'\n- NT42->'t60'\n- NT3->'t65'\n- NT4->'t54'\n- NT61->'t17'\n- NT78->'t72'\n- NT38->'t47'\n- NT83->'t7'\n- NT80->'t43'\n- NT7->'t44'\n- NT56->'t31'\n- NT16->'t28'\n- NT38->'t29'\n- NT33->'t85'\n- NT78->'t33'\n- NT6->'t18'\n- NT18->'t43'\n- NT7->'t23'\n- NT47->'t84'\n\nAh, there we go. NT3->'t65'. So the non-terminal NT3 can produce t65, which matches the first token.\n\nSo that's possible. Now, looking back, the first symbol is t65, which comes from NT3.

{"custom_id":"request-183","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t65 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t31 t62 t28`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CFGs in CNF have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. That structure usually makes it easier to apply certain parsing techniques like the CYK algorithm, but since this is just a single string, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the productions lead to terminal symbols. For example, some productions like NT41 -> 't9', NT77 -> 't47', and many others are terminals. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying productions step by step.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT13 NT69. So the initial expansion of S is two non-terminals: NT13 and NT69. Each of these needs to be expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual terminals to see how they might correspond to the productions. The string is: `t65 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t31 t62 t28`.\n\nI notice that some of these are terminals, but others like 't65', 't17', etc., might come directly from the grammar. Let me think about how the start symbol S can generate this string.\n\nStarting with S -> NT13 NT69, so the first two symbols are NT13 and NT69. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT13: The production for NT13 is NT70 NT46. So NT13 can be broken down into NT70 and NT46. Now, I need to see if these can further expand.\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7. Let's expand NT76: NT76 -> NT79 NT7. Wait, NT79 isn't present in the given productions. That might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in looking for the correct productions. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the NT76 production might not be listed, so perhaps I should look for other ways. Alternatively, maybe I should track the string and see if each part can derive a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the CYK algorithm steps. But since I'm doing this manually, let's see.\n\nAnother approach is to list all the possible ways each terminal in the string can be generated. Let me check each terminal to see if it's produced by any NT.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- 't65' is produced by NT4 and NT5? Wait, looking back: NT5 -> 't39', so that's 't39'. Wait, maybe I need to check which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nWait, the productions list includes some lines like `NT4 -> 't54'`, `NT1 -> 't3'`, `NT3 -> 't65'`, `NT62 -> 't71'`, `NT31 -> 't50'`, `NT5 -> 't39'`, `NT49 -> 't40'`, `NT53 -> 't48'`, `NT67 -> 't6'`, `NT9 -> 't0'`, `NT42 -> 't68'`, `NT12 -> 't81'`, `NT34 -> 't9'`, `NT46 -> 't58'`, `NT74 -> 't47'`, `NT32 -> 't11'`, `NT61 -> 't62'`, `NT26 -> 't42'`, `NT15 -> 't40'`, `NT32 -> 't24'`, `NT42 -> 't60'`, `NT3 -> 't65'`, `NT4 -> 't65'`, `NT61 -> 't17'`, `NT78 -> 't72'`, `NT38 -> 't47'`, `NT83 -> 't7'`, `NT80 -> 't43'`, `NT7 -> 't44'`, `NT56 -> 't31'`, `NT16 -> 't28'`, `NT38 -> 't29'`, `NT33 -> 't85'`, `NT78 -> 't33'`, `NT6 -> 't18'`, `NT18 -> 't43'`, `NT7 -> 't23'`, `NT47 -> 't84'`.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, some NTs map directly to terminals. For example, NT3 -> 't65', NT4 -> 't65', NT61 -> 't17', NT56 -> 't31', NT16 -> 't28', etc.\n\nSo each of these terminals in the string must be generated by one of these NTs directly or through a chain of expansions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t65 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t31 t62 t28`.\n\nWait, the last two are 't58' and 't28'. 't28' comes from NT16. 't58' comes from NT46 or perhaps another NT. Let me check: NT46 -> 't58' is not directly listed, but wait, looking at the productions, I don't see NT46 being a terminal. So perhaps 't58' is produced by NT46, which is a NT that has a production to other NTs.\n\nWait, looking back at the productions: NT46 -> 't58' is not present. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT67 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT34 -> 't9'\n- NT46 -> 't58' \u2013 Wait, no, actually, looking at the list, I think I misread NT60 -> 't38 NT18', and NT46 might have a production. Hmm, maybe I need to list all the NTs and their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a mapping of which NTs produce which terminals and which NTs they go to.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's faster to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the given productions.\n\nSo, starting with `t65`: NT3 produces 't65' (line `NT3 -> 't65'`), and NT4 also produces 't65' (line `NT4 -> 't65'`). So, either can be used.\n\nNext, `t17` comes from NT61 -> 't17' (line `NT61 -> 't17'`).\n\nThen `t84` comes from NT47 -> 't84' (line `NT47 -> 't84'`).\n\nNext, `t9` can come from NT34 -> 't9' (line `NT34 -> 't9'`), and since NT9 also produces 't0' (wait, line 20: NT9 -> NT31 NT45). So, perhaps `t9` comes from NT34.\n\nContinuing, the string is `t65 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t31 t62 t28`.\n\nSo, `t18` comes from NT18 -> 't43' (line 23: NT18 -> 't43'), but that's a problem because NT18 produces a terminal 't43', not 't18'. Wait, no, looking back, I see that line 23 is `NT18 -> NT49 NT80`, and then NT49 can produce 't40' and NT80 can produce 't43'. So, NT18 can produce 't49' 't80', which would then result in 't40 t43'. Wait, but in the given productions, NT49 -> 't40', and NT80 -> 't43'. So, NT18 can be used to produce 't40 t43', but that's not a terminal 't18'. So how does NT18 produce 't18'? Let me check again. No, looking through the productions, I don't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t65 t85 t58 t50 t43 t40 t6 t65 t84 t9 t9 t18 t72`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols. Some terminals are present too, like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nI see that the start symbol is S, and the productions from S go to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, to generate the string, the start symbol S must expand into these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t65. I check the grammar and see that NT1 has rules. One of them is NT1 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. Another rule is NT1 \u2192 't65', so that's useful because the first part of the string starts with t65. So, perhaps S \u2192 NT13 NT69, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, actually, the productions for NT1 are two options: NT1 \u2192 't3' or NT1 \u2192 't65'. So if the first token is t65, that could directly come from NT1, meaning maybe we can have S \u2192 NT1 ... but S \u2192 NT13 NT69, so perhaps S expands to NT13 and NT69, but that seems less likely because S is a single symbol. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Let me check NT4's productions: NT46 \u2192 't58', NT47 \u2192 't84', and others. Wait, in the string, t58 appears before t50, which is later. But the first token is t65, which comes from NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t65, which is from NT1. So maybe S \u2192 NT13 NT69 expands into NT13 and NT69, but then how do those connect? Maybe I need to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The string is a sequence of t tokens and numbers. Each production that ends in a terminal will contribute to the string. So perhaps each non-terminal in the grammar has some rules that produce tX, where X is a number.\n\nI need to see how to derive the string step by step. Let's try to break it down. The string is: t65, t85, t58, t50, t43, t40, t6, t65, t84, t9, t9, t18, t72.\n\nI can try to see how t65 comes from NT1. Then, the next token is t85, which I don't see a direct production for in NT1 or NT4 or other NTs. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT3 has a production to t65, and also NT39 maybe? Wait, let's check all non-terminals and their terminals.\n\nLooking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 t0, so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 t39, etc. Maybe I can figure out each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that fit the grammar rules. Let's try to find possible connections.\n\nt65 appears twice. From NT1: NT1 \u2192 t65.\n\nt65 is part of the string, so maybe that's achieved by NT1.\n\nNext, t85. I don't see a direct production for t85, so perhaps t85 comes from another production. Wait, maybe t85 is part of a non-terminal. Let me check NT78: NT78 \u2192 t72, but that's later. NT85? Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT85, so maybe it's not there. Alternatively, maybe the string has a part that comes from NT13 or NT27 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to parse the string by finding possible non-terminals that can produce these terminals.\n\nStarting with t65: can only come from NT1.\n\nSo, the first part would be NT1 \u2192 t65.\n\nThen, after t65, the next is t85. How can t85 be generated? Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT85 as a non-terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe t85 comes from another production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the productions again. The NTs include many, but perhaps I've overlooked some that generate t85. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t0\nNT5 \u2192 t39\nNT49 \u2192 t40\nNT36 \u2192 t56, t61\nNT18 \u2192 t43\nNT69 \u2192 t6\nNT13 \u2192 t70 or t46\nNT61 \u2192 t33 or t18 (wait, NT61 has multiple productions. Wait, in the grammar: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45; NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68; NT96? Wait no, looking back, the grammar has NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45, etc.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to look for t85. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t85. Wait, perhaps t85 isn't a terminal; maybe it's part of a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps the string is a series of t followed by numbers, but maybe some of these numbers are part of non-terminals that expand into more symbols. But in the string given, all the tokens after t are just numbers, like t65, t85, etc. So perhaps those are terminals? Or maybe not, depending on the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see productions where non-terminals are broken down further, but sometimes they include terminals. So for example, NT13 has a production to NT70 and NT46, but another to NT32 and NT21. But in the string, t65 appears once from NT1, and then other letters.\n\nBut I'm having trouble because the string has t85, which I don't see a production for.

The string is `t65 t85 t58 t62 t40 t6 t65 t43 t84 t9 t9 t18 t33`, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see which terminals are present. From the rules, I notice that some non-terminals expand into terminals like 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT42 -> 't68', so 't68' is a terminal. Similarly, I see other terminals such as 't50', 't54', etc. \n\nNow, the string has several 't's followed by numbers. My job is to see if there's a way the grammar can produce this exact string. I'll break down the string into individual tokens to analyze each part: `t65`, `t85`, `t58`, `t62`, `t40`, `t6`, `t65`, `t43`, `t84`, `t9`, `t9`, `t18`, `t33`.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules. The top-level start symbol is S, which can branch into different rules. Let's see the options:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT69\n2. S -> NT4 NT77\n\nI'll explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's take S -> NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\nBut wait, NT70 can't be expanded into a terminal; it's a non-terminal. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT70 being a terminal. It's broken down into NT76 and NT7.\n\nWait, this seems problematic. Let me check the grammar again. For NT70, the rules show:\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\nNT76 -> NT79 NT7\nNT79 -> NT51 NT78\nNT51 -> NT34 NT69\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\nAnd so on. None of these are terminals. So starting with S -> NT13 NT69 might not be the right path because NT70 isn't a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, let me try S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 -> 't54', which is a terminal. So starting with NT4 gives a terminal. Then NT77:\n\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78\nNT51 -> NT34 NT69\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\nNT61 -> NT15 NT47\nNT15 -> NT40 (terminal)\nSo let's see: NT77 -> NT51 NT78\nNT51 -> NT34 NT69 (both non-terminals)\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\nNT61 -> NT15 NT47\nNT15 -> NT40 (terminal)\nNT47 is a non-terminal, but looking at the grammar, NT47 has several rules, but none seem to expand into a terminal. Wait, looking back:\n\nNT47 -> 't84' is one of the rules. Yes! NT47 can become 't84'.\n\nSo let's put that together:\n\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78\nNT51 -> NT34 NT69\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\nNT61 -> NT15 NT47\nNT15 -> NT40\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nNow, what about NT78? Let's see:\n\nNT78 -> NT5 NT16\nNT5 -> 't39' (terminal)\nNT16 -> 't28' (terminal)\n\nSo NT78 becomes 't39' 't28' which is 't39t28'. But in our string, we have 't47' and others, but wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the string, the last part is ...t33. Hmm, maybe I need to track the entire string.\n\nWait, but let's go back. Starting from SN4 and S77:\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\n\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78\n\nNT51 -> NT34 NT69\n\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\n\nNT61 -> NT15 NT47\n\nNT15 -> NT40 (terminal)\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nSo, so far, we have 't54' + (NT51 and NT78 expansions). Let's see NT51 NT78.\n\nWait, NT51 -> NT34 NT69. And NT34 -> NT61 NT47. NT61 -> NT15 NT47, which then NT15->'t40', and NT47->'t84'. So for NT51, it's 't40 t84'.\n\nWait, but that would make NT51 = 't40 t84' ??\n\nSimilarly, NT34 becomes 't40 t84'.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me retrace:\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nSo, let's break down each step:\n\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78\n\nNT51 -> NT34 NT69\n\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\n\nNT61 -> NT15 NT47\n\nNT15 -> NT40\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nSo, NT51: NT34 NT69\n\nNT34: NT61 NT47\n\nNT61: NT15 NT47\n\nNT15: NT40\n\nNT47: 't84'\n\nSo, so NT34 becomes NT61 \u2192 NT15 (which is 't40') and NT47 \u2192 't84'\n\nSo NT34 \u2192 't40 t84'\n\nSimilarly, NT69 is another part.\n\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nNT23 -> 't94' (wait, looking back, I don't see NT23 being expanded into a terminal. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT23 has a rule NT23 -> NT73 NT41.\n\nAnd looking at NT73 -> 't9'\n\nAnd NT41 -> 't9'\n\nWait, no. Looking back:\n\nNT73 -> 't9' is a terminal.\n\nNT41 -> 't9' is a terminal.\n\nSo, NT23 -> NT73 NT41, which becomes 't9' 't9' or 't9t9'.\n\nSo, NT69: NT23 NT6\n\nSo, NT23 is 't9t9', and NT6 is 't18' (from rule NT6->'t18').\n\nSo, putting this together, NT69 is 't9t9t18'.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have 't33' towards the end, so maybe I'm not on the right track. Let me make a step-by-step expansion.\n\nLet me retrace:\n\nWe started with S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\n\nSo, first token is 't54'.\n\nThen, S continues with NT77:\n\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78\n\nNT51 -> NT34 NT69\n\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\n\nNT61 -> NT15 NT47\n\nNT15 -> NT40 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nSo, the NT51 part becomes 't40' 't84' \u2192 't40t84'.\n\nNow, NT34 is also part of NT51. Wait, no, NT51 is NT34 NT69. So after NT34 is 't40t84', and NT69 is part of NT51 as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the hierarchy. Let's think differently.\n\nEach non-terminal has a specific expansion. Let's track step by step.\n\nFirst, S becomes NT4 and NT77.\n\nNT4 is 't54'\n\nNT77 breaks into NT51 and NT78.\n\nNT51 breaks into NT34 and NT69.\n\nNT34 breaks into NT61 and NT47.\n\nNT61 breaks into NT15 and NT47.\n\nNT15 breaks into NT40.\n\nNT47 breaks into 't84'.\n\nSo, the expansion for S is 't54' followed by the expansions of NT51 and NT78.\n\nBut NT78 is:\n\nNT78 -> NT5 NT16\n\nNT5 is 't39'\n\nNT16 is 't28'\n\nSo NT78 becomes 't39t28'\n\nSo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It has S as the start symbol, and several non-terminals. The string consists of terminals only, which suggests that each part of the string is produced by terminal productions. So, the idea is to reconstruct the parse tree starting from S, using the given string as a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into segments that match the grammar. The string is: t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t50 t43 t40 t6 t65 t28.\n\nI'll start by looking at the first few symbols. The first symbol is 't54', which in the grammar is a terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT53 -> 't48' is a terminal, and another rule for NT77 -> 't47' and others, but not directly 't54'. Wait, looking again, I see that NT4 -> 't54' and NT1 -> 't3' and so on. So, 't54' must come from the non-terminal NT4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a rule: NT4 -> 't54'. So, the first symbol 't54' can be produced by NT4. That means the start symbol S must derive a production that includes NT4. Looking at the start symbol S's productions: S can go to NT13 NT13 NT69? Wait, no, wait the first line says S-> NT13 NT13 NT69? Or wait, actually, looking again, the first production is S-> NT13 NT13 NT69, no, wait, the way the user presented it is \"S -> NT13 NT13 NT69\", but that's an oddity because it's S with multiple NTs. Wait, actually, the user presented the grammar as lines starting with S -> etc., so perhaps it's:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69? Wait, no, looking again, the first line is \"S -> NT13 NT13 NT69\", but that seems like S produces a sequence of NT13 and NT69, which is a bit confusing. Maybe I misread it. Let me check again:\n\nThe user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69\n\nWait, no, it's S -> NT13 NT13 NT69. Or wait, perhaps the user made a typo, because typically in CNF, S would produce two non-terminals. But here, three. Hmm. Or maybe it's correct but the way it's formatted is different.\n\nWait, I think the user intended each production to be a single rule, so for example, the first line is S -> NT13 NT13 NT69, but that's actually three symbols. But since it's in CNF, each production should be two non-terminals. So maybe the user made a mistake, but let's proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the first production as S -> NT13 NT69, and the rest as other productions. Wait, the user listed S with two options, so perhaps it's:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nor\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nBecause in the user's message, they listed the grammar as:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT13 NT69\n\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo that's two possible productions for S. So each step, S can split into two non-terminals, either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nBut perhaps I need to see how the string starts with t54, which is generated by NT4, as per 't54' comes from NT4.\n\nSo, the first production for S is either NT4 and NT77. Let's see which of these make sense.\n\nBut the string starts with t54, so NT4 is involved. Let's see NT4 produces t54 (from NT4->'t54'), so then the other part would be NT77.\n\nNow, NT77 has a production rule: NT77 -> 't47'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see that NT77 -> NT51 NT78, and then NT51->NT34 NT69, etc. Hmm, that might not directly produce a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps there's a production for NT77 that leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, the NT77 rules include NT77->'t47', no. Let me check. The user provided some rules like NT77 -> 't47' perhaps, but looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n\n- NT77 -> 't50'? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, I see a rule for NT77: Not sure because earlier we had:\n\nNT77: NT77->'t47'\n\nWait, no. Specifically, looking through the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the list of rules, I see lines like:\n\nNT77 -> 't50' and NT77 -> 't47'. Wait, actually, no. Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT77 directly producing a terminal. Instead, NT77 is split into NT51 and NT78. So NT71 is broken down into NT51 -> NT34 NT69, then NT34 might produce something, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nPerhaps another approach is better. Let me try to parse the string step by step, using a top-down approach with the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t50 t43 t40 t6 t65 t28.\n\nEach symbol is derived from a non-terminal, except the terminals themselves. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two non-terminals, which can then be further split.\n\nBut since the string is a sequence of terminals, the parse tree must end with these terminals. So the root (S) must expand into two non-terminals, each of which eventually expand into a single terminal.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps an alternative approach: try to see if the string can be broken down into factors that each correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t54. As I noted, t54 comes from NT4, which has a production rule NT4 -> 't54'.\n\nSo, the start symbol S must derive into NT4 and NT77 (since S can be NT4 NT77). Thus, the string starts with NT4 => t54, and the remaining part after T54 would be the result of NT77 expanding and possibly further splitting.\n\nBut let's see: if S is NT4 NT77, then NT4 gives t54, and NT77 gives a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in a derivation, S would split into NT4 and NT77. NT4 becomes t54. Then NT77 needs to derive the rest of the string, which is t9 t9 t9 t18 t7 t50 t58 t50 t43 t40 t6 t65 t28.\n\nBut does NT77 produce this? Let me check the grammar for NT77.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT77: It has NT77 -> NT51 NT78.\n\nLooking for NT51's production: NT51 -> NT34 NT69.\n\nNT34 -> 't78' (or more accurately, NT34 -> NT61 NT47. Then NT61 -> various, etc. Hmm, but I think this might get too complicated. Let me instead think if there's a way to split the rest of the string into two parts after the initial t54.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string must be formed by expanding S into two non-terminals, each of which expands into the corresponding parts of the string. But the string is a linear sequence, so I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a way to split the string into the two parts that correspond to the initial split of S.\n\nWait, S can be either NT13 NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT13 NT69\n\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, S can split into either three non-terminals in the first case or two non-terminals in the second case. But since this is CNF, each production only splits into two non-terminals.

For example, NT77 has two productions: NT77 \u2192 't47' and another NT77 \u2192 't34'. That's unusual because in Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal should have unique productions. Maybe it's a typo or a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back at the original grammar, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't50'\nNT77 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, the second line says NT77 \u2192 't51' nt78? Or maybe it's a mistake. Wait, in the initial provided grammar, under NT77, it's listed as two rules: one to 't50' and another to 't47'. Probably, that's a mistake because a non-terminal can't have two identical names on the left. Wait no, the user's initial grammar showed two entries for NT77:\n\n1. NT77 \u2192 't51' NT78\n2. NT77 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, no, the initial grammar provided was:\n\nNT77 -> 't50'\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would have two production rules for the same non-terminal. That's against the rules of CNF. Maybe the user made a mistake. But looking back, in the provided grammar, it's:\n\nNT77 -> 't51' NT78\nand\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nWait, I might have misread. Let me go back. The initial grammar in the question is:\n\nUnder NT77: NT77 -> 't50' and NT77 -> 't47'. So that's two rules for the same non-terminal. That's impossible in Chomsky Normal Form. Maybe that's a typo. Perhaps the first was intended to be NT77 -> 't51' NT78, but then it's wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be two different production rules for other non-terminals. Hmm, perhaps it's a mistake. But in any case, for this problem, I'll proceed with the given grammar, assuming that some rules might be redundant or perhaps a typo.\n\nBut since the user is providing this grammar, I'll proceed as is. So, the string to evaluate is `t29 t40 t6 t65 t47 t43 t79 t44 t58 t58 t58 t9 t9 t18`. I'll need to see if this string can be derived from S using the given grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t29, t40, etc. I need to see if these can be derived from any of S's productions.\n\nLet's take each possibility for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nNT13 can produce NT70 NT46, which would lead to t70 and t46.\n\nBut the first token is t29, which doesn't match t70.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT13 produces something else.\n\nWait, let's look at NT13's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT13 appears in several rules, but the initial productions are:\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\nNT13 -> NT32 NT21\nNT13 -> NT12 \u2192 wait, no, looking back, under NT12, it's NT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47. Maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, no, under NT13, it's shown in these rules:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21\n- Also: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nSo, NT13 has two rules: NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21 and NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 is defined as NT23 NT6.\n\nSo, in the first production S \u2192 NT13 NT69, the symbols would be something like (something) (something else).\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is t29. Looking at NT13's rules, it can produce NT32 NT21. Let's see NT32 and NT21's productions.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT61 NT47 (per one of the rules). Then NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45, perhaps.\n\nWait, this might be getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

{"custom_id":"request-238","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine whether the given string `t54 t85 t58 t62 t43 t40 t43 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t58 t43 t28` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar first.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I see that S can produce NT13 NT13 and NT4 NT69. So, the initial step will produce two non-terminals, and then those need to be expanded further.\n\nNow, the string given consists of a sequence of terminals: t54, t85, t58, t62, t43, t40, t43, t84, t9, t9, t18, t7, t58, t43, t28. The length of the string is 15, which is odd. In CNF, each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one (since each non-terminal can only produce two symbols at most). So the length of the string after k steps is 2^k from the start. The initial grammar's start symbol would produce two symbols, so for a string of length n, we need n-1 steps. If the string length is 15, that's an odd number, which in the context of CNF would mean that after an even number of steps, we should have an odd length, but wait, actually, no. Starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each step expands each non-terminal into two, so the number of symbols at each step is 2^k. So the number of symbols must be a power of two. Wait, no\u2014that applies when the grammar only has productions to terminals and non-terminals. But in this case, we have both non-terminals and terminals, so the derivation could result in a string of terminals with length equal to a power of 2. But wait, actually, each production of a non-terminal adds one symbol, either a terminal or another non-terminal each step. So the total length can be any number, but perhaps I should calculate the steps.\n\nWait, the string length is 15, which is not a power of two, so does that automatically mean it's not possible? Wait, no. In a CFG in CNF, each production of a non-terminal increases the number of symbols by one, so starting from one non-terminal (S), after k steps, the number of symbols would be 1 + k. Because each production step replaces one non-terminal with two, but only when you expand all non-terminals, you get 2^k non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the string must be equal to the number of steps plus one. Let me think again. Starting from S, the first expansion gives two non-terminals, say A and B. Each of those can be expanded. For example, if both A and B are expanded, we get four symbols, but if only one is expanded, three symbols. Wait, no\u2014if A is expanded to two terminals and B remains, then we have three terminals. Alternatively, each non-terminal can be expanded as many times as needed, so the total number of terminals can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the derivation tree step by step, starting from S and trying to reach the string. But given that the string is quite long, maybe I should look for the order of terminals and see if each can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal has specific productions, and some of them generate terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT49 \u2192 t40\n- NT53 \u2192 t48\n- NT58 \u2192 t61 (Wait, NT58 \u2192 t61 or t62?)\nWait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking up the given productions:\n\nLooking for terminals in the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT49 \u2192 t40\n- NT53 \u2192 t48\n- NT67 \u2192 t6\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT42 \u2192 t68\n- NT12 \u2192 t81\n- NT34 \u2192 t9\n- NT46 \u2192 t58\n- NT74 \u2192 t47\n- NT32 \u2192 t11\n- NT61 \u2192 t62\n- NT26 \u2192 t42\n- NT15 \u2192 t40\n- NT32 \u2192 t24\n- NT42 \u2192 t60\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT4 \u2192 t65\n- NT61 \u2192 t17\n- NT78 \u2192 t72\n- NT38 \u2192 t47\n- NT83 \u2192 t7\n- NT80 \u2192 t43\n- NT33 \u2192 t85\n- NT78 \u2192 t33\n- NT7 \u2192 t44\n- NT56 \u2192 t31\n- NT76 \u2192 t79\n- NT18 \u2192 t43\n- NT7 \u2192 t23\n- NT56 \u2192 t31 (duplicate)\n- NT16 \u2192 t28\n- NT38 \u2192 t29\n- NT33 \u2192 t85\n\nSo, the terminals in the grammar are t3, t6, t7, t9, t11, t17, t18, t23, t24, t28, t31, t33, t38, t40, t42, t43, t44, t47, t48, t54, t58, t60, t61, t62, t65, t72, t79, t81, t83, t84, t9, t0.\n\nLooking at the given string: t54 t85 t58 t62 t43 t40 t43 t84 t9 t9 t18 t7 t58 t43 t28.\n\nSo each token must correspond to the expansion of a non-terminal. Let's note that the grammar has certain productions that when fully expanded can generate these terminals.\n\nFirst, let me try to see if the string can be broken down according to the available productions.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT13 NT13 or S \u2192 NT4 NT69. Let's consider each case.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT13.\n\nSo the first two symbols must be generated by NT13.

Let's see if t85 is a result of any terminal production. Looking back, yes, NT73 \u2192 t9 and NT78 \u2192 t72. Wait, NT73 is \"t9\"? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, looking for NTs that produce t85. Looking at the list, I see NT73 \u2192 t9 and NT78 \u2192 t72, etc. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong productions.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 t85\n- NT78 \u2192 t72\n- NT73 \u2192 t9\n\nSo t85 is produced by NT33. Therefore, I need to find how NT33 can be derived.\n\nLooking at NT33's productions: NT33 \u2192 NT61 NT47, NT34 NT69, etc.\n\nWait, in the provided list, I see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT61 NT47, NT34 NT69.\n\nSo to produce t85, I need to have NT33 \u2192 t85, but looking at the grammar's productions, NT33 does not directly produce t85.

{"custom_id":"request-240","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string `t29 t40 t6 t54 t47 t40 t43 t79 t44 t58 t58 t58 t9 t9 t18` is generated by the provided grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and the string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if the start symbol can derive this string.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze the structure step by step. Let me start by looking at the start symbol S. From the given grammar, S can produce two different options:\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT13, NT69 or NT4, NT77. Looking at the string, the first token is t29, which doesn't match any of these directly. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Since the grammar is in CNF, S must produce two non-terminals, which then produce other non-terminals until we reach terminal symbols. So, the initial expansion from S would involve these non-terminals, and each of those would expand further.\n\nBut the string starts with t29, so somewhere in the expansion, the intermediate non-terminals must derive to t29. Let me check if the grammar has any production for a non-terminal that directly leads to t29.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41. Then, NT73 \u2192 t9, and NT41 \u2192 t9. Wait, so NT23 would derive t9 t9. Is there a rule that directly links to t29?\n\nWait, I realize that some rules produce terminal symbols. For example, NT42 \u2192 t68, NT13 \u2192 t3, etc. Let me check if any non-terminals directly produce t29. Looking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes t29. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me look at NT29. Does NT29 produce t29? I don't think so. The rule is NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68. So, to get t29, perhaps through a chain of expansions from NT29. Let me see what NT29 produces: it becomes NT42 NT68. Then, NT42 \u2192 t68, and NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69. NT12 \u2192 t81, NT69 \u2192 t4. So, combining, NT29 would produce t68 t81 t4. That doesn't give me t29. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me see the entire string: t29 t40 t6 t54 t47 t40 t43 t79 t44 t58 t58 t58 t9 t9 t18.\n\nThe first token is t29, so I need to see how that can be derived. Since t29 comes from a non-terminal, that non-terminal must produce t29. Looking at the grammar, is there a rule where a non-terminal becomes t29? Checking the rules, I don't see any. So maybe t29 is produced by a chain of expansions. Let me check if any rule leads to t29.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT73 \u2192 t9, NT78 \u2192 t7. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at the production for NT29: NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68. NT42 \u2192 t68, NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69. NT12 \u2192 t81, NT69 \u2192 t4. So NT29 \u2192 t68 t81 t4. Not t29.\n\nWhat about NT46? NT46 \u2192 t58. Not helpful.\n\nWait, NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41. NT73 \u2192 t9, NT41 \u2192 t9. So NT23 \u2192 t9 t9.\n\nWhat about NT47? NT47 \u2192 t84. No.\n\nLooking for any NT that eventually leads to t29. Maybe NT61? Let's see NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45. NT33 \u2192 t85, NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36. NT46 \u2192 t58, NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61. NT56 \u2192 t62, NT61 \u2192 ... Wait, this seems like it's looping. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t29 is derived through another path. Let me think about the possible derivations.\n\nWait, maybe the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT4 NT77, and NT77 \u2192 t47. So from S, we have NT4 and NT77. NT4 \u2192 t54, NT77 \u2192 t47. So, combining, S would derive to t54 t47. But the string starts with t29, not t54. Therefore, the other option: S \u2192 NT13 NT69. NT13 \u2192 t3, NT69 \u2192 t4. So S would derive to t3 t4, which again doesn't start with t29.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the initial step from S can only produce t3 t4 or t54 t47, then any string derived from S must start with one of those combinations. But the string starts with t29, which isn't possible. That would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nBut that can't be the case because the grammar might have more complex derivations. Maybe I'm missing a step where the initial productions expand further, leading to t29. Let's explore this.\n\nFor example, starting from S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which gives t3 t4, but perhaps those t3 and t4 are further expanded through rules that eventually produce other tokens. Wait, but in the start symbol, S \u2192 NT13 NT69, so NT13 and NT69 are the immediate non-terminals that directly derive into other symbols. NT13 \u2192 t3, and NT69 \u2192 t4. So after the initial step, you get t3 t4, which is the end of the derivation. So no further expansion occurs beyond that.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT4 NT77, which leads to t54 t47. Again, two terminal symbols directly, no further expansion.\n\nSo the initial step only produces t3 t4 or t54 t47. Therefore, any string derived from S must start with either t3 t4 or t54 t47. The given string starts with t29, which isn't part of either. Hence, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, but am I considering all possibilities? Let me double-check. Maybe there's a way for some of the non-terminals to expand beyond one step. For example, if a non-terminal can expand into other non-terminals, which then expand further. Let me check if T29 is produced through a chain.\n\nLooking for rules that eventually produce t29. For instance, maybe NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68 \u2192 t68 NT68 \u2192 t68 NT12 NT69 \u2192 t68 t81 NT69 \u2192 t68 t81 t4. No t29 there. Alternatively, is there any NT that produces NT29 in its expansion? It seems none of the rules directly produce t29 from any NT. Therefore, it's impossible for t29 to appear in the string.\n\nSo, conclusion: the string starts with t29, which cannot be derived from any possible expansion of the start symbol S. Therefore, the answer must be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t65 t78 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t40 t6 t65 t40 t43 t65 t28`. \n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the grammar. It's given in CNF, which means each production is either a terminal followed by a non-terminal, or two non-terminals. Each production has a head (left-hand side) and a body (right-hand side) consisting of exactly two symbols for non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLooking at the initial productions:\n- S -> NT13 NT13\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, the start symbol is S, which always expands into two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals then expands further, and so on, until we reach terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, so I'll need to see if it can be generated by expanding S through the given rules.\n\nI'll attempt to build a parse tree for the string step by step. Starting from S, which is S -> NT13 NT13 or S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nLet's pick S -> NT13 NT13 first because the string starts with t65. Looking at the grammar, NT13 can be expanded into NT70 NT46. So, NT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded further. Looking at NT70, the production is NT70 -> NT76 NT7. NT76 is -> NT79 NT7, and NT7 is a terminal 't7'. So, NT70 eventually leads to 't7' via NT76 and NT7.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first 't65' is present, so maybe NT13 expanding to NT70 and then producing a terminal. Looking at NT70's rules, I see NT70 -> NT76 NT7. NT76 can be expanded as NT76 -> NT79 NT7. NT79 is -> NT77 NT6. NT77 can be 't47', which is another terminal. So NT79 produces 't47' and 't7' perhaps? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT77 can be 't47' or produce NT5 NT78. So if NT77 is 't47', then NT76 -> NT79 NT7. And NT79 -> NT77 NT6. So, if NT77 is 't47' (from NT77 -> 't47'), and NT7 is 't7', then NT79 would produce 't47' and 't7'? Wait, no. Wait, for NT77, the production is NT77 -> 't47' or NT5 NT78. So if NT77 is 't47', then it's a terminal. If it's NT5 NT78, it's two non-terminals. But in our case, since the string starts with t65, perhaps we need to follow a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial expansion of S isn't through NT13. Let's see what NT13 can produce. NT13 can be NT70 NT46, and looking at NT70, let's see its rules: NT70-> NT76 NT7. NT76 is NT79 NT7, and NT79 is NT77 NT6. NT77 can be 't47' or NT5 NT78. So, if NT77 is 't47', then NT76 becomes 't47' NT7, which is 't47' 't7'. So NT70 would be 't47' 't7' 't7'?\n\nWait, this might be getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by checking each 't' in the string against the possible terminals produced by the non-terminals. For example, each 't' must correspond to a production being replaced by that terminal.\n\nLet me check the first 't65'. Looking through the productions, I see NT61 -> 't62' or several other rules, and NT4 -> 't54'. Hmm, where does 't65' come from? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't65'. Wait, let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the entries:\n- NT77 -> 't47' and NT5 NT78\n- NT58 -> NT61 NT3, but not terminals\n- NT83 -> 't7' \n- NT9 -> various other non-terminals and 't0' \n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT78 -> 't33' via NT73...\nWait, but I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't65'. Without a production for NT65, it's impossible to have 't65' in the string. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar because there's no rule that allows a non-terminal to expand into 't65'.\n\nSo the answer is 'No' because the string contains 't65' which isn't produced by any of the non-terminals in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, which makes things a bit simpler.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar and the string to see how they might match. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols, where each symbol represents a production that must come from somewhere in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. In Chomsky CNF, S can produce two options:\n1. NT13 NT69\n2. NT4 NT77\n\nSo, S generates two non-terminals. Let's see what each of these produce.\n\nOption 1: NT13 -> NT70 NT46; NT69 -> NT23 NT6.\n\nSo, from the start, S -> NT13 NT69 becomes NT70 NT46 NT23 NT6.\n\nBut wait, I need to parse the string step by step. Each terminal in the string must correspond to the right-hand side of some production.\n\nLooking at the string: t65 t62 t79 t44 t58 t3 t68 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t39 t28.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals, so it must be the result of fully expanding the start symbol S into a sequence of terminals.\n\nStarting from S, which can be NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's try both paths.\n\nFirst, let's explore the S -> NT4 NT77 path because I remember that in the string, there's a 't28' at the end. Looking at the grammar, NT28 is a symbol, but wait, there's a production for NT28? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT77 -> 't47' and NT74 -> 't47', but I don't see NT28 being a terminal. Hmm, unless it's in another production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again. No, I don't see NT28 as a terminal or a production. But the string has 't28' at the end, so if the derivation uses NT28, it must expand to a terminal.\n\nWait, let's look for NT28. Scanning the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through all productions, I spot NT17 -> 't80' and NT23 -> 't73', but not NT28. Maybe the string's 't28' comes from somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the path is via NT4 or another symbol.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the other option first: S -> NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nSo S -> NT70 NT46 NT23 NT6.\n\nNow, let's look at these non-terminals:\n\nNT70: according to the grammar, NT70 -> NT76 NT7. So that's another non-terminal.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Let's try to see if the string can be broken down into the right parts.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last few symbols are t39 t28.\n\nLooking at the grammar, can any non-terminals expand to 't28'? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, NT39 is a production: NT39 -> 't40'.\n\nBut wait, the string ends with t28. So looking for terminal 't28' in the grammar, I don't see it directly. So perhaps the derivation leads to NT28 -> 't28' somehow, but in the grammar provided, none of the productions seem to produce 't28' directly.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Maybe I missed a production that includes 't28'. Let's scan:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT51 -> 't34', NT53 -> more symbols, NT58 -> 't61', NT42-> 't60', NT46-> 't58', NT61-> 't62', NT5-> 't39', etc. No, I don't see any production that ends with 't28'. So maybe the 't28' comes from some non-terminal that eventually produces 't28' through multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't generated by the grammar because the ending 't28' can't be reached. Or maybe the start path I chose isn't correct.\n\nLet me try the other option: S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 -> 't54', so that would be straightforward. So the first symbol would be 't54', but the string starts with 't65', so this path is incorrect. So S can't be this path because the first symbol is t65, not t54.\n\nTherefore, the correct starting path is S -> NT13 NT69.\n\nNow, the sequence starts with N70, N46, etc.\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nSo the expansion is S -> NT70 NT46 NT23 NT6.\n\nNow, looking at each non-terminal:\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\n\nNT46 -> NT84 (from looking at the grammar, wait, I don't see NT46's expansion. Wait, looking back: the grammar has NT46: is there a production for NT46?\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nWait, looking up, the grammar is quite extensive. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT46 in the productions:\n\nYes, here's one: NT46 -> 't58' and another: NT46 -> NT58.\n\nWait, the entry under NT26 says NT26 -> NT42 NT58.\n\nBut for NT46, looking in the grammar: It seems that NT46 has two options: NT46->'t58' or NT46->NT58.\n\nWait, no, looking again, I think I have to check the list again.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check the list again for NT46.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT10 -> NT68 NT58\n\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\n- NT23 -> NT73 NT41\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n\n- NT53 -> 't80'\n\n- NT67 -> 't6'\n\nWait, perhaps I missed NT46's production. Let me check all the productions again more carefully.\n\nWait, I have to look through each production line.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT58 -> NT61 NT3\n\nWait, no. Wait, the line for NT58 is: NT58->'t61'?\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express all the productions to see if I can find NT46.\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nThe line for NT70: NT70 -> NT76 NT7\n\nLine for NT46: Wait, looking at all the production lines, I need to find where NT46 is expanded.\n\nWait, in the list provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the entire list, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me scan carefully.\n\nLooking for NT46:\n\n- Line: NT26 -> NT42 NT58\n\n- Line: NT15 -> NT40\n\n- Line: NT32 -> 't11', etc.\n\nWait, no, it seems that in the initial list, NT46 is not explicitly present as a terminal or production. Wait, but that can't be correct because all CFGs in Chomsky form must have productions, so either as A->BC or A->a. Wait, perhaps I need to make a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar. It's possible that NT46 produces a terminal and another non-terminal. For example, looking at some lines:\n\nHere's a production: NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nSo is there a production for NT46? Let me find:\n\nLooking through the productions again:\n\nHere's one: NT46->'t58'\n\nWait, no, I think I might have missed it. Let me go through each production line:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT69\n\n2. S -> NT4 NT77\n\n3. NT47 -> NT55 NT9? No, wait, looking for NT46.\n\nContinuing:\n\nLooking through all grammar productions:\n\nNT61 -> NT38 NT18\n\nNT5 -> NT83 NT9\n\nNT21 -> NT73 NT53\n\nNT70 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-278","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: `t65 t43 t43 t79 t44 t58 t3 t68 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t72`.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can derive two options: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Both of these start with non-terminals, which will likely expand into other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t65, which is a terminal symbol. I need to check which production rule could produce t65. Looking at the grammar, both S's initial options (NT13 NT69 and NT4 NT77) don't directly produce t65. Instead, each non-terminal may produce other symbols, possibly leading to t65.\n\nLet me check the rules for NT61, as I see NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18, and NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80. Wait, looking back, I see that NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74, and NT74 \u2192 't47', but that might not be relevant here. Hmm, maybe I need to look further.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, NT3 has several options. Let me check NT3: it can produce 't65' directly. So if a non-terminal can produce 't65', that's useful. But looking through all the NTs, I see that NT1 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't54', NT6 \u2192 't18', NT7 \u2192 't44', NT8 \u2192 ... Wait, I don't see any NT directly producing 't65' except possibly NT6. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT3 has 't65' as an option. Yes, \"NT3 -> 't65'\". So if NT3 is somewhere in the derivation, it can produce 't65'.\n\nBut how can we get into NT3? Let's see. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's explore the first option: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Then NT70 can go to NT76 NT7 or NT70 is defined as NT76 NT7. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT70 -> NT76 NT7. Hmm, but 't65' is produced by NT3, so maybe somewhere along the way, one of the non-terminals needs to produce 't65'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace the string step by step, starting from the start symbol and seeing if each part can be derived.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string is a sequence of t65, t43, t43, t79, t44, t58, t3, t68, t29, t6, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t72.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t65. So we need a production that can yield t65. Looking at the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't65', so we need NT3 at some point.\n\nBut the start symbol is S, which can't directly produce t65. So perhaps S can produce something that eventually produces NT3. Let's see S's options:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69\nSo NT13 must expand to something, and NT69 to something else.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nNT70 has several options, like NT63 NT7 or NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, but wait, looking back, I don't see NT63. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 and also NT70 \u2192 't79' (looking at the grammar, yes: \"NT70 -> 't79'\"). So if NT70 can produce t79 directly, that's useful.\n\nSo if we have NT70 -> 't79', that could be a way to get t79, but our string starts with t65.\n\nHmm, perhaps another path. Let's trace from NT13.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nNT70 can be 't79' or maybe another path. Let me see if there's another rule for NT70: \"NT70 -> 't79'\". Yes, so if we take that, NT70 can be t79. But we need t65, so perhaps this isn't the way.\n\nWait, perhaps the other option for NT13. Let me check: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nIf NT70 is 't79', and NT46 can produce something else. So let's see:\n\nSuppose NT70 is 't79', then after that comes NT46. What does NT46 do? Looking at the rules, NT46 \u2192 't47' maybe? Wait, let me check: \"NT46 -> 't47'\". Yes, NT46 can directly produce t47.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT13 NT69, and then NT13 \u2192 't79' (if possible), and NT69 \u2192 ... Let me check NT69.\n\nNT69 has several rules: \"NT69 -> NT23 NT6\" and \"NT69 -> 't43'\". Oh, wait! NT69 can directly produce t43. So S \u2192 NT13 NT69 can derive 't79' (from NT13) and 't43' (from NT69). But the string starts with t65, not t79. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Let's check that. NT4 can produce 't54'; that's NT4 \u2192 't54'. So that would give us 't54' as the first symbol, but the string starts with t65. So maybe that's not the right path either.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the string starts with t65, which is produced by NT3. So perhaps we need a path where S eventually produces a string that leads to NT3. Alternatively, maybe the entire string doesn't start directly from S but rather from another production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has to be split into multiple steps. The string is a series of terminals, so each symbol must be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to build a leftmost derivation. Starting with S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\nSo we have NT13 and NT69. Both are non-terminals, so they need to expand.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\nNT70 can be 't79' or another option. Let me see: \"NT70 -> 't79'\". So if we take that, NT70 becomes t79.\n\nThen NT46 \u2192 't47', as per the rule \"NT46 -> 't47'\".\n\nSo from S \u2192 NT13 NT69, we can get t79 (from NT70) and t47 (from NT46), but the string starts with t65. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if NT46 produces something else. Looking at NT46's rules: \"NT46 -> 't47'\". So only that option. So that path leads to 't79' 't47', which doesn't match the string.\n\nSo perhaps this production isn't the way. Let's try the other option for S: S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54', and NT77 can produce 't47' or another option. Let me check: \"NT77 -> 't47'\". So taking that, NT77 becomes t47.\n\nSo S \u2192 't54' 't47', but the string starts with t65, so that's not matching.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Both options for S seem to start with t54 or t79, neither of which is t65. So maybe the string doesn't start with anything from S, but instead has a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial S expands into a longer sequence that eventually results in the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, which suggests it's derived from a derivation starting at S. But if both options for S don't start with t65, maybe the string starts with another symbol that's not covered by S's initial productions.

So, the grammar provided fits this form, which is good.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals.

So perhaps I need to see how NT13 and NT69 can lead to the first part of the string.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would help, but given the time, I might consider that.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to see if the string can be constructed step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.

Maybe another approach is to see if all the terminals are covered by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: t54, t40, t84, t11, t9, t48, t3, t60, t81, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t47, t47, t28.\n\nThe grammar has NT4 \u2192 't54', which is present.\n\nLooking for t40: Do any NT produce 't40'? Looking through the grammar entries, perhaps NT31 \u2192 't50', but that's t50, not t40. Wait, in the grammar, looking for 't40', I think NT45 \u2192 something. Wait, no. Let me see the grammar lines again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, 't40' doesn't appear as a terminal directly. Wait, no: NT1 \u2192 't3', NT6 \u2192 't18', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't54', NT3 \u2192 't65', but perhaps I'm missing 't40'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines, perhaps I don't see a direct production for 't40'.

The string is `t54 t17 t47 t40 t43 t79 t23 t58 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t33`. \n\nFirst, let's recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) consists of rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. The CNF has a specific structure, which makes it easier to analyze, especially for parsing.\n\nThe given grammar has several production rules starting with S, NT13, NT47, etc., and many of them end up producing terminal symbols (like 't54', 't17', etc.), which are probably the leaf nodes. The production rules that produce terminals seem to indicate the possible tokens in the generated language.\n\nMy approach will be to try to derive the given string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is binary, either generating two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, to generate the string, the number of symbols should match in a certain way.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens. Since the starting symbol S produces two non-terminals (S -> NT13 NT69, for example), each step should double the number of symbols or reduce them. But since the grammar has rules that produce terminals, we can build up the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work from the string backwards, using a top-down approach with the grammar, attempting to match the string to the productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the string. The first token is 't54', which I suspect comes from a rule where the non-terminal generates 't54'. Looking at the grammar, I see a production NT56 -> 't50' and NT77 -> 't47'. So, for instance, 't54' might come from a different non-terminal, perhaps NT4? Wait, let's check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT41 -> 't9', NT4 -> 't54', NT1 -> 't3', etc. So NT4 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't54'. So in the string, the first token 't54' would be generated by NT4. So that would mean that in the derivation, there should be a production where NT4 leads to 't54'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, I see NT4 -> 't54'. Yes, that's one of the rules. So the first token in the string is 't54', which is directly produced by NT4. So that gives me a hint that perhaps the derivation starts from NT4.\n\nBut wait, the starting symbol is S, so we have to see how S can lead to NT4 somewhere. So S -> NT13 NT69. So S can be split into two non-terminals. Let's see if either of those can be NT4.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT47 -> NT56 NT3, but NT4 doesn't appear in that. Wait, the start production is S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. Oh! Wait, that's a key point. The second production of S is S -> NT4 NT77. So S can directly produce NT4 followed by NT77. So if the first token is NT4, which gives 't54', then the next must be NT77, which produces 't47'. Because in the production S -> NT4 NT77, the first part is NT4 (t54) and the second is NT77 (t47). So the first two tokens 't54' 't47' would correspond to S -> NT4 NT77. That's a possibility.\n\nBut the actual string starts with 't54', then 't17', not 't47'. Hmm, that creates a problem because if the first two tokens are 't54' followed by something else, not 't47', then the initial assumption that S -> NT4 NT77 might not hold.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not the first two tokens but a longer sequence that's part of the derivation. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach is to work backwards from the string, trying to match each token with a production.\n\nLooking at the string: t54, t17, t47, t40, t43, t79, t23, t58, t58, t3, t68, t81, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t33.\n\nLet me start with the last token, which is 't33'. Looking at the grammar, which production produces 't33'? Scanning through, I see NT33 -> 't85' (no) and another production NT61 -> t62, which is not it. Wait, actually, I don't see a production that directly produces 't33' from a non-terminal. Hmm, that might be a problem. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't33' directly. So that suggests that perhaps the last token in the string can't be the direct result of any production, which would mean the string might not be part of the language. But wait, maybe I missed a rule.\n\nWait, I see a production for NT61 -> t62. Hmm, but not t33. Maybe I made a mistake in scanning. Let me check all the rules again for terminals.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT17 -> t80\nNT23 -> t73\nNT4 -> t54\nNT80 -> t43\nNT78 -> t33\nNT63 -> not there, wait no, let me check again...\n\nWait, looking for 't33' in the productions:\n\nLooking through, yes, I see NT78 -> t33. So NT78 can produce 't33'. So the last token can come from NT78 -> t33. So before 't33', the previous symbol must have been NT78.\n\nSo in the string, before 't33', it's 't18'. So the string ends with 't18 t33'. If 't33' is from NT78, then the symbol before must be NT78. So in the derivation, that would be NT78 -> 't33'. The rule before that might be NT78 -> something else? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT78 is defined as NT5 followed by something. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nI see NT78 -> 't33' and also NT78 is mentioned in other rules like `NT61 -> NT18 NT18` and others. So the rule for NT78 is `NT78 -> 't33'`. So yes, NT78 produces 't33', so in the string, the last token 't33' must come from NT78.\n\nSo before that, the string is ... 't18' 't33'.\n\nSo we have ... nt18 -> 't33'. Looking at the grammar, where is 't18' produced? Looking through the rules:\n\nI see NT12 -> 't81', NT45 -> ... , etc.\n\nWait, NT80 -> t43, NT18 -> t43 as well. Wait no, NT18 is an NT (non-terminal) and has a production `NT18 -> NT49 NT80`. So to get 't18', it's part of a production of another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Sorry, let's make this precise.\n\nThe string is ... 't18', then 't33'. So 't18' must come from the production of the corresponding non-terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for where 't18' appears as a terminal. I see:\n\n- NT67 -> 't6'\n- NT18 is a non-terminal and has a production `S->NT18...`, but in the rules provided, I don't see any production for NT18 -> 't18' directly.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, yes:\n\nLooking at NT18: `NT18 -> NT49 NT80`. That's one production for NT18, but does it produce 't18'? No, I don't see NT18 directly producing 't18'; instead, I see that NT18 is a non-terminal that leads to two other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps 't18' comes from another production, such as S->NT18 NT9 or something similar. Let me check:\n\nYes, S has productions like S -> NT18 NT9. So NT18 is a non-terminal that can be part of a production.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in a context-free grammar, each non-terminal symbol can be replaced by the right-hand side of the productions. The start symbol here is S, and it can generate different sequences through these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two options: S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. So the string will start with either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let me write that down.\n\nThe string starts with `t47`. I need to see which non-terminal symbols can produce a 't' and whether they can produce 't47'. Looking at the productions, I see NT47 -> 't47' and NT77 -> 't47'. So somewhere in the derivation, we'll get 't47', but how does it fit into the string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t47 t40 t6 ...`, so the first part is 't47'. Let me think about how the start symbol can produce this.\n\nIf S is the start, it can go to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's say it picks S -> NT13 NT69 because that production could lead to more non-terminals that might produce 't47' somewhere.\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46. So NT13 is replaced by NT70 and NT46. Let me check those. NT70 -> NT76 NT7. If I go down that, NT76 -> NT79 (from S->NT70... wait, actually looking at the productions, NT76 -> 't79' (for S->NT76 NT7 but I think I'm mixing up the productions. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT76 is in S->NT76 NT7. And the productions for NT76 and NT7 are: NT76 -> 't79' and NT7 -> 't23' (from another production). So, for example, NT76 can be directly replaced by 't79', and NT7 can be replaced by 't23'. But in the production for NT70, it's NT70 -> NT76 NT7. So that would produce 't79' and 't23', which would make 't79 t23', but in the string, we have 't47 t40 t6 t54 ...', so maybe I'm going the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if S can produce a 't47' in the beginning. Looking at the grammar, S can go to NT4 NT77. NT77 has productions: NT77 -> 't47' and NT51 NT78. So if S uses the production S -> NT4 NT77, then the first symbol would be the result of NT4 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT4 -> 't54' and NT77 -> 't47'. So combining these, S -> NT4 NT77 would produce 't54 t47' as the first two symbols. But in the string, the first symbol is 't47', not 't54', so that can't be the case. Therefore, the other option is S -> NT13 NT69.\n\nSo the string starts with `t47`, which must come from a production that directly gives t47. Looking at NT13, it's NT13 -> NT70 NT46. Then NT70 -> NT76 NT7, which can go to 't79' and 't23', making 't79 t23', which doesn't help. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not following the entire derivation correctly. Let me try building the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t47 t40 t6 t54 t29 t40 t43 t29 t40 t43 t79 t23 t58 t58 t43 t18`.\n\nI need to see if each 't' can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, which can be divided into NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let me pick NT47, because the string starts with t47, but wait: the only way to get t47 is through NT47, but NT47 is under NT13 or NT77.\n\nWait, no. NT47 is a non-terminal that directly produces t47. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT47 and NT77 have the 't' options:\n\n- NT47: NT47 -> 't47' (and maybe other options if any)\n- NT77: NT77 -> 't47' and NT51 NT78.\n\nSo for NT47, each instance of NT47 in the derivation can produce 't47' directly, which is what we see at the beginning of the string.\n\nSo maybe the derivation is such that S produces NT13 NT69, and NT13 produces NT70 NT46, and so on until we reach a point where NT47 is used, producing t47.\n\nBut let's try to map out a possible derivation path that would generate the string incrementally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can construct the parse tree.\n\nLet me try seeing if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t47. So the first production to use must be either S->NT13 NT69 or S->NT4 NT77, but the first 't' is t47, which doesn't come from NT13 or NT4 directly.\n\nWait, maybe the first step is S->NT13 NT69, and then NT69 is replaced by 't6', since looking at the grammar, NT69 -> 't6'. So that would give the first symbol as 't6', but the string starts with 't47', so that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the non-terminals. Let me clarify: when the productions are given as, for example, NT13 NT46, each of those NT13 and NT46 are independent symbols that can be expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each symbol in the string and how they could come from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t47, t40, t6, t54, t29, t40, t43, t29, t40, t43, t79, t23, t58, t58, t43, t18.\n\nEach of these tX must come from a production where a non-terminal directly produces 'tX'. So, for example, t47 comes from NT47, t40 from NT40, t6 from NT6, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for each tX, I need to check if there is a non-terminal NTn that directly produces 'tX'.\n\nLet's list the tX in the string along with their possible NTs:\n\nt47: NT47\nt40: NT40\nt6: NT6\nt54: NT54\nt29: NT29\nt43: NT43\nt79: NT79\nt23: NT23\nt58: NT58\nt18: NT18\n\nNow, let's check if each of these has a production in the grammar.\n\nt47: Yes, NT47 -> 't47'.\nt40: Yes, NT40 -> 't40'.\nt6: Yes, NT6 -> 't6'.\nt54: Yes, NT54 exists and NT54 -> 't54'.\nt29: Yes, NT29 -> 't29'.\nt43: Yes, NT43 -> 't43'.\nt79: Look for NT79. Checking the grammar, NT61->'t71', but where does NT79 come from? Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT79 that directly produces 't79'. Wait, maybe NT79 is a non-terminal that can produce something else, but in the given grammar, the only symbol that produces 't79' is NT76->'t79' (in S->NT76 NT7). So perhaps my list is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check all productions to see if 't79' is produced by any NT.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT76 -> 't79'\n- Is there any NT that directly produces 't79'?

{"custom_id":"request-335","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t65 t17 t47 t43 t79 t44 t58 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t47 t47 t28.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it means each production rule has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Since there are a lot of rules here, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I see it can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Both of these seem to be combinations of non-terminals that will be expanded further into terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t65, so I look at the rules for 't65'. From the given grammar, I see T36 -> t65. So 't65' is the terminal produced by NT36. So, I need to find a way for S to derive NT36 somehow, but S can't produce NT36 directly because all S production paths involve either NT13 or NT4. Hmm, maybe I need to see if the non-terminals in the string can connect back to S.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think step by step. Since all the rules are split into pairs of non-terminals, perhaps we can model this as a binary string, where each terminal comes from a production step.\n\nThe string length is 21 tokens, which is an odd number, meaning it's possible because each production step could double the string length, except for the initial S. Wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production produces two symbols, so starting from S, the derivation would produce two non-terminals at each step. Unless there's a production that produces a terminal and a non-terminal, but no, all are two-terminals.\n\nWait no, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols, either both non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal. So in this case, the start symbol S can only produce two non-terminals. So the entire derivation would build a binary tree structure, with each node being a non-terminal that splits into two children, which could be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, which must correspond to a leftmost derivation or rightmost. So to check if the string is in the language, I can try to parse it using the grammar, making sure each terminal is generated correctly from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is given, perhaps there's a way to see which non-terminals correspond to which terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t65. T36 is the production for t65. So, t65 comes from NT36. So, in the derivation, somewhere in the leftmost expansion, we must have NT36. Now, what does NT36 produce? Looking at the rules, NT36 -> NT46 NT61. So, from NT36, we get two non-terminals: NT46 and NT61.\n\nNow, looking at the string, after t65, the next is t17. So, that would have to come from NT46. Let's check NT46's production. NT46 -> t58. So, t17 must be from NT46's production. But NT46 only has one terminal, t58. Wait, that can't be. Oh, wait, nt46's production is t58, but the next token is t17, which is different. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misassigned. Maybe t17 comes from another non-terminal. Let me double-check the string. The string is: t65 t17 t47 t43 t79 t44 t58 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t47 t47 t28.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. t65 is from NT36, which splits into NT46 and NT61. So the next two tokens should be the expansions of NT46 and NT61. \n\nLooking at the string: after t65, we have t17, t47, t43, etc. Wait, no, the string is a single sequence without spaces, so each token is consecutive. So after t65 is t17, then t47, etc. So I need to see if t17 can be from either NT46 or NT61.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the non-terminals split into two parts, which generate two tokens in the string. So perhaps t65 is from the first part, and then the next two tokens are the expansion of the second part. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's map the string to the grammar by finding corresponding non-terminal productions.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t65\n2. t17\n3. t47\n4. t43\n5. t79\n6. t44\n7. t58\n8. t58\n9. t3\n10. t68\n11. t81\n12. t9\n13. t9\n14. t18\n15. t9\n16. t9\n17. t18\n18. t47\n19. t47\n20. t28\n\nStarting from S, which produces NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me consider both options.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT13 NT69\n\nSo, NT13 needs to derive into the first part of the string, and NT69 into the second.\n\nNT13's production is NT70 NT46. Then NT70 produces NT76 NT7. NT76 is NT79, and NT7 is a terminal t44.\n\nSo let's try to see if this can fit. The first part after S would be NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\n\nNT76 -> NT79\n\nNT79 -> ? Wait, in the rules, I don't see NT79 producing a terminal. Looking through all the rules, I don't see NT79 anywhere except appearing as a result of some production. Wait, looking again, NT77 -> t47, NT74->t47, etc. No, there's no NT79 in the rules except as an input to a production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rules. Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking for NT79: It seems there's a NT77 -> t47, NT70->NT76 NT7, etc. No, there is no NT79 in the non-terminals except when NT79 isn't listed as a result, so maybe I misread the rules.\n\nWait, the rules given include:\n\nNT77 -> 't47', NT5 -> 't39', etc.\n\nHmm, but I don't see NT79 being defined. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me look through all the rules:\n\nAh, looking at the rules:\n\nNT77 -> t47\n\nSo, no NT79. So perhaps NT79 doesn't exist, meaning that may not be the right path. So maybe S doesn't produce NT13 NT69.\n\nLet's try the other option: S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nSo NT4 produces t54, but that's a terminal, and NT77 produces t47.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t65, not t54. So that can't be right either. Because S produces NT4 and NT77, which would expand to t54 and t47. So the first two tokens would be t54 t47, which doesn't match the string starting with t65 t17.\n\nSo that's a problem. So S can't produce NT4 NT77 because that starts with t54, but our string starts with t65. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because the start symbol's productions don't lead to t65 as the first symbol.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-338","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string `t65 t43 t43 t79 t44 t58 t3 t60 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t7 t58 t71 t28` is generated by the given CFG. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the terminals are the tXX tokens, I need to track how the string can be broken down.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have rules that expand directly to 'tN', which are terminals. For example:\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n- NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n\nSo starting from S, I can expand it into NT13 and NT69, which then expand further, and each of those might eventually reach terminal symbols.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens. Each production from a non-terminal to two terminals would take 2 tokens, so I need to see if the entire string can be divided into a sequence of such steps.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Maybe I'll build a parse tree or try to see the structure.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t65, t43, t43, then t79. Let's see how these could be linked. Maybe the first two non-terminals are S \u2192 NT13 and NT69. So NT13 might produce t43 and something else, then NT69 might produce t65 and something else.\n\nWait, looking at NT13's rules:\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nBut NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\nAnd NT76 \u2192 t79 \nSo NT70 can produce t76 NT7, but NT7 is 't44'. Wait, no, NT7 \u2192 t44? Let me check. Looking at the grammar, yes, NT7 \u2192 t44.\n\nSo NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 \u2192 t79 t44. But in the string, after t65 comes t43 t43, then t79 t44. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the first part of the string: t65 t43 t43. Maybe that's the result of two S productions. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the productions again, S can be NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT77.\n\nNT47 might produce t84 when expanded, but in the string, I don't see t84, so perhaps that path isn't used. Instead, maybe S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo NT13 could produce t43 NT46, as per NT46 \u2192 t58? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list out the possible expansions.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to see each production step and track how many symbols are added. Each non-terminal expansion adds either a terminal or continues to produce more non-terminals. But for the string to be generated, each t token must come from a direct production, while non-terminals must expand into other non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: count the number of non-terminals in the string and see how many steps of expansion are needed. Let's consider that each production reduces the count of non-terminals by one, as each non-terminal becomes two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but each S production starts with two non-terminals. So the top level is two non-terminals, and each subsequent expansion would replace each non-terminal with two, so the total number of symbols might increase by one each time until all non-terminals are expanded.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to work backwards from the string to see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nLet me try that. Starting with the string, can I replace any two consecutive tokens that form the result of a production?\n\nLooking at the string: t65 t43 t43 t79 t44 t58 t3 t60 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t7 t58 t71 t28.\n\nLooking for any two consecutive tokens that match a production's RHS.\n\nFirst, check if the first two tokens, t65 t43, match any production. Looking through the grammar, does any non-terminal's RHS produce t65 and t43?\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT60 \u2192 NT38 NT18, which becomes t38 t18. Hmm, but not matching. NT3 is 't65' as per NT3 \u2192 t65. Wait, perhaps.\n\nWait, looking at NT38, it's 't7', and NT3 is 't65'. So if I have NT3, it would produce t65, but not in pairs.\n\nAnother look: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. NT70 \u2192 t79 t44, but that gives t79 t44, which are in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps t79 is from NT76 \u2192 t79, and t44 is NT7 \u2192 t44.\n\nSo perhaps part of the string is generated by NT70. Then NT70 \u2192 t79 t44, which are positions 3-5 in the string: t79 t44 t58 ... Hmm, the original string after S expands into two parts, so maybe the first expansion is NT13 producing NT70 and NT46. NT70 then becomes t79 t44, which are the 3rd and 4th tokens.\n\nBut in the string, it's t65 t43 t43 t79... Wait, the initial expansion would be S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which would expand into something like A B, which could be terminals or non-terminals. If A and B are terminals, they each take one token; if they are non-terminals, each could expand into more.\n\nWait, maybe I should track the entire expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for any possible way the string can be split into a sequence that matches the grammar.\n\nAnother thought: the string length is 20 tokens. Each production either keeps the same count or increases by one. Starting from S, each S \u2192 NT NT would create a two-token expansion. As we expand, more tokens are added.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach: count the number of symbols in the string. If every time a non-terminal is expanded, it adds one more symbol, then the total number of symbols must match 2^(n) -1, where n is the number of productions, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the initial S is one symbol. Each S production splits into two, so after the first expansion, we have two symbols. Then each of those symbols can expand into two, doubling the count each time until they reach terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the count increases, but not necessarily in a way that fits 2^n. For example, starting from S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which would be two symbols. Then each of those could expand further.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be built step by step.\n\nLooking for two consecutive tokens that form a known production's RHS.\n\nLooking through the productions to find matching terminals pairs.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT76 produces t79 and NT7 produces t44. So 't79 t44' is the production for NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, which becomes 't79 t44' after expanding.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 \u2192 t58, as per NT46 \u2192 't58'.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nNT46 \u2192 t58. So 't58' is a terminal from NT46.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't60' as a terminal: NT60 \u2192 t38 t18, but that's two tokens, but the string has a single 't60'? Wait, no, looking at the string, after t58 comes t3, which is 't3' \u2192 NT3 \u2192 t65. Wait, no, the string has 't3' as a separate token.\n\nWait, in the string, 't60' appears as a single token, but looking at the productions, NT60 \u2192 t38 t18, which are two terminals. So 't60' in the string would have to come from a different expansion path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me list the productions:\n\nLooking for two tokens in the string that match the RHS of any production. Let's go through the entire string step by step.\n\nSo the string is:\n\n1: t65\n\n2: t43\n\n3: t43\n\n4: t79\n\n5: t44\n\n6: t58\n\n7: t3\n\n8: t60\n\n9: t47\n\n10: t6\n\n11: t9\n\n12: t9\n\n13: t18\n\n1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-354","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing, like in the CYK algorithm, but for me, the key point is that each production can only generate two symbols at a time, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's already in CNF because each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminal productions, which are only a single terminal. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t65 t40 t84 t29 t40 t43 t11 t9 t48 t58 t3 t68 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t33`.\n\nI notice that each token is either a terminal like 'tX' or a non-terminal. In the grammar, non-terminals are uppercase letters like S, NT1, NT30, etc. Terminals are strings starting with 't' followed by a number or single letter.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be derived by the given grammar. One approach is to start from the start symbol and see if we can build the string step by step. However, since the string is quite long, it's better to parse it and see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the right productions.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this systematically?\n\nIn CNF, any derivation tree corresponds to a parse tree where each internal node has exactly two children. So each step in the parse would involve breaking down symbols into their constituent parts.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to simulate a parsing process. Since each production can only split into two symbols, I can try to read the string from the end and see if it can be parsed backward.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree where each node requires two children. Starting from the string, I need to group the symbols into pairs that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a more manageable approach is to try to match the string with the grammar by looking for possible productions that generate the given tokens.\n\nLet me list the terminal tokens in the string in order: t65, t40, t84, t29, t40, t43, t11, t9, t48, t58, t3, t68, t29, t6, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t33.\n\nI need to see if these can be generated by the grammar. Let's look at the grammar and see which productions can generate each of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- t3 appears in NT4 -> t3, so if NT4 is derived, it can produce t3.\n- Similarly, t54 is in NT4 -> t54.\n- But in the string, the first token is t65. Hmm, t65 isn't a terminal in the grammar. The grammar's terminals are things like t3, t5, etc. Wait, looking back, the last productions are things like NT34 -> t78, NT53 -> t48, among others, so some terminals are generated by non-terminals like NT34, NT53, etc.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has some production rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example, NT5 -> t39, NT4 -> t54, etc. So each of these non-terminals can generate certain terminals.\n\nSo in the string, we have several 't' terms that must be generated by the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nSo first, let's identify which terminals in the string are generated by which non-terminals.\n\nThe string is: t65 t40 t84 t29 t40 t43 t11 t9 t48 t58 t3 t68 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t33.\n\nSo the order is:\n\n1. t65\n2. t40\n3. t84\n4. t29\n5. t40\n6. t43\n7. t11\n8. t9\n9. t48\n10. t58\n11. t3\n12. t68\n13. t29\n14. t6\n15. t9\n16. t9\n17. t18\n18. t9\n19. t9\n20. t18\n21. t33\n\nI need to see if each of these terminals corresponds to a non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\n- NT18 -> t43\n- NT10 -> t68\n- NT17 -> t80\n- etc.\n\nBut looking for each terminal, let me see:\n\n- t65: Where does this come from?

It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. So each production either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal. Terminals are represented by the 't' followed by numbers, like 't3', 't50', etc. Non-terminals are all the other symbols like S, NT13, NT47, etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So any valid derivation must start with one of these two combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't54', which I know from the grammar rules. Let me check which non-terminal produces 't54'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT4 produces 't54'. So the first rule used must be one of the rules for NT4.\n\nLooking at the NT4 production, it's NT4 -> 't54' and other non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, the rule for NT4 is in the grammar. Let me check: \n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT46 -> 't58', NT41 -> 't9', NT5 -> 't39', and so on. But I also saw that NT34 -> 't78'. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT49 -> 't40', NT31 -> 't50', NT5 -> 't39', NT42 -> 't68', etc. But specifically, I see NT46 -> 't58' and NT15 -> 't40'. Also, NT2 -> 't71' (though 't71' isn't in the string, so maybe that's not relevant here). \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me look at the rules more carefully. The string has 't54', 't40', etc. \n\nLooking again, I notice NT26 -> 't42' and NT42 -> 't68'. Wait, but in the rules, NT42 is one of the non-terminals. Let me check the NT42 production: NT42 -> 't68'. So any occurrence of 't68' in the string would be generated by NT42.\n\nAlso, I see NT18 -> 't43' twice in the string. So where does NT18 produce 't43'? Looking at the rules, NT18 is -> NT43, I think. Wait, no: looking through the rules, I see NT48 is derived from something else. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me check for NT18.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT18 -> 't43'? Let me scan the list: \n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT18 -> 't43' explicitly. Instead, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT58 -> 't31'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should map all the terminal productions to understand which non-terminals produce them.\n\nHere's a list:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT17 -> 't80'\n- NT34 -> 't78'\n- NT70 -> 't79' (if I remember correctly, in the rules, NT70 produces 't79')\n- NT32 -> 't11'\n- NT34 -> 't9' (Wait, that might be incorrect. Looking back: NT34's rule is 't78', but also other rules may produce 't9'. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.)\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the rule numbers with the non-terminals. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me create a dictionary mapping each non-terminal to its productions. For example, for each non-terminal, list the right-hand sides which can be produced, either as non-terminals or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about each symbol in the string and see if there's a path from the start symbol S to that sequence.\n\nThe string is: t54 t40 t6 t65 t43 t29 t43 t79 t23 t58 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t72\n\nThis is quite long. Since the grammar is in CNF, the maximum length of a string with n steps is 2^n. However, this string is 21 symbols long, so n would be around log2(21) which is about 5, so the maximum string length is 32. So 21 is possible.\n\nBut I need to see if each symbol can be derived by some path from S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol: 't54'. From the grammar, I find that NT46 -> 't58', but I also see NT49 -> 't40', NT31 -> 't50', NT42 -> 't68', and I know NT43 is a rule that may produce 't65', etc.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT4 -> 't54'. So the first symbol 't54' must come from NT4. So S must produce NT4 NT77. So the first step is S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nNow, let's decompose this further. NT4 is 't54', so that's done. Now, the next symbol is 't40'. Let's look at how 't40' is produced. Looking through the rules, I find NT49 -> 't40', and perhaps NT15 -> 't40', and NT42 -> 't68' doesn't produce 't40'. So which non-terminals produce 't40'?\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT15 -> 't40'\n\nAre there others? Let me check: in the rules, I see NT54 -> 't40'? No, wait:\n\nWait, the rules say NT58 -> 't31', etc. Hmm, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, in the initial problem statement, the grammar is given as a list. Let me parse through the rules methodically.\n\nThe top-level rules are S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. So during the first expansion, the derivation starts with S, and that can split into NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nIn our case, the first symbol is 't54', which comes from NT4 -> 't54', so that path is chosen. So the first step is S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nNow, looking at the second symbol 't40'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't40'.\n\nFrom the rules, NT49 -> 't40' and NT15 -> 't40'. Let's check if NT15 can be present in the productions.\n\nLooking at NT15: in the given grammar, I don't see a production for NT15. Wait, wait, let me confirm. The given rules are:\n\nNT58 -> 't31'\n\nNT32 -> 't11'\n\nNT36 -> 't36'? Or something else? Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's look for 't40' production. From the given rules:\n\n- NT49: NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT15: I'm not seeing NT15 being produced as 't40'; perhaps I missed it. Let me check: \n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT15 as a rule. So perhaps only NT49 can produce 't40'. So after NT4, the next symbol must come from NT49 or some other non-terminal that produces 't40'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking through the production rules, do any of the NTs produce 't40'?\n\nYes, in the given grammar, I see NT49 -> 't40' and NT15 -> 't40'? Wait, no. Looking through:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39' (line 2: NT5 -> 't39')\n- NT49 is in production line 4: NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT15: Hmm, looking at the rules, the lines after that show NT15? Let me count:\n\nThe rules start with S -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Or is it S \u2192 NT13 NT13? Wait no, looking back, the grammar is written as S \u2192 NT13 NT13, yes. So S is NT13 followed by NT13, each contributing something.\n\nSo the string has two 't65's, which correspond to NT1 \u2192 t3 leads to t3, which is 't3'. Wait, no, 't65' is a terminal. Hmm, looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t65? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't47', 't34'\n- NT78 \u2192 't5', 't16'\n- NT79 \u2192 't79' maybe?

Let me see:\n\nLooking for t65: Do any NTs produce t65?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t9 \u2192 no, that's NT73 \u2192 t9\n- NT78 \u2192 t5, t16\n- NT62 \u2192 't71' (from NT62 \u2192 't71')\nWait, wait: Looking again at the grammar, NT4 \u2192 t54? No, perhaps I missed that.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the list, I think I have to check each production for when it produces a terminal that's one of the tX in the string.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce t65 or other terms in the string.\n\nWait, the string contains t65, t17, t84, t9, t9, t18, t42, t85, t58, etc.\n\nLet me check each of these terminals and see if they are directly produced by some NT or if they come from deeper productions.\n\nFirst, t65: Let me see which NTs produce 't65'. Looking through, I don't see any NT \u2192 t65. Wait, but hold on, some non-terminals may produce other NTs that in turn produce t65. Maybe t65 comes from a production where an NT that leads to it is somehow generated.\n\nBut wait, checking the NT productions, the only way to get 't65' is if a non-terminal directly produces it. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, I don't see any 't65' in the productions. Hmm, that's a problem because if t65 is in the string, it must come from a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking. Let me re-express all productions that have terminals:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t9\n- NT73 \u2192 t9\n- NT34 \u2192 t78\n- NT56 \u2192 t31\n- NT32 \u2192 t11\n- NT26 \u2192 t42\n- NT15 \u2192 t40\n- NT32 \u2192 t24\n- NT42 \u2192 t60\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT18 \u2192 t43\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT53 \u2192 t48, t47, etc.\n\nWait, hold on, some seem to produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT53 \u2192 't48', 't47'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some where the right-hand side has both NT and 't'X. Wait, looking again, some rules have a mix, like NT53 \u2192 't48' or 't47', meaning that if we choose the first production, it's 't48', else 't47'.\n\nWait, but the string has 't65' as the first element. I don't see any NT in the grammar that directly produces 't65'. So does that mean it's impossible? Because if the grammar doesn't produce 't65', then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking back at all the productions for non-terminals, I don't see any that produce 't65'. So, if 't65' is in the string, it must be generated by a NT that can produce it. But since there's no NT that directly produces 't65', the only possibility is that 't65' comes from another NT.\n\nWait, no, because the productions are only rules that produce either NT or terminals. So unless some NT can derive to 't65', it's impossible. But if no NT does that, then the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, that's only if all rules are non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar, maybe 't65' comes from a different NT that I overlooked.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps in NT77 \u2192 't47', 't34'... but t47 and t34 are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which NTs can produce 't62', since in the string, there are t62's.\n\nWait, looking through, I see NT74 \u2192 't47', and NT58 \u2192 't61'. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each NT's production for terminals:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT2 \u2192 Not a production in the given grammar, but in the grammar list, we see NT34 \u2192 t78, etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT5 \u2192 t39, t42, etc.\nWait, actually, looking at the given grammar list:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-399","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is: \n\n`t65 t17 t29 t43 t11 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t58 t3 t68 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t72`\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, indicated by '...' followed by a terminal. For example, NT4 -> 't54' means that NT4 is a terminal 't54'.\n\nSo, the strategy is to try to parse the string using the grammar's productions. Parsing techniques like recursive descent or using a parsing table might be helpful, but since the grammar is small and structured, maybe a top-down approach could work.\n\nLet me list out all the productions that directly map to terminals, which are the base cases. The productions listed with '...' indicating terminals are:\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT67 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT34 -> 't9'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT74 -> 't47'\n- NT32 -> 't11'\n- NT42 -> 't60'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT61 -> 't62'\n- NT78 -> 't72'\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT58 -> 't61'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT38 -> 't47'\n- NT83 -> 't7'\n- NT80 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT56 -> 't56' (wait, no, wait. Wait, looking back, some productions might overlap. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let's go through the productions again carefully. Some seem to produce terminals immediately, others might not. But for now, focusing on the ones that directly produce terminals is a good start.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, and the grammar must have a derivation from the start symbol S to this string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two productions: S -> NT13 NT13 ... 't69' (I think, but let me check the grammar again. Wait, S can produce NT13 NT69\u2014wait no, looking at the grammar, actually, the first production is S -> NT13 NT13 (wait no, the first line is \"S -> NT13 NT13\" with some 13s? Or is it a typo? Let me check the user's grammar:\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\n... and so on.\n\nWait, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13?\n\nWait, no, the first line as written is: \"S -> NT13 NT13\" but when I look, the user's grammar starts with:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT13 NT13 NT69 \u2014 No, wait, checking again:\n\nActually, in the initial grammar, the first two productions are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, S can produce either NT13 NT13 or NT4 NT77.\n\nTherefore, any valid string must start with either two NT13s or one NT4 and one NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't65'. Now, looking at the productions, which non-terminals produce 't65'?\n\nLooking through the list, 't65' is produced by:\n\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n\nSo the first part of the string must be derived from either NT3 or NT4. Let's see.\n\nIf the string starts with 't65', the first token is 't65', so that could come from either NT3 or NT4.\n\nNow, moving to the second token, which is 't17'.\n\nI need to check which non-terminals produce 't17'. Looking through the productions, 't17' is produced by NT17, which has a production: NT17 -> 't80'. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking for 't17' in the productions.\n\nWait, in the list, some are missing. Let me check carefully. The productions that directly produce terminals include:\n\nNT17 -> 't80'\n\nSo NT17 produces 't80', but in the string, the second token is 't17', which is not 't80'. So perhaps that's a mistake. Or did I miss any?\n\nWait, in the grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT17 -> 't80'\n\nWhich would mean that NT17 directly produces 't80', but in the string, the second token is 't17', which is a problem because 't17' is not produced by any of the non-terminals I see. Wait, perhaps I'm missing an entry.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I don't see any that produce 't17' as a terminal. Only 't80' is produced by NT17.\n\nHmm, that seems problematic. If the second token is 't17', but the grammar doesn't have any non-terminals that produce 't17', then it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar. So that would suggest that the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the productions. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking for 't17' in the productions:\n\nLooking through each line, I don't see any NT producing 't17' as a terminal. So that seems to indicate that the string can't be generated because the second token is 't17', which no production handles.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any. The full list of productions is:\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\n\nNT49 -> 't40'\n\nNT53 -> 't48'\n\nNT67 -> 't6'\n\nNT9 -> 't0'\n\nNT42 -> 't68'\n\nNT12 -> 't81'\n\nNT34 -> 't9'\n\nNT46 -> 't58'\n\nNT74 -> 't47'\n\nNT32 -> 't11'\n\nNT42 -> 't60'\n\nNT3 -> 't65'\n\nNT4 -> 't65'\n\nNT61 -> 't62'\n\nNT78 -> 't72'\n\nNT77 -> 't47'\n\nNT58 -> 't61'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nNT38 -> 't47'\n\nNT83 -> 't7'\n\nNT80 -> 't43'\n\nNT3 -> 't7'\n\nNT56 -> 't56' \u2192 wait, does NT56 produce 't56' as a terminal? That doesn't make sense, as that would just be a literal '56', but perhaps that's a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, some of these lines are longer and maybe have mistakes. For example, the line \"NT56 -> 't56'\" seems incorrect because it would mean NT56 directly produces itself, leading to an infinite loop. But I might be misparsing.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is longer. Looking again, for example, the first line after S is:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\n\nWait, perhaps I misread it. Let me re-express the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking back at the user's grammar, it's as follows:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nNT47 -> NT66 NT29\n\nNT45 -> NT46 NT36\n\nNT18 -> NT49 NT80\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\n\nWait, each of these seems to be production rules where non-terminals are on the left, and non-terminals or terminals on the right.

{"custom_id":"request-402","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t54 t85 t58 t62 t40 t11 t9 t6 t65 t9 t9 t18 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t84 t9 t9 t18 t33`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Since all productions are in CNF, every step in the derivation produces two symbols at most.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Since the terminals in the string are all single-character tokens, each production can directly correspond to a terminal if applicable. \n\nI think the standard method to check if a string is in the language of a CFG in CNF is to use recursive parsing or the CYK algorithm. But since the string is quite long, maybe I can spot a pattern or see if each terminal corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in CNF allows two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of non-terminals in the derivation tree should correspond to the length of the string. For example, for a string of length n, there should be n-1 productions that introduce terminals, each adding one terminal, and the remaining are non-terminals combined into terminals.\n\nWait, let's count the number of t's. The string has multiple t's: t54, t85, t58, t62, t40, t11, t9, t6, t65, t9, t9, t18, t3, t68, t81, t9, t9, t18, t84, t9, t9, t18, t33. That's 22 terminals. So the grammar would need to have a parse tree where each terminal is the result of a production, and each branch combines non-terminals according to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar represents a linear-bounded automaton, and the string must be exactly generated by a certain number of rules.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to check for each terminal in the string whether it corresponds to a production in the grammar. That is, for each token in the string, can it be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to see what terminals are present. From the productions, I see 't3', 't6', 't9', 't18', 't28', 't33', 't34', 't40', 't43', 't47', 't50', 't54', 't58', 't62', 't65', 't71', 't72', 't73', 't74', 't76', 't77', 't78', 't79'. \n\nWait, looking through the produced terminals:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39' (Wait, no, let's check each production where RHS is a terminal.)\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT56 -> 't62'\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT41 -> 't9'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't39' (Wait, wait, no, NT5 is a production leading to t39, but the string doesn't have that.

The string is a sequence of tokens split by spaces: \n\n`t47 t43 t47 t43 t47 t40 t43 t47 t43 t29 t40 t6 t65 t79 t23 t58 t58 t58 t58 t58 t58 t9 t9 t18`\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. Since CNF is given, the derivation process is straightforward, each step replacing a non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example, NT5 produces 't39', NT4 produces 't54', etc. Some non-terminals generate other non-terminals, which in turn can generate more symbols.\n\nThe target string starts with several 't47's, 't43's, etc. I think the approach is to look for how these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol S has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nEach of these NTs will then be expanded. So, we need to see if the string can be generated starting with either of these.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't47', 't43', etc. Let's check if any of the NTs can derive to these.\n\nFirst, let's see NT5. NT5 \u2192 't39'. But in the string, the first is 't47', so maybe NT47 is involved. Let me check if NT47 can produce 't47'. Looking at the grammar, NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29. Neither of these is a terminal, so NT47 can't directly produce 't47'. Wait, perhaps another NT does.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78. NT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69, and NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16. Hmm, NT51 can lead to NT34 NT69, and NT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47. NT61 can produce 't62' or lead to other NTs. NT47 again requires NT66 and NT29, so it loops.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the string step by step. Starting from S, let's see.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Let's see what NT70 can produce. NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. NT76 \u2192 't79', NT7 \u2192 't44'. So NT70 can produce t79 t44. But in the string, the first two tokens are t47 t43, which doesn't match. So maybe option 1 is not the way.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54'. The string starts with t47, not t54, so that can't be. Hmm, does that mean S cannot produce the string? But wait, maybe through other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps the first 't47' is coming from another NT, not S directly. Maybe through some intermediate steps.\n\nWait, but S directly produces NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Neither of these can produce a 't47' directly. So how can the string start with t47? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check if any other NTs can produce 't47'. Looking at the grammar, NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29. Neither is a terminal, so no. NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78, which also don't produce t47 directly. NT79? Maybe not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's try to parse the string backward to see if it can be generated.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I should check if any NTs can produce t47 or other tokens in the string.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the only NT that directly produces t47 is NT47 if it's a terminal, but looking at the rules, NT47 is defined as NT66 NT29, so it's not terminal. So how can the string have 't47'? It must come from some expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at other rules. Let's see:\n\nWhat about NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6. NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41. NT41 \u2192 't9'. So NT69 can produce NT23 NT6, and then NT23 could be NT73 NT41, which is NT73 which might produce t9, and NT41 is 't9'. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the productions that lead to 't47' in the string. Since 't47' appears multiple times, perhaps it's coming from NT66 or something that can derive to t47.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing t47 except NT47, which itself produces NT66 NT29. So perhaps in the derivation, some NTs must produce t47.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t47. So let's see if any of the productions can produce t47 as a result of expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial NTs can produce sequences that eventually lead to t47, t43, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to see if any NT directly produces t47 or t43 or the other tokens in the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar again:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT49 \u2192 t40\n- NT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69\n- NT53 \u2192 NT17 NT38 or NT80 NT69\n- NT61 \u2192 NT13 NT18 or NT32 NT21 or NT26 NT58, etc.\n- NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\n- NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16\n- NT7 \u2192 't44'\n- NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41\n- NT41 \u2192 't9'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nHmm. I'm not seeing any NTs that directly produce t47 or t43 as terminals, except perhaps looking deeper.\n\nWait, looking at NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT10 NT9 and also 't65'. So NT3 can produce 't65'. But the string has t47 and t43, not t65.\n\nWait, no NT directly produces t47. Or maybe I'm missing it.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo in the grammar. Let me check again. Looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for 't47' in the productions. I see:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT17 NT38 or NT80 NT69\nNT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3\nNT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\nNT5 \u2192 t39\nNT4 \u2192 t54\nNT49 \u2192 t40\nNT17 \u2192 t80\nNT34 \u2192 t9\nWait, perhaps a typo in the user input; it's possible that some NT production should create a terminal 't47' but was not transcribed correctly. For example, if NT47 was mistakenly written as NT45 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing that t47 can be derived from some path. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, in the string, the first token is 't47'. Let's assume that some NT leads to 't47', perhaps through multiple steps. For example, perhaps NT66 leads to another NT that eventually leads to 't47', but I don't see such a rule.\n\nWait, looking again: NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1. NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. NT76 \u2192 't79'. NT7 \u2192 't44'. So NT66 produces sequences that end with t79 t44, not t47.\n\nWait, perhaps another path. Let me consider NT61.

{"custom_id":"request-423","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string I'm checking is a series of tokens separated by spaces. My task is to figure out whether this string can be derived from the start symbol of the grammar, which is S.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. It looks like every non-terminal symbol (like S, NT4, NT69, etc.) has a production that breaks it down into two other non-terminals except for some terminals (t50, t3, etc.), which are the leaves of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where A is a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to check is: \"t54 t85 t58 t50 t40 t6 t65 t40 t6 t65 t11 t9 t80 t29 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t72.\"\n\nI'll list these tokens for clarity:\n\nt54, t85, t58, t50, t40, t6, t65, t40, t6, t65, t11, t9, t80, t29, t3, t68, t81, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t72.\n\nSince every production in the grammar is binary except for the terminals, the derivation of the string must form a parse tree where each internal node has exactly two children. So, the string's length should be one more than the number of internal nodes. Counting the tokens, there are 23 tokens. So the parse tree should have 22 internal nodes, meaning the string length is 23, which is correct because the grammar starts with S, which would ultimately derive a terminal string with an odd number of symbols based on the production rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT13 NT13 or S \u2192 NT47 NT77 (since the first line says S -> NT13 NT13, the next line is another production for S). Wait, looking back: The first line is S -> NT13 NT13. The next line is S -> NT47 NT77. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, the first rule is S -> NT13 NT13, and the second is S -> NT47 NT77. Hmm, actually, looking more carefully, the first line is S -> NT13 NT13, then the next is S \u2192 NT4 NT77, but earlier that contradicts. Wait, I need to make sure I read the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar as given starts with:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\nS -> NT4 NT77\n... (then other productions follow, but no NT4 or NT77 elsewhere? Let me check. Oh, looking further, S seems to produce either S \u2192 NT13 NT13 or S \u2192 NT47 NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps S has multiple productions. Wait, wait, looking more carefully, the first line is S \u2192 NT13 NT13, and the second is S \u2192 NT47 NT77. No, the first line says S is NT13 NT13, and the second says S is NT47 NT77? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the formatting. The grammar starts with:\n\nLine 1: S->NT13 NT13\n\nLine 2: S->NT4 NT77\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the first two lines again. The user wrote:\n\nGrammar: S -> NT13 NT13\n\n                     S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, S has two productions: one producing NT13 NT13, and another producing NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, that's strange because NT4 is a non-terminal, so how do we get to the terminals from there? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me think: each NT symbol is a non-terminal that can be expanded into other non-terminals, except when it's a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT4 is a non-terminal, so maybe S can produce a string that starts with NT4 followed by NT77, but NT4 may expand further. Alternatively, let me check the productions for NT4: looking through the rules, I don't see any NT4 productions. Wait, the grammar is given in a list, starting from S. Let me count the lines to see if there are more S productions.\n\nWait, the initial grammar has S defined with two rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT13\n\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nBut then, the rest of the lines are other NT symbols and their productions. For example, NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29, etc.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reread the grammar:\n\nThe first two lines are S \u2192 NT13 NT13 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Then it proceeds with other NT rules. So S has two productions, each consisting of two non-terminals.\n\nSo, when considering the string, it must start with NT13 NT13 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54. So, either S must derive to start with NT4 (if the first token is t54) because NT4's expansion includes t54.\n\nWait, from the production list, I don't see NT4 being defined as a terminal, but perhaps I'm looking closely. Let me check the NT47 production. No, every NT except the ones ending with t are non-terminals. Wait, looking through, I see some rules where NTn is followed by t, like:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't18'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo, some NT symbols expand into terminals. So let's check: when does 't54' appear?\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\n\nWait, NT4's production is \"NT4 \u2192 't54'\", so when NT4 is on the left side, it's replaced by 't54'. Similarly, other NTs are replaced by other NTs or terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with t54, which is the terminal token. So, in the derivation, at some point, the parse must have a production that leads to t54. Since t54 is a terminal, it can only be produced by a single production rule. Let's check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\n\nIs that the only terminal production for any NT? Let me check. Yes, looking through all the lines, the only NT that directly expands to 't54' is NT4. So, in the derivation, to get 't54' as the first token, the parse tree must have a node that expands NT4 to 't54', which is a single terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the next token is t85, then t58, etc. Let's try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nSince the string starts with t54, it comes from NT4. So the parse tree has a root node that's part of the derivation. Wait, since S can derive to either NT13 NT13 or NT4 NT77, but the first token is t54, which comes from NT4, perhaps the start symbol S must have derived via the second production S \u2192 NT4 NT77, which is 'NT4 NT77'. So, the first two symbols would be 't54 t...' But wait, no, wait: no, the first symbol is t54, which comes from NT4, which is part of S's second production. So in S's second production, S \u2192 NT4 NT77, so the start of the string is 't54 ...', which is 'NT4 NT77', which would produce t54 followed by whatever follows NT77.\n\nWait, no: S's second production is S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So the first expansion is S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Then, NT4 must expand to 't54', and NT77 must expand into something else. Looking at the NT77 production: line 7 says NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78. Then NT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69. NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16. So NT77 would expand into NT51 NT78. Wait: but that would mean NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78, which further breaks down into NT34 NT69, and NT5, which is 't3' as per line ?, wait:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't3'\n\nSimilarly, NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-440","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 string (where string has two non-terminals or just terminals). Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, except if it's using the epsilon rule. But in the given grammar, I see some productions end with terminals. Hmm, maybe the user is using the form with productions leading to terminals as well, like A \u2192 a. So the grammar can have both B \u2192 BC and B \u2192 terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like t65 t78 t9 and so on. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals. So, the first step is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nThe approach here is to perform a backward derivation. That is, start from the start symbol S and try to expand it step by step to see if I can reach the target string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo, S can produce either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nNow, let's look at the string. It starts with t65, which is a terminal. The first production that has a terminal is likely the one for NT13 or NT4. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nNT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29 (but 47 isn't in the string)\nNT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\nNT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nNT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n\nWait, NT69 goes to NT23 and NT6. And 23 is not in the string, but 6 is present. So the first part of the string has t65, t78, etc. Wait, but let me check if 't65' appears in any of the terminals of the productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some terminals:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62\nNT56 \u2192 't62'\nNT3 \u2192 't65'\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\nNT31 \u2192 't50'\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\nNT49 \u2192 't40'\nNT53 \u2192 't48'\nNT67 \u2192 't6'\nNT9 \u2192 't0'\nNT42 \u2192 't68'\nNT12 \u2192 't81'\nNT34 \u2192 't9' (twice)\nNT46 \u2192 't58'\nNT74 \u2192 't47'\nNT32 \u2192 't11'\nNT61 \u2192 't62'\nNT26 \u2192 't42'\nNT15 \u2192 't40'\nNT32 \u2192 't24'\nNT42 \u2192 't60'\nNT3 \u2192 't65'\nNT4 \u2192 't65'\nNT61 \u2192 't17'\nNT78 \u2192 't72'\nNT38 \u2192 't47'\nNT83 \u2192 't7'\nNT80 \u2192 't43'\nNT3 \u2192 't7'\nNT56 \u2192 't62'\nNT16 \u2192 't28'\nNT38 \u2192 't29'\nNT33 \u2192 't85'\nNT78 \u2192 't33'\nNT6 \u2192 't18'\nNT18 \u2192 't43'\nNT7 \u2192 't44'\nNT56 \u2192 't31'\nNT76 \u2192 't79'\nNT7 \u2192 't23'\nNT47 \u2192 't84'\n\nHmm, looking for 't65' in the productions, I find NT3 \u2192 't65' and NT4 \u2192 't65'.\n\nSo, the first part of the string starts with t65. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't65'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 can produce 't65', and NT4 can produce 't65'. So, in the first step, the start symbol S must have expanded into something that can eventually produce t65 as the first symbol.\n\nGiven that the start symbol can expand into S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then NT13 would need to produce a string starting with t65, but looking at NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Neither NT70 nor NT46 produce terminals, so that path might not get us a t65 immediately.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT4 NT77. NT4 \u2192 't65', so that's a possibility. NT77 can produce either 't47' or maybe something else? Let's check the productions for NT77.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47' and according to the grammar, there's a production NT77 \u2192 't34'. Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT77 -> 't47' and another production for NT77 is NT51 NT78. So, NT77 can be a terminal t47 or expand into NT51 and NT78.\n\nBut the string starts with t65, so the first step would be S \u2192 NT4 (which gives 't65') and NT77, which needs to produce something that starts with the next symbols.\n\nWait, but let's consider that the string is a sequence of t's and numbers. Each non-terminal in the grammar seems to expand into two non-terminals until they reach terminals. So, for the first token t65, it's produced by NT4.\n\nSo, the first expansion is S \u2192 NT4 (which is 't65') and NT77. Now, the next thing to produce is t78 t9 t9 t18 t42 t17 t81 t9 t9 t18 t17 t81 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t62 t43 t43 t7 t0 t0 t28.\n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the entire string is a sequence of terminals, each step in the derivation needs to produce a sequence of terminals. So, perhaps it's better to try to see if the string can be constructed by the non-terminals, starting from S.\n\nAnother approach is to split the string into chunks that correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions. The string is a series of t's and numbers, so each production must generate a subsequence of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal expansion is either two non-terminals or two terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6. NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41, NT41 \u2192 't9', NT73 \u2192 't9'. So, NT23 expands to 't9' and NT41 't9', so NT69 can produce 't9 t9'.\n\nWait, let me check NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41, and NT73 \u2192 't9', NT41 \u2192 't9'. So, NT23 is 't9 t9'.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 \u2192 NT23 which is 't9 t9' and NT6 \u2192 't18'. So NT69 would expand to 't9 t9 t18'.\n\nLooking back at the string: The first few tokens are t65 t78 t9 t9 t18 t42 t17 t81 t9 t9 t18 t17 t81 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t62 t43 t43 t7 t0 t0 t28.\n\nSo, the very first t65 is NT4 \u2192 't65' and the next part would be NT77's expansion.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So, the first part is t65, and then the expansion of NT77 would need to produce the rest of the string as t78 t9 t9 t18...\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to try to see if the entire string can be generated by looking at possible expansions.\n\nLet's try to see if the string can be split into sub-strings that correspond to the productions.\n\nFor example, starting with S \u2192 NT47. Wait, no, S has two productions: either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nLet me think: Since the first token is t65, which is NT4, so the first part is NT4. Then, the next part is NT77. But NT77 can either be 't47' or expand into NT51 and NT78. Since the next token is t78, perhaps NT77 expands into NT51 and NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes derivation steps more predictable.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some of the non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. For example, `NT4 -> 't54'`. So, any production that eventually terminates into these terminals might be part of the string.\n\nThe string itself consists of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nStarting from S, which can be rewritten as either S -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77. Since S is a single nonterminal, the entire string must be generated from one of these starting points.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step, looking for possible matches with the productions.\n\nThe string starts with `t65 t85...`. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT62 -> 't42' and NT32 -> 't24', but I need to find a way to get 't65'. Checking the productions, I notice NT34 -> 't78' and NT77 -> 't34'. Wait, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for an NT that can produce 't65'. Hmm, looking through the productions, I see that NT3 -> 't3' and NT62 -> 't42', but 't65' isn't directly produced. Alternatively, NT6 -> 't18', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be derived by considering the root productions and seeing if each part can be broken down accordingly. Since the string starts with 't65', I need a path from S that can generate 't65' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the production S -> NT69. So, S can become NT69, which then needs to be expanded into the string. So, the first part after NT69 would have to be 't85 ... t28' but that doesn't make sense because the first symbol is 't65'. Alternatively, maybe I should try the other option of S -> NT4 NT77. So, the string would start with NT4 followed by NT77. But the first symbol is 't65', which would come from NT4. Looking at the productions for NT4: NT4 -> 't54' and also appears in other rules. Wait, no, the production for NT4 is NT4 -> 't54' and 't42'. Wait, no, checking the grammar again, I see that NT4 has two productions: one that becomes 't54' (e.g., in NT5 -> 't39' and NT3 -> 't3'), and another that leads to more nonterminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look for each step methodically.\n\nStarting with S, it can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Since the string starts with 't65', and looking at the productions, 't65' is produced by NT3, because NT3 -> 't3' and then somehow combining to make 't65'. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check the productions for each NT:\n\nLooking for NT65: Wait, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't65'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the entire grammar:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, the terminals 't' followed by numbers are on the right side. So, 't3' is from NT3, 't54' is from NT4, etc.\n\nSo, to get 't65', I need an NT that produces 't65' directly or through some chain.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't65'. So maybe 't65' is only produced by a nonterminal that itself is derived from other nonterminals.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that NT13 -> 't70' and 't46'. Hmm, but that would be 't70 t46', so perhaps not. Or maybe NT13 is involved in a chain that ends up with 't65' somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if the string can be broken down into segments that match the productions.\n\nThe string is: t65 t85 t58 t62 t17 t11 t9 t80 t47 t3 t68 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t6 t54 t43 t65 t28.\n\nThat's a lot to handle. Maybe it's better to start from the beginning.\n\nLooking for the first 't65', I need to find a production that can generate this. Scanning the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't65'. That suggests that 't65' might be part of a chain of productions that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps 't65' is produced by a chain of nonterminals. Let me see if any NTs can produce 't65' through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT34 can produce 't78', and NT77 can produce 't34'. Wait, that's a cycle. Wait, no, because NT77 -> 't34' and NT34 -> 't78' and NT78 -> 't47' (among others). So, if NT77 can produce 't34', and 't34' can produce 't78', and 't78' can produce 't47', etc. So 't65' isn't in this chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't65' is produced by NT3 with NT3 -> 't3' and then NT3 needs to somehow lead to 't65', which seems impossible because 't3' is fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 't65' is part of a larger chain. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT69, which is derived from S -> NT13 NT69. So, NT69 would need to produce the rest of the string after the first 't85'... no, that doesn't fit because the first symbol is 't65', so that would have to come from NT69? No, NT69 can produce, for example, 't47' as in NT77 -> 't47', but that's not 't65'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the grammar rules wrong. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can go to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Each of those nonterminals can be further broken down. Let me see if any of them produce 't65'.\n\nLooking through the NTs, I don't see any NTs directly producing 't65'. So perhaps 't65' must be part of a longer chain. But since all NTs eventually produce terminal strings, each step must be correctly matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is impossible because it starts with 't65', which isn't part of any initial production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again:\n\nIn the grammar, the only NT that produces 't65' would be if there's an NT called NT65, but looking through the productions, I don't see such a thing. So 't65' must be either a nonterminal that's part of a chain leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the list of productions, I see that NT6 -> 't18', and NT3 -> 't3'. So, if a chain of nonterminals ends up producing 't65', it must go through a series of NTs that ultimately produce 't65'.\n\nLet me try to see if such a chain exists.\n\nLooking at NT6 -> 't18' and NT62 -> 't42'. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the CYK algorithm approach for parsing, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into smaller parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: 't65 t85 t58 t62 t17 t11 t9 t80 t47 t3'.\n\nThis seems like a long sequence.

{"custom_id":"request-454","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar consists of several production rules. My goal is to figure out whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals. Or is it that each production can have one non-terminal and one terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in this case, the grammar seems to have a mix where some rules produce two non-terminals, and others produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, the first rule is S -> NT13 NT69. That's two non-terminals, so that's an S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Another rule is S -> NT4 NT77. Also two non-terminals. Then NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29. So, each NT (non-terminal) seems to have two production options, sometimes leading to two NTs or a terminal followed by an NT.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t54 t17 t47 t40 t6 t65 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t47 t47 t28.\n\nI notice that some tokens are terminals like t54, t17, etc., and others are non-terminals? Wait, no\u2014the way it's written, I think the rules replace non-terminals. So, the string is a sequence of terminals and some symbols like NT13, NT69, etc., which are non-terminals according to the rules.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's all 't' followed by numbers, except for the initial NT symbols. Wait, no. Wait, in the string, it's given as a list separated by spaces. So the string is a series of symbols: t54, t17, t47, t40, t6, t65, t24, t9, t6, t54, t9, t9, t18, t58, t3, t60, t81, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t47, t47, t28.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar rules, most of the tokens start with NT, like NT47, NT45, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string is all terminals, with no NT symbols, so the initial string is in terms of terminals only.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is written with non-terminals as NT followed by numbers, and the string is just a series of terminals (t followed by numbers). That makes more sense because the user presented the grammar as a series of lines, some starting with NT, which seems like non-terminals, and others like S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So, perhaps the string to evaluate is a series of terminal symbols t followed by numbers, like t54, t17, etc.\n\nSo, the string to evaluate is all terminals, meaning the derivation should end when all non-terminals are resolved into these terminal symbols.\n\nGiven that, I'll need to see if the string can be generated step by step, starting from S and replacing non-terminals according to the grammar until only terminals remain, and they should match the given string.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a smarter way.\n\nFirst, let's list all the production rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77\nNT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29\nNT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\nNT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nNT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\nNT60 \u2192 NT38 NT18\nNT9 \u2192 NT31 NT45\nNT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61\nNT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4\nNT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74\nNT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45\nNT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68\nNT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62\nNT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3\nNT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\nNT5 \u2192 NT83 NT9\nNT21 \u2192 NT73 NT53\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\nNT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18\nNT5 \u2192 NT26 NT58\nNT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1\nNT10 \u2192 NT68 NT58\nNT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21\nNT12 \u2192 NT38 NT67\nNT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80\nNT53 \u2192 NT17 NT38\nNT53 \u2192 NT80 NT69\nNT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47\nNT70 \u2192 NT60 NT13\nNT3 \u2192 NT10 NT9\nNT61 \u2192 NT15 NT47\nNT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41\nNT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16\nNT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69\nNT56 \u2192 't50'\nNT77 \u2192 't47'\nNT41 \u2192 't9'\nNT1 \u2192 't3'\nNT62 \u2192 't71'\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\nNT17 \u2192 't80'\nNT34 \u2192 't78'\nNT73 \u2192 't9'\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\nNT31 \u2192 't50'\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\nNT49 \u2192 't40'\nNT53 \u2192 't48'\nNT67 \u2192 't6'\nNT9 \u2192 't0'\nNT42 \u2192 't68'\nNT12 \u2192 't81'\nNT34 \u2192 't9'\nNT46 \u2192 't58'\nNT74 \u2192 't47'\nNT32 \u2192 't11'\nNT61 \u2192 't62'\nNT26 \u2192 't42'\nNT15 \u2192 't40'\nNT32 \u2192 't24'\nNT42 \u2192 't60'\nNT3 \u2192 't65'\nNT4 \u2192 't65'\nNT61 \u2192 't17'\nNT78 \u2192 't72'\nNT38 \u2192 't47'\nNT83 \u2192 't7'\nNT80 \u2192 't43'\nNT3 \u2192 't7'\nNT56 \u2192 't62'\nNT16 \u2192 't28'\nNT38 \u2192 't29'\nNT33 \u2192 't85'\nNT78 \u2192 't33'\nNT6 \u2192 't18'\nNT18 \u2192 't43'\nNT7 \u2192 't44'\nNT56 \u2192 't31'\nNT76 \u2192 't79'\nNT7 \u2192 't23'\nNT47 \u2192 't84'\n\nNow, the string is t54 t17 t47 t40 t6 t65 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t47 t47 t28.\n\nFirst, I'll note that some of these are terminals, as indicated by starting with 't'.

{"custom_id":"request-478","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The job is to figure out whether the string belongs to the language defined by the rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar starts with the start symbol S, which can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Each of these seems to be two non-terminals, meaning that each step in the derivation will involve expanding these non-terminals further until I reach terminals or ones that can produce 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see a lot of NT followed by two other NTs, except for a few cases where the RHS ends with a terminal. For example, NT56 \u2192 't13' is a terminal production. So, these are the leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe string given is: `t54 t40 t79 t44 t58 t3 t68 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t79 t44 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t7 t0 t28`.\n\nThat's a bit long, 27 tokens. Since each production in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (terminal), each step in the derivation either combines two non-terminals into two new, or leaves them as terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if we can trace a valid derivation path from S to this string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, except for terminals. That means the parse tree must be a binary tree where each internal node has two children. The number of terminals in the string should then correspond to the number of leaves, which for a binary tree should be one more than the number of internal nodes. Wait, but the number of leaves in a binary tree is more than internal nodes by one. Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting that confused.\n\nWait, in any binary tree, the number of leaves is equal to the number of internal nodes plus one. For example, a full binary tree with 3 leaves has 2 internal nodes. So, if the string has N terminals, the parse tree must have N-1 internal nodes. Let's check the string length: 27 terminals. So the parse tree would need to have 26 internal nodes. Is that possible?\n\nBut more importantly, the structure must match the grammar. So let's think about how to derive the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nThese are two separate branches. Let's check both options.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46 (from the rule: NT13 -> NT70 NT46)\nNT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6 (from NT69 -> NT23 NT6)\nSo the next step would produce NT70 NT46 NT23 NT6.\n\nWait, so S could produce nt13 nt69, which further breaks down into nt70 nt46 nt23 nt6, right? But none of these are terminals except for some rules I don't think are directly applicable here.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to see if the tokens in the string can be linked through the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54. Let me look for which non-terminals produce t54. Looking through the rules, I see NT31 \u2192 't50', which doesn't help. Other rules: NT53 \u2192 t48, NT56 \u2192 t13, NT42 \u2192 t68, NT12 \u2192 t81, NT34 \u2192 t9 (multiple times). Wait, but I don't see a rule that directly produces t54. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT production where the RHS is 't54'. The closest is NT31 -> t50. So maybe t54 is not produced by any NT. That seems problematic because the string starts with t54, which would have to come from a terminal production. But in the grammar, is there any NT rule that produces t54? I don't see one. Only a few tokens do: t54, t40, etc.\n\nWait, the rules list has:\n\nNT53 \u2192 t48\nNT56 \u2192 't13'\nNT77 \u2192 't47'\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\n\nAh, yes, in the last part, I see NT4 \u2192 't54'. So that production exists.\n\nSo the first token t54 comes from NT4. Cool.\n\nThen after t54, we have t40. Let's look for rule that produces t40. From the rules: NT49 \u2192 t40, and NT5 \u2192 t39, but we're looking for t40. So NT49 \u2192 t40.\n\nSo after t54, t40. So t40 comes from NT49. But wait, does NT49 produce t40? Yes. So the substring after t54 is t40 t79 t44... etc. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the whole string as a series of tokens and try to find a way to break it down into the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me write the string as a list:\n\nt54, t40, t79, t44, t58, t3, t68, t47, t6, t9, t9, t18, t79, t44, t58, t3, t68, t81, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t7, t0, t28.\n\nHmm, that's 27 tokens. So the first token is t54 from NT4. Then t40 is from NT49. Then t79, which is in the rules as NT73 \u2192 't9' (wait, NT73 \u2192 't9') but t79 is a terminal? Or is it from a different NT?\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT77 \u2192 't47', but there's no NT79 in the rules. Wait, actually, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't79'. Wait, in the rules, I see NT78 \u2192 't33', NT73 \u2192 't9', etc. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rule entries again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 't33'\n- NT77 \u2192 't47'\n- NT51 \u2192 't34'\n- NT53 \u2192 't48'\n- NT62 \u2192 't71'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT17 \u2192 't80'\n- NT34 \u2192 't9'\n- NT47 \u2192 't58'\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing NT79. Hmm, in the rules, I don't see any NT79. So t79 must come from a NT that can produce t79. But looking at the rules, none of the NTs directly produce t79. That's a problem.\n\nWait, that might mean that the string can't be generated by the grammar because t79 doesn't appear as a terminal in any production, but the string has t79. Unless I missed a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a typo. But I shouldn't assume that. So, let's see.\n\nThe second token after the first is t40, which comes from NT49. So after t40, what's next is t79. So the third token is t79, which needs to come from an NT production.\n\nBut looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that produces t79. So that seems like a no-go. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains a terminal (t79) that's not produced by any NT.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a rule.

{"custom_id":"request-474","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t29 t43 t47 t43 t29 t40 t43 t47 t40 t43 t47 t40 t43 t24 t9 t43 t9 t9 t18 t58 t58 t58 t58 t58 t9 t9 t18`. \n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nGiven the grammar, I notice that some symbols are terminals. For example, in the productions, certain rules end with 't' followed by a number. So, when parsing the string, these terminals are the end points.\n\nThe string starts with `t29`, which I need to check against the grammar. Let's look at the productions for `t29`. Scanning through the grammar rules, I see that NT29 has a production: NT29 -> NT42 NT68. Wait, no\u2014let me check each production correctly.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for `t29`:\n- NT29 is defined as -> NT42 NT68.\n\nSo, to get `t29`, the RHS is NT42 and NT68. Therefore, the symbol before `t29` must be a non-terminal, and `t29` is derived from NT29.\n\nThen, working backward, the string starts with `t29`, so the first part of the production is NT29, which produces NT42 and NT68.\n\nSo the next two symbols should be t43 and t47, but let me check NT42 and NT68.\n\nNT42 is defined as -> t68? Wait, no. Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for NT42: I find NT42 -> t60. So NT42 produces t60, not NT68. Wait, but that can't be right because t42 is in the string, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the symbol after `t29` is `t43`, then `t47`, which are the next in the string. So, the entire production chain would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\nBut that seems to produce the entire string, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait no, the string is a series of t's, which correspond to terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string would be `t29` and `t43`, but according to the string, it starts with `t29`. Wait, no\u2014the string is `t29 t43 t47 ...`, which would mean that the first two symbols are `t29` and `t43`. But the S only directly expands into NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. So, maybe the string starts with t29 would require the first step to be NT13 or NT4, but the first two symbols in the string are `t29` and `t43`, which are both terminals (like NT29 -> t29, and NT43 is not a terminal), but in the given grammar, non-terminals are symbols like S, NT4, etc., while the 't' symbols are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals and non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are all the parts that end with 't' followed by a number, like t50, t39, etc. The non-terminals are those that have non-terminal symbols on their RHS.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals are all the NT and S. For example:\n\nNT4 -> t54\nNT31 -> t50\nNT5 -> t39\nNT49 -> t40\nNT53 -> t48\nNT67 -> t6\nNT9 -> t0\nNT42 -> t68\nNT12 -> t81\nNT34 -> t78\nNT46 -> t58\nNT74 -> t47\nNT32 -> t11\nNT61 -> t62\nNT29 -> whatever, let's see.\n\nWait, I think I should approach this step by step. Since the string is a series of terminals, each token in the string corresponds to a terminal derived from a non-terminal in the grammar. I need to check if this list of terminals can be produced by the grammar.\n\nThe initial approach is to model the derivation of the string step by step, considering how each terminal can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLet's list the symbols in the string:\n\n1. t29\n2. t43\n3. t47\n4. t43\n5. t29\n6. t40\n7. t43\n8. t47\n9. t40\n10. t43\n11. t47\n12. t40\n13. t43\n14. t24\n15. t9\n16. t43\n17. t9\n18. t9\n19. t18\n20. t58\n21. t58\n22. t58\n23. t58\n24. t58\n25. t9\n26. t9\n27. t18\n\nThat's 27 symbols. The initial symbols are `t29`, `t43`, `t47`, etc. Now, let's see what non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking for `t29` in the grammar, I see that NT29 is defined as NT42 NT68. So, the production is NT29 -> NT42 NT68. So NT42 must produce t60, as per NT42 -> t60 (from the grammar). Wait, that's a problem because the second symbol is `t43`, which would require NT42 and NT68 to produce t43 and something else, but NT42 produces t60. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let's check NT29 again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps NT29 is not directly producing t29. Let me check all the productions:\n\nI need to find which non-terminals have a production leading to t29. So, looking for any rule where the RHS includes 't29'.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only place t29 appears is in NT29 -> NT42 NT68. So no direct rule; instead, NT29 must be expanded to NT42 and NT68. Then, for the string to start with t29, perhaps the initial expansion would have to start with NT29. But looking at the start symbol S, it can only expand to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So the first two symbols should be either t13 and t69 or t4 and t77. But the string starts with t29, which is produced by NT29. Therefore, the string cannot be derived from S because S does not produce t29 as a start. So the initial symbol is S, which starts with NT13 or NT4, so the first symbol in the string should be the terminal derived from NT13 or NT4.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction because the string starts with `t29`, which is produced by NT29, which cannot be directly derived from S's first expansion. Therefore, the string cannot be in the language because S cannot start with `t29`.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nThe grammar's S has two options:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT69\n2. S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string must be the results of NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. The given string starts with t29, which would require the first symbol to come from NT13 or NT4. But since NT13 and NT4 produce non-terminal symbols (like their RHS contains other NTs), the first token in the string should be a terminal derived from those.\n\nLooking at NT13: NT13 -> NT70 NT46. So NT70 is a non-terminal and produces NT76 and NT7 (rule 76: NT70 -> NT76 NT7). NT76 -> NT79 NT8 (let"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-502","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has several production rules, and the string to check is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form is. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in this case, the grammar seems to have all the right structure, with non-terminals on the left and combinations of non-terminals or terminals on the right.\n\nThe string given is: `t47 t40 t6 t65 t29 t40 t6 t54 t29 t40 t43 t47 t40 t6 t65 t29 t43 t79 t44 t58 t58 t58 t58 t58 t58 t9 t9 t18`.\n\nI notice that 't's are followed by numbers, some of which are repeated. It looks like the string is composed entirely of terminals, which means we're looking at a sequence that should be ultimately derived from the start symbol S by replacing non-terminals.\n\nLet's see the grammar's start symbol: S. The first production from S is either NT13 NT1 or NT47 NT77. But wait, looking at the initial grammar, S produces NT13 NT1 or NT4 NT77.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT13 NT1 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t47. Let me check if there are any production rules that start with NT4 or NT13 that could lead to t47.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I can see that NT77 \u2192 t47, which is a terminal. So NT77 can produce 't47'. That might be useful.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT47, I see that it's produced in other places, but maybe I need to see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nLet me list all the production rules for each non-terminal, but that's a lot. Instead, perhaps I can look for a path from S down to the string.\n\nFirst, let's note that the string has t47 as the first symbol. So the first production must be S \u2192 NT77 because NT4 would lead to 't4' and the string starts with 't47', which can't come directly from NT4. But wait, S produces NT13 NT1 or NT4 NT77. Wait, looking more carefully, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recheck the production rules. Oh no, actually, in the initial part of the grammar, I see S \u2192 NT13 NT1, S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So S can produce either of these pairs. Now, looking at the string, it starts with t47, so 't47' must come from one of the non-terminals, perhaps NT77 since NT77 \u2192 't47'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT77 is defined as NT77 \u2192 t47, and NT47 \u2192 other things, but the terminal t47 only comes from NT77. So maybe the first step is using S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then the first symbol should be anything from NT4 or NT77. But the string starts with t47, which can only come from NT77. So that would require that in the left-hand side, one of the non-terminals in the production leads to 't47', which is NT77. So that part must come from NT77. Therefore, the production must be S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo the first part is NT77 producing 't47', so the first symbol is 't47'. Then, the remaining part of S's production is NT4, which would produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but NT77 is a non-terminal, so the NT77 in the production S \u2192 NT4 NT77 will lead to a sequence where one part is 't47'. But in the string, we have 't47' not in all positions. So let me think step by step.\n\nThe entire string is a series of t followed by numbers. Each 't' followed by a number is either a terminal in the grammar or the start of a production.\n\nLet me consider the first production: S \u2192 NT4 NT1. NT4's productions are:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n- NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n- NT41 \u2192 NT38 NT69\n- NT49 \u2192 NT80 NT80\n- NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\n- NT56 \u2192 NT62 NT3\n- NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT4\nWait, no, I think I need to look more carefully. Maybe writing down all the production rules for each NT is necessary, but that's a lot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string into a list to see how each token can be generated.\n\nWait, the string is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me represent it as a list:\n\n['t47', 't40', 't6', 't65', 't29', 't40', 't6', 't54', 't29', 't40', 't43', 't47', 't40', 't6', 't65', 't29', 't43', 't79', 't44', 't58', 't58', 't58', 't58', 't58', 't58', 't9', 't9', 't18']\n\nEach token is a terminal, so the parser must derive this string by substituting non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the first token, 't47', which comes from NT77. So we need to have, at some point, an NT77 in the left-hand sides of the string. So let me try to structure the string as a sequence where each production leads to a terminal.\n\nBut starting from S, let's see:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t47, so it must come from NT77, so the second option is more likely because S \u2192 NT4 and S \u2192 NT77. So using S \u2192 NT4 NT77. The first part is NT4, and the second is NT77. NT77 \u2192 t47, so that's good.\n\nSo the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77 \u2192 NT4 \u2192 ... and NT77 \u2192 t47. So the first token is t47.\n\nNow, we have the remaining string after the first token: ['t40', 't6', 't65', 't29', 't40', 't6', 't54', 't29', 't40', 't43', 't47', 't40', 't6', 't65', 't29', 't43', 't79', 't44', 't58', 't58', 't58', 't58', 't58', 't58', 't9', 't9', 't18']\n\nSo now, we have to derive the rest starting with NT4. Let me look at the productions for NT4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 can be derived from other non-terminals, like NT43: Wait no, in the grammar, I don't see NT4 directly producing anything. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, I think I can't directly see the NT4 production, because in the grammar, NT4's productions aren't directly listed, but maybe it's via a chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each non-terminal in the grammar has certain productions.\n\nLooking again, the grammar includes:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n- NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n- NT41 \u2192 NT38 NT69\n- NT49 \u2192 NT80 NT80\n- NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\n- NT56 \u2192 NT62 NT3\n- NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT4\n- Also, NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not looking accurately. Let me structure the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT4, I see in the rules, perhaps it's under another non-terminal.

It states that each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided seems to fit this form because all rules are either two non-terminals on the RHS or a single terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals: t65, t85, t58, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So, the string must start with either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step, breaking it down into possible non-terminals.\n\nThe first token is t65. Looking at the grammar, t65 is derived from NT4. Specifically, NT4 is replaced by t54, but wait, I'm confused. Wait, in the grammar, some NT symbols are converted to terminals. Let me check the NT rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT4 -> t54\n- NT1 -> t3\n- NT3 -> t10\n- NT4 again in other rules.\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t65. Where does t65 come from? Scanning the rules, I see NT34 \u2192 t78 and others, but where is t65?\n\nWait, I don't see a production for t65. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT78 \u2192 't33', NT47 \u2192 't84', but nothing about t65. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The user provided the string as `t65 t85 t58 t31 t62 t47 t40 t43 t47 t40 t6 t...` So the first symbol is t65.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't3', which is different. None of the non-terminals seem to directly produce t65. That's odd because if the string starts with t65, the parser would need to have a production that starts with t65, but I don't see any in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again. Scanning through the list, I see:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 't17', 't81' etc. No t65.\n- NT56 \u2192 't62'.\n- NT46 \u2192 't58'.\n- NT47 \u2192 't84'.\n- NT34 \u2192 't78'.\n- NT77 \u2192 't47', 't34'.\n- NT73 \u2192 't9'.\n- NT17 \u2192 't80'.\n- NT80 \u2192 't43'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a non-terminal that produces t65. Or perhaps t65 is the result of a longer derivation. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the string actually ends with t65, maybe it's a typo. Let's assume it's correct. Perhaps I can find a non-terminal that can produce t65. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar's rules for terminals might include t65. Wait, in the rules I see:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't62' and 't31' seems not. But t62 is from NT62 \u2192 't71'. Not sure.\n\nWait, I realize I might be mixing up non-terminals and terminals. The string is all terminals, so each token in the string must be a terminal symbol derived from some non-terminal.\n\nSo, if the first token is t65, there must be an NT rule where NT65 produces t65. But looking through the given grammar rules, nowhere does any NT non-terminal produce t65. For example, NT34 \u2192 t78, NT3 \u2192 t10, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Are all the 't...' tokens terminals? Let me confirm. Yes, the string consists only of t's followed by numbers, so they are terminals.\n\nSo, for t65 to appear, there must be a production NT65 \u2192 t65 somewhere in the grammar, but scanning the given rules, I don't see any such rule. All terminals are for numbers like t5, t6, etc., but not t65. Oh, wait, no: looking through all the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't54', NT1 \u2192 't3', NT5 \u2192 't54', etc., but no t65.\n\nWait, perhaps t65 is the result of a longer derivation, like from NT34 or something else. But that seems unlikely because each production in CNF either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, to get t65, the non-terminal that directly produces it must be present in the grammar, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token is not t65 but something else, like a typo. Let me check again. The string starts with `t65 t85 t58 t31 t62 t47 t40 t43 t47 t40 t6 t65 t79 t44 t58 t58 t58 t3 t68 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t33`\n\nHmm, assuming it's correct, but I can't find any NT rule that produces t65. This makes me think that the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But that might not be the case because perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I can trace the string back through the grammar. Let's try to see if there's a path from S to the string.\n\nBut given that the first symbol is t65 and there's no non-terminal that directly produces t65, the string cannot be generated. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but I'm new to this and might have missed some rules. Let me check again. Oh, I don't see any NT with t65 as a terminal. So, unless the grammar has a rule like NT65 \u2192 t65, which it doesn't, the string cannot be generated.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-522","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like each production rule in the grammar starts with a non-terminal (capital letters) on the left and is followed by two other non-terminals or terminals on the right. For example, the first rule is S -> NT13 NT69, which means the start symbol S can be replaced by NT13 and NT69. Then NT13 can be replaced by NT70 and NT46, and so on. There are a lot of these rules, so it's a complex grammar.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t65 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t79 t44 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t81 t9 t9 t18 t17 t65 t50 t58 t62 t40 t84 t28`.\n\nI notice that all the tokens except 't79' and 't28' are either single-character or multi-character strings starting with a 't' followed by a number. The grammar seems to encode these into various non-terminals, which then break down further until they reach the terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This structure should make it possible to parse the string using a standard algorithm like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try a different approach.\n\nI'll start by tracing the string through the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number might correspond to a non-terminal that eventually breaks down into that terminal. \n\nLooking at the string, I'll list out the tokens in order:\n\n1. t65\n2. t17\n3. t84\n4. t9\n5. t9\n6. t18\n7. t42\n8. t40\n9. t79\n10. t44\n11. t58\n12. t3\n13. t60\n14. t81\n15. t9\n16. t9\n17. t18\n18. t81\n19. t9\n20. t9\n21. t18\n22. t17\n23. t65\n24. t50\n25. t58\n26. t62\n27. t40\n28. t84\n29. t28\n\nI notice that t79 is an unusual token. Looking at the grammar rules, none of the right-hand sides directly produce 't79'. The only place I see a 't' is in specific cases. For example, rules like NT3 -> 't3', NT4 -> 't54', NT5 -> 't39', etc. So 't79' would have to come from a non-terminal that is not defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking deeper, some non-terminals have rules that lead to a 't' followed by a specific number. For example, NT7 -> 't44' and NT8 -> 't43'. So, any 't' followed by a two-digit number must be produced by a specific non-terminal. Let me see if any of these rules include 't79':\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT77 -> 't47' (so 't77' is 't47')\n- NT41 -> 't9'\n- NT17 -> 't80'\n- NT73 -> 't9'\n- NT78 -> 't33'\n- NT34 -> 't9', 't78', 't9', etc.\n\nWait, there's a rule NT77 -> 't47', so when ever NT77 is used, it produces 't47'. But I don't see a rule that has 't79' as a terminal. So if the string has t79, that would imply that some non-terminal produces 't79', but looking through all the rules, I don't see any that do. All other terminals start with 't' followed by a number that's defined by specific non-terminals, but none result in 't79'.\n\nSo the presence of 't79' in the string suggests that it would require a production rule where a non-terminal generates 't79', which isn't present in the grammar. Therefore, the string should not be derivable from the given grammar.\n\nWait, but let me cross-check to make sure I didn't miss any rule. I'll go through the entire grammar to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't79':\n\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT41 -> 't9'\n- NT17 -> 't80'\n- NT34 -> 't9', 't78', etc.\n\nNo, I don't see any rule where any non-terminal directly translates to 't79'. The only way to get 't79' would be if there's a production rule like NT79 -> 't79', but I don't see any such rule.

{"custom_id":"request-514","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is a standard form for context-free grammars, so that's a good start. But I'm not super familiar with all the details, so I'll have to think carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar structure. I see that the start symbol is S, which immediately branches into two options: NT13 NT69 and NT4 NT77. So S can only produce strings that start with either of these two combinations. Looking at the string we're evaluating, it starts with 't65 t40...', which doesn't immediately match either of those, but wait\u2014maybe the NT symbols can be further expanded into terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that many of the NT symbols are broken down into other NT symbols and some are expanded into 't' followed by a number. For example, NT4 is 't54', NT3 is 't3', and others. So each NT symbol is either another NT on either side, or it's just a terminal.\n\nTo parse the string, I need to see if each part can be matched by the grammar. This feels like a derivation problem. Maybe I can reconstruct the parse tree from the string.\n\nLet me break down the string: t65 t40 t11 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t3 t60 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t79 t23 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t72.\n\nWait, that's a lot of t's followed by numbers. So each component of the string is a terminal symbol, and I need to check if they come from the correct NT production.\n\nLet me think about how the string could have been built. Starting from S, it has to split into either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT13 is 't70', NT69 is 't19'? Wait, looking back, actually, NT69 is NT23 NT6, so that would be t23 followed by t6? Or maybe each NT can expand into multiple t's if they're part of a chain of rules.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to reconstruct possible derivations step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map each 't' followed by a number to the NT they come from and see if the sequence can be produced by S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT either ends in a 't' symbol or reduces further. So starting with S, it can go to NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nIf I pick the first option, S -> NT13 NT69, then NT13 is 't70', and NT69 is 't19'. But wait, the string starts with t65, which isn't either of those. So maybe S must have expanded differently.\n\nWait, maybe I misread S's productions. Let me check again:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo the first production starts with NT13, which is 't70', and NT69 is 't19' maybe? Or NT69 is actually 't19'? Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT69, I see lines like NT69 -> NT23 NT6. So NT69 expands into another NT, so it can't be a terminal yet. Hmm, perhaps I need to go deeper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each NT symbol ultimately expands into a series of 't's, and I'm supposed to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match these 't's plus some numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically. Let's build the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t65 t40 t11 t9 t6 ... etc. So looking for where t65 and t40 come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT3 is 't65', and NT4 is 't54'. NT5 is 't39', NT6 is 't18', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can map each t to their NT:\n\nt65: NT3\nt40: Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly maps to t40. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps NT4 is 't54', so t40 might not be directly there. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to parse the string as a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see which parts of the string could be matched by the grammar. For example, starting from S, which is NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nSo looking at the start of the string, perhaps S can produce NT13, which is 't70', which is a terminal, but the first component is t65, which isn't t70.\n\nSo maybe the other production: NT4 and NT77. NT4 is 't54', so that would be t54 followed by whatever NT77 expands into.\n\nLooking for NT77, I see it's either 't47' or another NT. In the grammar, NT77 -> 't47' or NT5 -> 't39', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, the string starts with t65, which is NT3. So perhaps the initial S must expand into branches that lead to NT3 somewhere.\n\nBut looking at S's two productions, neither of them directly start with NT3. So maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the NT symbols can further expand into other NTs, which eventually lead to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think recursively. Let's pick S and see if it can produce any parts of the string.\n\nIf S -> NT4 NT77, then NT4 is 't54', so the first component is t54. The string starts with t65, which is not t54. So that branch might not be the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, S -> NT13 NT69. NT13 is 't70', and NT69 is 't19'? Or wait, NT69 is actually NT23 NT6, so perhaps I need to follow that down.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the string is a series of tokens that are part of the grammar derivations. I need to check each part of the string to see if it can be formed by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to construct a parse tree based on the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the entire string can be built by following the grammar's productions step by step.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of NT13, NT69, etc., and see if it aligns with the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT symbols that expand into 't's with numbers and see if the string can be formed by combining these.\n\nLooking through the grammar, a lot of Nts expand into t and a number.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT3 -> t65\nNT4 -> t54\nNT5 -> t39\nNT6 -> t18\nNT7 -> t44\nNT8 -> t7\nNT9 -> t0, t46, t31, t42, t12, etc.\n\nWait, the grammar has a lot more rules, so maybe I can make a list of all the NTs that expand into 't's:\n\n- NT3 -> t65\n- NT4 -> t54\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT6 -> t18\n- NT7 -> t44\n- NT8 -> t7\n- NT9 -> t46 (multiple times), etc.\n\nBut the string has t65 first, which would require the string to start with NT3. But as I saw, S starts with either NT13 or NT4. Neither of these is NT3. So unless NT13 or NT4 can derive into NT3 eventually, it might not be possible.\n\nWait, maybe NT13 can expand into other NTs, which can further expand into NT3. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT13, I see that NT13 -> NT70 NT46. Then, NT70 -> NT76 NT7, and NT76 -> NT79, etc. That seems to be getting more complex.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach: look for the presence of symbols that can be used to split the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string represents a series of factors that must come from S's productions. Each component after S is a factor, so the entire string is built by the two options from S.\n\nWait, the string starts with t65, which would require that the first part is a NT that expands to t65. So perhaps the first NT is NT3, which is t65, as per the grammar.\n\nBut in S's productions, do we have any way to get to NT3? Looking at S's options, it's either NT13 or NT4.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar productions. It's in CNF, so every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That might help in parsing the string step by step. Each production has two parts except for some which have single terminals. For example, S -> NT13 NT69, so S can generate two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, I notice that some of the non-terminals have rules where they produce two terminals. Like NT56 -> 't56'. Oh, no, looking again, I see that for example, NT46 -> 't58', so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT34 -> 't78', etc. So, any non-terminal that ends up producing a terminal in the derivation would correspond to a token in the string.\n\nI think the approach here is to construct a derivation tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be generated by expanding S. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can parse the string using the leftmost or rightmost derivations, but it's easier to think in terms of the steps needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree from the start symbol, expanding each non-terminal step by step, matching the tokens in the string as we go. Since the string is a series of tokens, each corresponding to a terminal in the grammar, we need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence.\n\nBut the string is quite long: 36 tokens, but some parts repeat. Let's break it down.\n\nStarting from S, which is the start symbol, and it can generate either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So each S expands into two non-terminals. Then each of those non-terminals can expand further until they reach terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, we can perform recursive descent or backtracking to see if the string can be generated. Alternatively, since each production is at most two symbols, the parse can be done by checking step by step.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the possible derivation. The string is a series of t and numbers. Each 't' number is a terminal symbol, so each token must come from a production where the non-terminal is replaced by that token.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each rule either expands into two non-terminals or directly into a single terminal. For example, S -> NT13 NT69: so when S is expanded, it becomes the combination of NT13 and NT69. Then each of these needs to be expanded, possibly into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string consists entirely of terminals ('t' followed by a number), the derivation process will ultimately involve expanding until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe string starts with 't54', so that must come from a production where the non-terminal expands into 't54'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT56 -> 't56' (so that's 't56', but in the string it's 't54'). Wait, does that mean one of the productions is 't54'? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT4 -> 't45', NT5 -> 't39', but 't54'... Hmm, let me check all terminals:\n\nLooking for 't54' as a terminal. Scanning through, yes: NT49 -> 't40', NT5 -> 't39', NT42 -> 't68', NT12 -> 't81', NT34 -> 't9', etc. Hmm, I don't actually see any NT production that expands to 't54'. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, NT4 is 't45', NT3 is 't10', NT6 is 't18', NT9 is 't0' and 't31', etc. I don't see any NT that expands to 't54' or 't40' except perhaps NT31 -> 't50', or others. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again, I notice NT5 -> 't39' and NT31 -> 't50'. So 't39' and 't50' are present, but 't54' is not directly a terminal in any of the grammar rules. Oh wait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT5 is defined as NT38 NT74, which further expands into NT47 NT5. So NT5 itself isn't a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe 't54' is generated by a non-terminal that's not in the provided rules. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar rules one by one to check for 't54':\n\nLooking at NT41 -> 't9', NT17 -> 't80', NT34 -> 't78', NT46 -> 't58', NT77 -> 't47', etc. I don't see any NT which directly expands to 't54', except maybe if it's an intermediate step. Maybe I'm missing something in the rules.\n\nWait, maybe NT77 has more rules. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't47', and also NT77 is part of some other expansions. So 't47' is a terminal. So 't54' is not in any of the terminals, so if the string starts with 't54', then it's not possible because no NT in the grammar expands directly to 't54'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first token 't54' isn't present. So the answer is \"No\".\n<\/think>\n\nThe string begins with 't54', but no non-terminal in the grammar directly produces 't54'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Each rule's left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides have only two symbols.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The starting symbol is S, and the productions seem to be generating a series of terminals ('t', 'n', etc.) based on the right-hand sides. The grammar seems to have 68 non-terminals and a lot of production rules. Each rule either produces two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or sometimes even two terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. But looking through the rules, some of them, like NT9 -> NT46 NT62 and NT9 -> NT46 NT62 again, but wait\u2014no, some rules have a terminal and a non-terminal, which can also be acceptable because in some interpretations, the rules can have a terminal and a non-terminal, but in strict CNF, all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right. So maybe the grammar is slightly different, perhaps it's in a mixed form? Or perhaps the grammar isn't entirely in CNF because some rules might have a terminal plus a non-terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nBut the user said it's in CNF, so I assume each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right. Let's check the first few rules:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13\nNo, actually S -> NT13 NT69, which is two non-terminals, that's okay. But then other productions like NT4 -> 't54', which is a terminal. Wait, that's not possible in CNF because CNF requires all productions to have non-terminals only. So maybe the grammar isn't fully in CNF. Alternatively, perhaps some rules allow terminals, which would mean the grammar isn't in CNF. But the user says it's in CNF, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some rules produce a terminal and a non-terminal, which can still be in CNF but more generalized. Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Hmm. Well, perhaps I can proceed, assuming that all productions can have either two non-terminals or a mix, as long as the string is processed correctly.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. In CNF, all productions have the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So any rule that has a terminal on the right-hand side cannot be in CNF. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misreading the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT4 -> 't54'. That can't be in CNF because it's a terminal. So maybe some of the rules in the grammar do have terminals. So, maybe this is not pure CNF, but perhaps the user says it's in CNF, but I need to proceed regardless.\n\nI think the key is that regardless of whether it's CNF or not, I need to determine if the string can be derived from S. So I don't need to dive deep into the structure but instead analyze the string.\n\nThe string provided is: `t65 t40 t47 t40 t43 t79 t44 t58 t58 t3 t68 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t11 t9 t48 t3 t60 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t72`.\n\nI notice that it's a sequence of t's and numbers, but in the grammar, the terminals are strings, but actually, looking more carefully, some terminals are like 't54', 't74', etc. So each token in the string might correspond to a production.\n\nSo to check if the string can be generated by the grammar, I need to parse the string into a sequence of symbols and see if each symbol can be produced by a single application of a production. But since the grammar is given, I can track how the string might have been generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to simulate a top-down parsing using the given grammar and see if the string can be derived.\n\nLet me start by looking at the possible starting points. The start symbol is S, so the first symbols must come from S's production rules. \n\nLooking at S's productions:\n- S -> NT13 NT69\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo the first two non-terminals after S must be either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbol is 't65'. So I need to see if any of the non-terminals that production from S can lead to 't65' in the first step.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT13:\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n\nSo, if S produces NT13 and NT69, the first step would result in NT13 and NT69. Then, each of those can produce sequences.\n\nWait, but the first symbol of the string is 't65'. So perhaps NT70 can produce 't65' in the next step.\n\nLooking at NT70's production:\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\n\nSo from NT70, the next step would be NT76 and NT7.\n\nLooking further, NT76 -> NT79, and NT7 -> 't23' ?\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to break down the string into individual symbols and see how they can be grouped.\n\nWait, the initial approach might not work because the grammar might be generating a lot of symbols, but perhaps the string is made up of a sequence of individual terminals, so each token is a terminal. So each symbol in the string is the result of a single production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a production step. So for example, the first symbol is 't65', which must be the result of a production.\n\nBut in the grammar, the productions produce non-terminals and\/or terminals. So each symbol in the string must be a terminal, so looking at the right-hand sides, I can see what terminals are present.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are 't0', 't1', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't9', 't11', 't17', 't18', 't21', 't23', 't24', 't26', 't29', 't31', 't32', 't33', 't34', 't36', 't38', 't39', 't40', 't42', 't43', 't44', 't46', 't47', 't48', 't50', 't54', 't58', 't59', 't60', 't61', 't62', 't65', 't67', 't68', 't71', 't72', 't73', 't79', etc.\n\nSo each symbol in the string is a terminal that's present in the grammar. Now, the question is whether this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, let's see if the first two symbols are 't65' and 't40'\u2014wait no, the first symbol is 't65', but since S's productions are two non-terminals, the sequence must start with two non-terminals, each producing a terminal in the first step, but perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible that S could generate two non-terminals, each of which can expand into a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each symbol in the string corresponds to the application of a production rule. So the first symbol is 't65', which must be the result of a production. Looking through the grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce 't65'?\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT61 -> 't62' and NT56 -> 't62'. Also, NT76 -> 't79', but that's 't79' not 't65'. Wait, looking more carefully, actually NT61->'t62' and NT76->'t79', but I don't see a production that gives 't65'. Hmm.

{"custom_id":"request-560","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar has a set of production rules. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF production rules have the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, most of the productions seem to be of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which fits the CNF structure. Some productions end with terminals, like NT4 \u2192 t54 or NT83 \u2192 t7. These terminals could be the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t84 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t29 t40 t43 t11 t9 t80 t29 t58 t3 t68 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t7 t0 t28`.\n\nMy approach will be to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived by expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar. Alternatively, since parsing can be complex, I might look for a way to split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nStarting with S: according to the grammar, S can derive NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT77. Looking at the string, the first token is t54, which isn't a terminal in either of these branches. Wait, no\u2014the start symbol S in the grammar has two options. Let's check the first production: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT47 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54, which is a terminal. Let's see if any production leads to t54. Checking the grammar, NT56 \u2192 't50' (a terminal), but there's also NT14: no, wait, looking through the rules, I need to find a non-terminal that expands to t54. Scanning the production rules, I see that NT31 \u2192 't50', NT53 \u2192 't48', NT62 \u2192 't42', NT74 \u2192 't47', etc. Hmm, wait, in the grammar, I see NT61 \u2192 't62', NT78 \u2192 't5', NT77 \u2192 't47', etc. Wait, let me scan each rule to see if any produce a terminal of 't54'.\n\nLooking for a production of the form NTx \u2192 't54'. Scanning through each production:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't54' is the only one that ends with 't54'. So the only non-terminal that can directly produce t54 is NT4.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is either NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT77. T54 is 't54', which is produced by NT4 \u2192 't54'. So if S is NT13 NT69, those would produce 't54's, but NT13 and NT69 aren't directly linked to t54. Alternatively, if S is NT47 NT77, then if either of those NTs can produce t54, but looking through the rules, NT47 \u2192 't84' (from NT77 \u2192 't47'), and NT47 also has other productions. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, S can be split into NT47 and NT77. If either of these can derive a sequence that produces t54, but looking through the rules, none of those seem to directly lead to t54. Except for NT4 \u2192 't54', but S isn't NT4. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should break down the string into parts that correspond to each production. Let's list the string tokens:\n\n1. t54\n2. t9\n3. t9\n4. t9\n5. t18\n6. t42\n7. t40\n8. t84\n9. t81\n10. t9\n11. t9\n12. t18\n13. t40\n14. t29\n15. t40\n16. t43\n17. t11\n18. t9\n19. t80\n20. t29\n21. t58\n22. t3\n23. t68\n24. t47\n25. t6\n26. t9\n27. t9\n28. t18\n29. t7\n30. t0\n31. t28\n\nSo 31 tokens. The start symbol S is either NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT77. Since the string is long, it's likely that the derivation uses multiple steps.\n\nLooking at the first token, t54. This must come from a production of a non-terminal that ends with t54. The only production I see is NT4 \u2192 t54. So for t54 to appear, somewhere in the left part of the S split, there must be NT4, but wait S splits into two non-terminals, each of which has to expand into their own sequences.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by looking for possible splits in the string. Since S is two non-terminals, the string should be split into two parts that each can be formed by the respective non-terminal.\n\nLet's consider the first production of S: S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nThen, the string should start with the expansion of NT13 followed by the expansion of NT69. Similarly, for the second production S \u2192 NT47 NT77, the string would be the expansions of NT47 and NT77 in that order.\n\nSo let's start by considering the first production: S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So the string should be split into two parts: the first part from NT13 and the second from NT69.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part of NT13 would generate some sequence of tokens leading up to where NT13 can produce, and similarly for NT69. So let's see if the string can be split as such.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the string starts with t54, and the only way t54 is produced is by NT4 \u2192 t54, perhaps the S is not using the first production (NT13 NT69) because that start symbol doesn't produce t54. Wait, but S is either NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT77. If t54 is in the expansion, it must come from one of those two parts.\n\nWait, maybe another way: the first token is t54. Let's see the production of t54: only NT4 \u2192 t54. So perhaps in the expansion, one of the non-terminals (either NT13 or NT69) must derive to t54. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT13: according to the grammar, NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nWait, so NT13 expands into two non-terminals, which then expand into more, until they reach terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nLet's see if the entire string can be broken down into sequences that correspond to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to see if I can start forming the parse tree. The first token is t54, which must come from NT4 \u2192 t54. So perhaps in the S's first possible production (S \u2192 NT13 NT69), but since NT13 and NT69 don't directly produce t54, maybe S uses the other production (S \u2192 NT47 NT77), and one of NT47 or NT77 produces t54.\n\nLooking at NT47: NT47 \u2192 't84' or other productions, but 't84' is a terminal, so NT47's production would be 't84' or perhaps other sequences, but wait, NT47 also has other productions like NT47 \u2192 NT32 NT46, so maybe that's a route.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider each part of the string and see if they match any production rules.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let's try a different approach by looking for the terminals in the string and see if they correspond to any terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example, NT4 \u2192 t54, NT5 \u2192 t39, NT6 \u2192 t18, etc. \n\nWait, for t54, the only way is NT4 \u2192 t54. So if the string starts with t54, then somewhere in the first part of S (NT13 or NT47) must have a production that eventually leads to t54 via NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-554","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side, except for the start symbol which can also have a terminal. In this case, the start symbol is S, which has productions leading to NT... symbols. Some of these have terminals like 't...' and some continue to non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t65 t40 t24 t9 t6 t65 t9 t9 t18 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t24 t9 t43 t9 t9 t18 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t33`.\n\nEach token here is either a terminal (like t65, t40) or a non-terminal (presumably from the grammar, like NT3, NT77, etc.). Wait, but the grammar production rules only have non-terminals and terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). So, I need to parse the given string by matching the sequence of terminals to the possible derivations from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminals on the left, which means that each step in the derivation splits a single non-terminal into two. So, when parsing from left to right, each terminal in the string must be matched by a production that starts from the current context and possibly consumes two symbols, but in this case, it's a string of terminals and non-terminals may need to be parsed step by step.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the non-terminals on the left side of production rules can be expanded into sequences of non-terminals and\/or terminals. For example, S -> NT13 NT69. So, each step in the derivation branches the current non-terminal into two. So, when generating, you start with S, then produce two non-terminals, each of which can themselves produce more non-terminals until you reach terminals.\n\nBut here, we're trying to see if the given string can be derived using these production rules. So, perhaps a bottom-up approach would help, trying to build the string from the start symbol, or a top-down approach where we parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to represent the string as a sequence of symbols and see if there's a way to reduce it using the inverse of the grammar rules, i.e., looking at the string and seeing if each part can be matched to a production's right-hand side.\n\nBut since parsing is a bit tricky without a recursive descent parser, maybe I can find a way to map the sequence by looking for possible pairs in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me take a step back. The string is a sequence of tokens, each either a terminal or a non-terminal (like NT13, NT45, etc.). The grammar's rules give possible expansions, so perhaps I can parse the string by starting from the beginning and seeing if each part matches a possible expansion.\n\nLet me recall that in a grammar in CNF, the leftmost derivation is used, so each step introduces the leftmost non-terminal, expanding it into two non-terminals. So, for the string, I can attempt a leftmost derivation.\n\nThe given string is: `t65 t40 t24 t9 t6 t65 t9 t9 t18 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t24 t9 t43 t9 t9 t18 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t33`.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of tokens. Let me start by identifying what happens when applying the production rules.\n\nLet me first look at the top-level production rule. The start symbol S can produce NT13 and NT69 as per the first production: S -> NT13 NT69. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT13 followed by NT69.\n\nBut NTS appear to be non-terminals, so they must be expanded into other symbols.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so the initial expansion must consume S -> NT13 NT69, each of which must then derive into a sequence that eventually produces the terminals.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Perhaps a better approach is to see if each token can be derived from the grammar by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces exactly two non-terminals or terminals. So, each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two symbols. So, for a string of length n, the derivation will have n-1 splits, each splitting a non-terminal into two.\n\nWait, this might be complex. Maybe a better approach is to try to find whether the given string can be generated by the grammar using the productions.\n\nLet me list all the production rules to have them clear:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT69\n- S -> NT4 NT77\n- NT47 -> NT66 NT29\n- NT45 -> NT46 NT36\n- NT18 -> NT49 NT80\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n- NT69 -> NT23 NT6\n- NT60 -> NT38 NT18\n- NT9 -> NT31 NT45\n- NT36 -> NT56 NT61\n- NT80 -> NT67 NT4\n- NT5 -> NT38 NT74\n- NT68 -> NT12 NT69\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT45\n- NT29 -> NT42 NT68\n- NT9 -> NT46 NT62\n- NT58 -> NT61 NT3\n- NT77 -> NT51 NT78\n- NT5 -> NT83 NT9\n- NT21 -> NT73 NT53\n- NT70 -> NT76 NT7\n- NT61 -> NT18 NT18\n- NT5 -> NT26 NT58\n- NT66 -> NT13 NT1\n- NT10 -> NT68 NT58\n- NT13 -> NT32 NT21\n- NT12 -> NT38 NT67\n- NT9 -> NT46 NT80\n- NT53 -> NT17 NT38\n- NT53 -> NT80 NT69\n- NT34 -> NT61 NT47\n- NT70 -> NT60 NT13\n- NT3 -> NT10 NT9\n- NT61 -> NT15 NT47\n- NT23 -> NT73 NT41\n- NT78 -> NT5 NT16\n- NT51 -> NT34 NT69\n- NT56 -> 't50'\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT41 -> 't9'\n- NT1 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> 't71'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT17 -> 't80'\n- NT34 -> 't78'\n- NT73 -> 't9'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT67 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT34 -> 't9'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT74 -> 't47'\n- NT32 -> 't11'\n- NT61 -> 't62'\n- NT26 -> 't42'\n- NT15 -> 't40'\n- NT32 -> 't24'\n- NT42 -> 't60'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT61 -> 't17'\n- NT78 -> 't72'\n- NT38 -> 't47'\n- NT83 -> 't7'\n- NT80 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT56 -> 't62'\n- NT16 -> 't28'\n- NT38 -> 't29'\n- NT33 -> 't85'\n- NT78 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n- NT18 -> 't43'\n- NT7 -> 't44'\n- NT56 -> 't31'\n- NT76 -> 't79'\n- NT7 -> 't23'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n\nWow, okay, that's a lot of rules.

No, that's a production to other non-terminals, no terminal at the end).\nWait, no\u2014that production is NT29 -> NT42 NT68, which doesn't terminate in a terminal.

Wait, '69' is a production.\n\nWait, '69' is a non-terminal? Wait, in the grammar, is 'NT69' a non-terminal or a terminal? In Chomsky normal form, all non-terminals are represented with uppercase letters. However, the string contains lowercase 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals, but perhaps in the grammar, some non-terminals might produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, no. In the given grammar, all non-terminals are uppercase letters or sometimes 't' followed by numbers? But in Chomsky normal form, the only terminals are the lowercase letters. So 't6' would be a terminal if 't' is a terminal and '6' is an index, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, that's a confusion.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, all terminals are lowercase letters? Or here, is 't' a terminal, and the numbers part of the indices? But looking back, the productions in the grammar start with uppercase letters on the left and have non-terminals or lowercase 't' and digits on the right.\n\nWait, perhaps in this context, 't' is a terminal, followed by a number, which is part of the string. So, for example, 't29' is a terminal, and the grammar might have NT29 -> ... which is a non-terminal.\n\nBut looking through the productions, does any non-terminal produce a terminal like 't29'? I don't see that.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for 't29'. Looking through all the production lines, I don't see any production where a non-terminal immediately precedes 't29' as the terminal. So perhaps the production that generates 't29' is not present.\n\nWait, but looking again at the grammar lines, for example, NT42 -> 't68' and NT29:\n\nI don't see a production that immediately ends with 't29'. The earliest I see is NT29 -> NT42 NT68, which doesn't produce 't29' as a terminal. So perhaps 't29' is only present in the string if a longer derivation allows it.\n\nWait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Maybe I should approach this as a parsing problem, starting from the left, trying to produce each token according to the grammar.\n\nBut before that, perhaps the string cannot be generated because certain terminals don't appear in the grammar. Let me check the string:\n\nThe first token is 't29'. Looking through the grammar, in productions for non-terminals, none directly produce 't29'. So if there's no production for a non-terminal to generate 't29' as a terminal, then 't29' can't exist in the string. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar for any non-terminals that can produce 't29'.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT that immediately produces 't29' as a terminal. The productions for NT29 are:\n\n- NT29 -> NT42 NT68\n\nBut that doesn't end with a terminal. So if 't29' is a terminal in the input string, it must have come from a production that produces it directly. Since none exists, the string can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So if the string starts with 't65', that suggests that the grammar doesn't produce that string, right?\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some NT65 rule.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. They all seem to be two-symbol productions except when they eventually terminate with a terminal symbol. Each production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That's Chomsky normal form, right? So that's good because there are no issues with the form itself.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. For example, 't54', 't78', 't9', etc. I notice that some of these are two-character terms, like 't58' which is probably not a terminal but a production like NT77 \u2192 't47'. Hmm, wait, the grammar has some rules that convert NT parts into terminals. For example, NT77 -> 't47', so that's a terminal production.\n\nSo, my first step is to see how the string can be broken down into these production rules. Each 't' followed by a number is either a direct terminal or part of a two-step production, like 't17' comes from somewhere else.\n\nI think I need to reverse-engineer the derivation starting from S and see if it can yield the given string.

So where does 't54 come from?\n\nLooking for production rules that result in 't54': I see NT46 \u2192 't58' (nope), NT61 \u2192 't62' (nope), NT26 \u2192 't42' (nope), NT5 \u2192 't39' (nope), NT58 \u2192 't61', NT53 \u2192 't40', etc.\n\nWait a minute, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't54'. That's a problem because the string starts with 't54', so if there's no rule that gives 't54', then the string can't be produced by the grammar. Wait, but let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the rules again: I don't see 't54' as a terminal in the right-hand side of any rule except maybe elsewhere. Let me check the rules again. Scanning through, I don't see any NT production that ends with 't54'. For example, the rule NT53 \u2192 't47' doesn't produce 't54'. Similarly, NT58 \u2192 't61' gives 't61', not 't54'.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first token 't54' would have to come from a non-terminal that isn't listed in the production rules. Because all the productions either go to a non-terminal (like NT1, NT2, etc.) or to a terminal. So if a production exists for NT5 something that ends with 't54', but I don't see any, then 't54' can't be produced. Therefore, the string starts with 't54', which can't come from any production in the grammar. So the string is not in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Did I misread any rules? Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided, I see:\n\n- There's a rule NT46 \u2192 't58', so 't58' is possible.\n- There's NT77 \u2192 't47', so 't47' is possible.\n- NT49 \u2192 't40' which is possible.\n- NT58 is defined as NT61 \u2192 't62' but wait, no, looking again.\n\nWait, let me parse each rule line to be precise.\n\nWait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT or S rule that ends with 't54'. So if the string starts with 't54', but there's no production that produces 't54' as a terminal, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-598","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't65 t62 t24 ...' and so on. I have to process this and decide whether the string is indeed in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem and the tools I can use. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, except the start symbol which can produce terminals. Additionally, the right-hand side of each production has exactly two symbols. This structure implies that any string in the language will have a derivation tree where every node has exactly two children, except the leaves, which are terminals. Therefore, the length of any string in the language should be a power of two, but wait, that's only for the start symbol. Actually, in CNF, the productions are such that each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So the length of derived strings can vary, but importantly, each step increases the length by 1 (since one non-terminal is replaced by two symbols). But wait, no, that's not necessarily a power of two. For example, starting with S, which might produce two non-terminals, then each of those could produce two more, leading to four, and so on. But the original string might mix terminals and non-terminals, so the lengths could vary. Hmm, maybe I was wrong about the power of two; perhaps it's not directly relevant here.\n\nAnyway, moving on. The string provided has 40 tokens, separated by spaces, so it's 40 'tXXX' sequences. I think each 'tXXX' represents a terminal symbol, which is part of the target string. My job is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to simulate the bottom-up or top-down parsing of the string against the grammar. But doing this manually might be time-consuming, especially with such a long string. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be built step by step through the productions given.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production starts with S or N, and most of them are broken down into smaller non-terminals and terminals. The non-terminals tend to produce other non-terminals or specific terminals.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar again:\n\nThe start symbol is S.\n\nThe productions are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nNT47 -> NT66 NT29\nNT45 -> NT46 NT36\nNT18 -> NT49 NT80\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\nNT69 -> NT23 NT6\nNT60 -> NT38 NT18\nNT9 -> NT31 NT45\nNT36 -> NT56 NT61\nNT80 -> NT67 NT4\nNT5 -> NT38 NT74\nNT68 -> NT12 NT69\nNT61 -> NT33 NT45\nNT29 -> NT42 NT68\nNT9 -> NT46 NT62\nNT58 -> NT61 NT3\nNT77 -> NT51 NT78\nNT5 -> NT83 NT9\nNT21 -> NT73 NT53\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\nNT61 -> NT18 NT18\nNT5 -> NT26 NT58\nNT66 -> NT13 NT1\nNT10 -> NT68 NT58\nNT13 -> NT32 NT21\nNT12 -> NT38 NT67\nNT9 -> NT46 NT80\nNT53 -> NT17 NT38\nNT53 -> NT80 NT69\nNT34 -> NT61 NT47\nNT70 -> NT60 NT13\nNT3 -> NT10 NT9\nNT61 -> NT15 NT47\nNT23 -> NT73 NT41\nNT78 -> NT5 NT16\nNT51 -> NT34 NT69\nNT56 -> 't50'\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT31 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT49 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't48'\nNT67 -> 't6'\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT42 -> 't68'\nNT12 -> 't81'\nNT34 -> 't9'\nNT46 -> 't58'\nNT74 -> 't47'\nNT32 -> 't11'\nNT61 -> 't62'\nNT26 -> 't42'\nNT15 -> 't40'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT42 -> 't60'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nNT4 -> 't65'\nNT61 -> 't17'\nNT78 -> 't72'\nNT38 -> 't47'\nNT83 -> 't7'\nNT80 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't7'\nNT56 -> 't62'\nNT16 -> 't28'\nNT38 -> 't29'\nNT33 -> 't85'\nNT78 -> 't33'\nNT6 -> 't18'\nNT18 -> 't43'\nNT7 -> 't44'\nNT56 -> 't31'\nNT76 -> 't79'\nNT7 -> 't23'\nNT47 -> 't84'\n\nWow, that's a lot. The only terminals are the ones that have 't' followed by numbers and are not further broken down. For example, 't50', 't47', 't40', etc. The rest are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking more closely, some NTs have terminals as their productions. For example, NT58 -> 't61' NT3, but NT3 is non-terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, the production for NT58 is 't61' and NT3. So, in the context of the string, 't61' would be a terminal if NT3 can derive to a terminal. But wait, looking at NT3: NT3 -> NT10 NT9. NT10 -> NT68 NT58. NT9 -> NT46 NT80, etc. None of these seem to resolve to terminals, except perhaps when a terminal is present in the production.\n\nWait, looking at the right-hand sides, only certain NTs have terminals. For example:\n\nNT5 -> 't38' NT74\n\nYes, NT5 can produce 't38' and NT74.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 -> 't47', so 't47' is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 -> 't54', 't54' is a terminal.\n\nNT31 -> 't50'\n\nNT61 -> 't62'\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\n\nNT42 -> 't68'\n\nNT78 -> 't5' and 't16'?\n\nWait, NT78 -> NT5 NT16. Wait, looking at the production, that's 't5' and NT16. But wait, earlier I thought that NT5 could produce 't38' and NT74. But the production for NT5 is written as NT5 -> NT38 NT74, which I think is a mistake. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the line is:\n\nNT5 -> 't38' NT74\n\nYes, so NT5 can produce 't38' as a terminal and NT74 as a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 -> 't9' as a terminal.\n\nSo, in the string to parse, each 'tXXX' represents a terminal symbol. So the string consists of 40 terminals, each of which must be produced by their respective non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nTo see if the string is in the language, I need to check if every 't' in the string is derivable by some production.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because the structure needs to be built in a way that the entire string is generated by the start symbols S and via productions.\n\nSo, to approach this, perhaps I can first check if each 'tXXX' exists in the set of terminals produced by the grammar. If any 'tXXX' is not present, then the string is immediately not derivable.\n\nLooking at the grammar's productions, the terminals present are:\n\nFrom NT5: 't38'\n\nFrom NT77: 't47'\n\nFrom NT4: 't54'\n\nFrom NT31: 't50'\n\nFrom NT61: 't62', 't56' (Wait, NT61 -> 't17' is mentioned?

{"custom_id":"request-621","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens ending with 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar seems to consist of terminals (the 't' tokens with numbers) and non-terminals (the NT followed by numbers, or just S). The string provided is quite long, so it's going to be helpful to break it down step by step.\n\nCNF has a specific structure: each production is either A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all productions seem to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT13 NT13, which fits because NT is a non-terminal and the right side has two non-terminals. Other productions like NT4 \u2192 t54 are terminals, so that fits the A \u2192 a form.\n\nNow, the string given is a series of terminal symbols separated by spaces. I think each symbol is a terminal and represents a single character in the string. But wait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal strings, like NT4 is 't54', NT1 is 't3', and others. So when expanding, each rule will produce a certain number of terminals.\n\nThe string is: `t54 t85 t58 t62 t85 t58 t50 t85 t58 t62 t40 t84 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t43 t40 t43 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t6 t65 t43 t65 t58 t6 t54 t28`.\n\nSo the first token is t54, which according to the grammar, corresponds to NT4 \u2192 t54. So the start symbol S must expand into something that eventually can produce t54 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the starting production for S: S \u2192 NT13 NT13 and S \u2192 NT47 NT77. So when S is expanded, it will produce two non-terminals on each branch. Since the string starts with t54, I think the correct expansion is S \u2192 NT47 NT77? Wait, no, because NT47's production is something else. Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, the S rules are S \u2192 NT13 NT13 and S \u2192 NT47 NT77. Both start with NT13 or NT47. The string starts with t54, which is produced by NT4 \u2192 t54. So perhaps the correct production is S \u2192 NT47 NT77? But wait, that would involve NT47 and NT77. But in the grammar, the NTs can only expand into other NTs or terminals. So to get t54, we would have to see if any of the non-terminals can produce t54.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 \u2192 t54, so if the expansion can lead to NT4, then its terminal is t54. So perhaps somewhere in the derivation, S expands into NT47 and NT77, and NT47 can expand further, eventually leading to t54.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The first step is S, which can expand into NT47 NT77. Then each of those NTs would have to expand. Let's see:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29 (which then would expand)\nNT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\n\nNow, NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1. So NT13 and NT1.\n\nBut let's see: for the string, the first token is t54, which is NT4 \u2192 t54. So somehow, in the derivation, the first symbol has to be from NT4. So how can that happen?\n\nLooking back, S can only directly produce NT47 NT77 (since the other production is S \u2192 NT13 NT13). Wait, but S can also produce NT47 NT77. So maybe the derivation is S \u2192 NT47 NT77. But none of the NTs in the initial S's production produce t54 immediately.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Looking again, S's rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT13\n\nS \u2192 NT47 NT77\n\nSo the first step is to expand S into either NT13 NT13 or NT47 NT77. None of the NT13, NT47 produce t54 immediately; rather, they produce other NTs or terminals. Wait, no, some of them produce terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 t39, NT6 \u2192 t18, etc.\n\nSo let's see, for example, NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29. Then NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1. So maybe that's a path. But still, how do we get t54 from there? Because NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21, etc., and further down, some NTs may produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the t54 comes from a deeper expansion. Let's try to build the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar, step by step.\n\nLet me list the string tokens again:\n\nt54, t85, t58, t62, t85, t58, t50, t85, t58, t62, t40, t84, t84, t9, t9, t18, t42, t43, t40, t43, t29, t6, t9, t9, t18, t40, t6, t65, t43, t65, t58, t6, t54, t28.\n\nI think the strategy is to try to find a sequence of productions that leads to this string.\n\nStarting from S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT13.\n\nEach NT13 is replaced by NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. NT7 \u2192 t44. NT76 \u2192 t79. So NT70 produces t44 followed by something.\n\nWait, that seems like it's getting into the deeper levels.\n\nAlternatively, let's see how the string could be built.\n\nt54 is the first symbol, which can only come from NT4. So we need to have a production that eventually includes NT4 as one of its terminals.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 t54, which is a terminal.\n\nSo the path is somewhere in the expansion, but how?\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. Let's see the possible production pathways.\n\nS can expand to NT47 NT77. If that's the case, then NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29. NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1. NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21. NT32 \u2192 NT42 NT68. NT68 is produced by NT12 NT69. Hmm.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is to look at the string and see if it can be split into segments that match the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with t54, which is from NT4. So we need a NT4 somewhere in the derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar's expansion for NT4, it's straightforward: NT4 \u2192 t54. But NT4 can also be obtained from other rules. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, only NT4 has a production leading to a terminal in the given productions.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules.

{"custom_id":"request-622","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding what the grammar can produce and then see how the string fits into it.\n\nFirst, the string is a sequence of tokens, each of which is probably a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see that there are rules for both non-terminals (like S, NT4, NT13, etc.) and some terminals. Some of the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, such as 't54', 't9', etc., and some are just numbers, like 't58', which I think might be a typo or another way to represent the terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that in the grammar, rules like NT5->'t39' and NT42->'t68' indicate that certain non-terminals expand into a single terminal symbol, which is a 't' followed by a number. Some of these also lead to more complex terminals like 't0', 't3', etc. So, I need to figure out how the given string can be constructed by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe given string is: `t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t84 t81 t9 t9 t18 t17 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t24 t9 t80 t29 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t65 t58 t71 t0 t28`.\n\nThat's quite a long string. Let me break it down into individual tokens to list them:\n\n1. t54\n2. t9\n3. t9\n4. t9\n5. t18\n6. t42\n7. t40\n8. t84\n9. t81\n10. t9\n11. t9\n12. t18\n13. t17\n14. t29\n15. t6\n16. t9\n17. t9\n18. t18\n19. t40\n20. t24\n21. t9\n22. t80\n23. t29\n24. t3\n25. t60\n26. t81\n27. t9\n28. t9\n29. t18\n30. t65\n31. t58\n32. t71\n33. t0\n34. t28\n\nI notice that most of these are terminal symbols, but some lines might be confused. Wait, looking again, the grammar has rule S->NT13 NT69, which suggests that the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals: NT13 and NT69.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the string can be generated by expanding S into NT13 and NT69, and each of those into other non-terminals until we reach the terminals as per the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54. Let me check the grammar rules for the terminals. I see that NT56 -> t62, but I don't see 't54' directly. Wait, looking again: NT54? Oh, no, the rules are like NT9 ->'t0', but perhaps 't54' comes from a non-terminal. Let me check the terminal rules for NT54. From the grammar, I see NT54 isn't present as a terminal, but looking for rules that expand to 't54'. From the given rules, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't54' except perhaps in the list of terminals. Wait, I see at the end of the grammar:\n\nNT34 -> 't78'\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT41 -> 't9'\nNT1 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't71'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT17 -> 't80'\nNT34 -> 't9'\nNT46 -> 't58'\nNT74 -> 't47'\nNT32 -> 't11'\nNT61 -> 't62'\n...\n\nWait, perhaps 't54' comes from the non-terminal NT54, but looking at the provided grammar, I don't see any production rule for NT54 except perhaps as a terminal? Or maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules like:\n\nNT5->'t39'\nNT49->'t40'\nNT46->t58\nNT57 (wait, no NT57, but NT17->t80, NT34->t78, etc.)\n\nHmm, I don't see any rule that produces 't54', except maybe in some other form. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me look again. The grammar includes:\n\nNT5 -> 't39' (line 3)\nNT49 -> 't40' (line 9)\nNT46 -> 't58' (line 41)\nNT74 -> 't47' (line 63)\nNT32 -> 't11' (line 67)\nNT61 -> 't62' (line 71)\nNT77 -> 't47' (line 74)\nNT41 -> 't9' (line 78)\nNT1 -> 't3' (line 80)\nNT62 -> 't71' (line 17)\nNT77 -> 't34' (line 29)\n...\n\nWait, perhaps 't54' comes from NT56? Or is 't54' a direct terminal from a non-terminal I'm not seeing? I'm a bit confused here. Let me make a list of all terminal symbols: t3, t9, t17, t18, t24, t28, t29, t60, t65, t58, etc. But I don't see any 't54' as a terminal. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nWait, perhaps 't54' isn't directly from a rule but must be part of a longer production. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, but I'll proceed.\n\nSo, the first token is t54. Since the grammar's terminals are all represented with 't' followed by a number, I'll need to see if there's any non-terminal that can produce 't54'. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly expands to 't54'. Let me check line by line.\n\nLooking at each line in the grammar, I see that NT56-> 't62', NT58->'t61', NT59 isn't present, NT60-> 't67', NT61-> 't62', etc. Wait, is there a rule for NT54 in the grammar? I don't think so. The highest number I see is NT92 and above, but no NT54.\n\nWait, maybe the 't54' is part of a longer production, like a larger non-terminal that eventually expands into 't54' as part of a chain. For example, if S-> NT13 NT69, and both NT13 and NT69 expand into more non-terminals, each of which eventually expand into t54.\n\nLet me try to map out the structure. Starting from S:\n\nS expands to NT13 and NT69.\n\nNT13: from the grammar, NT13-> NT70 NT46. So, NT13 can split into NT70 and NT46.\n\nNT70 is in the grammar: NT70-> NT76 NT7. NT76-> NT79 NT77, and NT77-> 't34' or 't47'.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Let me try to see if the string can fit any possible derivation.\n\nBut given that the string starts with 't54', which seems problematic since I don't see a rule that produces 't54', but perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I misread the grammar rules. Let me check line by line.\n\nLooking again through the grammar, all the rules ending with terminals (those with letters on the right side without NT) are:\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\nWait, line 42: NT42 -> 't68'\nWait, no, line 42: NT42->'t68'\nLine 40: NT40->'t31' and line 49: NT49->'t40'\n\nWait, line 42: NT17->'t80'\n\nWait, looking for 't54' as a terminal.

The string is a sequence of tokens, each presumably corresponding to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. CNF grammars have two main rules: S \u2192 AB, A \u2192 a, and A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The provided grammar has S \u2192 NT13 NT12 and S \u2192 NT9 NT77, and a bunch of other rules for non-terminals. Each non-terminal seems to decompose into two other non-terminals until you reach terminals, which correspond to strings of 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t65 t40 t43 t43 t47 t43 t11 t9 t6 t65 t9 t9 t18 t58 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t79 t44 t58 t3 t60 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t72`.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from the grammar. Since it's a right-derivation, I have to break down the string into a series of productions. Alternatively, I can build the parse tree by expanding symbols step by step, but that might be complicated. Maybe I can work backwards by trying to find possible reductions.\n\nLet me see. The string starts with t65. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which non-terminals correspond to t65. In the grammar, I see NT1 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't54', NT5 \u2192 't39', NT6 \u2192 't18', NT9 \u2192 't0', etc. Hmm, but in the given string, the first token is t65. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule that gives 't65'. Wait, does any non-terminal produce 't65'?\n\nWait, in the list, looking at the productions, I see NT3 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't54', NT5 \u2192 't39', NT6 \u2192 't18', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT10 \u2192 'NT68 NT58' which becomes 't68' 't58', and that continues. I'm not seeing a direct production for 't65'. That might be a problem because if the first token isn't produced by any rule, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check again. Looking through the grammar, is there any rule that results in 't65'? Let me go through each production:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT6 \u2192 't18'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't40' (Wait, no, NT49 is a non-terminal, but in the list, there's a line: NT49 -> 't40'\u2014wait, that's actually a terminal.

Let me list them:\n\nLooking online, I just realize I can't actually scroll through all 50 productions here, but I'll check ones that might produce 't65':\n\n- NT61 \u2192 't62'\n- NT15 \u2192 't40'\n- NT32 \u2192 't24' (Wait, no, NT32 \u2192 't24' is a terminal. Let me look again. Oh wait, NT32 \u2192 't24' is a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nLet me parse through the list:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with two terminals, which would correspond to 't' followed by numbers.

{"custom_id":"request-634","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The CFG has a bunch of productions, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF has each production either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol cannot be on the right-hand side of a production. So, I should check if my grammar fits this structure. Looking through the productions, I see they're all either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. So it seems to conform to CNF.\n\nNext, I need to parse the given string using this grammar. The string is: t65 t40 t47 t40 t6 t54 t11 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t11 t9 t80 t47 t3 t60 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t33.\n\nThe approach I think of is using a top-down parser, like the CYK algorithm, or checking the leftmost derivation. But since the grammar is provided, maybe I can try to trace a possible derivation step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the symbols in the string and see if they match the terminals in the production rules, starting from the start symbol. The start symbol is S, which according to the CFG, S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo the string starts with t65. Let's see which productions lead to t65.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT65 is present. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT13 -> NT70 NT46, and then NT65 is derived from NT42 and NT61. Let me check each step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to construct a parse tree. Let's start by breaking down the string.\n\nThe first part of the string is t65 t40 t47 t40 t6. Hmm, t65 is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I don't see a direct production for NT65. However, in the productions, I see NT42 \u2192 t68 and NT56 \u2192 t62, but not t65.\n\nWait, in the productions, NT61 \u2192 t62. Let me check. Also, NT32 \u2192 t11, and NT33 \u2192 t85. Hmm. Looking through the productions, I see that NT42 is t68, and NT56 is t62. Wait, but the string starts with t65. I didn't see any production that directly outputs t65. Let me double-check the productions.\n\nLooking again at the productions, I see NT62 \u2192 't71', NT71 \u2192 something. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all the terminals.\n\nWait, the terminals are: t3, t6, t9, t11, t18, t33, t40, t47, t54, t58, t60, t65, t68, t71, t73, t78, t80, t81, t9 (since t9 might be a typo, but in the string it's written as t9 and t9...).\n\nLooking back at the productions, I see:\n\nNT72 \u2192 't9' (I think earlier I might have misread). Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT26 \u2192 t42, NT56 \u2192 t62, NT41 \u2192 t9. Hmm. Let me check NT4 \u2192 t54, NT31 \u2192 t50, NT5 \u2192 t39, NT49 \u2192 t40, NT53 \u2192 t48, NT67 \u2192 t6, NT9 \u2192 t0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for t65 in the productions. I don't see any NT65 as a terminal. So, that's a problem. So if t65 is the first symbol in the string, but there's no production where NT65 produces a terminal. So that would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake and there is a production that leads to t65. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 t62\n- NT56 \u2192 t62 is another production, no. Wait, looking at the list:\n\n productions include:\n\nNT61 -> NT18 NT18\n\n...\n\nLooking for any NT that produces t65 directly. I see NT42 \u2192 t68, but that's not helpful. NT56 \u2192 t62, NT58 \u2192 t61, NT41 \u2192 t9, etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t65, which is not a direct terminal in any of the productions. So that would indicate that the grammar can't produce t65 as the first symbol, hence the entire string isn't valid. So the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Suppose the string starts with t65, but perhaps t65 is derived from some combination of non-terminals.\n\nFor example, if t65 is the result of NT65 \u2192 a b, but a and b would have to be non-terminals. But since t65 is a terminal, it would have to be a production like NT65 \u2192 t65. But looking through the productions, I don't see any NT65. So, t65 isn't a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the first symbol t65 can't be derived from any production starting from S or any other non-terminal, since no production ends with t65.\n\nTherefore, the string is invalid, and the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: \"t65 t40 t47 t43 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t29 t40 t43 t24 t9 t80 t29 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t72\".\n\nI notice that each token is a terminal, so I need to see how they can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S, which can produce products of non-terminals. Let's look at S's productions: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Both options involve non-terminals that need to be expanded until we get terminals.\n\nLet me try expanding using S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So the first part is NT13, and the second part is NT69.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So, I need to expand NT70 and NT46.\n\nNT70: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. Let's expand those.\n\nNT76: Looking in the grammar, I don't see NT76 being listed as a non-terminal. Wait, maybe it's a terminal, but let me double-check. No, all non-terminals are listed with arrows from other non-terminals. So NT76 isn't in the list, which might mean it's a terminal, but that doesn't make sense because all the productions should involve non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, NT77 and others are, but not NT76. Hmm. Maybe NT76 is not present, so perhaps there's a mistake in the parsing. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider another production for S: S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Let me see if that path can lead to the string.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54'. Okay, that's the first part of the string: 't54'. Wait, no, the string starts with 't65', not 't54'. So if we're taking the other production, S \u2192 NT47 NT77, wait no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, looking back, the first production is S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So if we take S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then the first symbol should come from NT13's expansion. But in the string, the first symbol is 't65', which is from NT3 \u2192 't65', or maybe from NT73, which also goes to 't9' and others. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the NTs in the grammar directly expand to 't65'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't65', except maybe via chains. Wait, 't65' is produced by NT3 and NT4. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't3' and NT4 \u2192 't54'. Oh, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me read the productions again carefully. Looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't9'\nNT56 \u2192 't62'\nNT16 \u2192 't28'\nNT38 \u2192 't47'\nNT77 \u2192 't47'\nNT53 \u2192 't48'\nNT67 \u2192 't6'\nNT9 \u2192 't0' etc.\n\nWait, 't65' is produced by NT3, which is a non-terminal. But in the grammar, where does NT3 come from? Let me check. Looking back, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT10 NT9. So to get 't65', the production for NT3 would have to come from NT3 \u2192 't3' but 't3' is not 't65'. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the list, under NT78, it says NT78 \u2192 't33', wait no:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't65'\n\nWait, hold on: under the list, I see:\n\n\"NT34 -> NT61 NT47\n\nNT73 -> 't9'\n\n... Wait, looking through the list again, I see:\n\nLooking at the list, I realize that some items might be misaligned. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar list:\n\nThe lines are as follows (simplified for brevity):\n\n...\nNT62 -> 't71'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nNT9 -> 't3' etc.\n\nSo, I'm seeing that NT3 \u2192 't65', which suggests that NT3 can directly produce 't65'. Similarly, there are other NTs that produce 't40', 't47', etc.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't65', then perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT69 or S \u2192 NT77 NT... Wait, no, wait: the initial productions are S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77, but there's no NT3 in the initial productions. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong initial step.\n\nWait, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT13 NT69, S \u2192 NT4 NT77, etc. So if the first symbol is 't65', which comes from NT3, then perhaps that comes from a different production. Wait, unless there's a way for S to produce NT3 somewhere, but the initial productions don't suggest that.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I'm confusing NT3 with another symbol. Since the initial productions for S are NT13 and NT4, maybe the first symbol 't65' doesn't come directly from S, but from one of those non-terminals expanded from S.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then expanding NT13 to, say, NT70 NT46. Then NT70 to NT76 NT7, but I don't see NT76, so that might not work. Alternatively, maybe I need to find a way for one of the non-terminals to produce 't65'. Since NT3 \u2192 't65', perhaps that's a key part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't65', which comes from NT3. So, perhaps in the expansion, we need to have a non-terminal that eventually produces 't65'.\n\nBut the initial productions of S are NT13 NT69 and NT4 NT77. If none of these directly produce 't65', unless through some expansion, then maybe that path isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the string is generated in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with S \u2192 NT77 NT... Let me check S's other production: S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54', but the string starts with 't65', so that's a mismatch. So perhaps that's not the path.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, there is an NT5 that eventually produces 't39', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to combine multiple paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. Since the grammar and string can be complex, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps I can look for inconsistencies. For example, let's see if the string contains 't9' and other terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: 't65', 't40', 't47', 't43', 't24', etc.\n\nI notice that 't9' appears multiple times. Let's see where 't9' comes from. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT31 NT45\n\nNT31 \u2192 't50'\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n\nHmm, so maybe this path leads to 't50' and more. Alternatively, looking at other NTs:\n\nNT74 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47\n\nWait, perhaps 't47' is produced by several NTs. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there is a 't9' from NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62, and then NT46 and NT62 could produce something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first 't65' in the string, it's from NT3 \u2192 't65'. So how can we get 't65'? It must come from NT3, which suggests that NT3 is derived from S via some path. But looking at the initial productions, S does not directly expand into NT3 unless there's a way through some intermediate"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT47, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals until they reach terminals (like 'tX', letters that are terminal symbols). \n\nThe string is a sequence of these 'tX' symbols. My goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string length, it's 46 symbols. Since the grammar starts with S, which is a non-terminal, each expansion step adds more symbols but starts with two symbols (each rule has two non-terminals on the right). However, since the initial expansion from S will have two non-terminals, each subsequent expansion can add more, leading to the total count of symbols increasing by one each time a non-terminal is expanded.\n\nBut since the string has 46 symbols, it would have gone through 46-1=45 expansions. That's a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or a way to map the symbols.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the two possible productions are S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77. So the string must start with either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. But looking at the string, the first symbol is 't65'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals end with 't65' or are involved in generating 't65'? \n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT4 -> 't54', NT62 -> 't42', NT32 -> 't11', NT5 -> 't39', NT49 -> 't40', NT53 -> 't48', NT67 -> 't6', NT9 -> 't0'. So none of these directly produce 't65'.\n\nWait, but maybe 't65' is generated by a non-terminal that itself is derived from a chain. Let me look up which non-terminals lead to 't65'. \n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT1 -> 't3', which is a terminal. But that's not helpful. Wait, other non-terminals may directly produce 't65'. Scanning through, I see NT47 -> 't84' which isn't helpful. NT77 -> 't47' and 't34', so no. NT41 -> 't9', which isn't 't65'. Hmm, maybe looking at the rules where the right-hand side includes 't65'.\n\nLooking through all rules, the only one that ends with 't65' is NT46 -> 't58', which doesn't help. Wait, perhaps I need to check if any non-terminal in the grammar directly produces 't65'. Looking through all rules, I don't see any that do. That means that 't65' must appear as part of a chain where non-terminals are expanded to reach it. \n\nWait, but if none of the non-terminals directly produce 't65', perhaps 't65' is generated by another rule. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check:\n\nLooking at all the rules, each only defines some non-terminals in terms of other non-terminals or terminals. None have 't65' as a terminal, meaning that either 't65' isn't present in the grammar or I'm missing a rule. Wait, looking again, perhaps I see in the rules: NT13 -> 't65'. Yes, that's it. So NT13 is a non-terminal that directly expands into 't65'.\n\nSo, if the string has 't65', it must come from an NT13 production. So the first two symbols of the string should come from either the first production of S, which starts with NT13 and NT69. So the first symbol is 't65' from NT13, which is a terminal, so the next symbol should come from NT69.\n\nLooking at NT69 -> 't67' and 't6'. But in the string after 't65', the next symbol is 't85'. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, if the first symbol is 't65', but it's the first symbol of the string, and if S starts with NT4 and NT77, then NT4 could be 't54', not 't65', so that wouldn't work. \n\nWait, that suggests that 't65' can't be the first symbol if S expands via NT4. Alternatively, if S uses the other production, NT4 and NT77, then NT4 can't give 't65'. Therefore, the string starts with 't65' can only come from NT13, but then the next symbol must be from NT69, which is supposed to produce 't67' or 't6', but in the string, it's 't85', which doesn't match. \n\nSo that suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first two symbols would require NT69 to produce 't85', but according to the rules, NT69 only expands into 't67' and 't6'. Therefore, the string starts with 't65' and 't85', which isn't possible because NT69 can't produce 't85'. \n\nHence, the string is not generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, that's quite long, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form looks like. CNF is a set of productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That helps because we can apply the standard parsing algorithm for CNF grammars, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just evaluating the string, maybe it's easier to simulate the derivation.\n\nBut wait, since the string is in terms of terminal symbols, maybe I can work backwards.

For example, NT56 \u2192 't50', NT77 \u2192 't47', NT41 \u2192 't9', etc. So any occurrence of these non-terminals in the string would be replaced by their respective terminals.\n\nI can create a list of all the production rules where the LHS is a non-terminal and the RHS is a terminal. Let me jot those down:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT68 \u2192 't6' (Wait, NT68's production is \u2192 NT12 NT69, which are non-terminals. Wait, that's different from what I thought.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The string starts with 't65', so I should check which non-terminal can produce 't65'. Looking at the rules, I spot NT3 -> 't65' and NT4 -> 't54'. Wait, but other rules have 't' terminals, so I need to see what each non-terminal can generate.\n\nThe string is: t65 t85 t58 t31 t17 t24 t9 t48 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t31 t40 t43 t43 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t84 t7 t50 t58 t50 t43 t43 t28.\n\nI'll try to parse this string using the grammar, treating it as a leftmost derivation. Starting from S, I need to see how the string is constructed.\n\nS can be derived from NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT69? Wait, looking back, the rules are S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT47? Wait no, looking at the grammar, S is split into two different options: S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT47 NT67? Wait no, looking again, the first S rule is S -> NT13 NT69, and the second is S -> NT47 NT69, maybe? Wait, let me check the grammar properly.\n\nLooking at the initial grammar lines:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nS \u2192 NT47 NT69\n\nWait, no, looking at the initial context, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nThen a bunch of NT rules and terminals.\n\nSo S has two production rules: one that starts with NT13 NT69, and another that starts with NT47. Wait, looking closer, S's first rule is S -> NT13 NT69, and the second is S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, actually, in the user's message, the grammar has S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT47 NT69? Or is the second rule S \u2192 NT47 something else. Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"S -> NT47 NT69\" \u2013 no, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nFirst rule: S -> NT13 NT69\n\nSecond rule: S -> NT47 NT69\n\nWait no. Looking again, the user wrote:\n\n\"S -> NT13 NT69\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\"\n\nAh, right, so S can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT69? Or wait, no, the second line after S definitions is S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nSo first S rule is NT13 NT69, second is NT4 NT77. Are there any other S rules? It just says two S rules.\n\nSo the leftmost symbol must start with either NT13 or NT47? Wait, the first production is S \u2192 NT13 NT69, so the leftmost is NT13, and the second is S \u2192 NT47 NT69, so leftmost is NT47? Or wait, looking at the second production, it's S \u2192 NT47 NT69. So yes, leftmost could be NT47.\n\nWait, but in the user's grammar, S's production lines are:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\n\nS -> NT47 NT69\n\nSo each S starts with NT13 or NT47? Wait, no, the user's grammar as provided started with S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then S \u2192 NT4 NT77, then a long list of NT productions, but then in the NT3 line, it's NT3 -> 't65', etc.\n\nWait, this might have been a mistake while pasting, but I think the main point is that the initial S can be split into two options: one leading with NT13 and the other with NT47.\n\nBut looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"S -> NT13 NT69\n\nS -> NT47 NT69\"\n\nSo the two rules for S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\n2. S \u2192 NT47 NT69\n\nWait, but no, the second line after S is S \u2192 NT47 NT69, so S's productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nS \u2192 NT47 NT69\n\nWait, but that would mean that after S, the next symbols would be either NT13 followed by NT69 or NT47 followed by NT69.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t65, which can only be produced by NT3, not NT13 or NT47. So perhaps S must expand in a way that leads to NT3 somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check the grammar again. Looking at the user's grammar:\n\nLines starting with 'S -> ':\n\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\n- S \u2192 NT47 NT69\n\nWait no, no, in the user's message, the second S rule is S \u2192 NT47 NT69? Or is it S \u2192 NT4 NT77?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the user's grammar correctly.\n\nThe user provided the grammar as follows:\n\nGrammar:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\n\nS -> NT47 NT69\n\n... (long list of NT productions)\n\nSo S can expand into NT13 NT69 or NT47 NT69. So when deriving, at S, we choose between these two.\n\nBut the string starts with t65, which is produced by NT3. So that suggests that S must derive into something that eventually produces NT3.\n\nBut S's expansion starts with either NT13 or NT47. So perhaps S can't directly produce NT3. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at how the grammar allows S to derive NT3. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT47 NT69. So the string starts with t65, which comes from NT3, but NT13 and NT47 don't directly connect to NT3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT3 is part of one of these larger non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see that NT4 has a production to 't54', NT31 to 't50', etc. But none directly connect to NT3 as the start.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with t65, which could only come from NT3, but NT3 isn't an option in the S's initial productions. So S can't start with NT3, which suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe S can expand into a form that allows another expansion, leading to NT3 somewhere deeper.\n\nWait, but let's trace this.\n\nIf S is S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then the next symbols are the concatenation of NT13 and NT69.\n\nBut let's see what NT13 and NT69 can produce.\n\nLooking at the NT13 production: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT13 NT69, the next symbols are (NT13)(NT69) = (NT70 NT46)(something). But NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6.\n\nWait, hold on, let's see NT69's production. In the user's grammar, lines:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n\nSo in the first expansion, starting with S \u2192 NT13 NT69, we have NT13 and NT69, which become (NT70 NT46) and (NT23 NT6). So the next step would be to push the right-hand sides, leading to symbols after that, which would be more NTs, and so on, until we reach t symbols.\n\nSimilarly, if S \u2192 NT47 NT69, then NT47 can produce NT84 't7', and NT69 as before.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, I see NT47 \u2192 't9'. Wait, no, looking again, the user wrote:\n\nLooking back, the lines include:\n\nNT47 -> 't9'\n\nNT13 -> 't3'\n\nNT68 -> 't28'\n\nWait, no. Looking through the user's list, for example:\n\nNT13 -> 't3'\n\nNT47 -> 't9'\n\nSo if S expands to NT47 NT69, then NT47 immediately produces 't9', and NT69 produces 't23 t6'. So the first symbols after S would be 't9' followed by 't23' and 't6', but our string starts with t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-697","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. My goal is to determine whether the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that the start symbol cannot be on the right-hand side. Additionally, no rule has a left-hand side with more than one symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, most rules are indeed of the form A \u2192 BC, except for some that have a single terminal or non-terminal on the right. Wait, actually, in this grammar, all the right-hand sides seem to be exactly two symbols\u2014either two non-terminals or a combination of a non-terminal and a terminal. So that's consistent with CNF.\n\nNext, I need to understand how the terminal symbols map to actual terminal strings. The rules where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal (without any non-terminal on the right-hand side) directly map to their respective terminal values. For example, S -> NT13 NT69 means that S is composed of the two terminals corresponding to NT13 and NT69. So each NT... is a non-terminal that eventually resolves to a terminal string.\n\nNow, the given string is: `t54 t17 t47 t40 t43 t11 t9 t48 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t85 t58 t50 t43 t40 t43 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t17 t7 t58 t43 t28`.\n\nThe first step is to parse this string into its component terminals and see how they correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. Each token prefixed with 't' is a terminal symbol. For example, 't54' corresponds to NT54, 't17' to NT17, and so on.\n\nMy approach will be to reconstruct the derivation starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived by expanding non-terminals according to the production rules until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, matching the given string.\n\nLet me first list out all the NT to terminal mappings based on the provided rules:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t4\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT5 \u2192 t5 (from S production rules, I see S can go to NT47 NT69 or others, but let's get all mappings):\nLooking through the rules, I'll make a list of NT and their corresponding terminals:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3\nNT3 \u2192 t65\nNT4 \u2192 t54\nNT5 \u2192 t39\nNT6 \u2192 t18\nNT7 \u2192 t44\nNT9 \u2192 t0\nNT10 \u2192 ?\nWait, looking through the rules, some NT have terminals mapped directly:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t39\nNT10 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, actually, I need to create a comprehensive list. Let's go through each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n- NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29\n- NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36\n- NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n- NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6\n- NT60 \u2192 NT38 NT18\n- NT9 \u2192 NT31 NT45\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT12 NT69\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT45\n- NT29 \u2192 NT42 NT68\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62\n- NT58 \u2192 NT61 NT3\n- NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78\n- NT5 \u2192 NT83 NT9\n- NT21 \u2192 NT73 NT53\n- NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n- NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT18\n- NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT58\n- NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT10 \u2192 NT68 NT58\n- NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21\n- NT12 \u2192 NT38 NT67\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80\n- NT53 \u2192 NT17 NT38\n- NT53 \u2192 NT80 NT69\n- NT34 \u2192 NT61 NT47\n- NT70 \u2192 NT60 NT13\n- NT3 \u2192 NT10 NT9\n- NT61 \u2192 NT15 NT47\n- NT23 \u2192 NT73 NT41\n- NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16\n- NT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69\n- NT56 \u2192 't15'\u2014Wait, looking back, I think some entries end with a single 't' or a number. Let me parse each rule correctly:\n\nLooking more carefully, some rules end with just a terminal, with or without a number. For example:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3\nWait, no, looking again: Actually, the rules are written as NT5 \u2192 't39', which means NT5 maps directly to 't39'. Similarly:\n\nFor example:\nNT5 \u2192 NT38 NT74 --> non-terminal\nNT31 \u2192 't50'\nSo, each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal (like 't50').\n\nWait, no. Wait a second, the production rules are written as A \u2192 NT...., so for example, NT5 \u2192 't39' means that NT5 can be replaced directly with the terminal 't39', not a non-terminal. Similarly, some have two non-terminals.\n\nSo, I need to create a mapping from all NT symbols to their corresponding terminals (if they are terminals directly). Let's list them:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3\nNT3 \u2192 t65\nNT4 \u2192 t54\nNT5 \u2192 t39\nNT6 \u2192 t18\nNT7 \u2192 t44\nNT9 \u2192 t0\nNT10 \u2192 ? Looking through the rules, NT10 is referred to in some right-hand sides, but is it replaced directly? Wait, looking for a rule where NT10 is on the left. I don't see a rule that has NT10 \u2192 something. So, what does that mean? Perhaps NT10 is a non-terminal and needs to be produced by other rules, but since there's no rule for NT10, it's undefined or can't resolve, which could be a problem.\n\nWait, let's check all the rules again to make sure:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT6 \u2192 t18\n- NT7 \u2192 t44\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT10 \u2192 is there a rule? Looking in the production list, I don't see a rule for NT10. Hmm, maybe the NT10 rule is missing, which would be problematic because the grammar can't generate any string that involves NT10 unless it's defined.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the structure of the string and the grammar. The string is a sequence of t-commands. From the grammar, I can see that terminals are denoted with 't' followed by a number. For example, 't50' is a terminal. So, each t-... in the string must correspond to a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some rules: \n\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT69: This starts the derivation. So, the string must start with a sequence that eventually starts with NT13 leading to 't65' and NT69 leading to 't29'. Wait, wait\u2014 hold on, no. Let me look at the productions again.\n\nWait, let me list some key productions that end with t-...:\n\nFor example, NT26 \u2192 t42, NT31 \u2192 t50, NT3 \u2192 t3, etc. Also, NT1 \u2192 t3, NT4 \u2192 t54, NT5 \u2192 t39, etc.\n\nBreaking down the string into components separated by spaces: the string is:\n\nt65 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t62 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t84 t81 t9 t9 t18 t43 t40 t6 t65 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t6 t65 t43 t65 t58 t71 t58 t43 t58 t43 t28\n\nSo, 44 tokens in total.\n\nNow, the start symbol S produces NT13 NT69. So, the first step is to get t65 and then ... Wait, NT13 \u2192 t65. Because looking at the grammar, NT13 is rewritten as NT70 NT46. Then, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7. Wait, maybe I need to track each step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if I can parse the string starting from S.\n\nThe string starts with t65. Looking at the grammar, NT1 \u2192 t3.

Wait, perhaps it's getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe an alternative approach is to see each t in the string and their possible rules. For example, the first token is t65, which can be produced by NT3, as well as NT31 (NT31 \u2192 t50), but t65 needs to be matched. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t65.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t44. Also, NT... Wait, the rules don't seem to have any non-terminal that directly produces t65.

Maybe the string starts with t65, which is the terminal from NT3. Then, the next is t9, which comes from NT4?

Alternatively, perhaps the t-65 comes from NT65, but I don't see any NT producing t65. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the entire list of grammar rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t65. So, perhaps the first token t65 can't come from any rule. But S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Let's see what NT13 and NT69 derive to.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\nNT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7\nNT79 \u2192 NT73 NT41\nNT73 \u2192 t9\nNT41 \u2192 t9\nSo, NT76 \u2192 t73 (t9) and then t41 (t9) \u2192 so NT76 generates t9 t9.\n\nWait, but NT76 is a non-terminal, and the rule for NT76 is NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7, which then eventually becomes t9 t9.\n\nSo, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 \u2192 t9 t9 NT7, then NT7 \u2192 t44. So, that would produce t9 t9 t44.\n\nBut the string starts with t65, which isn't t9 or t44, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by checking each step.\n\nWait, maybe the first token t65 is from NT3. Let me check. NT3 \u2192 t3. Hmm, that gives t3, but we have t65.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way NT1 \u2192 t3, but the token is t65. This seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the structure. Maybe the string is being generated by the grammar, but the way the non-terminals break down is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production must split into two non-terminals, one that leads to the first part of the string and the other to the latter part.\n\nSo, the string is 44 tokens. Let me count in parts: the first half is t65 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t62 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t84, and the second half is t81 t9 t9 t18 t43 t40 t6 t65 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t6 t65 t43 t65 t58 t71 t58 t43 t58 t43 t28.\n\nWait, maybe not. I think each NT can be processed independently in the string, but the string represents a fully reduced form, not a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct a parse tree for the string. Let me think: S must derive to the string.\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo, the first part is NT13, which might produce t65, but from earlier, NT13 seems to produce t9 t9 something. Wait, perhaps I missed a rule.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules again. Here's NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, NT7 \u2192 t44.\n\nSo, NT70 becomes t44, and NT76 breaks down into NT79 and NT7.\n\nWait, no, NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7, which becomes t9 t9. Then, NT70 becomes t44 (from NT7 \u2192 t44) and t9 t9. So, NT70 becomes t44 t9 t9.\n\nBut the string starts with t65, which isn't t44, so that can't be the case.

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token must correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in CNF, every production rule has a non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because each production like S -> NT13 NT13... has exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: `t65 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t40 t84 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t11 t9 t48 t3 t60 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t81 t9 t9 t18 t17 t7 t0 t50 t58 t31 t17 t28`. Each token is either a number (probably representing a non-terminal or a terminal) or 't' followed by a number, which likely represents a terminal symbol.\n\nI'll need to see if this string can be generated starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which in the given grammar can be rewritten as NT47 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So the production for S is always two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will then be expanded using the productions in the grammar.\n\nThe first step is to parse the string and see if it can be constructed by S's first production. So, the string needs to start with S's expansion, which is either NT47 NT69 or NT4 NT77.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t65, t9, t9, t9, t18... I need to match this to one of the productions.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the non-terminals are represented by numbers, and the terminals are 't' followed by a number. So each non-terminal in the production corresponds to a specific production rule.\n\nLet me list out the productions where numbers appear on the right-hand side.\n\nFor example, NT47 -> something. Let's see the given grammar rules:\n\nNT47 -> t84 (since NT47 is rewritten as 't84'). Wait, looking back, the rule is NT47 -> 't84', so if NT47 is used, the string would have t84.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 -> 't54', and so on.\n\nWait, but the input string starts with t65, which could correspond to a non-terminal. Let's see which non-terminal expands to t65.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can search for where nt65 is produced.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT66 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't85'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- ... etc.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, the tokens are 't65', which could be a terminal, but 't65' seems like a possible terminal, but in the grammar, are there any productions that produce 't65'?\n\nWait, the provided grammar doesn't have any production for t65. So if the string has 't65', that's a problem because that non-terminal must expand to a terminal symbol. But if it's a non-terminal, that would mean there's a production rule for NT65, which isn't present in the given grammar.\n\nWait, in the list, looking for 't65' in the right-hand sides:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT66 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't85'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT67 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't81'\n- NT34 -> 't9'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT74 -> 't47'\n- NT32 -> 't11'\n- NT61 -> 't62'\n- NT26 -> 't42'\n- NT15 -> 't40'\n- NT32 -> 't24'\n- NT42 -> 't60'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT61 -> 't17'\n- NT78 -> 't72'\n- NT38 -> 't47'\n- NT83 -> 't7'\n- NT80 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT56 -> 't62'\n- NT16 -> 't28'\n- NT38 -> 't29'\n- NT33 -> 't85'\n- NT78 -> 't33'\n- NT6 -> 't18'\n- NT18 -> 't43'\n- NT7 -> 't44'\n- NT56 -> 't31'\n- NT76 -> 't79'\n- NT7 -> 't23'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- ... etc.\n\nLooking specifically, I see that NT3 is 't65' and NT4 is also 't65'. So NT3 and NT4 both expand to 't65'. So in the production, if any of these NTs appear, they produce 't65'.\n\nSo looking back at the string: it starts with 't65', which could be either NT3 or NT4. That's acceptable.\n\nSo let's assume the string starts with NT3 or NT4. Since the grammar's starting symbol S has two options, we might need to explore both, but perhaps one will lead us astray quickly.\n\nLet's take the first possibility: S -> NT47 NT69.\n\nSo the first production after S is NT47 and NT69. Each of these must expand into a terminal or non-terminal symbol.\n\nSo, starting with NT47, based on the grammar, NT47 -> 't84'? Wait no, looking at the grammar rules, let me find where NT47 is.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT47 is in the list? Let me check.\n\nThe rules provided are as follows (abbreviated):\n\nNT47 -> NT84? Or in the given list, do I see NT47's production?\n\nLooking through the list, I remember that some non-terminals have 't' as their expansion. For example, NT3 -> t65.\n\nWait, in the given rules, for NT47, I recall it's in the list as:\n\nNT47 -> 't84'? Or is it another production.\n\nWait, in the given list, let's see:\n\nNT34 -> 't9'\n...\nLooking for NT47, in the given rules, do any have NT47 as the left side. Let me scan the list:\n\n- NT47 is in the third line: 'NT4 -> t54', no, that's for NT4.\n\nWait, let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT47's production is listed later as:\n\nNT47 -> 't84' or another option.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is:\n\nLooking at the list more carefully:\n\nNT13 -> NT70 NT46\n...\nLooking for NT47.

{"custom_id":"request-714","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the rules.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S can produce NT13 NT69. So the production for S is always going to involve these twoNT symbols. Looking at the rules, both NT13 and NT69 can further break down into other NT symbols. Each of these might continue to split until I reach terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers: `t65 t43 t43 t47 t43 t47 t40 t6 t65 t11 t9 t48 t58 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t40 t24 t9 t48 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t7 t28`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production step replaces an NT symbol with two other NT symbols, except for the terminal symbols. So, I can model this as a parse tree where each node is an NT symbol, and each edge corresponds to a production.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in reverse: starting from the string, try to merge pairs of 't's according to the grammar's reverse productions. That might be a systematic way to check if the string can be reduced down to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list out all the NT symbols and their productions to see which ones can produce 't' symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, many NT symbols end up as 'tXX' where XX is a number. These are the terminal symbols. For example:\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT18 -> 't43'\n- NT29 -> 't68'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT77 -> 't47'\n- NT70 -> 't76' (But wait, NT70 has further productions; let me check.)\n\nWait, actually, some NT symbols first produce other NT symbols and then eventually reach the terminal 't's. For example, NT70 -> NT76 NT7, and NT76 -> NT60 NT13, NT7 -> 't44'. So, to get 't's, the chain of productions needs to reach a terminal.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if each 'tX' in the string can be generated by some NT symbol. If all the symbols in the string can be derived from the grammar's NT symbols, then it's possible. But more importantly, the way they are grouped must follow the grammar's rules.\n\nAnother approach is to start from the string and try to merge pairs of symbols according to the grammar's reverse rules. If I can reduce the entire string to S, which is NT13 NT69, then the string is acceptable.\n\nLet me list all the NT symbols in the grammar and note which ones can produce terminals.\n\nWait, this might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can identify which NT symbols directly produce the 't' sequences in the string.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n- 't65' appears twice.\n- 't43' appears three times.\n- 't47' appears twice.\n- 't40' once.\n- 't6' once.\n- 't11' once.\n- 't9' appears many times.\n- 't18' appears twice.\n- 't85' once.\n- 't58' appears twice.\n- 't50' once.\n- 't24' once.\n- 't9' in the latter part.\n\nI need to check if these 't' symbols can be produced by NT symbols in the grammar, and the sequence should match.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nFor example, NT4 -> 't54' \u2192 doesn't produce 't65'.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each 'tX' in the string and see if there is an NT symbol that can produce it.\n\nWait, for instance, 't65' is produced by NT13: NT13 -> NT70 NT46, then NT70 -> NT76 NT7, NT76 -> NT60 NT13, and so on. Hmm, but looking at the rules, ultimately NT70 will lead to NT76 and NT7, which then split more, leading eventually to terminals. It might be that 't65' is a terminal, but do any NT symbols produce 't65'?\n\nLooking through, I see NT3 is 't65'. So NT3 can directly produce 't65' via NT3 -> 't65'.\n\nSimilarly, 't43' is produced by NT18. NT18 -> 't43'.\n\nWait, no, NT18's production is NT49 NT80. So NT18 doesn't directly produce 't43'. Let me check: NT49 -> 't40', NT80 -> 't43'. So NT18 is NT49 NT80, which are both terminals, so 't40 t43' comes from NT18. But in the string, we have 't43' appearing multiple times. So perhaps each 't43' is the result of NT46 or other NT symbols that can produce 't43'.\n\nWait, NT42 -> 't68', NT12 -> 't81', NT34 -> 't9', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the reverse process. Start from the string and try to combine pairs into NT symbols.\n\nLet me start the reduction:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt65 t43 t43 t47 t43 t47 t40 t6 t65 t11 t9 t48 t58 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t40 t24 t9 t48 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t7 t28.\n\nI need to merge pairs starting from the right, using the reverse productions.\n\nLet me list all the tokens with their positions:\n\n1. t65\n2. t43\n3. t43\n4. t47\n5. t43\n6. t47\n7. t40\n8. t6\n9. t65\n10. t11\n11. t9\n12. t48\n13. t58\n14. t58\n15. t3\n16. t68\n17. t81\n18. t9\n19. t9\n20. t18\n21. t9\n22. t9\n23. t18\n24. t42\n25. t85\n26. t58\n27. t50\n28. t40\n29. t24\n30. t9\n31. t48\n32. t3\n33. t68\n34. t81\n35. t9\n36. t9\n37. t18\n38. t7\n39. t28\n\nI will try to group them from the end, looking for two 't's that can come from an NT production.\n\nStarting with the last token, t28.

Looking at the rules, there's no NT that directly produces t28. Hmm, wait, looking at NT53: it can go to 't48' or 't47'. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the rules, there's NT53 -> 't48' and NT53 -> 't47'. But I don't see any NT symbol that produces 't28' directly. That's a problem because our string ends with t28, which may not have a corresponding NT symbol that can produce it.

{"custom_id":"request-734","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to figure out if it's valid based on the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. The grammar consists of several production rules, each starting with a non-terminal symbol on the left and combining two non-terminals or terminals on the right. For example, S -> NT13 NT69, meaning the start symbol S is replaced by NT13 and NT69. The NT symbols are other non-terminals, and some of them eventually expand into terminals, which are the actual letters or numbers in the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t85 t58 t50 t40 t29 t40 t43 t47 t43 t24 t9 t6 t65 t9 t9 t18 t58 t58 t3 t60 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t24 t9 t48 t3 t68 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t33`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived through the grammar. Let's break down the approach.\n\n1. **Identify Terminal Tokens**: The string consists mainly of terminal symbols (the t followed by numbers). The non-terminals are represented by NT followed by numbers. So, my first step is to map the string's tokens into non-terminals where applicable.\n\n2. **Check for Allowed Rules**: Look for production rules that match the string's structure. Each production in the grammar splits into exactly two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals. So, every two tokens in the string should correspond to two parts of a production.\n\n3. **Start with the Start Symbol S**: The start symbol is S, which produces NT13 and NT69. So, the entire string must be derived from S. That means the first expansion should be S, leading to NT13 and NT69. Each of these non-terminals then expands further until they reach terminals.\n\n4. **Tracing Backwards**: Another approach is to reverse the process, starting from the string and trying to reduce it to S by applying inverse productions. This might be more efficient because sometimes the string can be broken down step by step from the end.\n\nWait, actually, since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can work backwards from the string to see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nLet's think about the string in terms of pairs. Every two tokens should correspond to the right-hand side of a production. Let's list the string as a sequence of tokens and try to match them to production rules.\n\nThe string is: \nt54, t85, t58, t50, t40, t29, t40, t43, t47, t43, t24, t9, t6, t65, t9, t9, t18, t58, t58, t3, t60, t29, t6, t9, t9, t18, t24, t9, t48, t3, t68, t29, t6, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t33.\n\nI need to see if this can be grouped into pairs that match the RHS of some production.\n\nLet me try to process the string step by step, trying to reduce tokens.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first two tokens are t54 and t85. Looking at the grammar, the rule for NT54 is: NT5 -> 't39'. Wait, that's a terminal. But NT54 is a non-terminal; there's no production for that, so maybe I'm looking at the wrong approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for all possible production rules that result in terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n\nSo, NT5, when expanded, becomes 't39'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at other non-terminals:\n\n- NT32 -> 't11'\n- NT34 -> 't9'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT61 -> 't62'\n- NT66 -> 't13' (but we're looking for terminals)\nWait, no, non-terminals that produce terminals can be identified as those rules that end with -> 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, let's list out all non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT32 -> 't11'\n- NT34 -> 't9'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT61 -> 't62'\n- NT58 -> 't31'?\nWait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT5: 't39'\n- NT18: 't43' (Wait, wait, no. Let me look again.)\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let's check each production to see which non-terminals expand into a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT5 -> 't39'\n- NT32 -> 't11'\n- NT34 -> 't9'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT3 -> 't65'\n- NT4 -> 't65'\n- NT5 -> 't39' (same as before)\n- NT18 -> 't43' yes\n- NT9 -> 't0' wait, in the rules, looking for 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, I need to correct myself: The rules that convert non-terminals to terminals are those that have a production where RHS is just 't' followed by a number, like 't5', 't6', etc.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT5 -> t39 \u2192 terminal\nNT32 -> t11 \u2192 terminal\nNT34 -> t9 \u2192 terminal\nNT42 -> t68 \u2192 terminal\nNT46 -> t58 \u2192 terminal\nNT3 -> t65 \u2192 terminal\nNT4 -> t65 \u2192 terminal\nNT18 -> t43 \u2192 terminal\nNT9 -> t0 \u2192 terminal\nNT27? Or looking for others:\n\nNT17 -> 't80' Oh, but 't80' is not a single terminal, because each 't' is followed by a number, so 't80' is a token, but in the rules, 't80' isn't a terminal. Wait, 't80' might be a terminal in the grammar's context, but in the string, it's a token.\n\nWait, hold on. The string has 't54', 't85', etc. So these are all terminals because they start with 't' followed by a number, not 't' followed by another 't'.\n\nSo any non-terminal that has a production rule where the RHS is just 't' followed by a number is a terminal. Let's compile a list:\n\nFrom the given grammar rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t39 \u2192 terminal\nNT32 \u2192 t11 \u2192 terminal\nNT34 \u2192 t9 \u2192 terminal\nNT42 \u2192 t68 \u2192 terminal\nNT46 \u2192 t58 \u2192 terminal\nNT3 \u2192 t65 \u2192 terminal\nNT4 \u2192 t65 \u2192 terminal\nNT18 \u2192 t43 \u2192 terminal\nNT77 \u2192 t47 \u2192 terminal (but t47 is also in the string: in the string, I see 't47'?\nWait, in the string, I don't see 't47', but let me check the string:\n\nThe string is: t54, t85, t58, t50, t40, t29, t40, t43, t47, t43, t24, t9, t6, t65, t9, t9, t18, t58, t58, t3, t60, t29, t6, t9, t9, t18, t24, t9, t48, t3, t68, t29, t6, t9, t9, t18, t9, t9, t18, t33.\n\nWait, there's 't43', but not 't47'.

{"custom_id":"request-763","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It consists of a start symbol S and several production rules. Each non-terminal (like S, NT4, etc.) can produce two other non-terminals until eventually, some of them produce terminal symbols like 't1', 't2', etc., down to 't50' or even the empty string, I think? Wait, actually, some of the terminals look like they're numeric, maybe they represent strings or are part of the generated string.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms: `t54 t62 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t62 t62 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t79 t23 t58 t3 t68 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t17 t65 t0 t50 t58 t50 t43 t43 t28`. So, the task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, the parsing can be done using a method like the CYK algorithm or by attempting to derive the string step by step. Since I'm more comfortable with the latter, I'll try that approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S branches into two: S -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77. So, the first two symbols of the string must come from these productions. Let's check the string: the first term is t54. Let me see if either NT13 or NT4 can produce something that starts with t54.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT56 -> 't62', NT49 -> 't40', etc. So, I need to see if any of the NTs in the productions can lead to a terminal like t54.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT56 -> 't62', NT47 -> 't84', etc. Hmm, but t54 isn't directly a terminal in the productions I can see from the grammar provided. Wait, let me double-check the rules.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of rules. Let me scan them for any NT that produces t54. Scanning through the NTs, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't54'\nOh, right! So NT4 can produce 't54'. So, if the first part of the string is 't54', then that must come from NT4.\n\nSo, looking at the string, the first token is t54, which would be from NT4. So, the first production at S must be S -> NT4 NT77. Because NT4 is the one that gives us t54.\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string are t54 and then the next one is t62. So, the first symbol is from NT4 (t54), the next is t62.\n\nLet's see what NT4 can produce. So, NT4 is a non-terminal. Looking at the rules, NT4 can produce 't54' (as we saw), but I need to check if NT4 can produce anything else that could lead to t62 in the next step. Hmm, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for any production that starts with NT4 and produces something that can lead to t62. Wait, the rules given don't seem to have NT4 producing anything else except the terminal 't54'. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, the only production for NT4 is NT4 -> 't54'. So, maybe that's it. So, once NT4 is used, it only produces 't54'.\n\nBut wait, in context-free grammars, a non-terminal can produce a terminal multiple ways, but here, it seems that NT4 can only produce 't54'. So, in the string, after t54, the next term would have to come from NT77 since S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, no. Because the S production is S -> NT4 NT77, so after NT4 produces 't54', the next symbol must come from NT77.\n\nSo, the next token is t62. So, T77 must produce 't62'. Let me check if NT77 can produce t62.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT77 -> 't47'. Oh, wait, that's not t62. So, that doesn't work. Alternatively, does NT77 produce anything else? Let me check the rules for NT77.\n\nLooking for NT77, the only rule is NT77 -> 't47'. So, NH77 can only produce 't47', not 't62'. Hmm, that's a problem because the next token is t62, which isn't produced by NT77.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. The string starts with t54. So, the first S production is S -> NT4 NT77, so the first symbol is NT4, which produces 't54' correctly. The next symbol is t62, which must come from NT77.\n\nBut looking at the rules, NT77 can't produce t62. So, that seems to be a dead end. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe I should check the other production of S, which is S -> NT5 NT0. Or wait, looking back, the grammar was:\n\nS-> NT13 NT69\n\nS-> NT4 NT77\n\nSo, the productions are S goes to NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nWait, looking at the initial production, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, in the problem statement, the grammar was presented as:\n\n```S -> NT13 NT16\nS -> NT4 NT77\n```\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar: S -> NT13 NT16\n\n            S -> NT4 NT77\n\nWait, but that's a bit confusing because in the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"S -> NT13 NT16\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\"\n\nWait, actually, no, the user wrote:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\n\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nWait, let me recheck.\n\nIn the problem, the provided grammar was:\n\n```S -> NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n```\n\nWait, the user later provided a more comprehensive list. But the initial grammar as presented in the problem has two productions for S: one branches into NT13 and NT69, the other into NT4 and NT77.\n\nSo, in the initial stage, from S, either (NT13, NT69) or (NT4, NT77) are output. So, the first step in parsing the string is to choose which production to use.\n\nIn any case, the first symbol in the string is t54, which is produced by NT4, so we took the S -> NT4 NT77 path.\n\nSo, the first two symbols are t54 (from NT4) and then we need to figure out where t62 comes from. The next symbol is t62, so that must be the output of NT77.\n\nBut looking back, the NT77 production only gives 't47', not 't62'. So, that's a problem. Therefore, the S -> NT4 NT77 path doesn't seem to lead us correctly.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Perhaps the NT77 can derive a non-terminal that can in turn generate 't62'. Let me check if any of the non-terminals can produce NT77.\n\nWait, NT77 can only produce 't47', so it's a terminal symbol. Therefore, it can't produce anything else. So, that path is dead.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Maybe I should approach this differently by starting from the start symbol and trying to expand it step by step.\n\nLet me try to generate the string starting from S and see if it matches.\n\nFirst, S can be NT4 NT77 or NT13 NT69.\n\nGiven the string starts with t54, which is NT4's production, we take the S -> NT4 NT77 path.\n\nSo, the first step is S => NT4 NT77.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t62. We just saw that NT77 can't produce t62.

{"custom_id":"request-762","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it's a bit complex with many rules. I notice that some non-terminals have direct terminal productions, which might be useful. For example, rules like S \u2192 NT47 NT13 NT69 have terminals and non-terminals, so I might need to parse the string matching these terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t40 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t81 t9 t9 t18 t62 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t17 t7 t58 t71 t58 t6 t54 t28`.\n\nI notice a lot of t tokens, some of which have numbers, which correspond to the terminals in the grammar. The left-hand side of each production is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nI think the strategy here is to use a top-down parsing approach, starting from the start symbol S. Let me see what rules S has:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo S starts with either NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77. Let me look at the first two tokens of the string: the first four tokens are t54 t9 t9 t9. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because S is two non-terminals. Wait, the entire string is a sequence of these t tokens; so maybe I need to split the string into the components that each production represents.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of how to parse this string step by step. Alternatively, maybe constructing a parse tree would help, but given the complexity, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can check whether the string is a correct sequence of symbols from these productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So the string must be built by replacing non-terminals with sequences of non-terminals or terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a better approach is to check if each terminal is replaced correctly according to the grammar.\n\nLet me note down the starting non-terminals: S can produce NT13 and NT69, or NT4 and NT77. Both options must be considered.\n\nI'll start by assuming the first production S \u2192 NT13 NT69:\n\nSo the first non-terminal is NT13, which in turn can produce other non-terminals or terminals. Let's see what NT13 can produce:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nSo NT13 produces NT70 and NT46. Now, looking at the string, the first token is t54. Let's check what NT70 can produce:\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7 or NT70 has another rule? Looking back, I see:\n\nWait, no, from the provided grammar:\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\n\nSo NT70 has to generate NT76 and NT7. Hmm. Or is there another rule for NT70? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, I need to look through the list. Let me find NT70:\n\nYes, here\u2019s NT70:\n\nNT70 -> NT76 NT7\n\nSo NT70 must be split into NT76 and NT7. Now, looking at the first part of the string, after t54, the next is t9. So if NT70 is splitting into NT76 and NT7, and the next token is t9, let's check NT7.\n\nLooking into the grammar, where does NT7 go?\n\nLooking through, I don't see any rule for NT7. Wait, but looking through all the non-terminals, perhaps NT7 is not defined? Or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse each token step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each production is composed of two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can eventually produce a terminal, either directly or through other non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to try to parse the entire string, treating it as a sequence of symbols that must be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, but another approach is to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol. Let me outline this:\n\nS is either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's take the first option: S \u2192 NT13 NT69.\n\nSo NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7.\n\nNow, the string starts with t54, so if NT70 is producing NT76 and NT7, then where does t54 come from? So, unless NT7 expands to t54.\n\nLooking into NT7:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I don't see a rule for NT7. So maybe I missed it. Let me check again the list.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals are listed, and I don't see any production for NT7. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with t54, and if NT70 leads to NT76 and NT7, but NT7 isn't defined, unless I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again:\n\nLooking for NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7: yes, that's correct. So NT70 is split into NT76 and NT7.\n\nNow, looking into NT7: do we have any production for NT7? It seems not. But the string starts with t54, which is a terminal. So unless NT7 can produce t54 somehow.\n\nBut according to the provided rules, NT7 isn't present; all non-terminals have their own rules, and perhaps NT7 is a dead end. That's a problem because the string requires t54 to appear, but if NT70 splits into NT76 and NT7, and we can't get to t54 from NT7, because NT7 isn't defined.\n\nWait, maybe I should try the other production for S first. Let's see:\n\nS can also produce NT4 and NT77. So S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me see NT4:\n\nLooking for NT4 in the grammar:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\n\nAh, yes! NT4 is directly a terminal 't54'. Perfect. So the first part checks out.\n\nNow, the second non-terminal in S's production is NT77. Let's see what NT77 produces:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78.\n\nSo NT77 will generate two non-terminals: NT51 and NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, after t54, the next token is t9, so let's see:\n\nWait, the string is:\n\nt54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t40 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9...\n\nWait, after S \u2192 NT4 (t54), the next non-terminal is NT77. So the next symbols should be the symbols generated by NT77.\n\nSo NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78.\n\nNow, the first symbol after t54 is t9, so maybe NT51 is t9.\n\nLooking at NT51:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69.\n\nSo NT51 must generate two non-terminals: NT34 and NT69.\n\nSo the next symbols should be the symbols produced by NT34 and NT69.\n\nThe string after t54 is t9, which would come from NT34 or NT69.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's outline this more clearly.\n\nThe string is: t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t40 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9...\n\nWe have S \u2192 NT4 (which is t54) \u2192 then NT77, which is followed by the next symbol, which is t9.\n\nSo after NT4, the next is NT77. So in the string, after t54 comes t9. So that would imply NT77 produces t9.\n\nBut NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78, both of which are non-terminals, so the next symbols must be generated by NT51 and NT78. So the first symbol after t54 should be the result of NT51, and the next from NT78.\n\nLooking at NT51's production:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69.\n\nSo NT51 produces NT34 and NT69. So the next two symbols after t54 should come from NT34 and NT69.\n\nBut the string is t54 followed by t9,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-781","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing. Let me start by understanding what each part of this task involves.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a start symbol S and various non-terminals and terminals. Each production rule in the grammar has exactly two non-terminals on the left-hand side or a non-terminal followed by a terminal on the right. That\u2019s consistent with Chomsky normal form, where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of tokens starting with t65, t85, etc., but looking closer, each t followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the grammar has production rules for each of these. My task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules.\n\nI'll start by looking at the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar has two main start rules: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So, the start symbol can produce either NT13 followed by NT69 or NT4 followed by NT77. Therefore, the string must derive from one of these two paths.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t65. Let's check the grammar for t65. The production for t65 is in the production rules: NT4 \u2192 't54' and NT5 \u2192 't39', but there's a NT65 that's in some cases. Wait, let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, for example, NT65 is present in some cases. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, I see lines like NT3 \u2192 't65', NT4 \u2192 't65', etc. So, t65 can be generated by NT3 or NT4. So, at the beginning of the string, it's t65, which can come from NT3 or NT4.\n\nBut let me go deeper. The string is t65 t85 t58 t62 t40 t11 t9 t43 t9 t9 t18 t3 t60 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t47 t43 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t43 t43 t65 t28.\n\nWait, each token is separated by a space, so the string is a sequence of these terminals. So, I need to parse this string by applying the grammar's productions step by step.\n\nGiven that the grammar has all productions as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, it's a good candidate for a recursive descent parser or a simple bottom-up approach, like the CYK algorithm. Since the problem allows any reasoning strategy, maybe I can build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break the string into parts that match parts of the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the first token t65. Looking at the grammar for NT65, I see that:\n\nFrom the given productions, for example:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't47', which means that NT77 can be t47. Also, NT65 appears in some rules, for example: NT77: NT58 could be the rule? Wait, no, let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the list of productions, for example:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69.

{"custom_id":"request-777","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with determining whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a series of terminal symbols (t0 to t79). \n\nCNF has the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This is helpful because it allows us to model the parsing process as a series of steps that either consume a terminal or expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals, which then can further break down.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example, S can go to NT13 NT69, and NT13 can go to 't0' and NT9. NT36 can go to 't78', and so on. These are anchors that allow us to navigate the string easily.\n\nSince the string is long, I'll try to parse it step by step, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until I either consume the entire string or run out of rules. This is a standard top-down approach, which works well with CNF grammars.\n\nStarting with the string: `t54 t40 t24 t9 t6 t65 t9 t9 t18 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t62 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t43 t40 t6 t65 t7 t0 t28`.\n\nI'll need to see if each part of the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\n1. The first two symbols are t54 and t40. Looking at the grammar, does any production start with 't54' or 't40'? Let's check the right-hand sides.\n\n   Looking through the productions, I see:\n   - NT41 \u2192 't9'\n   - NT31 \u2192 't50'\n   - NT5 \u2192 't39'\n   - NT9 \u2192 't0'\n   - NT4 \u2192 't54'\n\n   So, NT4 \u2192 t54, and NT31 \u2192 t50, but the string starts with t54. Wait, but in the grammar rules, I have:\n   NT4: S has a production that starts with NT4. Wait, actually, the production rules are all in the form of NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or a terminal. So I need to see if the starting symbol S can produce a terminal, or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which are both non-terminals. So I'll have to expand NT13 and NT69.\n\nLet's see what NT13 produces. The production is NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nThen, NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 t44. Wait, but let's clarify.\n\nWait, let me write the steps:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\n\nFirst, expand NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNow, I have NT70 and NT46 in the string to derive. The string starts with t54, but according to the production, NT70 is a non-terminal. So we need to expand NT70 and NT46.\n\nWait, but the initial expansion is that the string must start with the terminals produced from the starting symbols. So the first symbol is t54, but S goes to NT13 NT69, which are non-terminals. So when we start, according to the initial string, t54 must be produced by one of the rules after expanding the non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the initial step, the first terminal is t54. Let's look for any production that directly produces 't54'. Looking through the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 t54.\n\nSo perhaps the derivation starts with NT4, which goes directly to t54. But wait, S's right-hand side is NT13 and NT69, so the string should start with the output of NT13 followed by NT69.\n\nHmm, this is confusing because the string starts with t54, which might not directly correspond to S's initial productions. So maybe t54 isn't the first symbol generated by S. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string from the beginning. Let's attempt to match the string with the grammar.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, symbol by symbol, expanding the left-hand side when necessary.\n\nThe string is: t54 t40 t24 t9 t6 t65 t9 t9 t18 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t62 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t43 t40 t6 t65 t7 t0 t28.\n\nI'll need to see if this can be broken down into the productions.\n\nLet's start with the first symbol, t54. In the grammar, looking for any rules where A \u2192 t54. Checking the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 t54. So can we derive this as the first symbol?\n\nBut S's productions are S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So the first two symbols would be the output of NT13 followed by NT69. So perhaps t54 is the first symbol, which would require that NT13 \u2192 t54, but according to the grammar, NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So that's not possible because NT70 produces non-terminals.\n\nWait, so perhaps the initial expansion leads to non-terminals that can produce t54. Let me check each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the initial step is to parse the string starting with NT13 NT69, which would require that the first two terminals are the outputs of NT13 and NT69.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, and S goes to NT13 NT69. So the first two symbols of the string must be the outputs of NT13's expansion and NT69's expansion. But the string starts with t54, which is a single terminal. But S's first production creates two non-terminals, so that would require the first symbol to be a non-terminal, which can't be because the string starts with t54. Therefore, maybe the production used at the top level is different?\n\nWait no, the start symbol is S, which only has the productions given. So if S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then the first expansion must create t54 as part of that, but that seems impossible because NT13 and NT69 are followed by another expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different production that we can directly derive t54 as the first symbol. Looking through the rules, the NT4 \u2192 t54 is a production, but that's a separate non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way for S to produce NT4, but in the given grammar, S directly goes to NT13 and NT69. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the expansion works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial step is to expand NT13 into something that can produce t54. Let me see: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNow, let's see what NT70 and NT46 can produce.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 t44. So NT70's expansion would produce NT76 followed by NT7, which is NT76 followed by t44.\n\nBut then, if NT76 \u2192 NT79, and NT79 is a terminal? Looking at the rules, yes: NT79 \u2192 't79' is not shown; instead, in the rules, some have 'tX' as terminal.\n\nWait, no: Checking the rules for NT70, it's NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7; NT76 \u2192 NT79, but according to the rules, NT77 \u2192 't47' and other similar rules, so perhaps NT76 \u2192 something that eventually can produce a terminal.\n\nBut to avoid getting stuck, let's try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to represent the string as a list and attempt to match it against the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nThe idea is to start consuming the string from the beginning and apply the grammar's rules to see if the string can be fully consumed.\n\nLet's try this approach.\n\nThe string is:\n\n['t54', 't40', 't24', 't9', 't6', 't65', 't9', 't9', 't18', 't3', 't68', 't81', 't9', 't9', 't18', 't9', 't9', 't18', 't42', 't62', 't81', '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't39'\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nI think the user made a mistake in their rule format, but looking at the rules, many have a form where a non-terminal produces a terminal and another non-terminal.

Wait, no, the user provided the rules as follows, for example:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't65'\n\nWait, that's different. So some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t54, which would correspond to NT4 \u2192 't54'. So, the first symbol of the string is t54, so the first non-terminal in the parse tree is NT4, which produces t54.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first token is t54, but in the grammar, S is the start symbol, and S can go to NT13 NT69. So after S, we have two non-terminals, NT13 and NT69. Therefore, the first two symbols should correspond to NT13 and NT69, but in the string, the first symbol is t54.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because S \u2192 NT13 NT69, so the next tokens in the string should be the results of NT13 and NT69. But the string starts with t54, which is a terminal that could come from NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing the order. The string is a sequence of symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. So perhaps I need to parse the entire string, treating each symbol as either a terminal or a non-terminal that needs to be split into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in context-free grammars, each rule replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the entire string would be a series of terminals and non-terminals that can be consumed through the grammar's rules.\n\nThis seems a bit more complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-794","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of t<something>, which I think corresponds to terminals in the grammar. The grammar itself has non-terminals like S, NT13, NT4, etc., and terminals labeled as t followed by a number, like t54, t40, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, which according to the rules, can produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So S is the root, and from there, it branches into these non-terminals, which themselves split further.\n\nNext, I should look at the given string: t54 t40 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t3 t60 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t29 t40 t6 t65 t47 t40 t6 t54 t79 t23 t58 t58 t58 t3 t60 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t7 t58 t71 t28.\n\nI notice that most of these are t-something, so that's likely the terminals. The non-terminals might be numbers without the t. So perhaps the idea is to parse the string using the grammar rules and see if it can be constructed step by step.\n\nBut parsing by hand could be complicated. Instead, maybe I can look for patterns or rules that directly produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminal tokens:\n\n- NT56 -> 't62'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT4 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't50'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT49 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT74 -> 't47'\n- NT34 -> 't78'\n- NT46 -> 't58'\n- NT80 -> 't43'\n- NT58 -> 't61' (Wait, NT58 is in the rules as NT58 -> 't61'...?)\n\nWait, let me go through all the rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal:\n\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT31 -> 't50'\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT49 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't48'\nNT67 -> 't6'\nNT58 -> 't61'\nNT34 -> 't9'\nNT42 -> 't68'\nNT12 -> 't81'\nNT34 -> 't9'\nNT46 -> 't58'\nNT74 -> 't47'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT42 -> 't68'\nNT61 -> 't62'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT77 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nWait, I think some of these might be duplicates or same rules. For example, NT77 can produce 't34' or 't47', depending on the rule.\n\nSo the terminals in the string that correspond to these production rules are:\n\nt54 appears three times. From the rules, NT4 -> 't54', so that's when NT4 is used in a production.\n\nt40 appears a few times, but according to the rules, NT49 -> 't40' and NT34 -> 't9' (Wait, no, NT34 has two rules: NT34 -> 't9' and NT34 -> 't78'). So, for t40, it must come from NT49.\n\nt24 comes up once, from NT32 -> 't24'.\n\nt9 appears a lot, from NT34 -> 't9' and others. Each occurrence needs to find a rule that produces 't9'.\n\nt6 comes from NT67 -> 't6' once.\n\nt54 appears again for the 4th position, so another NT4.\n\nt9 again, and t9.\n\nt18 comes from NT18: Looking at the rules, I see NT18 -> 't43' and others. Wait, no. NT18's production is either 't43' or another non-terminal. Wait, in the rules list, I see NT18 -> NT49 NT80 and NT18 -> ... Hmm, actually, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the first production is S -> NT13 NT69. Then NT13 is replaced by other rules. Let me check all NT18 rules:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT18 -> NT49 NT80\nNT18 -> NT67 NT4\nLooking at the rules, if NT18 can produce a terminal, it's if any of its productions produce a terminal. So NT18 has rules that go to NT49 and NT80, which produce 't40' and 't43', respectively.\n\nSo, when a non-terminal reaches NT18, it generates two terminals: 't40' and 't43' in one case, and 't47' and another in another case. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, NT18's production is: NT18 -> NT49 NT80 and also NT18 -> NT67 NT4.\n\nNT49 -> 't40', NT80 -> 't43'\n\nNT67 -> 't6', NT4 -> 't54'\n\nSo, when NT18 is expanded, it's either 't40' 't43' or 't6' 't54'. So in the given string, after two 't9's and a 't6', we have 't18', which would produce 't40' 't43' or 't6' 't54'. In the string, after 't6', we have 't18', then 't9' three times, and then 't9' and 't18' again.\n\nNow, the string is: t54 t40 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t3 t60 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t29 t40 t6 t65 t47 t40 t6 t54 t79 t23 t58 t58 t58 t3 t60 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t7 t58 t71 t28.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\nPositions 1-5: t54, t40, t24, t9, t6\n\nPosition 6: t54\n\nThen t9, t9, t18, t3, etc.\n\nSo after t6 at position 5, t18 comes at position 9. According to NT18's rules, it's either 't40' 't43' or 't6' 't54'.\n\nLooking at the string: after 't6' comes 't18', then 't9' at position 10. Wait, but 't18' would produce two tokens. So the string shows at position 9: 't18' followed by 't9' at 10. But t18 would lead to a pair of terminals, so perhaps the first is 't40' and the second 't43', or 't6' and 't54'. But in the given string, after t6 is t18, then t9, which is a single token. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to structure the entire parse tree step by step.\n\nLet's outline the string as a list:\n\n1: t54\n\n2: t40\n\n3: t24\n\n4: t9\n\n5: t6\n\n6: t54\n\n7: t9\n\n8: t9\n\n9: t18\n\n10: t3\n\n11: t60\n\n12: t29\n\n13: t6\n\n14: t9\n\n15: t9\n\n16: t18\n\n17: t29\n\n18: t40\n\n19: t6\n\n20: t65\n\n21: t47\n\n22: t40\n\n23: t6\n\n24: t54\n\n25: t79\n\n26: t23\n\n27: t58\n\n28: t58\n\n29: t58\n\n30: t3\n\n3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-815","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, with B and C not both being the start symbol. Also, in CNF, the start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any production, and all productions have two non-terminals on the right side except for the base cases which produce terminal symbols.\n\nThe given grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT47, NT45, etc.) and some terminals (strings like 't54', 't40', 't65', etc.). The initial production rules for S are S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So, the start symbol S is broken down into two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals will further break down using the productions provided.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t40 t84 t29 t40 t6 t65 t11 t9 t48 t58 t3 t60 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t43 t40 t6 t54 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t6 t54 t40 t43 t65 t50 t58 t50 t43 t40 t6 t65 t28`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the string step by step, looking for sequences of terminals that match the right-hand sides of any production rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's consider each possibility separately.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n   - Now, NT13 can produce 't70' and NT69 can produce 't6'.\n   - But in the string, the first part is t54, which is a terminal. So, let's see if NT13 can produce 't54'.\n   - Wait, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT56 \u2192 't62' and NT46 \u2192 't58', but not directly for NT13. Let me check all NT13 productions.\n   - Looking for NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46 or other possibilities? Wait, in the grammar:\n     - NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n     - Also, does NT13 have any other productions? Let me check all lines: I see NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46 and also NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21. Wait, no, looking again: NT13 is mentioned as having two productions: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46, but wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n     Checking all NT13 rules:\n     - NT13 -> NT70 NT46\n     - Is there another NT13 production? Looking through the list, I find NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. Are there any others? No, so NT13 can only produce two non-terminals.\n\n     So, if S \u2192 NT13 NT69, then NT13 would produce something like NT70 NT46, and NT69 would produce 't6' (from NT69 \u2192 't6'). So the initial sequence would be something like t6 t6, but the given string starts with t54 t40 t84..., so maybe this path isn't correct.\n\n   Alternatively, let's see if there's another possibility for NT13. I don't see any, so S \u2192 NT13 NT69 likely doesn't help because the first terminals don't match.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n   - Now, NT4 produces 't54' from NT4 \u2192 't54'.\n   - NT77 produces 't47' from NT77 \u2192 't47'.\n   - So, the first two tokens would be t54 and t47. Let's check the string: the first token is t54, which matches. The second would be t47, but the given string's second token is t40. So that's a mismatch. Wait, no, wait: S \u2192 NT4 NT77, so NT4 \u2192 't54' and NT77 \u2192 't47'. So after NT4 NT77, the first two tokens would be t54 followed by t47. But the given string starts with t54, then t40. So this suggests that the production S \u2192 NT4 NT77 isn't the right path because the second token doesn't match. Hmm, but maybe NT77 can produce a longer string.\n\nWait, perhaps NT77 can produce more than one terminal. Let me check NT77's productions. In the grammar provided, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't47'\n\nSo NT77 produces only one terminal symbol 't47', which means S \u2192 NT4 NT77 would immediately produce 't54' followed by 't47', but the given string is starting with 't54 t40 t84...'. So this doesn't match, meaning S \u2192 NT4 NT77 is not the correct path.\n\nWait a minute, that suggests that the string might not be generated because S can only be produced by either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77, neither of which directly lead to 't54 t40...';\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in checking NT4. Looking back, S \u2192 NT4 NT77, so NT4 must produce a terminal and NT77 must produce a terminal. From the grammar, NT4 \u2192 't54' and NT77 \u2192 't47'. So the combined production would be 't54' 't47', but the string starts with 't54 t40', so that sequence doesn't start with 't54 t47'.\n\nTherefore, the given string can't be generated by S \u2192 NT4 NT77 because the second token would be 't47' not 't40'. \n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT13 NT69 leads to 't70 t6', which doesn't match.\n\nHmm. But maybe there's another way. Perhaps the initial production uses longer sequences, meaning that the entire string is broken down through more steps.\n\nWait, maybe I didn't consider that NT47 and others can produce more than one terminal. For example, looking at NT77 \u2192 't47', but maybe some other NTx can produce sequences longer than one terminal. Let me think.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't54 t40 t84...'. From the first part, 't54 t40' could be the result of some NT production. Let me look for any NT that can produce 't54 t40' as a sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT56 \u2192 't62', NT46 \u2192 't58', etc. But wait, maybe a non-terminal like NT46 can be part of a production that leads to multiple terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start parsing the string step by step, considering all possible splits according to the grammar.\n\nSo the string is: t54 t40 t84 t29 t40 t6 t65 t11 t9 t48 t58 t3 t60 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t43 t40 t6 t54 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t6 t54 t40 t43 t65 t50 t58 t50 t43 t40 t6 t65 t28.\n\nI'll try to parse this string step by step, starting with possible initial splits.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT4 NT77, which would be 't54' 't47'. But the first token is 't54', which fits, but the second should be 't47', not 't40'. So that path is not possible.\n\nNext, S \u2192 NT13 NT69. From the grammar, NT13 produces 't70 t46' when it's broken down into NT70 NT46. NT46 in the grammar produces 't58'. NT70 can produce 't65 t28' from NT70 \u2192 't70' would not be a terminal, but wait: NT70 \u2192 't70' is not a terminal, because looking under NT70, I don't see a production where NT70 \u2192 a terminal, except maybe through some other rules. Wait, looking back, I see NT77 \u2192 't47', but other NTs?

{"custom_id":"request-814","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's see what I should do here.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. The grammar starts with a start symbol S which has two production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT69\n2. S -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo S can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. That means the string must begin with the tokens generated from either of these two options.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate:\n\nt65 t85 t58 t31 t40 t79 t44 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t85 t58 t50 t40 t43 t43 t81 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t31 t40 t6 t65 t43 t65 t58 t6 t65 t28\n\nI notice that the first symbol is t65. Let's look at the grammar rules for symbols that produce t65. Scanning through the production rules:\n\n- NT61 -> t62\n- NT78 -> t72\n- NT65 -> I don't see a direct production for NT65. Wait, looking back, NT1 is t3, NT3 is t65, NT4 is t54, etc. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through the symbols, I see NT3 \u2192 't65' and NT4 \u2192 't54', and so on. So any NT that has a production rule ending with 't65' would produce it. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\n- NT77 -> 't50'\n- NT47 -> 't84'\n- NT34 -> 't9'\n- NT42 -> 't68'\n- NT60 -> 't38'\n- NT36 -> 't56'\n- NT69 -> 't23'\n- NT70 -> 't76' etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided rules, I see NT3 \u2192 t65. So any rule that can derive to NT3 would produce t65. But how does that happen? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first step is either to produce NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's take the first production: NT13 NT69.\n\nSo S -> NT13 NT69. Now, each of these symbols can be further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT13, I see the production rule: NT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 -> NT23 NT6.\n\nSo now, the string would start with (NT70 NT46) (NT23 NT6) which translates to NT70 NT46 NT23 NT6.\n\nBut wait, the initial string starts with t65, which suggests it might be originating from a different production path. Alternatively, perhaps the S production isn't the first step. Let me think: maybe the first two symbols come from the other production of S.\n\nWait, S can produce either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. If the first two symbols in the string are t65 and t85, perhaps those come from a different path, but in this grammar, the S's first symbols are combinations of two NTs. So perhaps the first part of the string starts with an NT that's derived from S.\n\nBut wait, t65 is produced by NT3 \u2192 't65', but in S's productions, the first symbol is NT13, which goes to NT70 and NT46. Neither of these produce t65. Alternatively, maybe the first NT is NT3? But in the S production, it's always NT13 and NT69 or NT4 and NT77.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string can be broken down into components that correspond to the production rules.\n\nWait, let's think about each symbol. Each symbol in the string must be the result of the right-hand side of some production. So the grammar uses symbols NT followed by numbers, and some of them produce terminal symbols (like t, followed by numbers), while others produce other NT symbols.\n\nSo each production is of the form NTAB -> tC D, where A and B are numbers, and tC and D are terminals or other NTs.\n\nTo parse the given string, I can try to split it into the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nThe string is: t65 t85 t58 t31 t40 t79 t44 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t85 t58 t50 t40 t43 t43 t81 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t31 t40 t6 t65 t43 t65 t58 t6 t65 t28\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from any combination of the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the string as the combination of production rules starting from S. Since S can split into two NTs, each of which can further split into either t or other NTs.\n\nBut this could be a bit daunting. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string can be split into segments that match the production rules.\n\nWait, another approach is to reconstruct the parse tree. Let's attempt to break down the string step by step, each time checking if a production can match a part of the string.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let's try to go step by step.\n\nFirst, let's see the initial symbols. The string starts with t65. Let's see which NT symbols produce t65.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- Also, let's check other production rules where a terminal is t65. Wait, in the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT9 \u2192 t46 etc. But none directly produce t65 except NT3.\n\nSo for t65 to appear as the first symbol, we must have a production that eventually leads to NT3. But in S's productions, the first two symbols are always combinations of NT13, NT69 or NT4, NT77. Neither of these seem to directly lead to NT3 immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT13 NT69, which expands to NT70 NT46 NT23 NT6.\n\nFrom the given string, the first symbol is t65, which might not fit NT70 or NT46, so perhaps this path is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the first symbols are from NT4 \u2192 t54, which doesn't produce t65, so that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the production rules that might produce t65. Only NT3 produces it. So any NT that expands to NT3 would produce t65.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t65\n- Also, looking deeper into other production rules to see if any produce NT3. For example, does any production expand into NT3?\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- So none of these.\n\nWait, but looking at the symbol NT3, it only maps to t65. So any occurrence of t65 must come from NT3.\n\nNow, to get to NT3 in the derivation, we must have a rule that leads to it. Looking at the given rules, for example:\n\n- NT3 -> NT70 NT46\n\nAh, okay, so NT3 can be produced by NT70 -> something. Wait, no. Wait, the rules are written as NTAB -> CD. So for example, NT31 \u2192 NT42 NT68.\n\nWait, in the provided rules:\n\nLooking for something that expands to NT3, but in the provided rules, I don't see any rule that has a RHS containing a 3. Wait no, let me scan all the production rules to see where 3 comes as a digit.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT42 NT68\n- So no, actually, the rules don't have '3' in the terminals except NT3 \u2192 t65.\n\nSo the only way t3 would appear is as a terminal from NT3. Wait, but t3 is part of t65's NT3 derivation. Wait, no. Wait, the 't' is part of the terminal. So if a rule leads to NT3, that would produce 't65'.\n\nSo in order for the string to have 't65' as a symbol, the derivation must include an NT3 node somewhere.\n\nSo, in the starting S production, which is either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77, each of these needs to be followed by the production of their respective symbols.\n\nWait, for"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string given is quite long, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can produce terminals directly. The start symbol here is S, and the initial productions are S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. So S can generate strings by expanding these non-terminals, and each of these non-terminals can, in turn, produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate, it's a sequence of terminals: `t54 t17 t84 t9 t9 t18 t42 t17 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t43 t43 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t50 t40 t84 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t62 t7 t58 t6 t54 t50 t58 t62 t85 t58 t62 t17 t58 t43 t28`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by expanding the non-terminals in the grammar until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the initial productions of S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT13 NT69\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nEach of these NTs can be followed by other expansions or terminals. Each NT production either expands into two NTs or, in some cases, into a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT5 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't54', etc. So these NTs that end with a terminal are the leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nWait, looking more closely, some NTs have terminal symbol productions, like NT5 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't54', etc. So any NT that can produce a terminal is a possible end in a derivation.\n\nSo the first step is to check if each terminal in the string corresponds to a production of the respective NT.\n\nLet's list out each terminal in the string and see if it matches any NT's terminal production.\n\nThe string is: t54, t17, t84, t9, t9, t18, t42, t17, t47, t6, t9, t9, t18, t43, t43, t47, t6, t9, t9, t18, t85, t58, t50, t40, t84, t47, t6, t9, t9, t18, t62, t7, t58, t6, t54, t50, t58, t62, t85, t58, t62, t17, t58, t43, t28.\n\nI need to go through each terminal and see which NTs produce them.\n\nNT17: I see NT17 \u2192 't80' and NT17 \u2192 't80' (probably a typo), wait, looking at the production list:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT17 has two productions? Or maybe it's another NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nSearching for NT17 in the productions:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't80' (twice, seems like a typo, but it's the same production)\nSo NT17 always produces 't80' as a terminal.\n\nThen, in the string, t17 is present. But according to the grammar, NT17 only produces 't80', not 't17'. So that's a problem. 't17' is not in the terminal symbols of NT17.\n\nWait, that seems like an error. The string has t17, but the grammar doesn't have any NT that produces 't17'. So that would immediately suggest that the string cannot be generated by this grammar. So the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar.

The start has 3 non-terminals (S is a non-terminal, but NT13 and NT69 are also non-terminals). Wait, no, in the initial S, it's S -> NT13 NT69, which are two non-terminals, so the count starts at 2.\n\nEach expansion step replaces a non-terminal (if possible) with two symbols. So the count goes S (0) \u2192 2 non-terminals. Each expansion step can branch into more non-terminals, but ultimately all must resolve to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of non-terminals and see if it's a power of 2 minus one. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the total number of symbols in the string. The string has 47 tokens, and each production either adds one or keeps the same, depending on terminals.\n\nBut this might not be the right approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two symbols. The string is all terminals, so each non-terminal must be expanded down to terminals.\n\nI should think about how the string can be broken down into parts based on the grammar rules. Let's take the first few tokens to see if they can come from any production.\n\nThe first token is t65. Looking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce t65. For example, NT4 -> t54, but wait, I'm looking for t65. Let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT61 -> t62, NT78 -> t72, NT38 -> t47, NT83 -> t7, NT80 -> t43, NT42 -> t68, etc. Wait, where is t65 mentioned?\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, maybe I missed something. Let me check: \n\nNo, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t65 except two new rules:\nNT3 -> t65\nNT4 -> t65\n\nSo both NT3 and NT4 produce t65. That's important because the string starts with two t65s, but the grammar allows for t65 via either of these.\n\nWait, the string starts with t65, t9, t9, t9... Let me see:\n\nThe first token is t65. So the first non-terminal must be either NT3 or NT4, as they produce t65. \n\nLooking further, after that, t9 is the next token. Where does t9 come from? Looking at the rules, NT5 -> t39, but that's t39, not t9. Wait, let me check the rules again. \n\nWait, t9 comes from NT4 -> t54? No, wait, the rules for t9 are:\n\nLooking for t9, I see NT9 -> t46, NT91? Wait, no, let me check the rules again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me reorganize.\n\nLooking for all NT rules that produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT31 -> 't50'\nNT5 -> 't39'\nNT49 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't48'\nNT67 -> 't6'\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT42 -> 't68'\nNT12 -> 't81'\nNT34 -> 't9'\nNT46 -> 't58'\nNT74 -> 't47'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT42 -> 't60'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nNT4 -> 't54'\nNT61 -> 't62'\nNT26 -> 't42'\nNT15 -> 't40'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT42 -> 't60'\nNT3 -> 't65'\nNT4 -> 't65'\nNT61 -> 't17'\nNT78 -> 't72'\nNT38 -> 't47'\nNT83 -> 't7'\nNT80 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't7'\nNT56 -> 't31'\nNT16 -> 't28'\nNT38 -> 't29'\nNT33 -> 't85'\nNT78 -> 't33'\nNT6 -> 't18'\nNT18 -> 't43'\nNT7 -> 't44'\nNT56 -> 't31'\nNT76 -> 't79'\nNT7 -> 't23'\nNT47 -> 't84'\nNT53 -> 't48'\nNT53 -> 't80 nt69'\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me parse the grammar rules correctly. Each production is written as X -> Y Z, where Y and Z are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking for all rules where a non-terminal X is expanded into a terminal:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT3 -> t65\nNT4 -> t54\nNT5 -> t39\nNT49 -> t40\nNT53 -> t48\nNT67 -> t6\nNT9 -> t0\nNT42 -> t68\nNT12 -> t81\nNT34 -> t9\nNT46 -> t58\nNT74 -> t47\nNT32 -> t24\nNT42 -> t60\nNT3 -> t65\nNT4 -> t54\nNT61 -> t62\nNT26 -> t42\nNT15 -> t40\nNT32 -> t24\nNT42 -> t60\nNT3 -> t65\nNT4 -> t65\nNT61 -> t17\nNT78 -> t72\nNT38 -> t47\nNT83 -> t7\nNT80 -> t43\nNT3 -> t7\nNT56 -> t31\nNT16 -> t28\nNT38 -> t29\nNT33 -> t85\nNT78 -> t33\nNT6 -> t18\nNT18 -> t43\nNT7 -> t44\nNT56 -> t31\nNT76 -> t79\nNT7 -> t23\nNT47 -> t84\nNT53 -> t48\nNT53 -> t80 nt69\n\nWait, I think I misread the rules earlier. Let me go through each rule to identify which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- S -> NT13 NT69 and S -> NT4 NT77: these are productions for S, which starts as a non-terminal.\n- NT13: produces two non-terminals: NT70, NT46. So not a terminal.\n- NT47: NT66 and NT29: non-terminals.\n- NT45: NT46 and NT36: non-terminals.\n- NT18: NT49 and NT80: non-terminals.\n- NT13: NT70 and NT46: both non-terminals.\n- NT69: NT23 and NT6: non-terminals.\n- NT60: NT38 and NT18: non-terminals.\n- NT9: NT31 and NT45: non-terminals.\n- NT36: NT56 and NT61: non-terminals.\n- NT80: NT67 and NT4: NT67 is a non-terminal, but NT4 is a terminal? Wait, no: looking at the rule for NT4: NT4 -> t54, which is a terminal. Wait, no, in the rules as given:\n\nWait, looking at the given rules: \n\nThe rules for NT4: 'NT4 -> t54'? No, looking again, the rules are a bit hard to read because some may span multiple lines. For example, the rule for NT53 is broken into two lines: 'NT53 -> t48' and 'NT53 -> t80 nt69'. Wait, that can't be right. Probably, each production is written as separate lines for readability.

{"custom_id":"request-855","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided to understand the structure. It seems quite extensive with many non-terminals and terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Each of these non-terminals then further breaks down into combinations of other non-terminals until terminals are reached.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals: `t54 t78 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t6 t54 t43 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t84 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t6 t65 t43 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t43 t40 t6 t65 t7 t50 t58 t62 t40 t84 t58 t71 t58 t71 t28`. Since some 't' symbols like t54, t58, etc., are terminals, I need to check if these can be directly derived from the grammar.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, each terminal in the string must correspond to a production rule that ends with that terminal. Let me go through the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, 't54'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't54'. So that matches. Next, 't78' \u2013 looking through the rules, I find NT5 has a production NT5 \u2192 't39', NT34 \u2192 't78', and NT77 \u2192 't34'. Hmm, t78 can come from NT34. But wait, I need to see if there's a rule that produces NT34 directly or through other rules.\n\nWait, looking at NT34's productions: NT34 \u2192 NT46 NT40 or NT73 NT41 or NT56 NT65. None of these directly produce a terminal, except for NT56 \u2192 't62', NT73 \u2192 't9', and NT41 \u2192 't9'. So, to get 't78', which comes from NT34 \u2192 't78', there must be a path where NT34 is derived from NT73 NT41 or another valid combination. Let me check: NT73 \u2192 't9', NT41 \u2192 't9', and so NT34 would produce 't9' 't9', but that's 't9 t9', which isn't the same as 't78'. Alternatively, NT34 can be NT56 \u2192 't62' and NT65 \u2192 't65', but that's 't62 t65' which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see if NT34 can directly produce 't78' via another rule. Oh, looking back, I think I might have missed a production. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT34 \u2192 't78' is there? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, yes, I see NT34 \u2192 't78'. So that's correct. So the second symbol 't78' corresponds to NT34 \u2192 't78'. That works.\n\nNext is 't9'. The grammar has NT9 \u2192 't0', but 't0' isn't in our string. Wait, but there's another NT9. Let me look: I see NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62, and NT46 \u2192 't58', and NT62 \u2192 't71'. So, maybe 't9' comes from a different NT9 production. Wait, in the given grammar, I see multiple NT9 entries. Let me check:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62 (produces 't58 t71')\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80 (produces 't58 t43')\n- Also, the string has 't9 t9 t18 t40 t43 t40 t6 ...'\n\nWait, the string starts with three 't9's. Hmm, but in the grammar, I don't see any production where NT9 \u2192 't9'. So, perhaps 't9' comes from a different non-terminal. Wait, let me confirm: NT9's productions are:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62 \u2192 't58 t71'\n- NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT80 \u2192 't58 t43'\n- Also, looking in the list, I see NT5 \u2192 't39', NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61, etc. Wait, no NT9 directly producing 't9'. So, perhaps 't9' is not directly produced. But in the string, 't9' appears multiple times, so I might have to backtrack.\n\nWait, perhaps NT1 \u2192 't3' and NT3 \u2192 't11', etc. Maybe I need to model this as a parse tree. Alternatively, perhaps using the leftmost derivation approach, each symbol in the string must be a terminal produced by some production.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. For each terminal in the string, check if there's a production in the grammar that produces it. If not, then the string isn't in the language.\n\nLooking at 't54', the grammar has NT4 \u2192 't54', so that's okay.\n\n't78' comes from NT34 \u2192 't78' as I thought.\n\nThen 't9' \u2013 the first 't9'. From the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't9'? Let me check all NTs:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT5 \u2192 't39'\n- NT6 \u2192 't18'\n- NT9 \u2192 various combinations but none produce 't9' directly. Wait, but perhaps it's derived through other non-terminals. Let me see. For example, BT:\n\nWait, for example, NT46 \u2192 't58', which is a terminal. So, 't9' might not appear directly, but maybe from a path that ends with 't9'. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for a path where a non-terminal eventually leads to 't9' as a terminal. Let's consider NT3 \u2192 't11', which is a terminal. NT13 \u2192 't43'? Let me check where NT13 is defined.\n\nLooking at NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46. NT70 \u2192 't79' or 't23'. NT46 \u2192 't58'. So, that would produce 't58 t79' or 't58 t23'. Doesn't give 't9'. Similarly, NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21. NT32 \u2192 't11', NT21 \u2192 't73'. NT73 \u2192 't9'. So, NT13 \u2192 't11 t9'. Hmm, that's 't11 t9', which could result in 't9' as the second element. So, maybe 't9' comes from NT13 \u2192 NT32 NT21 \u2192 't11 t73 t9' \u2192 but that would give 't11 t9'. But in our string, the second symbol is 't78' and then 't9' comes next. So perhaps it's after a few steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the string step by step, symbol by symbol.\n\n1. t54: comes from NT4 \u2192 't54' \u2013 okay.\n2. t78: comes from NT34 \u2192 't78' \u2013 okay.\n3. t9: Hmm. Let's see if any production can lead to 't9'. Looking through all the non-terminals, NT9 \u2192 't58 t71' or 't58 t43' via NT9's rules. So, no direct 't9'. Wait, perhaps 't9' can be part of a longer derivation. For example, maybe NT6 \u2192 't18' is a terminal, so how do we get 't9'? Maybe NT73 \u2192 't9' directly. Let me see: NT73 \u2192 't9' is a production. So, NT73 can produce 't9'.\n\nSo, for the third symbol 't9', it must be from NT73 \u2192 't9'.\n\nNext, the fourth symbol is 't9' again. So, same as above: NT73 \u2192 't9'.\n\nNext"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is quite complex with a bunch of productions, and the string to check is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, ending with t50 and other t's. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It seems to consist of starting symbols 'S' which branches into 'NT13 NT69' or 'NT4 NT77'. Each of these further branches into other non-terminals and terminals. Terminals here are the 't' strings like 't50', 't39', etc., and some have numerical subscripts like NT47, NT69, and so on.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it starts with t65, t9, t9, t9, then t18, t42, t40, etc. There are several terminals like t50, t39, t83, etc. The goal is to parse this string into the grammar.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to perform a parse using the grammar, starting from the top symbol S.

Both options will branch into more productions.\n\nLet me first look at the string. The string begins with t65. Looking at the grammar, t65 is a terminal and appears in a few productions:\n- NT34 \u2192 t61 NT47\nWait, no, the terminal t65 is a terminal itself in some productions.

Looking at the rules:\n\nFrom the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 t18, NT4 \u2192 t54, etc. Wait, actually, certain non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT61 \u2192 t62. So t65 must be a terminal somewhere else. Looking through, I see:\n\nLooking at the production rules, 't65' appears in NT7 \u2192 t44 and others?

Wait, looking through, I see:\n\nYes, in the rules, NT3 \u2192 t65. So one of the non-terminals (NT3) produces t65.\n\nWait, but how does NT3 get produced? It must be derived from some non-terminal, perhaps. So in the string, t65 must come from NT3, which then needs to be generated from other non-terminals.\n\nBut let me step back. The string starts with t65, so the first step is to match t65. This suggests that the first production must involve a rule that can produce t65. So, looking at the grammar, the t65 terminal appears on the right-hand side of the production NT3 \u2192 t65.\n\nTherefore, somewhere in the derivation, NT3 must be expanded into t65. So, in the parse tree, one of the leaf nodes is NT3 \u2192 t65.\n\nSo, the first step is to see where NT3 is produced in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t65.\n\nSo, that's straightforward. So the first part of the string, t65, comes from NT3 \u2192 t65.\n\nNext, after t65, we have t9, t9, t9. Let me see how t9 is generated.\n\nLooking through the rules, t9 occurs in several places:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t80\n- NT53 \u2192 t48\n- NT23 \u2192 t73\n- NT34 \u2192 t9\n- NT46 \u2192 t58\nWait, but looking at the rule list, I see NT29 \u2192 t68, NT46 \u2192 t58, etc. Wait, I'm looking for where terminal t9 is a production. Looking at the list, I see:\n\nLooking through, I notice:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t9\n- NT73 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t3\nWait, no, t9 is a terminal in several places. For example, NT41 \u2192 t9, NT9 \u2192 t80, etc. Wait, let me check each rule:\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the rules show that:\n\nNT31 \u2192 t50.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out where terminals are produced. Let me go through each rule and note down any terminals.\n\nFrom the production rules, the terminals are t0, t1, t3, t4, t5, t6, t9, t18, t21, t23, t29, t31, t34, t38, t39, t40, t42, t43, t44, t45, t46, t47, t48, t50, t53, t54, t58, t61, t62, t65, t68, t73, t74, t77, t78, t80, t81, t83, t9, etc.\n\nEach terminal is on the right-hand side of a production, either in the form of NTn \u2192 terminal or NTn \u2192 NTm NTk.\n\nSo for example, NT31 \u2192 t50, meaning NT31 can produce the terminal t50. Similarly, NT13 \u2192 t65. So, NT13 generates t65.\n\nSo, in the string, after t65, the next part is t9, t9, t9. Let's see how t9 can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t9 appears as a terminal in several NT rules. For instance:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 t68\n- NT78 \u2192 t54\nWait, maybe I should look through each production rule to find where the terminals are.\n\nLooking through the production rules, the terminals are in the right-hand sides. For example:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t80\n- NT53 \u2192 t48\n- NT34 \u2192 t9\n- NT41 \u2192 t9\n- NT23 \u2192 t73\n- NT73 \u2192 t9\n- And others like t0, t18, t29, etc.\n\nSo, t9 can be produced by NT34 \u2192 t9 or NT41 \u2192 t9 or NT73 \u2192 t9.\n\nNow, in the string after t65, we have three t9s. Let's see how each t9 could be generated.\n\nSo, after t65, the first t9 could come from, say, NT34 \u2192 t9. Now, looking into how NT34 is formed.\n\nLooking for NT34's production. From the list, I see:\n\nNT34 \u2192 t61 NT47.\n\nSo, NT34 must first generate t61 followed by NT47, which will generate another string.\n\nBut wait, t9 is generated by NT34 \u2192 t9. So in that case, from S, we have:\n\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSuppose we take S \u2192 NT13 NT69. Then, NT13 would have to be expanded, and NT69 would have to be expanded.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that t65 comes from NT3 \u2192 t65, but looking at the production rules, I see:\n\nWait, no, in the list given, there's a production NT3 \u2192 t65. So NT3 \u2192 t65. So t65 is generated by NT3.\n\nWait, but in the S productions, NT69 is an option. So if S \u2192 NT47 NT80, for example, perhaps not. Wait, no: the starting S is either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So, perhaps in the first step, S \u2192 NT47 NT80, but no, looking at the rules, I don't see NT47 being part of S. Let me check the initial S productions.\n\nWait, the initial S productions are:\nS \u2192 NT13 NT69\nS \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo, starting with S, we pick one of these.\n\nNow, in the string, the first symbol is t65, which is from NT3 \u2192 t65. So, to get t65, perhaps NT3 is part of the expansion, but looking at the starting S, which is either NT13 or NT4, I don't see NT3 being involved at the beginning. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the t65 is part of the derivation paths. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is from NT3 \u2192 t6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that grammars in CNF have production rules where each rule is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So, every production looks like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. But wait, looking at the given grammar, I see that some rules have terminals on the right side, like NT56 \u2192 't50'. That's a terminal, so that's allowed in CNF since the productions can derive terminals directly.\n\nThe string to check is: `t65 t78 t9 t9 t18 t42 t43 t40 t43 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t62 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t43 t40 t6 t54 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t6 t65 t40 t43 t65 t58 t6 t65 t50 t58 t50 t43 t40 t43 t58 t43 t28`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and see their order. It starts with t65, then t78, t9, t9, t18, t42, t43, t40, t43, t29, t6, t9, t9, t18, t62, t47, t6, t9, t9, t18, t43, t40, t6, t54, t47, t6, t9, t9, t18, t40, t6, t65, t40, t43, t65, t58, t6, t65, t50, t58, t50, t43, t40, t43, t58, t43, t28.\n\nI notice that the string has a t50 and a t54, which are terminals. Let me see if these terminals correspond to non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the RHS of the rules, I see that 't50' is on the RHS of NT77 \u2192 't47' (wait, that can't be right\u2014maybe I'm mixing something up). Wait, no: looking at the rules, for example, NT5 \u2192 't39', so t39 is a terminal. Similarly, t40 is on NT56 \u2192 't50' (no, wait, no\u2014NT56's RHS is t50? Wait, the rules are listed, so I need to find where the terminals are in the RHS.\n\nFor example, NT5 \u2192 't39', so 't39' is a terminal. Similarly, NT1 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't54', NT6 \u2192 't18', NT9 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nSo, in the string, I see a t54 and t50. Let's check:\n\n- t54 is the RHS of NT4 \u2192 't54'. So NT4 can derive t54 directly.\n- t50 is the RHS of NT5 \u2192 't39'? Wait, no. Wait, looking for 't50' in the RHS. I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I spot NT31 \u2192 't50', so 't50' is the RHS of NT31.\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't54'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't18'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't50'\n\nSo 't50' is the RHS of NT31.

{"custom_id":"request-883","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided, and the string is a sequence of symbols. My goal is to figure out if the grammar can generate that exact string.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the given grammar. Context-free grammars consist of terminals and non-terminals, with non-terminals expanding into other symbols. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the start symbol is S, which has productions like S \u2192 NT13 NT69 and S \u2192 NT4 NT77. These mean S can expand into two non-terminals each. From there, I see a series of rules for each NTx where x is a number. Each of these seems to either produce another pair of NTs or a terminal character like 't10', 't18', etc.\n\nSome of these productions directly produce terminals. For example, NT58 -> t61, and NT33 -> t85. Others produce more non-terminals, like NT47 -> NT66 NT29, which would require each of those to expand further.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of ts followed by numbers, like t65 t85 t58 t62 t17... The string has 43 symbols, so the grammar must expand accordingly.\n\nI think the approach here is to perform a derivation starting from S and see if I can reach the exact string. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can construct a parse tree or use a recursive descent parsing method.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a derivation step by step. Each production rule in the grammar allows us to split a non-terminal into two parts. Since it's in CNF, each step will expand one non-terminal into two symbols, either both non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try to outline the possible steps.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Let's pick the first one for now: S = NT13 NT69.\n\nNow, each of NT13 and NT69 will need to expand. Looking at NT13's rules, I see NT13 -> NT70 NT46. So NT13 becomes NT70 and NT46.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 has the production NT69 -> NT23 NT6. So NT69 is NT23 and NT6.\n\nNow, each of these new non-terminals (NT70, NT23, NT46, NT6) will need to expand further.\n\nNT70's rules include NT70 -> NT76 NT7, and NT7 -> t44, which is a terminal. So NT7 can directly be t44.\n\nWait, but NT76 might also have a rule. Let me check: NT76 isn't directly a symbol in the grammar. Looking through, I don't see NT76. So maybe this path is incorrect, because NT76 isn't defined, which means that production isn't part of the grammar.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again. No, the string provided doesn't include any NT76, so if NT76 is not defined, then that production can't be used. That might mean that this path is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me look again. The grammar includes NT7 and NT76? Or does it?\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT76: I don't see an NT76 production. The rule NT77 \u2192 't47' is present, but NT76 isn't listed. So NT76 isn't a non-terminal with a production; it's essentially a dummy node or part of another rule.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, every non-terminal must have productions that split into two. The production rules may involve all symbols, including terminals. So if NT76 has no production, maybe it's not present. So, in that case, NT76 would not be a valid non-terminal, and the production might not exist.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try building a parse tree step by step, using the given production rules.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that each step in the derivation reduces the count of non-terminals by one, starting from the start symbol S and ending with no non-terminals left.\n\nThe given string has 43 symbols, meaning that the number of productions needed would have to account for that.\n\nWait, actually, each production step (e.g., replacing a non-terminal with two symbols) would increase the count by one. Starting from S, which is one symbol, the number of symbols would increase by one each time a non-terminal is expanded. So to go from 1 symbol to 43 symbols, we need 42 production steps.\n\nBut that's a lot. Manually doing this is impractical. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if all the terminals in the string can be derived correctly.\n\nLooking at the string: t65 t85 t58 t62 t17 t29 t43 t24 t9 t80 t47 t58 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t84 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t62 t40 t43 t43 t65 t50 t58 t50 t85 t58 t31 t40 t6 t54 t43 t28.\n\nThat's 43 symbols, so I need to make sure that each of these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the start symbol S and try to construct the string step by step, ensuring that each part is covered.\n\nAnother idea is to check if all the possible non-terminals in the string have valid production rules leading to them.\n\nFor example, the first symbol is t65. Looking at the rules, I see NT65 has a production: NT65 -> 't65'. So t65 can be directly derived. Wait, but in the grammar provided, I don't see NT65. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking back, yes, the grammar does include NT65: NT65 -> 't65'. So the first symbol t65 is directly produced by NT65.\n\nThen the next symbol is t85, which is produced by NT85, but wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT85. Or do I?\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I see NT34 -> 't78', NT61 -> 't62', etc., but I don't see NT85 as a terminal or non-terminal. Wait, no, the string has t85, but in the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't85'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces 't85'. That might be a problem because if 't85' isn't a terminal or a result of any production, then it can't be part of the string.\n\nWait a minute, that could mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar because 't85' isn't present in any rule.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. I see NT34 -> 't78', but no production for 't85'. So if the string contains t85, then it's invalid unless there's a production rule that allows it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread it. Let me look again: the string is t65 t85 t58 t62 t17...\n\nYes, so the second symbol is t85. Since I don't see any non-terminal in the grammar that produces 't85', this would mean the string is invalid because no non-terminal can expand to t85.\n\nWait, but the grammar only has non-terminals that produce certain terminals. If t85 isn't produced by any rule, then the string is impossible to generate.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed a production. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking at NT58: NT58 -> t62.\n\nWT65 is t65, NT65 -> t65 exists.\n\nThen t85: is there a non-terminal NT85? Or is there a way to get t85 through some expansion?\n\nNo, in the grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal expands into 't85'. All the terminals are like 't10' 't18' etc., except a few.\n\nSo that would mean that the string has a terminal that's not present in any production, making it impossible to generate the string. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-902","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). First, I need to understand what the grammar consists of and how it might generate the string.\n\nThe grammar has a set of productions where each left-hand side non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT13 NT1, and so on. Some of the non-terminals are terminals, denoted by 't' followed by numbers. Specifically, non-terminals like NT1, NT3, NT4, etc., can produce these 't' strings, which are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. The goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n\nSo, S's first expansion is either NT13 and NT1, or NT4 and NT77. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT13 NT1\nLooking at NT1, the production is \"t3\". So, NT1 directly becomes 't3'. Now, NT13 can be expanded. From the rules, NT13 is:\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n\nSo, NT13 becomes NT70 and NT46.\n\nNow, NT70's productions are:\nNT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7\nand\nNT70 \u2192 NT60 NT13\n\nSimilarly, NT46's productions are:\nNT46 \u2192 NT58 NT6\nand\nNT46 \u2192 NT16 NT28\n\nLooking for NT76 and NT7. NT76 is:\nNT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7\n\nAnd NT7 is a terminal 't7'.\n\nSo, let's try a path for NT70 and NT46.\n\nTake NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7:\n- NT76 \u2192 NT79 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo, NT70 \u2192 NT79 NT7 \u2192 ['t7', 't7'].\n\nNow, NT46 must be expanded. Let's see NT46 \u2192 NT16 NT28.\nNT16 is a terminal 't16', and NT28 is 't28'.\n\nSo, NT46 \u2192 't16' 't28'.\n\nSo, combining these, NT13 becomes ['t7','t7'] and ['t16','t28'], making the entire expansion for S (via S\u2192NT13 NT1) as:\n\nFirst path: 't7 t7 t3 t16 t28'\n\nThird path: Wait, no, NT13 expands to NT70 and NT46, so it's NT70 followed by NT46. So, the expansions are concatenated. So, after expanding, the string would be the expansion of NT70 concatenated with the expansion of NT46. Let's clarify.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nEach of these can expand into more symbols. So let's consider possible expansions.\n\nLet's take the first path: NT70 \u2192 NT76 NT7, which as above becomes 't7 t7', and NT46 \u2192 't16 t28', so the entire expansion is 't7 t7 t1' (since NT1 is 't3'). Wait, hold on. NT1 is 't3', not 't1', because looking back, NT1 \u2192 't3' from one of the rules, right? Wait, no, let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT3 \u2192 't65', which is a terminal because it ends with 't'. Similarly, NT1 \u2192 't3' (since one of the rules is NT1 \u2192 't3'). So S \u2192 NT13 \u2192 which becomes, after expansion, let's get back.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the terminals explicitly from the grammar.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals (those ending with 't#') are:\n\n- t3 (NT1)\n- t4 (S productions into NT4, and perhaps others)\n- t9 (from NT9 \u2192 't9', NT9 also appears in others like NT9 \u2192 NT46 NT62)\n- t18 (NT18)\n- t23 (NT23)\n- t24 (because looking at NT17 \u2192 't80' and others, maybe NT24 comes from somewhere else)\nWait, in the grammar, NT24 is a terminal from rule NT24 \u2192 't24'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, each line is either a production or a terminal ('t#'). Let me list the terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't65'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT18 \u2192 't43'\n- NT58 \u2192 't62'\n- NT12 \u2192 't81'\n- NT26 \u2192 't42'\n- NT15 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 => 't65'\nWait, hold on. Wait, some non-terminals have rules that are terminals. For example:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61\nWait, no, some of the rules like NT18 \u2192 't43' (so that's a terminal 't43'), NT36 ends with 't9', etc.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule line and see if a rule ends with 't#':\n\n1. S -> NT13 NT1 \u2192 both NT13 and NT1 are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded.\n2. S -> NT4 NT77 \u2192 NT4 and NT77 are non-terminals.\n3. NT47 \u2192 NT66 NT29 \u2192 non-terminals.\n4. NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT36 \u2192 non-terminals.\n5. NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT80 \u2192 non-terminals? Wait, NT49 is a non-terminal, but NT80 \u2192 't43' (terminal), so NT80 is a terminal here.\n6. NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46 \u2192 NT70 and NT46 are non-terminals.\n7. NT69 \u2192 NT23 NT6 \u2192 NT23 is non-terminal, and NT6 is a terminal? Wait, are these terminals? Wait, NT6 \u2192 't18'? Let me check.\n\nWait, not all non-terminals. Some are terminals. I need to identify which non-terminals are terminals by looking for rules that have 't' as part of the RHS.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- Looking for any rule where the RHS is a single terminal. From the rules, we have:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't9' (from 12th rule)\nNT13 \u2192 't65' (from 1st rule of NT36 and other rules, but wait, no: looking at rule 3 line: NT36 \u2192 NT56 NT61)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me scan each line:\n\nEach rule is something like X \u2192 Y Z or X \u2192 'tN'\n\nExamples of rules where the RHS is a terminal:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't65'\n- NT4 \u2192 't54'\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT18 \u2192 't43'\n- NT23 \u2192 't73' (looking for 't' in RHS: is there a 't73'? Yes, in NT70 \u2192 't77' and NT7 \u2192 't44')\nWait no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for 't' followed by a number in the RHS:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't65' \u2192 yes, that's a rule.\n- NT15 \u2192 't40' \u2192 yes.\n- NT24 \u2192 't24' \u2192 yes (I think, looking at rule, perhaps from NT24's definition above?\nWait, let's check all lines:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-899","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which makes it easier as each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it limits the possible derivations, making parsing and checking feasibility more straightforward.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The goal is to see if the provided string can be derived starting from S and applying the production rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n\nt65 t40 t11 t9 t43 t9 t9 t18 t3 t68 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t47 t43 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t11 t9 t80 t47 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t65 t28\n\nHmm, that's a long string with various 't' followed by numbers. From the grammar, I notice several NTs (non-terminals) that produce terminals. For example, NT4 and NT5 produce 't54' and 't39' respectively. Let me check which non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT22: I don't see any. Wait, the last NT16 is 't28'. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nYeah, NT16 -> 't28', so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT5 -> 't39', NT4 -> 't54', etc. So the string contains a bunch of these 't' terms, which are the terminals from the grammar.\n\nMy first thought is to parse the string from the start and see if each part can be derived from the grammar. Since it's a CNF grammar, leftmost derivation is feasible.\n\nBut given the complexity and length of the string, this might take a while. Maybe I can look for clues or see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in reverse, trying to reduce the string to the start symbol S by applying reverse productions. This might be more efficient, as sometimes reducing is easier than generating.\n\nIn CFGs, each step can split a non-terminal into two. So if I can find a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the non-terminals, I can proceed.\n\nBut let me start by looking for possible derivations. The string starts with t65. Looking at the rules, which NTs produce t65? Let me check each rule to see which gives t65.\n\nFrom the rules, I see:\n\nNT61 -> NT17 NT38\nNT77 -> 't47' (But t47 isn't in the string)\nWait, actually looking for t65. Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\nNT32 -> 't11'\nNT77 -> 't47'\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let me scan all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT63 is not in the rules. Wait, I only see NT61->NT17 NT38, NT3->'t65', so only NT3 produces t65.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is t65, which must come from NT3. So the entire string would have to be derived from NT3.\n\nWait, looking at the provided string, it's a list of t tokens separated by spaces, but in a context-free grammar, the language consists of sequences of these terminals. Each production rule can generate a sequence, so the entire string must be a single derivation path.\n\nWait, but the grammar starts with S. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77\n\nWait, wait. Actually, according to the initial user message, the grammar uses \"\u2192\" but in the provided input, it's presented with arrows. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, each line is something like S -> NT4 NT7. So S can be derived into two non-terminals, each a pair. So for S, each production is a binary split.\n\nSo S can produce NT13 NT13 NT69? Wait, wait, no. Looking again: the user wrote:\n\n grammar: \n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69 \u2192 Wait, no, context-free grammars in CNF can only have two non-terminals on the right side. So maybe the user made a typo? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, looking again: the user shows S -> NT13 NT13 NT69, but in CNF, each rule can only have one terminal or two non-terminals. So perhaps it was a mistake. Or maybe it's a rule with three parts, which would not fit CNF. Wait, no, the user specified it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which allows only two non-terminals per production. So perhaps S's productions are written as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69 \u2192 No, because that's three non-terminals, which is invalid for CNF. Did the user make a mistake or did I misread? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n... (then the rest of the rules)\n\nWait, so this can't be in CNF because S has more than two non-terminals on the right. So maybe the user made a mistake. Or perhaps it's a typo. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the user intended S's productions to be written with NT13 NT13 and NT69 in a single production, but that's three, which isn't allowed in CNF. So, perhaps the correct production is S \u2192 NT13 NT13 NT69, but that can't be in CNF. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended productions were S\u2192NT13 NT69 and another production, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a three-way production, but no, that's not CNF. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the S -> NT13 NT13 NT69 is incorrect, and perhaps it's supposed to be NT13 and NT13, but that leaves out NT69, which may not make sense.\n\nThis is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the given grammar. Let me check again:\n\nThe first line is \"S -> NT13 NT13 NT69\", which has three non-terminals, which is not allowed in CNF. So perhaps it's supposed to be S-> NT13 NT69, but that would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the 'NT69' is a typo, meant to be something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct productions for S are S->NT13 NT69 and S->NT4 NT77, which are two productions, each with two non-terminals. Then, the earlier production lines of NT13 and NT4 and the others must be considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's initial message had a typo, and the first S production is something else, but for now, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that it's supposed to be S\u2192NT13 NT69 and S\u2192 NT4 NT77, each being valid CNF productions.\n\nIf that's the case, S can expand into NT13 followed by NT69, or NT4 followed by NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t65, which as we saw earlier must come from NT3. Wait, but if S is expanding to NT13 and NT69, then neither NT13 nor NT69 produce t65. Let me check NT13 and NT69's rules:\n\nLooking back, NT13 -> NT70 NT46, then NT70 could be further expanded. Or perhaps I'm getting somewhere. Let me try to track the possible tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can better approach this by trying to parse the string. Since it's a list of terminals, I need to find a way to break this down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me try to split the string into possible pieces that match the non-terminals.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt65 t40 t11 t9 t43 t9 t9 t18 t3 t68 t29 t6 t9 t9 t18 t47 t43 t24 t9 t6 t54 t9 t9 t18 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t11 t9 t80 t47 t3 t68 t81 t9 t9 t18 t65 t28\n\nI think it's better to process this string as a sequence and try"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

From the grammar, t65 appears in the productions of several symbols:\n\n- NT65 is present in several rules, but wait, in the grammar provided, t65 seems to be a terminal symbol. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, t65 is a terminal and appears as a result in some productions. For example:\n\n- NT26 -> t42\n- NT15 -> t40\n- NT61 -> t62 (but t62 is another terminal)\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, t65 is a terminal and appears on the right-hand side of a production. For example:\n\n- NT61 -> t62\n- Wait, no, t65 is present as a terminal, I see that in the grammar, some NT symbols produce a terminal. For instance, NT65: does it produce anything? Wait, the grammar provided has lines like:\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nActually, the grammar has lines such as NT65 -> t3, but I don't see a production for S -> t65, but in the string, we have t65 appearing multiple times. Hmm, perhaps S branches into NT13 NT69 and then each NT produces other symbols until they become terminals.\n\nWait, S is a non-terminal, so it must generate strings of terminals. Each production of S is two non-terminals. So to get a string starting with t65, we need to see if any of these non-terminals can eventually produce t65.\n\nBut let's check the grammar to see if any non-terminals directly or indirectly produce t65. Looking through all the production rules:\n\nLooking for where t65 is generated.

{"custom_id":"request-914","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if a given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens, each possibly corresponding to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form means. It's a grammar where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this case, most of the rules seem to be of the form NT_XY \u2192 NT_AB NT_CD, but some end with terminals like 't50', 't9', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the non-terminals (NT_*) have productions that split into two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT13 NT69. So S can produce two non-terminals, which themselves can be further split.\n\nThe given string is a series of terminals, like t54, t9, t9, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. To do this, I might need to parse the string using the grammar's rules.\n\nOne approach is to perform a rightmost derivation or a leftmost derivation, but given the length, that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can try to build a parse tree from the string, ensuring that each step follows a production rule.\n\nBut first, I should check if all the terminals in the string are present as terminal symbols in the grammar. Let's list all the terminals in the string: t50, t9, t18, t42, t85, t58, t62, t47, t6, t29, t40, t80, t3, t11, etc. Now, looking through the grammar, I see rules ending with terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n- NT9 \u2192 t0, t31, t46\n- NT5 \u2192 t39, t50, t74\n- NT42 \u2192 t68\n- NT12 \u2192 t81\n- NT34 \u2192 t78\n- NT46 \u2192 t58\n- NT78 \u2192 t72, t33, t17, t41, t34, t73\n- NT61 \u2192 t62, t18, etc.\n- NT58 \u2192 t61, t31\n- NT59? Wait, the string has t58, etc. Looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT49 -> t40, etc. Hmm. Maybe I should make a mapping of all possible terminals to their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try to reduce the string step by step using the grammar rules, starting from the rightmost symbols. This is called a recursive descent parser or using a stack-based approach.\n\nLet's start with the string: t54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t62 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t29 t40 t43 t11 t9 t80 t29 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t81 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t62 t85 t58 t62 t43 t40 t43 t65 t58 t71 t58 t71 t28\n\nFirst, let's look for the starting symbol. In the grammar, the start symbol is S. So the entire string should derive from S. Let's see what S produces: S \u2192 NT13 NT69 or S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, whichever production is used, the string must start with NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Let's check the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54. So, does any of the non-terminals NT13 or NT4 produce t54?\n\nLooking into the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t54 (Yes)\n- NT13 \u2192 NT70 NT46\n- NT4 \u2192 t54\n\nSo, perhaps S used the production S \u2192 NT4 NT77. Because the first symbol is t54, which is produced by NT4. That would mean S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, the string would start with NT4 \u2192 t54, and then the next part would be NT77. So, the string after t54 should derive from NT77.\n\nWhat does NT77 produce? Looking at the grammar, under NT77: NT77 \u2192 NT51 NT78.\n\nSo, NT77 splits into NT51 and NT78. Then each of those would produce further symbols.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT4 NT77\n   - S reduces to [NT4, NT77]\n   - The string so far is t54 followed by the NT77 part.\n\n2.

Next step, process NT51 and NT78:\n   - NT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69\n   - NT78 \u2192 t72? Wait, no. Let me check. Under NT78, the rule is NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16.\n\nWait, under NT78, looking at the grammar:\nNT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16\n\nSo, NT78 splits into NT5 and NT16.\n\nSo now, NT51 \u2192 NT34 NT69 and NT78 \u2192 NT5 NT16.\n\nSo the string now after t54 is NT34 NT69 NT5 NT16.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the stack. Let me try a pushdown parsing approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to group the string into pairs according to the grammar structures.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to simulate the reduction.\n\nAlternatively, since this is getting complex, maybe I can look for the presence of certain symbols that might not be in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the last part ends with t28. Let me check if t28 is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rules that produce t28. So, if t28 is a terminal and it's present in the string, but no non-terminal produces t28, then the string cannot be generated. So wait, is t28 in the grammar?\n\nLooking through all the production rules in the grammar, I don't see any terminal named t28. Instead, NT73 \u2192 t9, which is a different terminal.\n\nSo if the string ends with t28, that terminal is not present as a terminal in the grammar at the leaves. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because t28 would have nowhere to come from.\n\nWait, that might be a dead giveaway. Let me check again.\n\nIn the string, the last token is t28. The grammar does not have any production ending with t28. All terminals are like t50, t9, t18, etc. So if t28 is present but not in the terminal set of the grammar, the string is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No' because the string contains a terminal that isn't present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should make sure that t28 isn't generated somewhere. Looking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT_ producing t28. Therefore, the grammar cannot derive t28 as a terminal. Hence, any string containing t28 is invalid.\n\nSo, the presence of t28 in the string makes it impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-934","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar starts with the start symbol S, which can be rewritten as either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. Each non-terminal on the left side of the productions can be broken down into two other non-terminals. Many of these non-terminals eventually derive into terminals with 't' followed by a number. Some non-terminals are recursive, like NT46, NT61, etc., meaning they might generate longer strings.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a series of t followed by numbers, like t54, t78, t9, etc. The first part of the string starts with t54, t78. I remember that in some of the non-terminals, 't54' and 't78' appear as direct terminals, so that might be part of the derivation.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to build the string by following the rules of the grammar. Starting from S:\n\n1. S can be replaced by NT13 NT69. Let's take this path.\n   - Now, NT13 can be replaced by NT70 NT46. So, we have NT70 NT46 NT69.\n   - Looking at NT70: it can be replaced by NT76 NT7. NT76 is NT76 -> NT79 NT7, and NT7 is NT23 NT18. Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for simpler paths.\n   \nAlternatively, let's try the other initial rule: S -> NT4 NT77.\n   - NT4 -> 't4'. So that's one 't4'. But wait, in the string, the first is 't54', not 't4', so this can't be the beginning. Hmm, wait\u2014no, S can be replaced by NT4 NT77, which would derive 't54' and 't78', because NT4 is 't54' and NT77 is 't78'. Wait, but looking back at the rules, NT77 is either 't47' or 't78'. Oh no, wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT77: in the grammar, NT77 has two productions: NT77 -> NT51 NT78 and NT77 -> 't47'. So from NT77, we can get either 't47' or NT51 NT78. Since in the string, the first term is 't54' and the second is 't78'. So perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I got the initial rule wrong. Let's re-examine S's rules:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nIn the string, the first term is t54. Looking at the non-terminals, NT54 doesn't seem present, but wait: looking at NT4, it's 't54'. So S -> NT4 NT77 would produce 't54' followed by something. If NT77 is 't78', then the start would be t54 t78, which matches the first two terms of the string.\n\nSo maybe that's the correct path. Let's proceed:\n\nS -> NT4 NT77.\n\n- NT4 -> 't54' (since NT4's production is 't54').\n- NT77 -> 't78' because 't78' is one of its productions (NT77 -> 't78').\n\nSo the first two tokens would be t54 t78, which matches the string.\n\nNext, after t54 t78, we need to generate more terms. But wait, in the grammar, S is replaced by NT4 NT77, which immediately produce terminals. So the entire string must be generated from S, but according to the grammar, S can't generate a longer string than just two terminals because each production for S results in two non-terminals, which in turn may produce more terminals. But in this case, S is producing two terminals, so the string must be exactly two 't' terms. However, the given string is way longer than that, so this suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built using a different production from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is replaced by either NT13 NT69 or NT4 NT77. So S -> NT4 NT77 would produce NT4 NT77, which as we saw, gives 't54' and 't78'. But then, how does the string go on? Because in the string, after t54 t78, it's more terms. So perhaps the production from S is using NT13 NT69 instead.\n\nLet's try that path again:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69.\n\n- NT13 -> NT70 NT46.\n  - NT70 can be NT76 NT7.\n    - NT76 -> NT79 NT7.\n    - NT7 is NT23 NT18.\n  - NT46 can be, for example, NT9 NT62, and so on.\n\nBut this path could generate a longer string. Let me see if the string can be broken down into such a structure.\n\nLooking at the string again: t54 t78 t9 t9 t18 t42 t40 t79 t44 t58 t3 t60 t81 t9 t9 t18 t81 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t50 t43 t43 t81 t9 t9 t18 t85 t58 t62 t85 t58 t31 t40 t84 t65 t50 t58 t31 t40 t84 t58 t6 t65 t28.\n\nWait a minute, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first part is t54, which matches NT4. Then, the next is t78, which is generated directly from NT77. But S can only produce either NT4 NT77, leading to t54 t78, and that's it because those are terminals. So how does the string have 36 terms? That suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule S can be replaced in a way that leads to more productions. Let me check if S has other productions, but according to the grammar, no\u2014it only has S -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the grammar. Let me check the productions carefully.\n\nLooking back, the grammar defines S as:\n\nS -> NT13 NT69\nS -> NT4 NT77\n\nSo each production of S results in two non-terminals, each of which can be replaced further. Therefore, the string must be built by expanding these non-terminals all the way until terminals are produced.\n\nBut in this case, the string is quite long, which suggests that the derivation might involve multiple levels of expansion of these non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to model this. The string starts with t54 t78, which suggests that the first two non-terminals are replaced by 't54' and 't78', as per the production S -> NT4 NT77.\n\nSo S becomes NT4 NT77 -> 't54' 't78'. But that's just two terms, whereas the string is much longer. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the NT4 NT77 production giving only two terminals. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is replaced by NT4 NT77, which in turn have their own productions. Wait, no: in the grammar, S is replaced by NT4 NT77, which are both non-terminals. So to get terminals from S, we'd have to expand NT4 and NT77 as well.\n\nWait, I think I need to approach this differently. Let me try to build the string step by step by following possible derivations.\n\nStarting from S, which can be replaced by NT4 NT77.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT4 NT77.\n\nNow, NT4 can be replaced by 't54' (as per the grammar), so NT4 \u2192 't54'.\n\nNow, NT77 can be replaced by 't78' (since one of its productions is 't78'). So NT77 \u2192 't78'.\n\nThus, S \u2192 't54' 't78'. Which is a string of length 2. However, the given string is much longer (36 terms). This suggests that perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial productions. Maybe S can have more productions beyond the two I listed. Looking again, the grammar only lists S -> NT13 NT69 or S -> NT4 NT77, so S cannot derive beyond that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is a bit complex, and the string to evaluate is quite long. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) implies. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this structure except for the last few rules where terminals like 't50' appear. However, I should check if those are indeed terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- Rules like NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT58, NT26 \u2192 't42', NT58 \u2192 't71' indicate that NT5 is a non-terminal that produces terminals and other non-terminals.\n- Similarly, other non-terminals (NTx) either produce other non-terminals or terminals. So, yes, the grammar is in CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is:\n\nt54 t9 t9 t9 t18 t42 t85 t58 t50 t62 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t40 t43 t40 t6 t54 t47 t6 t9 t9 t18 t62 t81 t9 t9 t18 t40 t6 t65 t40 t6 t65 t81 t9 t9 t18 t17 t65 t58 t71 t58 t71 t0 t58 t43 t28\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do that, I'll try to parse the string using the given grammar, checking at each step if the non-terminals can be replaced by the corresponding terminals or other non-terminals in the correct order.\n\nOne approach is to use a recursive descent parser or a top-down parsing method since the grammar is in CNF, which makes it suitable for such parsing techniques.\n\nLet me list down the steps:\n\n1.

Because the initial grammar may have S as S \u2192 NT13 NT13 NT1, but looking at the user's message, they wrote:\n\n\"S -> NT13 NT13 NT13\n\nS -> NT47 NT77\"\n\nSo S produces two terms: NT13, NT13, NT13, or NT47 and NT77.\n\nWait, now that's confusing because the user might have a typo, but let's proceed. The string to evaluate starts with a series of t's. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT13 NT13 NT13, but wait, actually, the initial production is S can produce NT13 NT13 NT13 or NT47 NT77.\n\nWait, but the first line shows S -> NT13 NT13 NT1, which can't be because 1 is a digit, suggesting a terminal. So perhaps that's a typo, and the correct production is S \u2192 NT13 NT13 NT1, which seems unlikely since NT1 is not defined. Alternatively, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
