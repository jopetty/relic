S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo from S, we can only go through one of these two paths. Let's explore each.\n\nFirst path: S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\nSo to get \"t4\", the terminal t4 must come from one of the NTs in NT73 or NT20. Let's look at each NT's productions.\n\nLooking at NT73:\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\nNT62 \u2192 NT6 NT36\nNT53 \u2192 NT12 NT85\nWait, maybe it's better to list all NTs and their possible productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should create a mapping of each NT to its productions to see if any of them can directly produce \"t4\" or can eventually derive to \"t4\".\n\nLooking through all the NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36', 't29', 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11', 't16'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT6 \u2192 't88', 't73', etc.\n- Other NTs like NT52, NT71, etc., have productions leading to other NTs.\n  \nWait, maybe focus on NT38 since it has two 't's: 't36' and 't29'. Let's see what NT38 can produce.\n\nWait, looking through the list, NT38 has:\n- NT38 \u2192 't36', 't29', and maybe more?\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't26', 't20'\n- Wait, perhaps I need to create a comprehensive list.\n\nLet me list all the NTs along with their productions:\n\n1. NT38:\n   - NT38 \u2192 't26', 't20' (Wait, looking at the given rules, I see:\n   - NT38 \u2192 't26', 't20' (from \"NT38 -> 't26'\", but looking back, I see:\n   \"NT38 -> 't26'\" and \"NT38 -> 't20'\" in the given rules. So, NT38 can produce 't26' or 't20'.\n\n2. NT44:\n   - NT44 \u2192 't4', 't17' (from \"NT44 -> 't4'\", \"NT44 -> 't17'\").\n\n3. NT55:\n   - NT55 \u2192 't17'.\n\n4. NT45:\n   - NT45 \u2192 't44', 't52' (from \"NT45 -> NT44 NT52\", but wait, no\u2014looking again, the production is \"NT45 -> NT44 NT52\". Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each NT to its immediate terminals and other NTs.\n\nLet me go through each NT:\n\n- NT38: As above, \u2192 't26', 't20'.\n- NT44: \u2192 't4', 't17'.\n- NT55: \u2192 't17'.\n- NT45: looks like I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's see: \"NT45 -> NT44 NT52\" is one production, but also \"NT44 -> 't4', 't17'\". So NT45 is not directly a terminal, but it's a combination of NT44 and NT52. So NT45 can't produce 't4' directly but needs to derive to other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a confusion here. Let me clarify.\n\nSome of the rules are written as NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, which means a single NT can produce a combination of two other NTs, which might in turn produce terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52, which would mean NT45 can only be expanded into two NTs. Similarly, NT44 can expand into 't4' or 't17'.\n\nSo the terminals are when an NT directly expands into a single terminal, like 't4', 't26', etc. The rest expand into two other NTs.\n\nSo the terminals are:\n\n- 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't9', 't10', 't11', 't12', 't13', 't14', 't16', 't17', 't18', 't20', 't22', 't24', 't26', 't27', 't28', 't29', 't30', 't33', 't35', 't36', 't37', 't38', 't49', 't51', 't53', 't55', 't64', 't68', 't71', 't73', 't74', 't82', 't83', 't87', etc.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, each NT either produces a terminal or another NT. For example:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't4' and 't17'.\n- NT35 \u2192 't3', 't5', etc.\n\nSo, to get 't4', we need a path from S down to 't4'.\n\nLet me explore both possible initial paths from S:\n\n1. Path 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n   So S splits into NT73 and NT20.\n\n   For S to produce \"t4\", either NT73 or NT20 must produce 't4' through their expansions.\n\n   Looking at NT73:\n   NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n   Then NT62 \u2192 NT6 NT36\n   NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73 (Wait, NT6 \u2192 \"NT88 NT73\", which could lead to recursion. That seems complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, look deeper into NT73's productions. Let's trace possible derivations.\n\n   Also, NT20:\n   NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68\n   NT27 \u2192 NT62 NT24\n   NT62 \u2192 NT6 NT36\n   This also seems to lead into more NTs, possibly a cycle that could produce terminals. But getting 't4' specifically isn't obvious here.\n\n2. Path 2: S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n   So S splits into NT95 and NT83.\n\n   For S to produce \"t4\", either NT95 or NT83 must produce 't4'.\n\n   Let's look at NT95:\n   NT95 \u2192 NT99 NT52\n   Then NT99 \u2192 't10' directly, so that's a terminal. So NT95 can produce 't10' as a final symbol if followed by NT52, but NT52 can have multiple productions leading to terminals.\n\n   Wait, no. NT95 is \"NT99 NT52\", so each of these can only expand into NTs or terminals. So the way this works is that when you have two NTs, each must expand into something, possibly themselves, until you get terminals.\n\n   For example, NT99 can go to 't10' or 't16' or others, as per the rules:\n\n   From earlier, I see NT99 has several productions:\n\n   - NT99 \u2192 't10', 't16', 't23', etc.\n\n   Also, NT52 has several productions:\n\n   NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47, NT12 NT85, etc.\n\n   Let's see, maybe NT52 can go to a terminal.\n\n   Looking at NT52's rules:\n\n   - NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47\n   - NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85\n   - NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47 (again)\n   - NT52 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 something?

Instead, I see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT27 \u2192 NT27\n\nSo, NT27 can only produce itself, which means it's a non-terminal that doesn't derive a terminal. Therefore, it can't produce any terminal, including 't27'.\n\nWait, but the string is 't27', which is a single terminal symbol. So unless NT27 directly expands to 't27', which isn't the case here, it can't be produced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a production that somehow leads to 't27' via other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me consider another path. Starting with S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nIf S is NT73 NT20, and NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, then part of the string is 't27' if NT62 \u2192 t something that leads to t27, but from earlier, NT62 \u2192 NT24, and from NT24 \u2192 NT25 \u2192 NT49 \u2192 't17' or 't9'.\n\nSo, that path leads to 't17' or 't9', not 't27'.\n\nAlternatively, what about NT47? Let's see if NT47 can produce 't27'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT47 \u2192 't27' is a production?\n\nWait, yes! Looking back:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't27'\n\nYes, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't27'\n\nSo, if any NT47 can just produce 't27', that would help.\n\nSo, can NT47 be derived from either NT73 or NT20?\n\nLooking back at the rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nThen, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT24 \u2192 NT25 \u2192 NT49 \u2192 NT47.\n\nSo, if NT24 goes to NT25 \u2192 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT47, which can produce 't27'.\n\nSo, let me see:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\nNT62 \u2192 NT24\nNT24 \u2192 NT25\nNT25 \u2192 NT49\nNT49 \u2192 NT47\nNT47 \u2192 't27'\n\nAnd NT20 is another part.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which makes parsing easier. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has two main types of rules. One produces two non-terminals, and the other produces a terminal symbol. Since our string consists of two terminals, `t24` and `t37`, I need to find a way to derive these using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the string, each part must come from a production. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The string is two tokens: `t24` and `t37`. So, the entire string must be derived from a single non-terminal, probably the start symbol. The start symbol is S.\n\n2. Let me check the rules for S. The grammar starts with:\n   - S -> NT73 NT20\n   - S -> NT95 NT83\n\n   So, S can produce two different pairs: NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83.\n\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t33 t22\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of terminals and non-terminals, with production rules that expand non-terminals into other symbols. The start symbol is usually S, but in this case, looking at the grammar, the production rules start with S -> NT... So S is the start symbol.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is \"t33 t22\". These look like symbols that could be terminals because they start with 't' followed by numbers. The grammar has several productions where non-terminals are turned into these 't' symbols with numbers. For example, NT38 -> 't36', which indicates that NT38 can produce the terminal 't36'.\n\nMy goal is to see if I can derive \"t33 t22\" by expanding the start symbol S through a series of productions until I end up with the string of terminals.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules:\n\nStarting with S, the productions are:\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo S can expand into two parts: NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83. Each of these non-terminals must be expanded into terminals and other non-terminals until we get to the terminals that make up our string.\n\nOur string is two terminals: t33 and t22.\n\nI need to find a way to get t33 and t22 from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, some NT symbols resolve to 't' followed by a number. For example, NT73 -> 't36', NT20 -> 't14', etc. I need to find if any of these NTs can produce t33 or t22.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see a line: NT99 -> NT38 NT62, which then further breaks down. Maybe I should look for how NT22 and NT73 can be formed.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t33. Let me check if any NTs produce t33.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> 't33' (line: NT27 -> 't33')\n- NT62 -> 't24' (line: NT62 -> 't24')\n- NT53 -> 't11' (line: NT53 -> 't11')\n- NT96 -> 't27' (line: NT96 -> 't27')\n- NT26 -> 't20' (line: NT26 -> 't20')\n- NT49 -> 't2' (line: NT49 -> 't2')\n- NT99 -> 't16' (line: NT99 -> 't16')\n- NT20 -> 't17' (line: NT20 -> 't17')\n- NT38 -> 't22' (line: NT38 -> 't22')\n\nWait, I'm checking for t33, so looking at the rules, I see NT27 -> 't33' (line: NT27 -> 't33'). So that's how we get t33.\n\nNow, looking for t22: the rule NT38 -> 't22' is present (line: NT38 -> 't22'). So t22 comes from NT38.\n\nSo the string is \"t33 t22\", which corresponds to NT27 and NT38. Therefore, the derivation would involve S expanding into some non-terminals that can produce these two NTs.\n\nLooking at the initial productions from S:\n\n1. S -> NT73 NT20: So NT73 and NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83: So NT95 and NT83\n\nWe need to see if any of these NTs can produce NT27 and NT38.\n\nLet me look at the rules for NT73 and NT20:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27 (line: NT73 -> NT62 NT27)\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68 (line: NT20 -> NT27 NT68)\n\nSo NT73 can produce NT62 and NT27. If we're looking to get NT27, that might help us get t33. Similarly, NT20 can produce NT27 and NT68. NT68 can produce 't14' (line: NT68 -> 't14').\n\nWait, so if S expands to NT73 and NT20, then NT73 can expand into NT62 and NT27. So NT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nThen, NT62 can expand into... looking at the rules, NT62 -> 't24' (line: NT62 -> 't24'). So NT62 -> 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 can expand into 't33' (line: NT27 -> 't33').\n\nSo combining these, NT73 can produce 't24' (from NT62) and 't33' (from NT27).\n\nSo S -> NT73 NT20 would produce 't24' 't33' and another part from NT20, which is NT20 -> NT27 NT68.\n\nWait, so S -> NT73 NT20 leads to NT73 and NT20. NT73's derivation leads to 't24' and NT27. NT20's derivation could lead to 't33' and 't14' perhaps? Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, each NT can only expand one step at a time. So let's think step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT73 NT20.\n\nFirst, expand NT73 to NT62 NT27.\n\nThen, expand NT27 to 't33' and NT62 to 't24', so the first part becomes 't24 t33'.\n\nThen, the second part is NT20, which can expand to NT27 NT68.\n\nExpanding NT27 to 't33' again, and NT68 to 't14', so the second part would be 't33 t14'.\n\nBut that seems to complicate things. Maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nBut wait, NT95 and NT83: looking for how to get t33 and t22.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is that S can expand into NT73 and NT20, then NT73 into 't24' and NT27, and NT20 into NT27 and NT68. But this might not directly lead to t33 and t22.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if there's a direct path.\n\nLooking for 't33' and 't22', so I need two NTs in the derivation that produce these.\n\nSo, the first NT needs to produce t33, which is NT27 -> 't33'.\n\nThe second NT needs to produce t22, which is NT38 -> 't22'.\n\nSo, looking for S expanding into two NTs, one of which can produce NT27 and the other NT38.\n\nBut looking at the initial productions, S can only produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So each expansion is two NTs. To get both NT27 and NT38, I'd need one of the NTs to expand into NT27 and the other into NT38.\n\nLooking at the initial productions from S, neither NT73 nor NT20 nor NT95 nor NT83 directly produce NT38. Let me check the rules for these NTs.\n\nLooking at NT73's production: NT73 -> NT62 NT27. So NT73 can't directly become NT38.\n\nNT20's production: NT20 -> NT27 NT68. So NT20 can't become NT38 directly.\n\nNT95's production: NT95 -> NT11 NT6. So NT95 can't become NT38.\n\nNT83's production: NT83 -> NT22 NT45. Wait, NT83 can produce NT22. Let me check: NT83 -> NT22 NT45.\n\nSo, if we can get NT83 to produce NT22, then the other NT needs to produce NT38. But looking at the initial productions, neither S's first two options can produce NT83 along with another NT that produces NT27.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for a path where S expands into two NTs, each leading to t33 or t22.\n\nLet's try S -> NT73 NT20. Now, NT73 can expand into NT62 and NT27"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-40","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if the string `t17 t2 t27` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because I know that means each production is either a single non-terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols. First, I should look at the structure of the string and see how it might be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nThe string has three tokens: t17, t2, and t27. Since each of these is a terminal symbol, I need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence. Context-free grammars can generate sequences by expanding non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals until all non-terminals are consumed, resulting in a string of terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level non-terminals. The grammar starts with S, which has two productions:\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSince the string has three parts, I'm thinking that maybe S must expand into two non-terminals, each of which then expand further to produce the three t tokens. Alternatively, maybe one of the non-terminals expands into three terminals, but I don't think that's possible because the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production only splits into two non-terminals at most. So each production only introduces two new symbols. Wait, no, that's right, so starting from S, which goes to two non-terminals, each of those can go to another two, and so on, until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, but each production has exactly two symbols, so the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, the terminals t17, t2, t27 are all separate. So to get three terminals, maybe S goes to two non-terminals, each of which goes to a terminal, but then that would only give two tokens. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no. Let me think about the derivation steps.\n\nIf S -> NT73 NT20, then NT73 and NT20 would each have to produce a terminal to get two tokens. But the string is three tokens. Alternatively, maybe one of them produces two terms, and the other produces one. But the problem is each production in the grammar either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So perhaps S goes to NT95 NT83, and then NT95 produces two terminals, and NT83 produces one. But then I would have three terminals if that's the case.\n\nWait, let's look at each option. Let's first check what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nNT73 can produce NT62 NT27 or 't36' and 't35'. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> 't36'\nThere's also another line: NT73 -> 't36', yes. So NT73 can produce either NT62 NT27 or the terminal 't36'.\n\nSimilarly, NT20 can produce NT27 NT68 or 't17', 't20', etc.\n\nWait, let's break down each non-terminal's productions step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nSo first, let's choose S -> NT95 NT83 because the string has t17, which might come from NT99 or NT64, but let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps we should approach this by looking at the string and seeing how it can be built up.\n\nThe string is t17 t2 t27. So we have three terminals. That suggests that the derivation starts from S, which must split into something that can produce three terminals. Since in Chomsky normal form, each production is two symbols, maybe S splits into two non-terminals, each of which splits into two, but in such a way that the result is three terminals.\n\nWait, that's a bit impossible because each split is binary. So S->A B. Then A must produce two terminals and B must produce one terminal, but that would only give three. Alternatively, A produces one terminal and B produces two, totaling three.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t17. Let me see what non-terminals can produce t17.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\nNT64 -> 't17'\nNT80 -> 't7' etc. So t17 can come from NT64.\n\nSo perhaps the first non-terminal derived from S is NT64, which immediately produces t17. Then the second part of S would have to derive the remaining t2 and t27.\n\nLooking at the next token, t2. Let's see what non-terminals produce t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT26 -> 't20', so no. NT2 -> 't22', NT4 -> 't11', NT68 -> 't14', NT20 -> 't17', etc. Hmm, looking for t2.\n\nWait, perhaps t2 comes from NT2, but NT2's productions are:\nLooking back, NT2 -> 't22', so that's t22, not t2. So perhaps t2 is produced by some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe NT26 produces t20, but that's not t2.

NT45 can produce 't2' as one of its options.\n\nSo, one of the non-terminals, NT45, can produce 't2' when expanded.\n\nSo, the second part after t17 would have to be t2, which comes from NT45. Then the third part is t27.\n\nSo, to get t27 after t17 and t2, maybe the structure is S -> NT95 NT83, where NT95 produces t17, and NT83 produces NT45 and t27.\n\nLet me check:\n\nNT95 can produce:\nLooking back, NT95's productions are:\nNT95 -> 't10', 't8', 't9', 't18', 't39', 't49', 't55', 't64', 't73'\n\nWait, none of these directly produce 't17'.

{"custom_id":"request-36","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t10 t14 t33\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar is a set of production rules that generate all possible strings in a language. The Chomsky normal form means that the grammar is structured with each rule having exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side or a terminal symbol. But in the given grammar, I see some rules like NT52 -> t3 or NT44 -> t4, which are terminals. So, each production has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t10 t14 t33\". Each of these is a separate token, I think, but I'm not entirely sure how they are separated. Since the grammar uses non-terminals and terminals, and the string is a sequence of terminals, maybe each \"t\" is a terminal symbol, and the spaces just separate the tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals that expand to terminals are those ending with \"t\", like NT52 -> t3, or NT38 -> t36, etc. So, each terminal in the string is the result of a production that directly expands to a single terminal symbol. For example, NT52 can become t3, t5, t7, etc., depending on the rule.\n\nI think the process involves breaking down the string into its constituent terminals and seeing if they can be generated step by step by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary tree, so the entire string should be derived by a series of expansions starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce two possible strings: NTNT73 and NT95. So, the initial expansion would be S -> NT nt (nt being the next symbol). But looking at the string, it's three terminals, each possibly generated by a non-terminal.\n\nEach step would involve the non-terminals in the current string expanding to two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But wait, since it's a binary expansion, each symbol in the string would need to be replaced, but since the string is a single sequence, perhaps each terminal is the result of a production that has exactly two symbols, leading down to each terminal.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: in CNF, each production has two symbols on the left and either two symbols or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right. So the string \"t10 t14 t33\" has three terminals, which means the derivation would have to involve a binary tree that combines them, but since the string is linear, that would require an odd number of nodes or some merging, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of three non-terminals, each of which must expand to the corresponding term. But that doesn't seem right either because each production is left- or right-expanded, but each step only deals with one non-terminal at a time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if each terminal in the string can be the result of a production, and that the structure allows them to form a valid derivation tree.\n\nLet me take the first term, \"t10\". Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals expand to t10. Let's check: NT99 -> t10. Also, NT64 -> t17 (wait, that's not helpful). Wait, what's NT99? In the grammar, I see NT99 -> NT38 NT62, and also other productions. But looking at the nt64 -> t17, that's not helpful for t10.\n\nWait, perhaps NT99 -> t10. Let me check the grammar: yes, there's NT99 -> t10. So, if we have a non-terminal A -> t10, then A can produce t10.\n\nBut in our case, the string starts with t10, so t10 must be generated by a production that produces exactly t10, which is only NT99 -> t10. So, the initial step would involve NT99 expanding to t10. But that would require that the other symbol in the production is also something that can produce nothing, which is not possible. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the steps.\n\nWait, in the string \"t10 t14 t33\", each term is a terminal. But in the grammar, each production is binary, so it's more likely that the string is built by combining two non-terminals, then each of those non-terminals are broken down further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string represents a leftmost derivation, where each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nLet me consider the string as a sequence of three terminals: t10, t14, t33.\n\nWait, but the grammar only has two symbols at each step. So, perhaps the string is a combination of three non-terminals that expand to these terminals in some order.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to see if each terminal can be reached through the grammar. Let's take each terminal:\n\n- t10: The non-terminal that can produce t10 is NT99 (since NT99 -> t10). So, NT99 can be the first symbol.\n\n- t14: Let's look for a non-terminal that can produce t14. Looking through the grammar, I see NT68 -> t14.\n\n- t33: Looking for a non-terminal that can produce t33. Checking the grammar, NT62 -> t24, which isn't directly helpful. Wait, but looking further, NT26 -> t2 (that's a terminal). Wait, NT44 -> t4. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe let's map each terminal to its possible sources:\n\nt10: NT99 -> t10\n\nt14: NT68 -> t14\n\nt33: Need to find a non-terminal that expands to t33.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT62 -> t24, which isn't t33.\n\nWait, is there any NT that directly produces t33? I don't see any in the given grammar. Wait, no. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nBecause if t33 cannot be directly derived from any non-terminal, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. That would mean the string is not in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe t33 is derived indirectly through some production. Let me check all the productions to see if any expand to t33.\n\nGoing through the list:\n\n- NT62 -> t24\n\n- NT26 -> t2\n\n- NT22 -> t\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, it seems none produce t33. So, that's a red flag.\n\nSince the string ends with t33, and t33 isn't a terminal in any production, then it can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see any production that ends with NT33 -> anything or NT33 being on the left of a production. So, no, there's no way to produce t33 directly or indirectly.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t10 t14 t33\" cannot be generated by this grammar because t33 is not present in any production as a terminal.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to map this step by step.\n\nThe string is \"t18 t5 t6 t7\".\n\nBreaking this down, the first part is t18, which comes from NT95. Then, the next part is t5, which comes from NT35.

Let me try constructing the parse tree.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, NT95 can derive 't18', so that's the first token. Next, NT83. Looking at NT83's production:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45.\n\nNow, we need to derive 't5' next. But NT22's production is NT44 NT63, and NT45 is NT44 NT52.\n\nSo, to get 't5', maybe NT52 can go somewhere. Let's look:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT80 \u2192 t7, but wait, NT52 has multiple productions. Let's check:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85\nNT73 \u2192 ... \u2192 t36\nNT49 \u2192 t3\n...\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWe have S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, NT95 \u2192 t18, which is t18.\n\nThen, NT83 needs to derive the rest of the string: t5 t6 t7.\n\nWait, the string has four tokens, so after S \u2192 NT95 NT83, which are two symbols (NT95 and NT83), each of these should produce two symbols each, because in CNF, each production is two symbols. But in this case, t18 is a terminal, so NT95 is a single terminal. Then, NT83 should produce a sequence that builds up to t5, t6, t7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's try to parse the string step by step, applying the productions.\n\nThe string is t18 t5 t6 t7.\n\nLet's try to build the parse tree:\n\n1. The entire string is four tokens. Since each production is two symbols, to get four tokens, perhaps each step splits into two parts.\n\nBut wait, each non-terminal can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So maybe we can split the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me try to think of how the string can be built.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t18, which is from NT95. So, the first part is t18, and the remaining part is t5 t6 t7.\n\nSo, one possible split is S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So far, that's correct.\n\nNow, NT95 produces t18, and NT83 needs to produce the remaining tokens: t5, t6, t7. But how can NT83 produce three tokens? Each production is two symbols, so perhaps NT83 splits into two parts that together make three tokens. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, each production is two symbols, so to get a sequence of three tokens, we'd need two steps. Let's see:\n\nFirst, NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45.\n\nThen, NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63.\n\nThen, NT63 \u2192 something.\n\nWait, let's check NT63:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT63 \u2192 NT22 NT20.\n\nSo, NT63 produces two non-terminals: NT22 and NT20.\n\nWait, that doesn't help because we're getting into a loop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a wrong initial assumption. Maybe the string doesn't come from the first production of S, which is NT73 NT20, but from the second one, NT95 NT83.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNT95 produces t18, which is correct. Now, NT83 can produce t5 t6 t7? But NT83 can only produce two symbols at a time. So perhaps we need to find a way for NT83 to derive t5, t6, t7 through multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire process is as follows:\n\nEach step breaks down the non-terminals into their components until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me try to represent the string as a sequence:\n\nt18 t5 t6 t7\n\nI need to see if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- t18 comes from NT95. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, after NT95 (which gives t18), what does NT83 produce?\n\nFrom the rules, NT83 can produce NT22 NT45.\n\nSo, NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45.\n\nNow, each of these can produce further symbols. Let's see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52\n\nSo, after splitting once, we have NT44, NT63, NT44, NT52.\n\nNow, that's four symbols, but our remaining string after t18 is t5 t6 t7, which is three symbols. Hmm, this seems off. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a parse tree where each node is a production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach is flawed. Let me try starting from the entire string and see if it can be generated from S.\n\nThe string is \"t18 t5 t6 t7\".\n\nEach symbol is produced by some non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-61","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine whether the string `t4 t31 t0 t11` is generated by the given context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see a mix of productions. Some like NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 are non-terminals, but others like NT20 \u2192 't17' are terminals. So, 't' strings are the terminals, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nThe string we need to check is `t4 t31 t0 t11`. Since all the elements are 't' followed by a number, I think each 't' corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So, the start is either S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility:\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nNow, looking at NT73, in the grammar there's a production NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47. So, NT73 is replaced by NT12 NT47. Similarly, NT20 can produce either 't17' or 't68' via NT20 \u2192 't17' or NT20 \u2192 NT68. Alternatively, NT20 could have other productions? Wait, looking back, NT20's productions are:\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68\nWait, looking at the grammar again: Hmm, I think I might have misread. Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, under NT20, the productions are:\n- NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68\nAnd also, later:\n- NT20 \u2192 't68' \nWait, no, looking again, in the grammar, the last few entries are:\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT20 \u2192 't68'\nAh, okay, so NT20 can produce either 't17' or 't68'. So, in the first possibility, S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nLet's take NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47. Then NT20 can be 't17' or 't68'. So, if we choose 't17', then the string so far would start with 't17', which doesn't match the given string's first element 't4'. So that's a problem. Alternatively, NT20 \u2192 't68', but that also starts with 't68', not 't4'. So that path doesn't seem to lead to the given string. So maybe this first possibility isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S also has another production. The other option is S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Let's explore that.\n\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83. Now, looking at NT95, what are its productions? I see under NT95:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT39 NT35 (I think)\nWait, let me check. Under NT95, the grammar has a production NT95 \u2192 NT35 NT39. So, that's the production. Then, looking at NT83, under NT83, the productions are:\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT95 NT83 becomes NT95 \u2192 NT35 NT39 and NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45. So, putting those together: NT35 NT39 NT22 NT45. Now, each of these could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet's look at NT35. Under NT35, the productions are:\n- NT35 \u2192 NT13 NT3\n- NT35 \u2192 NT5 NT3\n- NT35 \u2192 NT5 NT6? Wait, looking at the grammar, under NT35:\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 't5'\n- NT35 \u2192 't9'\n\nSo, NT35 has productions to 't3', 't5', and 't9'. Similarly, NT39 has productions to 't6', 't11', 't39' (wait, I think I'm misremembering). Wait, in the grammar, under NT39, I see:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n- NT39 \u2192 't6'\n- NT39 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NT39 productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT39, I see:\n- NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n- NT39 \u2192 't6' (I think it was)\n- Also, earlier in the grammar, under NT39: NT39 \u2192 't35'. So, NT39 can produce 't6' or 't35'.\n\nWait, let me verify the grammar:\n\nYes, under NT39: \n- NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n- NT39 \u2192 't6'\n- Wait, no, looking again: There's 'NT39 -> 't6'' and 'NT39 -> 't11'' elsewhere. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar again carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar entries:\n\n- NT39: two lines: \n  1. NT39 -> NT51 NT37\n  2. NT39 -> 't6' \nWait, looking again, line 43: NT39 -> NT51 NT37\nThen, later line 148: NT39 -> 't6'? No, wait the line numbers in the grammar are confusing. Let me redo this.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT39 productions properly.\n\nHere's the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT39:\n- NT39 -> NT51 NT37 (line 43)\n- NT39 -> 't6' (line 148)\nWait, maybe the original structure is as follows:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLines:\n...\n710: NT39 -> 't6'\n711: NT39 -> 't35'\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should parse the grammar properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the original grammar has:\n\n- NT39 -> NT51 NT37\n- NT39 -> 't6'\n- NT39 -> 't35'\n\nI think that's correct because earlier when I was looking, I saw lines where NT39 produced 't6' and 't35'. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, with that, proceeding.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT95 NT83, we have NT35 NT39 NT22 NT45. Let's expand each non-terminal step by step.\n\nFirst, NT35 can be 't3', 't5', or 't9'. Since our target string starts with 't4', that's not matching. So that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps there's another path, but I need to track each step.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach so far isn't correct. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should work backwards from the string and see if I can reach the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is t4 t31 t0 t11. So each element is a terminal. Let me write the string as a sequence of productions.\n\nEach terminal must come directly from a production where that non-terminal is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the terminals are things like 't0' 't1', up to 't53', etc.\n\nSo, to get 't4', 't31', 't0', 't11', each must come from a production where they are terminals. Let's list which non-terminals have productions to these 't...' terms.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT20, there's a production NT20 \u2192 't17' and another \u2192 't68'. But that's not 't4' or 't31'.\n\nLooking under other non-terminals:\n\n- NT55: 't17'\n- NT6: 't8'\n- Wait, let me list all the 't' productions.\n\nLooking through each line in the grammar:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT20 \u2192 't68'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT49 \u2192 't9'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 't5'\n- NT35 \u2192 't9' (another one)\n- NT39 \u2192 't6'\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-77","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string \"t33 t29 t3 t0 t22\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the process to check the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar rules, they all seem to be in the form of A \u2192 B C, except for some terminals like 't36' which are also A \u2192 terminal. This means each production step reduces two symbols into one, making the parse a bit straightforward.\n\nThe string I'm given is \"t33 t29 t3 t0 t22\". Since the grammar uses only two symbols on the right side of each production, the parse tree of the string should have a length of (n-1), where n is the length of the string. Since the string has 5 tokens, the parse tree would have 4 edges, meaning 5 leaves, which makes sense.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals: t33, t29, t3, t0, t22. I'll treat each as a separate unit and try to find a way to combine them using the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting from the top, the grammar starts with S, which branches into NT73 and NT20. Both of these are non-terminals, so I need to see how they can derive the respective parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t33 and t29. Wait, the first symbol is t33. So I need to find which production leads directly to t33 or can produce it through a series of steps.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 t36, but that's not helpful here. Wait, let me list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t36\n- NT38 \u2192 t29\n- NT49 \u2192 t3 (multiple times)\n- NT2 \u2192 t22\n- NT68 \u2192 t14 & 't64'\u2192t17\nWait, maybe I'm conflating symbols.

The string is t33 t29 t3 t0 t22.\n\nFirst, looking for a production where a non-terminal can produce t33 t29... or maybe the first two symbols can be broken down.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by trying to find any production that leads directly to t33. Looking at the productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 t33. So t33 must be derived from a combination of two non-terminals. Let's see where t33 appears.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47. Then, looking at NT47 \u2192 NT8 NT44, and NT8 \u2192 NT53 NT53? Wait, no. The production for NT47 is \u2192 NT8 NT44, but earlier I see NT88 \u2192 NT9 NT53, and NT96 \u2192 NT82 NT83. There's also NT27 \u2192 t33 \u2192 NT27 has rule NT27 \u2192 NT62 NT27? No, looking again: NT27 \u2192 t33, so NT27 \u2192 t33.\n\nWait, I see NT27 \u2192 t33 as a production. So to get t33, the non-terminal must be NT27.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is t33, which must come from NT27 \u2192 t33.\n\nTherefore, that's the first part. Now, what about the rest of the string?\n\nWait, after t33, the next token is t29. So the string was t33 t29 t3 t0 t22.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S \u2192 NT73 NT20, so S expands into two non-terminals: NT73 and NT20.\n\nNT73 \u2192 t36 (from earlier, but the string starts with t33, which isn't t36. Hmm. This suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine how the productions work.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which can be NT73 NT20. Both are non-terminals. So S directly produces the string NT73 NT20.\n\nEach of those non-terminals can be expanded further as per the grammar.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, it must be derivable from S through leftmost derivation (or any other), creating a parse tree where the leaves are the terminals in the string in order.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t33 t29 t3 t0 t22.\n\nLet's check each token in order.\n\nFirst token: t33.\n\nLooking for which non-terminal A can be expanded into t33. From the rules, we see that NT27 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo t33 must come from NT27.\n\nBut NT27, according to the grammar, isn't a non-terminal that branches into two non-terminals. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, I see NT27 \u2192 t33. So NT27 is a non-terminal that produces t33 directly. So in the context of the string, if t33 is derived from NT27, that would be the first step.\n\nSo, the initial S \u2192 NT73 NT20, but how does that lead to t33 as the first token?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this by trying to find the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this grammar is such that each symbol's expansion corresponds to the tokens, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each token in the string is either a terminal in the grammar or can be generated by a non-terminal in one step.\n\nLooking at the tokens:\n\n- t33: is a terminal, so it must be generated by a non-terminal that produces it directly. From the rules, NT27 \u2192 t33.\n\n- t29: a terminal, produced by NT38 \u2192 t29.\n\n- t3: produced by NT49 \u2192 t3.\n\n- t0: produced by NT68 \u2192 t0.\n\n- t22: produced by NT2 \u2192 t22.\n\nBut how do these non-terminals fit into the structure?\n\nThe string is a sequence of these terminals. So in the parse tree, the leftmost symbol must be generated from S, which branches into NT73 and NT20.\n\nSo the first expansion would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nNow, the NT73 on the left will derive part of the string, and NT20 will derive the remaining part.\n\nBut how does NT73 give t33?\n\nLooking at NT73: the productions for NT73 are:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nSo NT73 must expand into NT62 NT27.\n\nSince NT62 is another non-terminal, which has productions:\n\nLooking at NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT49.\n\nNT53 \u2192 t11 (from NT53 \u2192 t11), and NT49 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo the expansion would be t11 t3.\n\nWait, that's t11 followed by t3, but the first token in our string is t33, not t11. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the NT73 isn't the first non-terminal to expand.\n\nWait, maybe I need to structure the parse tree differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me see... The string is \"t12 t23 t9 t1 t29\". And the grammar has several productions, all of which are the form A \u2192 BC, except possibly the start symbol, which might have two non-terminals as well since it's CNF, which requires all productions to have exactly two non-terminals except the start that can have one. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are in the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can have A \u2192 a, but in this case, looking at the grammar, all rules start with S or N and then two NTs or a terminal. Hmm, maybe I need to check the exact structure.\n\nBut let me focus on the problem. The string is made up of several t's followed by numbers, so that's the terminals. From the grammar, I can see that each production either continues breaking down into more non-terminals or eventually leads into a terminal, usually with a digit and 't' like t3, t12, etc.\n\nThe string given is \"t12 t23 t9 t1 t29\". I'll need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the productions again to make sure I have them correctly, but that might take too long. Instead, perhaps I can find if each component in the string can be derived, step by step, possibly through intermediate non-terminals.\n\nThe string has five tokens: t12, t23, t9, t1, t29. Wait, but the grammar uses NT symbols, which probably break down into t's and numbers. So each t is a terminal, and numbers are probably non-terminals converted into terminals.\n\nLet me think about how this process might work. Each terminal in the string will correspond to a production that ends on a terminal. For example, t12 comes from a production that eventually leads to t12. Similarly for the other t's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal followed by a number. For instance:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT22 NT4 \u2192 ... eventually t22 t4? Wait, but t22 ends with t22, so that would be t22 t4. But in our string, we have t23, which is different.\n\nWait, let's check each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t12: In the grammar, does any production generate t12 as a terminal? Looking through the productions, I see that NT99 \u2192 NT22 NT4, and then NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63. Hmm, but there's a production for NT12 \u2192 NT84 NT68. Wait, no, that's not t12. Maybe NT12 leads to something that produces t12.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68, and in the productions, NT68 \u2192 t14. So NT20 would be NT27 t14. But t14 isn't in our string. Hmm, maybe that's a red herring.\n\nWait, maybe I should see which NT symbols lead directly to terminals. Let's look for any NT \u2192 terminal:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT44 \u2192 't31' (Wait, no, the productions are all in the NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ form, except where they have 't's. Let me check again. For example, NT44 \u2192 't4' and 't16'. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, I notice several NT productions that end with a single 't' or a number followed by 't'. For example:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\n- NT49 \u2192 't23'\n- NT88 \u2192 't28'\n- NT82 \u2192 't5'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT96 \u2192 't27'\n- NT88 \u2192 't27'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT62 \u2192 't24'\n- NT53 \u2192 't11'\n- NT27 \u2192 't33'\n- NT62 \u2192 't36'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT49 \u2192 't0'\n- NT99 \u2192 't16'\n- NT27 \u2192 't27'\n- NT49 \u2192 't2'\n- NT24 \u2192 't25'\n- NT47 \u2192 't27'\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Looking through the productions, do any NTs lead directly to 't12'? Let me check. For example:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12'? Looking... Wait, no. Looking through the list, I don't see a production for NT12 that directly leads to 't12'. Instead, perhaps it's generated via another NT:\n\nLooking at the productions, perhaps NT12 is part of a chain leading to 't12'. Wait, for example, NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68, and NT68 \u2192 't14'. But that would produce 't14', not 't12'. Alternatively, NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT63, which can produce 't28' or other terms.\n\nWait, maybe I should build an analysis tree for the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a bottom-up approach: see if each token can be matched by a terminal, starting from the root.\n\nLet me assume the string is \"t12 t23 t9 t1 t29\" and parse it using the CFG. The idea is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S into the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Reverse Derivation method, where I start from the string and see if I can work backwards towards the start symbol.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation (or any derivation) must consist of splitting terminals into NTs, eventually leading up to the start symbol.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are NTs, except the start symbol. So, in Reverse Derivation, each terminal is broken down into possible NTs that can produce it, and the NTs are then further broken down if they can produce other NTs.\n\nSo, let's try to do that.\n\nThe string is [t12, t23, t9, t1, t29]. Let's see each component:\n\n1. t12: So, the first step is to find an NT that can produce t12. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 't12' directly. So perhaps t12 is ultimately produced via a chain of NTs.\n\nLooking at the productions, perhaps there's an NT that goes through t12, like NT12 \u2192 something that leads to 't12'.

The string in question is `t30 t27 t24 t0 t30 t18`. \n\nFirst, let's understand what's given. The grammar consists of a series of productions, each of which is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. These are the standard forms of a CNF grammar. Each non-terminal on the left side of the production expands into either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. \n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t30, t27, t24, t0, t30, t18. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's break down the grammar to see which terminals correspond to which non-terminals and how they can produce the given string. \n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that many non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. For example, NT53 \u2192 t11, NT52 \u2192 t7, etc. So, each production is a way to expand a non-terminal into a single terminal or further into non-terminals.\n\nTo analyze the string, I can start by seeing if each terminal in the string corresponds to any direct production in the grammar. Let's list the terminals and their possible productions:\n\n1. t30: Looking through the productions, NT11 \u2192 t12 is not t30, but NT12 \u2192 t11, NT95 \u2192 t18. Hmm, wait, I might be missing some. Let me check each terminal.\n\nWait, I should note that some terminals are associated with multiple non-terminals, so each tX is produced by the respective non-terminal. For example, t30 is from NT24, because NT24 -> t25. Wait, no, NT24 \u2192 t25, but t25 isn't in the string. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's see: the string is `t30 t27 t24 t0 t30 t18`.\n\nEach t in the string must come from a production that directly produces that t. So, let me check each t to see which non-terminal produces it.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- t30: Is there any production where the right-hand side is t30? Looking through, I see NT64 \u2192 t24, NT68 \u2192 t14, NT11 \u2192 t12, NT35 \u2192 t3, etc. Wait, I'm looking for a production that directly produces t30. Hmm, maybe I need to check if any non-terminal directly expands to t30. Scanning the productions, I see that NT99 \u2192 t30 is not present. Hmm, so perhaps t30 must come from a longer derivation, like a chain of non-terminals expanding into terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see if each terminal in the string is present in any production as a single symbol. For example:\n\nt30: Looking at the productions, I don't see any direct expansion to t30. So, t30 must be the result of a non-terminal that eventually derives to it. So, perhaps a non-terminal like NT24 \u2192 t25 (but not t30) or NT95 \u2192 t18, but then that doesn't help. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking at the production NT24 \u2192 t25: that's not t30. Wait, maybe I should look for terminals like t30 in the productions. Scanning, I see that NT12 \u2192 t11, NT96 \u2192 t27, NT26 \u2192 t20, etc. Hmm, no direct productions for t30. So, that suggests that t30 must come from a non-terminal that has a production involving t30. But I don't see any such production in the given grammar. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no: looking at the productions, I see NT27 \u2192 t33, NT62 \u2192 t24, NT53 \u2192 t11, NT96 \u2192 t27. Hmm, let's see: NT64 \u2192 t24, so t24 is produced by NT64. Then, t24 is correct for the string. Wait, the third element is t24, so that's NT64.\n\nNext, the string is t30. So, for t30, it must come from a non-terminal that expands to t30. Let's see: is there a production where the RHS is t30? I don't see one. So perhaps t30 is produced by a longer expansion. For example, maybe a non-terminal A \u2192 B t30. Or perhaps t30 is only a symbol that is the result of a chain.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts from a longer production. Wait, the initial productions start with S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Let me see the first elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the entire derivation. Let me try to see how the string can be built.\n\nThe string is `t30 t27 t24 t0 t30 t18`. Let's break it down into the individual terminals:\n\n1. t30\n2. t27\n3. t24\n4. t0\n5. t30\n6. t18\n\nSo, let's see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nt30 is tricky because I don't see a production for it directly. Maybe it's a result of expanding a non-terminal that eventually produces it. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake and t30 is produced by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that NT99 \u2192 t10, but that's not helpful. Let's check each t in the string:\n\n- t30: Perhaps from NT99, but wait, looking for any expansion leading to t30. Or maybe a chain like NT24 \u2192 t25, but that's not t30.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production. Let me scan through the productions again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT27 \u2192 t33, NT62 \u2192 t24, etc. Hmm, no t30 found. That suggests that t30 cannot be produced by any non-terminal in this grammar, which would mean the string cannot be generated. But that can't be right because the problem gives a string and expects a yes or no.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the productions again. Are there any that produce t30? Hmm, no. So, perhaps the string contains a terminal that's not in the grammar, making it invalid. So, if the string contains any t that doesn't have a production in the grammar, it's automatically no.\n\nWait, but the user provided a list of productions. Let me check that list again to make sure I didn't miss a production that produces t30.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- The productions are as follows, and I don't see any that produce t30.\n\nSo, that would mean that the string cannot be generated because it contains a terminal that the grammar doesn't produce.

{"custom_id":"request-101","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to check is \"t10 t9 t9 t14 t12 t3\". \n\nFirst, I should remember what CNF entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or with a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's a bit complex with many production rules. My goal is to see if I can break down the string step by step according to the grammar rules. Since the string is provided as separate tokens separated by spaces, I assume it's a sequence of these symbols that needs to be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list the production rules for the terminals I see in the string: t10, t9, t9, t14, t12, t3. The terminals in the grammar include t10, t14, t12, t3, among others. So the first step is to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals directly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some production rules directly produce terminals:\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n- NT80 \u2192 NT71 NT99\n- NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- NT44 \u2192 't31'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't88'\n- NT22 \u2192 't26'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17' etc.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to have some inconsistencies. Let me check. For example, looking at NT20, one of the productions is NT20 \u2192 't17', but in the string we have t17 is not present; our string is t10 t9 t9 t14 t12 t3. Hmm, so maybe that's not the case. Let me verify the given grammar.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT20 is written as 't17' in one production, but in the list, another production for NT20 is \"NT20 \u2192 NT53 NT27\". Wait, no, looking again, the rules sometimes have the terminals written with single quotes or as regular strings. I think in this grammar, 't10' is a terminal, as it appears as a terminal production. Wait, perhaps the productions have 't's as terminals, but sometimes a production may generate another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The grammar is written with some productions ending with an apostrophe and digits, which I think are direct terminal productions. For example, NT44 \u2192 't31' would mean that NT44 can produce the terminal 't31'. Similarly, NT49 \u2192 't3', and others.\n\nSo, in the given string, I have 't10', 't9', 't9', 't14', 't12', 't3'. So I need to see if each of these can be generated by some non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list which production rules generate each of these t's:\n\n- 't10' is produced by NT96 \u2192 't10'\n- 't9' is produced by NT6 \u2192 't9'\n- 't9' again is the same as above.\n- 't14' is produced by NT26 \u2192 't26' which is 't14'? Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT26 \u2192 't20'. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let's go through each terminal in the string and find which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string is a series of t's, each of which is a terminal, I can work backwards from the start symbol S, trying to expand it step by step to see if I can reach the given string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83, according to the rules. So S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nLet me pick one of them, say S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Now, each of these non-terminals (NT73 and NT20) must expand into the given string.\n\nWait, but the string is six t's. So to generate six t's, S must have two expansions leading to a chain that includes six t's. That might be complicated, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to parse the string by reversing the process. Let me look at the string and see if it can be built up step by step.\n\nThe string is t10 t9 t9 t14 t12 t3.\n\nLet's note that each step in the grammar expansion would involve replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since it's CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So to build the string, I would start with S and have to expand it into the sequence. But perhaps I can look for each t in the string and see if they can be generated by some non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can start from the end and see if the rightmost symbols can be derived.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a parse tree approach.\n\nLet me try to map each t in the string to possible non-terminals that can generate them.\n\nLet me list each t and see which non-terminals can produce them:\n\n- t10: produced by NT96 \u2192 't10'\n- t9: produced by NT6 \u2192 't9'\n- t9: same as above\n- t14: Hmm, looking at the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 't31', NT26 \u2192 't20', etc. But t14 is not directly produced by any of the given rules. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't20'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT88 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't25'\n\nWait, I don't see a production that directly produces t14. Did I miss one?\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36' and 't29' appears in NT49 \u2192 't29', etc. But I don't see t14 being directly produced. Maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions, which might be the ones with 'a's:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I find:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't31'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't88'\n- NT22 \u2192 't26'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17' (but in our string, I don't see t17)\nWait, in the given string, we have t14, but I don't see any rule that produces t14. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't10'\n- NT6 \u2192 't9'\n- NT44 \u2192 't31'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14' (because in the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 't14')\nWait, yes, looking at the rules: NT68 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo t14 is produced by NT68.\n\nSimilarly, t12 is produced by NT12 \u2192 't11' or NT12 is also a non-terminal that leads to something else.\n\nWait, in the string, we have t14.\n\nSo let's list each t in the string with their possible generating non-terminals:\n\n- t10: generated by NT96\n- t9: generated by NT6\n- t9: again NT6\n- t14: generated by NT68\n- t12: generated by NT12 \u2192 but wait, does NT12 produce a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules: I don't see NT12 producing a terminal, but I do see NT12 appearing in other productions. For example, NT12 is part of NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85, but those are non-terminals. Wait, but perhaps NT12 leads to something else.\n\nWait, but in the string we have t12 as the last part. How would t12 be generated? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any production for NT12 that ends with a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-118","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string `t33 t17 t16 t29 t30 t33 t18` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and from what I remember, that means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Or wait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form usually allows the left-hand side to be a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side to be two non-terminals, or a terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammar here seems to fit that, because each rule on the left has one non-terminal, and on the right, sometimes two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is `t33 t17 t16 t29 t30 t33 t18`. So each of these is a terminal symbol, which must correspond to some right-hand side of a production. So to generate this string, starting from S, we must expand step by step, each time replacing a non-terminal with two others (possibly terminals) until we reach all terminals.\n\nThe process would involve creating a parse tree where the leaves are these t's, and each internal node is a non-terminal that expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. The order of the t's must match the parse tree.\n\nSo first, I should look for which non-terminals can expand into a terminal. From the grammar rules, I can see some NTs expand into a single terminal, like NT26 \u2192 't20', NT24 \u2192 't25', etc. So the approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by starting from S and expanding until we get the terminals in the order given.\n\nI think the best way is to try to find the parse tree. Let's start by identifying which non-terminals could directly lead to the first t, which is t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which rules produce 't33'. I look through the rules, and I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 't24'\nNT53 \u2192 't11'\nNT27 \u2192 't33'\nNT62 \u2192 't36'\nNT53 \u2192 't23'\nBut that doesn't include 't33'. Wait, do any NTs expand to 't33'? Looking through the rules, yes:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo the first t is t33, which must come from NT27. So in the parse tree, the root starts with S, which has two options. The first option is S->NT73 NT20, the second is S->NT95 NT83. Let's see what each of these could produce.\n\nLooking at the string, the first t is t33, which comes from NT27, so perhaps the S rule used is the one that leads to something that can generate NT27. Let's check the options:\n\nFor S->NT73 NT20, then S's expansion would produce two non-terminals NT73 and NT20. Now, looking at the grammar, NT20 \u2192 't17' or 't17' is a production. Wait, no, let me check: Looking at the rules, NT20 is on the left of two productions: NT20\u2192 NT27 NT68 and NT20 \u2192 't17'. So NT20 can either expand into two non-terminals or a terminal 't17'. Similarly, NT73 has several rules: looking at the NT73 rule, it's in the rules as S -> NT73 NT20, but within the grammar, NT73 has other productions, like NT73\u2192NT62 NT27. So perhaps NT73 can expand into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, to avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to consider each step.\n\nSo the first t is t33, which comes from NT27. So one part is NT27. Now, looking at NT27's rules, it's a rule: NT27 \u2192 't33'. So that part is terminal, so the entire path from S to this t33 would have to go through NT27 being expanded directly to t33. So the other part must then be another non-terminal, which, when expanded, would provide the rest of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the S expands to NT27 as one of its two parts? Wait, no, because S has two parts: S->NT73 NT20 or S->NT95 NT83. So when starting from S, the first expansion is either NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83.\n\nGiven that the first t is t33 from NT27, which is a leaf, perhaps the S must expand via the path that leads to NT27.\n\nWait, but how does the root S lead to NT27? Because S doesn't have a rule that directly produces NT27. So perhaps the path is S \u2192 NT73 \u2192 ... \u2192 NT27 \u2192 t33.\n\nLet me see. NT73's production: looking at the rules, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. And then NT62's production: NT62 \u2192 't33'. Wait, that's a problem because that would make T33 followed by T33. But in the string, it's T33 once.\n\nWait, let me double-check: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 (from the given rules under NT73). Now, NT62 has a rule: NT62 \u2192 't24' or 't36' or 't33'. Looking at the rules, NT62's rules are: NT62 \u2192 't24' (from the rule I provided earlier). Wait, actually, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT62, I see:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't24' (earlier when I converted, I think I might have confused NT62 with other NTs. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the line is: NT62 \u2192 't33'. Wait, no, looking for NT62: under NT62, I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 't24'\nNT62 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, no, let me look again:\n\nFrom the provided rules, looking for NT62:\n\nI see multiple entries, like:\n\nNT62 \u2192 't24'\nNT62 \u2192 't33'\n\nYes, here's the relevant part:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, under NT62's productions, I see:\n\n\"NT62 -> 't24'\nNT62 -> 't33'\"\n\nOkay, so NT62 can produce either t24 or t33. So if NT73 expands into NT62 NT27, and NT62 can produce t33 (as one option), then T33 would be one of the terminals in the string.\n\nSo let's follow this path.\n\nSo S expands to NT73 NT20. Then, NT73 expands to NT62 NT27. NT62 then can expand to 't33', and NT27 can expand to 't33'. But wait, that would produce two t33s in a row, because NT73 is NT62 and NT27, both of which have rules that produce 't33' or other t's. Wait, but if NT62 is t33 and NT27 is t33, then the substring from S would have 't33 t33', but the input string has a single 't33' followed by 't17' etc. So that would not match.\n\nTherefore, maybe NT62 doesn't expand to 't33' here. Maybe it's another production. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first expansion is S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Let's see where that leads us.\n\nNT95: Looking at the rules for NT95, there are a few options. For example, NT95\u2192't18' or NT95\u2192't35', etc. But the first t is t33, so perhaps that's not the path we want. Wait, but let me check the rules for NT95. In the provided grammar, NT95 appears under S as a rule, but perhaps looking elsewhere:\n\nLooking for NT95, I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't35'\nNT95 \u2192 't39'\netc. Hmm, perhaps the production for NT95 is NT95\u2192't18' as well. But to get t33, maybe that's not the correct path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is 't33'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce 't33'.

{"custom_id":"request-119","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the string \"t18 t37 t1 t36 t1 t36 t20\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is structured with multiple non-terminals (like S, NT52, NT71, etc.) that lead to terminal symbols (like t18, t37, etc.). Each production rule in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is a sequence of terminal symbols: t18, t37, t1, t36, t1, t36, t20. Since each production only replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals), the string's length is related to the derivation steps. The grammar uses two non-terminals per production, so for n terminal symbols, the number of nodes in the parse tree would be 2^n. Wait, that might not be directly applicable here, but I'll think through the specific steps.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the string must start with either \"NT73\" and \"NT20\" or \"NT95\" and \"NT83\". But in the provided string, the start is t18, which is a terminal. So, let's see what NT95 and NT73 produce.\n\nLooking at the NT95 production: NT95 \u2192 't18', so t18 is directly derived from NT95. Similarly, NT20's production is 't17'. Wait, but in the string, after t18 comes t37, which is not directly derived from NT95 or NT20. So perhaps the S rule S \u2192 NT95 NT83 is the one being used since the first symbol is t18 from NT95.\n\nWait, no, because NT95 is a non-terminal, so when we expand S using S \u2192 NT95 NT83, T1 is NT95, and T2 is NT83.\n\nSo the first symbol is t18 (from NT95), and the second is whatever NT83 produces. Looking at NT83's productions:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\nNT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24\nNT83 \u2192 NT9 NT53\nNT83 \u2192 NT47 NT73\n\nLooking at the string, after t18 comes t37. So after NT95 (which is t18), the next symbol should come from NT83. So, which production of NT83 leads to t37?\n\nWait, looking at NT83's productions, none directly produce t37. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking through the NT productions, I see:\n\nFor NT37, the productions are:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT85 NT55\nNT37 \u2192 NT95 NT39\nNT37 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT37 \u2192 NT99 NT27\n\nNone of these produce t37 directly. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I need to track each step. Let me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t18 t37 t1 t36 t1 t36 t20.\n\nSo, the initial S would expand into two non-terminals, say A and B, such that A can produce t18 and B can produce the rest.\n\nLooking at S's first production: S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So NT73 and NT20. NT20 is 't17' from its production, but the string starts with t18, which would come from NT95. So perhaps S is using the second production, S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nSo the first symbol t18 comes from NT95. Now, the second symbol in the string after t18 is t37. So, the NT83 must produce the substring starting with t37. But looking at NT83's productions:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\nNT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24\nNT83 \u2192 NT9 NT53\nNT83 \u2192 NT47 NT73\n\nNone of these directly produce a terminal, so after NT83 is expanded, the next symbol in the string is t37, which must come from one of NT22, NT38, etc.\n\nWait, looking further, NT37 is involved in other productions. For example, production NT24 is in NT44's rules, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's look for which NT leads to t37.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\nNT37: productions are as before, none directly produce t37.\n\nNT99: multiple productions, but none seem to produce t37.\n\nWait, did I miss any NT that ends with t37? Looking back, in the NT productions:\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm missing a production. Let me go through each NT.\n\nLooking at NT47: productions include NT8 and NT44. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's NT6, NT2, or other lower-numbered Nts. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT73: production to t36.\n\nLooking for a NT that can produce t37. Hmm.\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see NT39: NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37, so yes, NT39 can produce t37 through NT37.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So, starting from S \u2192 NT95 NT83, we have t18 from NT95.\n\nNow, NT83 could expand into something that eventually leads to t37. Let's consider NT83's productions again.\n\nNT83 can go to NT22 and NT45, or NT38 and NT24, or NT9 and NT53, or NT47 and NT73.\n\nWait, for example, if NT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24, then NT38 and NT24 need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT38, it has a production: NT38 \u2192 t36. Oh, yes! So if NT38 expands to t36, then perhaps the string can proceed.\n\nWait, but the next symbol after t18 is t37, so let's see:\n\nSo, after t18 (from NT95), the next part is t37. That would have to come from a combination where one side is t37 and the other is t? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the second part of NT83's expansion is t37, which must come from a NT that leads to t37.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is t18 t37 t1 t36 t1 t36 t20.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNT95 \u2192 t18.\n\nNT83 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the string after t18 is t37, so the next symbol must come from NT83's expansion. Since NT83 expands to two non-terminals, we need to get a t37 from one of those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT83 doesn't directly produce t37, so we need to see if any path from NT83 leads to t37.\n\nLooking at NT83's productions:\n\n1. NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n2. NT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24\n3. NT83 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n4. NT83 \u2192 NT47 NT73\n\nNone of these directly yield t37, so we need to see if any of these NTs can produce t37.\n\nLooking at these:\n\n1. NT22: production NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63\n   Then, NT44 \u2192 t4? Wait, no, NT44 \u2192 't4'.\n   Wait, but NT22 would expand to NT44 NT63. So NT22 would contribute nt44 and nt63, which are terminals. So NT22 would become 't4' followed by 't14' (since NT63 \u2192 't14').\n   So 't4 t14' from NT22.\n\n2. NT38: NT38 \u2192 t36 (among other options). So if NT38 is expanded, it can produce t36.\n\n3. NT9 \u2192 't17' (a terminal).\n\n4. NT47 \u2192 't27' (terminals). But wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at NT47's productions: NT47 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-135","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t36 t29 t1 t30 t4 t23 t6 t1`.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have specific structures where each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. This means that any string derived from the grammar must have a derivation tree where each node represents a production rule, and the leaves are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, each rule has exactly two non-terminals except for the ones that produce a single terminal. So, for example, S -> NT73 NT20 means that S is two non-terminals, and each of those can be split further until we reach terminals.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of seven tokens: `t36 t29 t1 t30 t4 t23 t6 t1`. Wait, actually, that's 8 tokens. Hmm, let me count again. The string provided has eight terminal symbols: t36, t29, t1, t30, t4, t23, t6, t1.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S can produce either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So, the first step is to see which of these could be the root of the derivation.\n\nLet's consider the first option: S -> NT73 NT20. Then, each of NT73 and NT20 must expand into terminals. Let's look at the productions for NT73 and NT20.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n\nSo, starting with NT73, it produces NT62 and NT27. Let's see what those produce.\n\nLooking up NT62: it can go to NT53 or NT26. NT53 goes to NT44 and NT52, and NT44 goes to 't31'. So, NT62 -> NT53 -> NT44 -> 't31'.\n\nNT27: looking up, NT27 -> NT62 NT27, which seems circular. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking back: NT27 -> NT62 NT27, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, NT27 might have other productions? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT27 having any other productions except perhaps the mentioned ones. So, maybe I went the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps NT27 is part of a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the rules again. NT27 is present in the productions, but looking more carefully, I see that NT27 is a target of another production, like NT99 -> NT27. So maybe the path is longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's take the provided string and see if each terminal can be produced by some non-terminal, starting from the root S.\n\nThe string is: t36, t29, t1, t30, t4, t23, t6, t1.\n\nWait, the string has 8 symbols. Since the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can potentially produce more non-terminals or a terminal. So, the length of the derivation would depend on how many splits and reductions happen.\n\nIn this case, the string has 8 terminals, which might mean that the parse tree has 8 leaves, so the depth of the tree is 3, since each split increases the depth, and each production of two non-terminals would contribute to the leaves.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, let's try to see if it can be divided into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol S. It can produce two non-terminals, say A and B. Then, each of A and B must produce some sequences that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLet's consider S -> NT73 NT20. So, A = NT73, B = NT20.\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nSo, A expands to NT62 and NT27.\n\nLooking at NT62: it can go to NT53 or NT26. Let's see the options.\n\nNT53 -> NT44 NT52, and NT44 -> 't31'. NT44 is a terminal 't31'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> NT20 NT63. Wait, NT20 is another non-terminal. Let's see:\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t36. Hmm, perhaps NT62 -> NT44 (t31) and then another path. But t31 isn't in the string immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT62 -> NT53, which then -> NT44 (t31) and others. But the first token is t36, which is produced by NT36, but looking at the grammar rules, I don't see a production rule that directly produces t36 as a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back, I notice that several lines in the grammar end with 'tX'. For example:\n\n- NT6 -> NT88 NT73\n- NT73 -> 't36' or other non-terminals\n- NT88 -> 't28' or other\n- NT74 ->...\n- NT53 ->...\n- NT26 ->...\n- NT49 ->...\n- NT94 ->...\nWait, I see that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT36 -> 't36', etc.\n\nLooking for 't36' in the grammar, it's produced by NT36, but is NT36 a non-terminal? Wait, in the grammar, there are lines like:\n\n- NT36 -> 't36' \u2014 no, looking back, perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, I see lines like:\n\n- NT6 -> 't88' or 't73', not 't36'.\n\nWait, let me scan through all the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for any NT->'t...':\n\nYes, I see a few:\n\n- NT2 -> 't22'\n- NT4 -> 't11'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT64 -> 't17'\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT35 -> 't5'\n- NT63 -> 't29'\n- NT96 -> 't20'\n- NT4 -> 't11'\n- NT49 -> 't23'\n- NT82 -> 't5'\n- NT83 -> 't28'\n- NT37 -> 't31'\n- ... and others.\n\nWait, I see that NT27 -> NT62 NT27 (circular), but another path is NT73 -> NT62 NT27. So, perhaps the terminals in the string correspond to certain non-terminals that can generate t tokens.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t36, t29, t1, t30, t4, t23, t6, t1.\n\nI need to find a sequence of non-terminals that can produce these terminals when expanded.\n\nLet's try to break down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, t36. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't36'? Let's see:\n\nI see NT6 -> 't88' or 't73', but not t36.\n\nNT99 -> 't36'? Wait, looking through the lines:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's:\n\n- NT83 -> 't28'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT95 -> 't37'\n- NT88 -> 't38'... Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol is t36, which comes from a non-terminal that directly produces it.

Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and from the production rules, I see that S can produce two options: NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So any valid string must start with one of these combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t20. Let's see which grammar rules produce t20. Checking the rules:\n\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n- NT68 -> t14\nSo, NT20 can be derived from NT27 and NT68, which then become t27 and t14. Let me write that: NT20 \u2192 t14 (since NT68 is t14 and NT27 is t27, but wait, does that mean NT20 actually becomes 't27 t14'? Hmm, maybe I need to reconstruct the entire string trace.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t20, so maybe the first production is NT20, which then becomes a sequence of tokens. So, perhaps the overall string is built from one of the S productions.\n\nWait, but the string is `t20 t36 t12 t5 t12 t37 t0 t9`. Let me parse this as a sequence of tokens.\n\nI think the approach here is to reconstruct the parse tree or see if the string can be generated by any of the grammar's rules. Each production can be seen as a transformation rule, so let's try to see how the string can be built.\n\nStarting from S, the first production is either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's consider the first one: S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nNow, NT73 can produce t27 (from the rule NT73 -> t27) and NT42 or wait, let me check the rules again. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for where NT73 occurs:\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- Also, another rule: NT73 -> t36\n\nSo, NT73 can either become t36 or further split into NT62 and NT27. Similarly, NT20:\n\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n- NT68 -> t14\n- NT27 -> t27\n\nWait, no: NT27's rule is NT27 -> NT62 NT27, which then leads to t62 and t27.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to parse this string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t20 t36 t12 t5 t12 t37 t0 t9\n\nI think I should model each token as a result of a production, starting from S.\n\nFirst, S can be NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's try the first option: NT73 and NT20.\n\nSo, N73 NT20 needs to produce the string.\n\nLet's look at NT20: the only rule for NT20 is NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68.\n\nThen, NT27's rules: Looking back, NT27-> NT62 NT27 or is there another way? Wait, looking at all the rules, I see NT27-> NT62 NT27 and NT27-> t62. Wait, wait, no:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27 or t36\n- NT27 has rule: NT27-> NT62 NT27 and NT27-> t62\n\nWait, no, let me check the full list:\n\nWait, looking through the list provided:\n\nI see lines like:\nNT52 -> NT80 NT47\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\nNT82 -> NT51 NT84\nAnd so on. Hmm, in the grammar rules, for NT27, I don't see it directly. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I do see:\nNT27 -> t33\nAnd earlier, NT62 -> t24.\n\nWait, let me recheck all the grammar rules. Okay, after some scrolling:\n\nI see NT27 -> t62 maybe? Wait, no. Let me go through each rule:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT27 isn't directly producing anything except in cases where other NTs lead to it. Wait, let's check each NT rule:\n\nLooking for NT73:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27 or t36.\n\nSo, from NT73, we can get either t36 or NT62 NT27.\n\nSimilarly, for NT20:\n\n- NT20-> NT27 NT68.\n\nAnd NT68->t14.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The string starts with t20.\n\nBut t20 is not a terminal, unless I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in the grammar rules, are terminals just the t-numbers?\n\nLooking back, for NT20: the rule is NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68. So, to get t20, maybe NT20 needs to produce t20? Wait, but in the list, I don't see NT20 producing a terminal. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to track how each NT is derived.\n\nWait, perhaps the string t20 is the result of NT20, but NT20 can't produce t20 directly. So perhaps the initial step is to see how the string can be generated.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should construct a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, think of the string as generated step by step.\n\nThe string is t20 t36 t12 t5 t12 t37 t0 t9. Let\u2019s see how each of these can be links in the grammar.\n\nFirst, t20.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which rule produces a terminal, specifically 't20'? Hmm, looking at the list, does any rule produce 't20'?\n\nYes! Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT20 -> 't27' ?\nWait, no, wait.\n\nLooking again, I see a rule for NT24: NT24 -> t25.\n\nWait, but looking through all the rules:\n\nDo any rules produce 't20'?\n\nWait, at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> t33\n- NT62 -> t24\n- NT53 -> 't11'\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT producing 't20' as a terminal. Wait, that's a problem. Because in the string, the first token is t20.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only NT that transitions are the ones given. So perhaps t20 is part of a non-terminal symbol. But wait, let me check: perhaps I misread the rules.\n\nWait, in the list, under NT20, there is \"NT20 -> 't27'\". Wait, let me make sure.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nFor example: NT64 -> 't24', NT49 -> 't9', etc.\n\nWait, here's the entire grammar provided:\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe lines for NT20:\n\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT20 -> 't12'\n- NT20 -> 't27'\n\nWait, no, I might have misread. Let me go through the list carefully.\n\nWait, the user listed a long list of grammar rules. Let me look for NT20:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n\nAnother rule: \n\n- NT20 -> 't22' ? No, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, in the list:\n\nWait, the user's grammar includes:\n\nNT20 has a rule:\n- NT20->'t22' ?\n\nNo, check again. Let's see:\n\nLooking all the way at the end, I see:\n\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT20 -> 't27'\n- Wait, maybe I'm missing this. Wait, looking through all the lines, perhaps there is a rule like NT20 -> 't22'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's take it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is: 't20 t36 t12 t5 t12 t37 t0 t9'\n\nSo, the first token is 't20'.

{"custom_id":"request-156","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t12 t5 t27 t30 t27 t20 t10 t4 t10`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has two main rules: \n1. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals.\n2. There's also the empty string production, S \u2192 \u03b5.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions start with S and NTs on the left, and each production is either two non-terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, NT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96, etc. That seems to fit the CNF structure.\n\nThe string to evaluate consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. In the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce these 't' strings. For example, NT38 \u2192 't36', NT44 \u2192 't31', and so on. So, each 't' in the string might correspond to a production from a non-terminal.\n\nTo check if the string can be generated by the grammar, I need to see if it can be broken down into the right sequence of non-terminals that ultimately derive back to S.\n\nLet me approach this as a parsing problem. I'll start by listing the string: `t12 t5 t27 t30 t27 t20 t10 t4 t10`. I'll number the positions from 0 to 8 for clarity.\n\nEach 't' corresponds to a non-terminal, so I can map each 'tX' to its production rule. For example, 't12' must come from a non-terminal that has a production yielding 't12'. Looking at my grammar, I see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't11' (But wait, that's 't11', not 't12')\n- Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check all 'tX' in the grammar.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- `t12` appears in NT85 \u2192 't12', but NT85 \u2192 't27', not 't12'.\nWait no, let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the productions, perhaps I should make a list of each production that results in 'tX' and their rule.\n\nFor example, NT49 \u2192 't9', NT62 \u2192 't24', NT53 \u2192 't11', etc. But none of these produce 't12' directly. Hmm. Wait, maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, the grammar includes NT85 \u2192 't12' according to:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT85 has several rules. Wait, looking through:\n\nLooking at production NT85:\n- NT85 \u2192 't12' (Is that correct?) Wait, in the provided grammar, the lines are a bit jumbled. Let me parse them more carefully.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT85 \u2192 't12' (Yes, that's one line: NT85 -> 't12')\n- Similarly, NT95 \u2192 't18', NT35 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo 't12' comes from NT85, which is a non-terminal. So in the string, the first 't12' in the string corresponds to NT85 deriving into 't12'.\n\nNow, the first token is 't12', which must come from a production of NT85, so that production is NT85 \u2192 't12'.\n\nNow, let's move to the subsequent tokens. The second token is 't5'. I need to find which non-terminal can produce 't5'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't5'? Wait, checking the grammar...\n\nLooking at NT35: Wait, I see:\n\nNT35 has several productions, one of which is NT35 \u2192 't3' (I think no, let me check again).\n\nWait, checking each line:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't18'\n- NT85 \u2192 't12'\n- NT96 \u2192 't20'\n- NT88 \u2192 't28'\n- NT52 \u2192 't24' (Wait, looking again, I see NT52 has multiple productions, including NT52 \u2192 't24', but earlier in the grammar, I see NT52 \u2192 't24'? Let me confirm:\n\nThe grammar lines include:\n\nLooking for NTx productions that result in 'tX':\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'? Wait, perhaps I'm confusing 'tX' and the non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for all NTs that have a production that results in a 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's consider that each time a non-terminal appears on the left-hand side of a rule, and if that rule produces a 'tX' on the right, then that's where the 'tX' comes from.\n\nBut wait, maybe the 'tX' are the terminals where non-terminals expand into. So, whenever a non-terminal has a rule that includes a terminal, then that can produce the 'tX'.\n\nBut first, let's list all the non-terminals and their rules, and see which ones can produce a 'tX'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list for each 'tX' the possible non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, here are the rules that produce 'tX's:\n\n- NT85 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't5' (Is that correct?

But in our string, after 't12', we have 't5', so that wouldn't fit.\n\nWait, let me go through each 'tX' in the string and see if there's a non-terminal that can produce them.\n\nFirst token: 't12' \u2192 from NT85.\n\nSecond token: 't5' \u2192 Looking for a non-terminal that can produce 't5'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nDoes any NT have a production that includes 't5'?\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't3' (Not 't5')\n- Hmm, not seeing one. Did I miss something? Let me check the grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking at the production lines, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't5' except:\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for NT35, because in the grammar, I see NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37, and then NT51 \u2192 NT64 NT90, etc. Wait, I'm perhaps getting off track.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the rules involve a non-terminal that produces 't5' indirectly.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the analysis. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, all non-terminals are on the left side of the productions, except for the terminals. Each production has exactly two non-terminals except where a terminal is involved, but in this case, the string seems to have all terminals. Wait, no\u2014the grammar provided includes productions where some right-hand sides have non-terminals and some have terminals. Wait no, actually, looking back, the initial productions are like S -> NT73 NT20, but then later there are productions where the right-hand sides are a mix of NT and terminals. But given that the string we have to evaluate is a sequence of terminals (t29, t33, etc.), I'm thinking that the given grammar might actually be one where each production has exactly two terminals, i.e., it's in CNF but with only terminals on the right side. Wait, no, some productions have a mix of NT and terminals. Hmm, maybe I should look for how the string can be built using the given grammar.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the string may or may not be in the language defined by the grammar, and I have to determine if it is. So, perhaps the approach is to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nBut given the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if they can be produced by the grammar. Each symbol in the string should correspond to a production in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> B C, where B and C are non-terminals, except that some productions may have terminals as well. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must have either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, productions are either A->B or A->BC. So, in this grammar, I think all productions are either single terminals or two non-terminals. Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, many of the productions on the right-hand side have both NT and terminals, which might not conform to CNF as described. Hmm, maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, no, actually, CNF allows for productions that are either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. But in this case, perhaps the grammar has more than two symbols on the right-hand side, but looking at the given rules, I don't see any that have more than two non-terminals, so it's okay. Each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. Hmm, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that in the initial part, the productions for S and some other NT are combinations of NTs, but then other productions have a mix of NTs and terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that in the initial context-free grammar, all the productions (on the right-hand side) are either two non-terminals or two terminals, but in this case, the right-hand side may include terminals mixed with NTs. Wait, no, that would not fit Chomsky Normal Form. Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production is either A->BC (two non-terminals) or A->a, where a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, every production must have either a single terminal or two non-terminals. But looking at the given rules, let me see:\n\nFor example, S->NT73 NT20: that's two NTs, so that's fine. But other rules like NT73 -> NT62 NT27: again two NTs. However, some other rules have a terminal on the right, like NT82->'t5', which would be a production from a non-terminal to a single terminal. So, that's allowed.\n\nWait, but some rules have both NT and terminals, but according to CNF, the right-hand side can only be a single terminal or two non-terminals. So if I see something like NT52->NT80 NT27 (which is two NTs, fine) or NT52-> NT12 NA..., no, actually, looking closer, most rules are either two NTs or a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see that some rules are like NT55->'t17' which is a terminal, and some are like NT6->NT88 NT73, which is two NTs. So that fits Chomsky Normal Form: each production has either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nTherefore, the grammar is in CNF. Now, the string we have is `t29 t33 t12 t17 t2 t30 t18 t17 t35`. So it's a sequence of terminals. To determine if this string is in the language, I need to check if the grammar can produce this string through a series of steps that convert S into this sequence.\n\nOne approach is to parse the string from right to left, since in a right-recursive or left-recursive grammar, one parse approach may be more effective, but given the structure, perhaps a recursive descent parser approach would work. Alternatively, since each production can only have up to two symbols on the right, a bottom-up parsing approach could be feasible.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see each terminal in the string and identify how each can be derived. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each must correspond to leaves in the parse tree, each being the result of a production that terminates in a terminal symbol.\n\nGiven the string has 9 symbols, the parse tree must be such that each symbol is derived from some terminal production. So each symbol in the string must be matched to a production's terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me map the string: t29, t33, t12, t17, t2, t30, t18, t17, t35.\n\nSo the last symbol in the string is t35, and the first is t29.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation is used, but bottom-up parsing might be easier here.\n\nAlternatively, thinking of each terminal as a production whose bodies are consumed step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can map each terminal to its corresponding left-hand side (LHS) non-terminal. For example, if the string is broken down, each terminal must match the RHS of a production.\n\nLet me check each terminal and see which production they come from.\n\nStarting from the last symbol, t35.\n\nLooking through the grammar to see which productions have t35 on the RHS.\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT59->'t9'?

{"custom_id":"request-183","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t22 t12 t28 t12 t22 t25 t36 t9 t28 t12`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production rule either produces two terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and it seems to produce two non-terminals each time, like S -> NT73 NT73 or similar. \n\nLooking at the productions, many non-terminals have rules that are combinations of other non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals. For instance, NT20 -> 't22', NT22 -> 't2', etc. These terminal rules are key because they tell us how strings can be formed.\n\nThe string I need to check has the sequence of t's: t22, t12, t28, t12, t22, t25, t36, t9, t28, t12.\n\nI should start from the start symbol S and try to find a way to derive the string. Each step in the derivation must follow the production rules, and the end result should match the string exactly.\n\nSo, S can produce S is replaced by two non-terminals. Let's see the options:\nS -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nI'll need to track the two non-terminals generated each time because the string is a sequence of ten t's, which should correspond to ten terminal symbols. Each production splits the non-terminals into smaller components until we reach the terminal symbols.\n\nLet me outline the string as a list: [t22, t12, t28, t12, t22, t25, t36, t9, t28, t12].\n\nLooking at the last symbol, t12. In the grammar, which non-terminals produce t12? \n\nLooking at the productions:\nNT12 -> 't11' OR NT12 -> ... Wait, actually looking back, I think NT12 is used in some production. Let's check the grammar carefully.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has NT12 -> 't11'? Let me find all the terminals. Hmm, looking through, I don't see NT12 directly producing t12. Instead, I see NT12 -> 't11'. So, t12 isn't directly from NT12.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan through all the productions for terminal outputs. I notice NT20 -> 't22', NT22 -> 't2', NT25 is not a terminal; it's from NT25 -> ... Wait, looking through, NT25 isn't a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps I should consider reconstructing the parse tree starting from S, ensuring that each step aligns with the string.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm for parsing, but given the complexity, maybe I can manually check.\n\nLet's see the structure of the string. It has ten t's, so the derivation must progress by splitting into smaller non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nFirst step: S produces two non-terminals. Let's say S -> A B. So the string starts with the first part generated by A and then B.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t22, t12, t28, etc. If A is supposed to produce the first part, which is t22, t12, etc., but A can't directly produce multiple t's, so A must itself be a non-terminal that can split into more non-terminals until we get down to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see if the entire string can be broken down according to the production rules.\n\nLet me look at each part of the string and see how they can be split into non-terminals.\n\nThe string is t22 t12 t28 t12 t22 t25 t36 t9 t28 t12.\n\nGiven that the production starts with S, each step produces two non-terminals. So the total number of non-terminals at each step will decrease by one until we reach ten terminals. But perhaps this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the reverse approach: start from the string and see if we can reduce it according to the productions.\n\nStarting with the entire string: t22 t12 t28 t12 t22 t25 t36 t9 t28 t12.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t22. From the grammar, which production produces 't22'? Looking through, NT20 -> 't22' and NT12 -> 't11'. Wait, so t22 comes directly only from NT20.\n\nSo, if we have t22, it's the result of NT20. So, the first part of the string must come from NT20. Now, looking at the rest of the string after t22: t12 t28 t12 t22 t25 t36 t9 t28 t12.\n\nWait, but NT20 is a single non-terminal. Since S generates two non-terminals, maybe the first t22 comes from the first component of S's production. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note that each production can only generate two terminals or two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation reduces the number of symbols by one (since each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal, or two terminals). So, starting from S (1 symbol), after first step, two symbols. Each next step could increase or decrease the number based on the productions.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to model the parse as a tree, trying to match the string.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the given string and see if each part can be matched by the productions.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t22, let's see what produces t22.\n\nFrom the grammar, only NT20 -> 't22'.\n\nSo, to have t22, the previous non-terminal must be NT20.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is t22, which must come from NT20. Therefore, the production must be S -> NT73 NT20, or S -> NT95 NT83. But NT20 would be one of these.\n\nWait, no, S splits into two non-terminals. So, for S -> NT73 NT20, the first non-terminal is NT73, which produces the first part of the string, and the second non-terminal is NT20, which produces the rest.\n\nSo, the string starts with t22, which comes from NT20, meaning that the second part must be derived from NT20. So, let's think: If S -> NT73 NT20, then NT20 produces the rest of the string. But the rest starts with t12, which is t12 t28 t12 t22 t25 t36 t9 t28 t12.\n\nWait, but NT20 isn't used in producing those. So, maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check each possible path step by step.\n\nLet me consider that the string is of length 10, so the parse tree must have 10 leaves. Each non-terminal can produce either two terminals or two non-terminals. So, starting from S, each step produces more symbols, but in the end, they all collapse into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write down the entire derivation.\n\nBut it's time-consuming, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the possible splits:\n\nt22 t12 t28 t12 t22 t25 t36 t9 t28 t12\n\nSplit 1: t22 | rest\nSo, t22 is NT20.\n\nBut then the rest starts with t12.\n\nLooking at t12, where does that come from? Looking back, NT12 is in a production. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, in the productions:\n\nNT20 -> 't22' (terminal).\n\nSo, in the second position, t12, but there's no NT in the grammar that directly produces t12. Because looking through, I don't see a production for 't12' except perhaps in terms of NT12. Wait, let's check again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT12 has rules: NT12 -> 't1' or something? Wait, no, looking again, I think I might have confused NT12 with another.\n\nWait, looking through all NT productions:\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT20 -> 't22', NT22 -> 't2', NT25 is a non-terminal, but its production is NT25 -> NT49 NT95.

Hmm, context-free grammars parse strings into parse trees where the entire string must derive from the start symbol S. Since this grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a single non-terminal producing two others, or a terminal.\n\nLet's start by looking at the grammar. The start symbol is S. From the rules, S can produce two options: NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So any valid string must be a combination of sequences derived from either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5, which comes from NT35. Let me see which rules produce t5. Scanning through, I see NT49 -> t3, NT63 -> t29, wait, no, looking at all the rules, some terminals are t5, t37, etc.\n\nWait, the string has t5, t37, etc. Let's see which NT rules produce these terminals.\n\nt5 is produced by NT49. Because in the grammar, NT49 -> t3 or t5, I see NT49 -> t3 and NT49 -> t5. So to produce t5, we use the production NT49 -> t5.\n\nt37 is produced by NT2 -> t22, or wait, looking at the grammar, NT38 can produce t26 or t31, NT26 -> t20, etc. Wait, let me look for t37. Scanning all the terminals, t37 is produced by NT27: looking at NT27, I see a production NT27 -> t33, but wait, it's not a terminal rule. Wait, no, NT27 has a production that leads to t33, but also, I see NT62 -> t24, and maybe others.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions to see where each t is coming from.\n\nNT49 can produce t3 or t5.\n\nNT35 produces t3.\n\nLooking at the string, t5 comes from NT49, and t37. Wait, t37 is in the string. Wait, in the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t37? Let me check.\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see a terminal 't37'. Hmm, that might be a problem because if t37 isn't in any production, it can't be generated by the grammar. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the given string includes \"t37\", so I need to check if any NT rule produces t37. Scanning all the nt rules, I don't see any that produce t37. For example, NT44 -> t4 and t6, NT2 -> t22, NT68 -> t14, etc. It seems that 't37' is not a terminal for any NT. So if that's the case, the string contains a 't37' which is not possible, so the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the nt productions:\n\nLooking at each:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20 \u2192 so S branches into these two.\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96 \u2192 but no t's here.\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2 \u2192 no t's.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37 \u2192 here, NT37: looking further, NT37's production is -> NT85 NT55.

So where is t37 coming from?\n\nWait, looking through all the nt's, the only place where t's appear is in NT49, NT35, and perhaps others.\n\nWait, in NT35's productions, looking further down, I see NT35 -> t3 or t13. Wait, wait, yes: in the grammar:\n\nNT35's productions are:\n\nNT35 -> t3\n\nNT35 -> t13\n\nAh, okay, so NT35 can produce t3 or t13. Therefore, the string has 't37', which isn't a terminal in any NT. So if 't37' is in the string and it's not produced by any NT, it's impossible. So the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I made a mistake in looking through the rules. Let me check all NT productions to make sure I didn't miss any that produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through each NT in the grammar:\n\n- NT49: -> t3, t5\n- NT35: -> t3, t13\n- NT73: several rules, but none are terminals\n- NT71: NT68 nt2 \u2192 no terminals\n- NT39: NT51 nt37 \u2192 no terminals except if NT37 produces something else.\nWait, does NT37 produce any terminals? Let me look.\n\nLooking at NT37: in the grammar, I see several rules, but none that are immediate terminals. For example:\n\nNT37 -> NT85 NT55\n\nNT85 -> NT74 NT73\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT39\n\nAll these are non-terminals, so NT37 can't produce a terminal.

My goal is to break down the string into these parts and see if each part corresponds to a production rule.\n\nLet's start by listing the string: `t35 t17 t6 t33 t30 t12 t0 t3 t37 t14 t17`. I'll break it down into individual tokens: t35, t17, t6, t33, t30, t12, t0, t3, t37, t14, t17.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string ends with t17, which might be a terminal, I'll check from the end backward.\n\n1. t17: Looking at the grammar, NT96 -> 't17', but our string ends with t17, which is a terminal. So, maybe NT96 derived t17.\n\nWait, but the grammar's NT rules produce two non-terminals each, except for some that produce terminals like nt99 -> nt22 nt4, but the terminals like 't17' are separate. So perhaps each 't' is a terminal, and the non-terminals are paired together.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar more carefully, each production ends with two non-terminals or a terminal. The 't's are terminals, so each token in the string is a terminal. So, the string is a sequence of these terminals, and we need to see if the non-terminals can expand into that sequence.\n\nBut how? The grammar is in CNF, which means each production has two non-terminals on the right side. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. But in our grammar, the only terminals seem to be the 't' tokens. So, all the 't's are leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, we can look for a reduction that starts with S and ends with the given string. Given that S is the start symbol, the derivation tree must start with S and expand to the string through the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be split into pairs according to the grammar's productions. Since each production either pairs non-terminals or a terminal (but the grammar seems to have some rules that produce a single terminal, like nt82 -> 't5', but that's not clear because the structure is a bit complex.\n\nWait, looking again, I see rules like NT38 -> 't36', which is a terminal. Similarly, others produce 't' terms. So, the productions have some that produce two non-terminals and some that produce a terminal. So the grammar includes both CNF rules and terminals.\n\nSo to parse the string, each step can either replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals (CNF rule) or replace it with a single terminal.\n\nGiven that, I can try to split the string into pairs that match the productions. Let's attempt to backtrack from the end.\n\nThe last token is t17. Looking at the grammar, which NT rule produces 't17'?\n\nLooking:\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT64 -> 't24'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT49 -> 't9'\n- NT99 -> 't16'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't22'\n- NT4 -> 't11'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT64 -> 't17' \u2192 Oh, wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT64 \u2192 't17', but I see NT64 -> 't24'. Wait, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFrom the rules:\nNT64 -> 't24'.\nBut I don't see any NT64 \u2192 't17' rule. Hmm, but one of the rules is NT99 -> 't16'. Wait, in the list, I see NT99 -> 't10' and others, but perhaps I missed one that leads to t17.\n\nWait, looking again, there's NT99 -> 't16', and another rule for NT64 -> 't24', but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe t17 comes from another NT.\n\nWait, let me list the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT84 -> 't1'\n- NT49 -> 't3' (multiple times)\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT99 -> 't16'\n- NT38 -> 't29' and others.\nWait, perhaps t17 comes from NT20? Because looking for NT20's rules:\n\nNT20 -> 't17', yes, because in the list, I see NT20 -> 't17' under the rules. Wait, no, let me check: \n\nLooking for NT20 in the rules:\nYes, one rule is NT20 -> 't17', and another is NT20 -> 't1'.\n\nWait, so NT20 can produce either 't17' or 't1'. So the last token is t17, which would come from NT20 expanding to 't17'.\n\nSo in the derivation, the last symbol is produced by NT20 -> 't17'. That would mean that before t17, we have NT20. So the string ends with NT20 \u2192 't17'.\n\nSo moving back one step, the last two tokens would be the two symbols that led to this NT20. But wait, in the context-free grammar, when a non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, each non-terminal would expand into a certain part of the string.\n\nThis might get complicated, so perhaps I should represent the string as a sequence and see if it can be split into a series of non-terminals that expand.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is t17, which comes from NT20. So the last part is derived from NT20 \u2192 't17'. Before that, the previous NT would have two children, which would be the two symbols before t17 in the string. But the string before t17 would be t35 t17 t6 t33 t30 t12 t0 t3 t37 t14 t17.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps it's better to approach this by seeing the entire string as a sequence of 11 tokens. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which would create two non-terminals that expand into the first and last parts of the string. So the first token is t35 and the last is t17, possibly generated by NT73 and NT20 respectively.\n\nBut to proceed step by step, perhaps I can try to construct the derivation tree. Let me outline the string as a list:\n\n1. t35\n2. t17\n3. t6\n4. t33\n5. t30\n6. t12\n7. t0\n8. t3\n9. t37\n10. t14\n11. t17\n\nNow, let's try to pair these tokens according to the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with the entire string, perhaps it's built from S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which would correspond to the first token (t35) and the last token (t17). Let's check:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20, so NT73 expands to t35 and NT20 expands to t17. But looking at the string, S would produce two parts: the left part t35 and the right part t17. But the string is more than two tokens, so perhaps the non-terminals NT73 and NT20 expand into more tokens.\n\nSo let's focus on NT73 and NT20.\n\nFirst, NT73: According to the grammar, NT73 can produce 't36' or 't29' or 't3'. But in our string, the first token is t35. Does NT73 produce t35? Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT73's rules: I see NT73 \u2192 't36' and NT73 \u2192 't27'. But not t35. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I have the wrong initial split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with another NT. Wait, another way is to consider that the entire string must be built from S, which splits into NT73 and NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me list them: t27, t22, t16, t6, t6, t16, t5, t7, t25, t23, t36. \n\nStarting with S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo the string starts with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. The first element of the string is t27, which presumably comes from one of these NT productions.\n\nWait, looking at the NT productions, I need to see what each non-terminal can produce. Let's check NT73's rules. The grammar says NT73 can produce NT62 NT27 or NT12 NT47, or even 't36'. Oh, so NT73 can produce 't36' directly. So if the first symbol is t27, that must come from another path. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, the string starts with t27, so perhaps it's produced by NT62 NT27, but NT62... Let me see. Looking through the grammar, NT62 has a rule: NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT62 | ... Wait, no, NT62 is listed as NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT62, which suggests it's a recursive production. Wait, no, actually, looking closely, in the grammar, NT62's productions are:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT53 NT62 (left recursion)\nWait, no, let me check again. The grammar has entries like NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT62, which is left recursion. Left recursion can be tricky, but I think it's part of the production rules. However, parsing such rules is more complex because of infinite loops. But perhaps in this case, we don't have to handle it because the string ends before it can be consumed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT62 has a direct terminal production. Let me check the entire grammar to see if any NT (non-terminal) directly leads to 't27'.\n\nSo, looking through the NT rules:\n\nLooking for 't27' in the right-hand sides of any NT productions. Scanning through the list:\n\nYes! Here's one: NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT62 (left recursive) and another: NT62 \u2192 't24'. Oh, so NT62 can also produce 't24' directly. But how does that help with t27?\n\nWait, the string starts with t27. So the first symbol t27 must come from an NT production that leads directly to t27. Let me check each NT to see if it can produce t27.\n\nLooking at NT73's productions: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 | NT12 NT47 | 't36'. No t27 here. NT27: Let's check NT27's rules. I don't see NT27 in the list, but wait, in the initial grammar, NT27 is not listed, but looking at the grammar, perhaps I missed it. Wait, actually, in the initial list, after the first few entries, there's NT27 \u2192 't24' and so on. So NT27 has rules:\n\nWait, no, I think I made an error earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar correctly.\n\nThe grammar entries are:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\nNT71 -> NT68 NT2\nNT39 -> NT51 NT37\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\nNT88 -> NT38 NT24\nNT52 -> NT80 NT47\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT80 -> NT71 NT99\nNT22 -> NT44 NT63\nNT99 -> NT38 NT62\nNT52 -> NT12 NT85\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT45 -> NT44 NT52\nNT6 -> NT88 NT73\nNT38 -> NT26 NT20\nNT99 -> NT22 NT4\nNT99 -> NT63 NT2\nNT90 -> NT38 NT95\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\nNT51 -> NT64 NT90\nNT47 -> NT49 NT26\nNT88 -> NT9 NT53\nNT74 -> NT39 NT39\nNT96 -> NT82 NT83\nNT82 -> NT51 NT84\nNT37 -> NT85 NT55\nNT45 -> NT2 NT95\nNT73 -> NT12 NT47\nNT85 -> NT74 NT73\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\nNT38 -> 't36'\nNT44 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't17'\nNT80 -> 't7'\nNT73 -> 't36'\nNT38 -> 't29'\nNT2 -> 't22'\nNT4 -> 't11'\nNT68 -> 't14'\nNT11 -> 't12'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT64 -> 't17'\nNT99 -> 't10'\nNT35 -> 't13'\nNT39 -> 't6'\nNT11 -> 't37'\nNT95 -> 't18'\nNT35 -> 't5'\nNT63 -> 't29'\nNT96 -> 't20'\nNT4 -> 't11'\nNT49 -> 't23'\nNT82 -> 't5'\nNT83 -> 't28'\nNT37 -> 't31'\nNT95 -> 't35'\nNT8 -> 't30'\nNT64 -> 't24'\nNT26 -> 't20'\nNT49 -> 't9'\nNT88 -> 't28'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT84 -> 't1'\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nNT96 -> 't27'\nNT88 -> 't27'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT62 -> 't24'\nNT53 -> 't11'\nNT96 -> 't37'\nNT20 -> 't1'\nNT53 -> 't23'\nNT27 -> 't24'\nWait, I'm looking for NT27's rules.

So NT62 can directly produce 't24' but how does that get t27?\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. The production for NT73 includes NT62 NT27, so NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. That would mean that NT73 produces two symbols: NT62 and NT27. But NT27 can produce 't24' directly. So if we have NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and then NT27 \u2192 't24', that would be part of the derivation. But the string starts with t27, so perhaps that's the issue.\n\nWait, the string starts with t27. How can that be generated? Because if NT73 produces NT62 NT27, then the first symbol is from NT27.

{"custom_id":"request-217","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t0 t28 t24 t36 t23 t3 t25 t17 t28 t13 t18 t28`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the CFG works. CNF grammars have rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. All non-terminals are on the left side of the production. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that it's quite extensive. Each non-terminal (like S, NT, and various NT followed by numbers) has multiple production rules. Some of them directly produce terminal symbols (the 't' followed by numbers), and others break down into other non-terminals.\n\nSince the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, I need to see if the non-terminals in the grammar can derive down to these terminals in the correct order.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step should replace a non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, but I think in CNF, it's either two non-terminals or one non-terminal and a terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the RHS, either two terminals, two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal, but all non-terminals are on the left. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But in this grammar, all the rules on the RHS have either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, looking back, I see production rules like S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which are two non-terminals. Then, NT20 \u2192 NT73 etc., which are two non-terminals. But some rules break into a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT73 \u2192 t36. So I think each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But in reality, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the RHS, so it's either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. \n\nIn that case, when a production has a terminal and a non-terminal, the non-terminal should eventually produce another symbol, until all are terminals.\n\nGiven the string, I can try to see if each terminal in the string is generated from some production.\n\nLet me see the string: `t0 t28 t24 t36 t23 t3 t25 t17 t28 t13 t18 t28`\n\nThat's 12 terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation either replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the length of the string (in terms of terminals) should correspond to some binary expansion. Starting from S, which might be a non-terminal that can split into two symbols, each of which could continue splitting. So the number of terminals should be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree.\n\nBut 12 is not a power of two, and the way CNF works, each production splits into two symbols. So for the string length to be compatible, it should be 2^n - 1 for some n, I think. Let me check: n=4, 2^4-1=15, that's longer. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the count is such that the number of terminals is n where the parse tree's leaves count to n via binary splits. So 12 is possible if the tree has splits leading to that count. Hmm, maybe it's okay, but let me proceed.\n\nPerhaps I can construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t0, which in the grammar has production NT64 \u2192 t24, but wait, let's look for where t0 comes from. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT with t0 on the RHS except NT64 \u2192 t24 and some other T-symbols. Wait, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 t24\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT99 \u2192 t10\n- NT95 \u2192 t18\n- NT49 \u2192 t3\n- NT11 \u2192 t12 and t37\n- NT38 \u2192 t28, etc.\n\nWait, for t0: The initial string has t0. Looking through the grammar, is there any production where a non-terminal directly produces t0? Or does a non-terminal produce something that eventually leads to t0?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t11\n- NT55 \u2192 t17 (Wait, NT55? No, in the grammar, non-terminals are named as NT followed by numbers. Wait, let me look again.)\n\nHere are the productions:\n\nLooking through, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t0 except somewhere in the lower levels.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 t24\n- NT73 \u2192 t36\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT39\n- NT96 \u2192 t20\n- NT85 \u2192 NT74 NT73\n- NT74 \u2192 NT39 NT39\n- NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n- NT49 \u2192 t3 (So NT49 can produce t3 and a non-terminal, but can that non-terminal lead to t0?)\n- NT99 \u2192 t10\n- NT88 \u2192 t28\n- NT37 \u2192 t31 (Wait, but 31 is a different t number)\n- NT35 \u2192 t3, t13\n- NT95 \u2192 t18\n- NT63 \u2192 t29\n- NT26 \u2192 t20\n- NT99 \u2192 other rules\n- WT: Wait, I'm getting a bit overwhelmed. Let me try to find which non-terminals can produce t0.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t0. So t0 must be produced by a non-terminal that eventually leads there.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, let me check:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85\n- NT12 \u2192 NT31 (wait, NT12 \u2192 NT31?)\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar lines:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT31. Wait, that's a non-terminal on RHS? But according to CNF, each RHS must be a terminal or a non-terminal, but in this case, NT12 \u2192 NT31 is a non-terminal leading to another non-terminal, which might eventually produce a terminal.\n\nBut looking further:\n\nNT31 \u2192 t22 (Wait, is there a rule for NT31?)\n\nYes, looking at the list, I see: NT31 \u2192 t22. So NT31 produces t22.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 NT31.\n\nSo, starting from NT12, it can become NT31, which becomes t22.\n\nBut in the string, the last terminal is t28. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t0. So we need a non-terminal chain that can produce t0.\n\nLooking again, t0 is a terminal symbol. The only way to produce t0 is if a production exists where a non-terminal directly emits t0. Or through a chain of non-terminals, each emitting the next step, until t0 is reached.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT64 \u2192 t24\nNT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73\nNT73 \u2192 t36\nNT24 \u2192 t25\nNT77 \u2192 I think maybe NT24 is somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, I spot NT68 \u2192 t14, but I don't see t0 anywhere.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each rule carefully.\n\nLooking down the list:\n\nLooking for any rule that produces t0, or a non-terminal that leads down to t0.\n\n- NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85: NT12 is a non-terminal\n- NT12 \u2192 NT31: NT31 is a non-terminal leading to t22\n- NT31 \u2192 t22\n\nSo, NT12 can reach t22, but not t0.\n\nLooking for t0 in any RHS: I don't see any rules where a non-terminal directly goes to t0. So that seems problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it.

So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string that I need to determine if it's generated by this grammar. If I remember correctly, a Chomsky normal form grammar has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. The given productions all seem to fit that structure, using either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t29 t33 t35 t35 t13 t18 t36 t30 t12 t30 t5`. Hmm, but wait, in Chomsky normal form, a production can only have two non-terminals at most, except for the start symbol which can have more. However, in this case, the grammar seems to have multiple productions where a non-terminal expands into two terminals. So, each production is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking closer, most of the productions either have two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S -> NT73 NT20, which gives two NTs. Then each NT can expand into either two NTs or a single terminal. So, the string we're given is a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSo, the approach would be to construct a parse tree starting from S, expanding according to the grammar, and seeing if the sequence of terminals matches the given string.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual terminals:\n\nt35, t29, t33, t35, t35, t13, t18, t36, t30, t12, t30, t5.\n\nThat's a total of 12 tokens. So, the string is a concatenation of these terminals. In the grammar, each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal. So, the parse tree should expand S in a way that when all non-terminals are replaced by their terminals, it results in this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT38 -> 't36', NT44 -> 't4', etc. So, the first step is to identify which non-terminals in the string correspond to these terminals.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.

So, the terminals are 't3', 't5', 't6', 't9', 't10', 't11', 't12', 't13', 't14', 't17', 't18', 't20', 't23', 't24', 't25', 't26', 't27', 't28', 't29', 't30', 't31', 't33', 't35', 't36', 't37'.\n\nSo, each terminal in the string must correspond to one of these. So, checking each token in the given string:\n\n1. t35: Yes, exists as a terminal for NT35.\n2. t29: Yes, from NT63.\n3. t33: From NT27.\n4. t35: Again, NT35.\n5. t35: Same as before.\n6. t13: Hmm, t13 is not listed. Wait, looking through the terminals list I just did, I don't see 't13'. Let me check the productions again. Wait, no, looking through the given production rules, I don't see any production that yields 't13'. So, the sixth token is 't13', which is not present in any of the terminal productions. That's a red flag. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated because there's a terminal that the grammar doesn't produce.\n\nSo, as soon as I hit a terminal that's not in the grammar's terminal list, the string is invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The tokens in the string are: t35, t29, t33, t35, t35, t13, t18, t36, t30, t12, t30, t5.\n\nSo, 't13' is the 6th token. Checking the list of terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of all productions, I don't see any terminal 't13'.

The string to evaluate is `t12 t3 t27 t37 t23 t20 t17 t4 t16 t14 t23 t12 t33`.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the terminals which are the leaves. So, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the productions are in CNF except for some that go directly to terminals. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, some non-terminals are directly producing terminal symbols, like `NT38 -> 't36'`. So, when building the parse tree, these are terminal nodes.\n\nThe string to check consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which are presumably the terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nMy approach will be to build a parse tree for the string and see if it's possible according to the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the string components: t12, t3, t27, t37, t23, t20, t17, t4, t16, t14, t23, t12, t33.\n\nI'll start by looking for possible productions that can generate these terminals.\n\nFirst, the initial symbol is S, which has two productions: NT73 NT20 and NT95 NT83. So, S can derive into two parts: NT73 followed by NT20 or NT95 followed by NT83.\n\nI need to see if the string can be divided into two parts corresponding to either of these. Let's try both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n\nSo, NT73 and NT20 must each derive into parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t12. Let's see which NT productions can produce t12.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT73:\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT53 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT12 NT47\n- NT73 -> NT24 NT25\nWait, does any production of NT73 produce t12?\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see an NT73 \u2192 t12. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT. Maybe I should look for NT12.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT12 \u2192 NT24 NT95, which then can produce further.\n\nBut let me think step by step.\n\nLooking at NT73, are there any rules that produce t12? Scanning through, the rules for NT73 seem to always produce non-terminals. So perhaps I need to consider the sub-derivations.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me consider the entire string and see how the productions could chain together.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one, so for a string of length n, there are n-1 productions.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the most straightforward way here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for possible derivations that can produce the sequence.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to construct the parse tree from the string. Let's see.\n\nThe string is: t12, t3, t27, t37, t23, t20, t17, t4, t16, t14, t23, t12, t33.\n\nLet me see if these terminals can be grouped into sub-strings that correspond to the initial productions.\n\nFirst, given that S can derive into two parts, perhaps the first part is a derivation that ends with 't12' and the second part needs to start with 't3'. Or maybe vice versa.\n\nWait, let's look at the possible terminals.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: t33. Let's see which NT productions can lead to t33. Looking through, I don't see any NT directly producing t33. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's check the productions for NT27. From the grammar, NT27 \u2192 NT62 NT24. Wait, no, let me check again. Looking at the productions, NT27 is: NT27 \u2192 NT62 NT24? Wait, looking back at the grammar, under NT24: NT24 \u2192 NT49 NT52.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting confusing. Let me look for any NT that can produce a terminal. For example, NT38 \u2192 't36', NT44 \u2192 't4', NT26 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree from the root and see if the leaves can form the string.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n\nSo, NT73 and NT20 must each produce parts of the string. Let's see if NT73 can produce the first few terminals: t12, t3, etc.\n\nLooking at NT73, the productions are:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT53 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- NT73 \u2192 NT24 NT25\n\nSo, the first two options involve NT62 and NT53, which are in turn non-terminals.

Wait no, in the grammar, production rules start with NT... So perhaps NT2 is not a root but a non-terminal.\n\nWait no, in the grammar, the left-hand side is always a non-terminal. So, in the grammar, I don't see NT2 as a production. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production starting with NT2. So perhaps NT2 is not present. Instead, perhaps it's a terminal. Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait, looking at the production for NT4: NT4 \u2192 't11'.\n\nAh, so in the grammar, there are terminals with just 't' followed by a number, like 't11', 't12', etc. So, 't12' is a terminal in the grammar, right?\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, there is a production for NT38 \u2192 't36', but not for NT2 \u2192 something. So perhaps NT2 is not a non-terminal, implying that when a non-terminal derives into something with NT2, it's a terminal.\n\nSo, let's clarify: When any production on the left side (NT) expands into a terminal and non-terminals, but if a part of the expansion is a terminal, it stops there.\n\nSo, in the grammar, if a NT production includes a terminal symbol, then that symbol is added to the string.\n\nSo, for example, any time a NT production like NT38 \u2192 't36' is encountered, that 't36' is part of the string.\n\nBut back to the problem. In case 1, S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nWe thought of NT73 as deriving into NT12 NT47, which goes to NT24 NT95, etc. But perhaps that's not useful. Let me try a different route.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT73 can derive into NT53 NT27.

{"custom_id":"request-241","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite extensive with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. Chomsky Normal Form for a CFG has production rules where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. The string provided is `t11 t18 t31 t29 t27 t0 t5 t9 t11 t22 t27 t14 t7`. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production is non-terminal \u2192 non-terminal non-terminal or non-terminal \u2192 terminal. So it's a binary tree structure, and each step in the derivation produces exactly two symbols. \n\nTo approach this, maybe I can work backwards from the string. Starting from the rightmost symbol, try to find a production that can generate it, then replace it with the corresponding non-terminals, and continue this process until I reach the start symbol S. \n\nLooking at the string: t11, t18, t31, t29, t27, t0, t5, t9, t11, t22, t27, t14, t7. There are 13 tokens, but each production in CNF replaces one non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals, but in CNF, it's restricted to two non-terminals or a terminal non-terminal pair? Wait, no, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals, but wait no, actually in CNF, the productions are strictly A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a single terminal. So each production step gives exactly two symbols. \n\nWait, but that's a bit conflicting because when you have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, that's not CNF. So in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal? Or is it that each production is only two non-terminals or a single terminal? No, in CNF, each production must produce exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal would not fit because a terminal is a single symbol. Wait no, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. Wait no, I'm confusing again. Let me think: Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So in each production, the left side is one non-terminal, and the right side is either two non-terminals (leading to terminal symbols during derivation) or a single terminal. \n\nSo, if I have a string of terminals, to derive it, starting from S, I need to produce that string through a series of productions that generate these terminals. Each step would expand non-terminals into other symbols, and eventually, the leaves would be terminals.\n\nGiven that, the approach could be to work from the string backwards, matching the rightmost symbols to find possible production rules that can generate them, then replace those symbols with the corresponding non-terminals and continue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can be derived from S is a way. But manually building a parse tree for 13 symbols is tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map each terminal in the string to their parent rules in the grammar and see if the sequence forms a valid derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list the productions that produce each t symbol:\n\n- t0: S->NT62 NT20, but wait looking at the productions, for example, NT88->'t28', NT12->'t11', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the productions, each rule can produce a terminal or two non-terminals. So for each terminal in the string, I need to see where it can come from.\n\nFor example, t11 is produced by NT11->'t12'? Wait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the ones that produce terminals are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT49 -> 't1', 't17' (Wait, no, looking at the rules given:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT44 -> 't4'\n\nNT68 -> 't0'\n\nNT2 -> 't22'\n\nNT4 -> 't11'\n\nNT68 -> 't14'\n\nNT35 -> 't3', 't13', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to create a mapping from each terminal to its possible sources.\n\nLet's make a list:\n\nLooking at each production rule that starts with a non-terminal and ends with a terminal:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT49 -> 't1'\n\n- NT49 -> 't17'\n\n- NT64 -> 't24'\n\nWait, no, wait each production is either A \u2192 NT...NT... or A \u2192 terminal.\n\nWait looking through the production list, each line is either a production rule like S->NT52 NT73 or a production that ends with 't' like NT68->'t14'.\n\nSo for each production, check if the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nSo let's go through all the rules:\n\n1.

Hmm, this looks a bit daunting, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It seems like the non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT52, NT71, etc. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers and some single letters like 't22', 't2', etc. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, some are single letters like 't2' but others have two digits, like 't17', 't20', etc. Oh wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar rules, it seems like all the terminals are of the form 't' followed by two digits. For example, NT73 -> 't36' or 't27'. So each production either replaces a non-terminal with another non-terminal or with a terminal like 'tXX'.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals: t36, t33, t20, t5, t11, t16, t33, t27, t14, t30, t27, t4, t24, t17. So I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So to generate the string, each non-terminal step must break down into more terminals and non-terminals until all are terminals, matching the string.\n\nOne approach is to build a parse tree from the string backwards, using the reverse of the grammar rules. Alternatively, I can try to decompose the string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nLet me list out all the productions for clarity:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\nNT71 -> NT68 NT2\nNT39 -> NT51 NT37\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\nNT88 -> NT38 NT24\nNT52 -> NT80 NT47\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT80 -> NT71 NT99\nNT22 -> NT44 NT63\nNT99 -> NT38 NT62\nNT52 -> NT12 NT85\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT45 -> NT44 NT52\nNT6 -> NT88 NT73\nNT38 -> NT26 NT20\nNT99 -> NT22 NT4\nNT99 -> NT63 NT2\nNT90 -> NT38 NT95\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\nNT51 -> NT64 NT90\nNT47 -> NT49 NT26\nNT88 -> NT9 NT53\nNT74 -> NT39 NT39\nNT96 -> NT82 NT83\nNT82 -> NT51 NT84\nNT37 -> NT85 NT55\nNT45 -> NT2 NT95\nNT73 -> NT12 NT47\nNT85 -> NT74 NT73\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\nNT38 -> 't36'\nNT44 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't17'\nNT80 -> 't7'\nNT73 -> 't36'\nNT38 -> 't29'\nNT2 -> 't22'\nNT4 -> 't16'\nNT68 -> 't14'\nNT11 -> 't12'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT64 -> 't17'\nNT99 -> 't10'\nNT35 -> 't5'\nNT63 -> 't29'\nNT96 -> 't20'\nNT4 -> 't11'\nNT49 -> 't23'\nNT82 -> 't5'\nNT83 -> 't28'\nNT37 -> 't31'\nNT95 -> 't35'\nNT8 -> 't30'\nNT64 -> 't24'\nNT26 -> 't20'\nNT49 -> 't9'\nNT88 -> 't28'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT84 -> 't1'\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nNT96 -> 't27'\nNT88 -> 't27'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT62 -> 't24'\nNT53 -> 't11'\nNT96 -> 't37'\nNT20 -> 't1'\nNT53 -> 't23'\nNT27 -> 't33'\nNT62 -> 't36'\nNT26 -> 't2'\nNT49 -> 't0'\nNT99 -> 't16'\nNT27 -> 't27'\nNT49 -> 't2'\nNT24 -> 't25'\nNT47 -> 't27'\nNT12 -> 't31'\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should see which terminals are present in the string. The string has the following terminals:\n\nt36, t33, t20, t5, t11, t16, t33, t27, t14, t30, t27, t4, t24, t17.\n\nI need to see if these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first symbol is t36. So I need to check what terminals are directly produced by the S rules. S can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nLooking at NT73, the productions for NT73 are: NT62 NT27, NT12 NT47, and specifically, NT73 -> 't36' is one production. Wait, looking back: NT73 -> 't36' is there. But in the original grammar, S is split into NT73 NT20, which is then processed further.\n\nWait, no\u2014the S rules are S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So to get 't36', the initial S must expand into something that eventually produces 't36'.\n\nLet me check: To get t36, the non-terminal must have a production that leads to it. Looking at the grammar rules, NT73 has a production NT73 -> 't36' (is that correct? Wait, in the given grammar, under NT73, there's 't36'? Let me check: Yes, under NT73, both NT73 -> NT62 NT27 and NT73 -> 't36' are present. So NT73 can directly produce 't36'.\n\nSimilarly, NT95 can produce 't35' (wait, NT95's productions: Looking back, NT95 is only in S rule and S -> NT95 NT83. Also, NT95 has a production NT95 -> NT38 NT95, but also, checking the individual NT rules: I see NT35 -> 't3' and NT35 -> 't5'. Wait, but that's different. Wait, looking for NT95: Checking all rules, I don't see any production directly for NT95 except S, so NT95 seems to have productions only where it's part of other non-terminals.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S, which branches into two non-terminals, either NT73 or NT95. Let me look at the productions for NT73 and NT95. NT73 goes to NT62 NT27, and NT95 goes to NT88 NT53. So S becomes NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83, and each of those non-terminals can further be broken down.\n\nNow, looking at the right-hand sides, each production is a combination of two non-terminals except where they directly lead to terminal symbols like 't' followed by a number. For example, some NT52 productions lead directly to 't36', others to 't17', etc. My string seems to consist of a series of these 't' symbols, so I need to see if they can be formed through the grammar's productions.\n\nI think I'll start from the beginning of the string and try to match each token to the grammar. Let's split the string into individual tokens:\n\nt36, t27, t23, t24, t13, t20, t12, t33, t36, t11, t18, t6, t27, t6.\n\nI'll need to track the current non-terminal and see if each token can be produced by it. Starting with the first token, t36. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t36? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT62 -> t24 and 't24' as a production from NT62. Also, NT53 can produce t37, but that's not t36. NT96 -> t27 and t37, but no t36. Wait, let me check all productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT52 can produce t36 (NT52 -> t36) when it's present. So if the grammar is S -> NT73 NT20, and NT73 -> NT62 NT27, which in turn might lead to t36. Let me trace this path.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom S, we can go to NT73 and NT20. NT73 -> NT62 NT27. Then NT62 can produce t24. But that's t24, not t36. Oh, but wait, I'm looking for t36. Alternatively, looking at NT52, which can go to t36. Maybe there's another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map out all the possible paths. Let's take the string step by step.\n\nToken 1: t36. Can be produced by NT52, which is derived from NT73 -> NT62 NT27. But how does that connect? Alternatively, maybe some other NT produces t36.\n\nWait, looking again: NT52 can go to t36 directly. Hmm, no, wait, looking through the grammar, I think NT35 can produce t3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT55 -> t17\n\nNT38 -> t36\n\nNT80 -> t7\n\nNT71 -> t28\n\nNT45 -> t44 and maybe others.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT38 -> t36\n\nSimilarly, NT52 -> t36\n\nNT85 -> t36? No, looking at the productions, I see NT52 -> t36 in the grammar. Yes, for example:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nBut also, some NTs can produce a terminal like t36. Wait, looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT38 -> t36\n\nNT52 -> t36 (appears in some production lines? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT52: there's NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nBut also elsewhere:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT52 -> NT80 NT47\n\nNT52 -> NT12 NT85\n\nNT52 -> NT15 NT37 (Wait, no, the lines go by NT... So perhaps I should list each NT and their productions:\n\nLet me list all NTs from the grammar:\n\nNT52, NT73, NT95, NT52 (appears multiple times), NT45, NT44, NT6, NT38, NT39, NT83, NT88, NT52, NT71, NT99, NT22, NT11, NT35, NT49, NT82, NT88, NT90, NT47, NT51, NT47, NT88, NT9, NT62, NT53, NT20, NT38, NT44, NT68, NT11, NT35, NT49, NT64, NT99, NT37, NT45, NT2, NT4, NT68, NT11, NT35, NT49, NT64, NT99, NT35, NT39, NT39, etc.\n\nThis is a bit messy. Perhaps I can note that each production is a pair of non-terminals except for certain cases where they produce a 't' followed by a number. So, for example, NT38 can produce 't36', and NT45 can produce 't44', etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the context-free grammar as a structure and see if the string can be derived starting from S.\n\nThe string is: t36 t27 t23 t24 t13 t20 t12 t33 t36 t11 t18 t6 t27 t6.\n\nSo, each token corresponds to a production. I'll need to parse the string by applying the productions.\n\nStarting with S. S can go to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nLet's try NT73 NT20 first.\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27. So, the first token after S is t36. But according to NT73, the first production would be NT62 NT27, which would produce a sequence of symbols, but the first symbol would be from NT62 or NT27. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a leftmost derivation, so starting with S, and each step replacing the leftmost symbol.\n\nWait, let me consider the initial step.\n\nS starts as NT73 NT20. Then, the first step would be to expand the NT73.\n\nNT73 can go to NT62 NT27. So, NT73 -> NT62 NT27. Then, the string becomes (from S) NT62 NT27 NT20.\n\nNow, the first token to expand is NT62. NT62 can produce t24, for example. Because looking at the grammar, NT62 -> t24 is one of its productions.\n\nWait, actually, NT62 can be expanded into t24. So, if we produce t24 first, the string's first token is t36, but we have t36. So that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. The first token in the string is t36, but NT62 can only produce t24 or maybe others?

{"custom_id":"request-282","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens: `t7 t37 t4 t30 t16 t28 t36 t30 t11 t16 t27 t14 t33 t14 t6`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string needs to be parsed according to these rules, ensuring that each step follows the productions without any leftover symbols.\n\nStarting with the string, I can visualize it as a list of tokens. The approach is to try to build the string by matching the leftmost derivations. I might need to use a stack-based method similar to how parsers work, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to track the possible derivations step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is either S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So the first step is to see which of these can match the start of the string.\n\nThe string starts with `t7`. Let's see which NTs produce 't7'. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT24 (if that leads to 't7', but wait, checking the definitions further down, I see NT62 \u2192 NT27 NT68, and NT68 \u2192 't14'. Hmm, perhaps not directly. Wait, I might need to see which NTs directly produce 't7'.\n\nWait, let's check the definitions:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT84 \u2192 t1\nWait, looking for NTs that directly produce 't7'. Scanning the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't7'. Let's check:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t36 (from one rule) and t36 again in another rule. Hmm, that's not helpful. Wait, no. Wait, I'm looking for production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is an NT, and the right-hand side (RHS) starts with a terminal. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63, but does any NT have a production that starts with 't7'?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47\n- NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73\n- NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62\n- NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47, etc.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps the initial S's productions don't directly produce 't7', so perhaps the string isn't starting with a derived symbol that can be 't7'. Let me think again.\n\nIf S can only produce two possibilities: NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83, then the first two symbols after S derivation would be the results of NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83.\n\nBut the string starts with 't7', so the first step must involve a production that starts with 't7'. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: in the stack-based approach, we start with S, and each step produces two symbols on the right. So the first token should correspond to the leftmost part of a production rule.\n\nWait, no, because the derivation starts with S, and the first step would replace S with one of its productions. So the first two symbols of the string must be the result of the first NT's production.\n\nLooking at the NTs, let's see which ones can start with 't7'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT24 NT95\n- NT64 \u2192 NT26 NT20 \u2192 't20' as a terminal? Wait, no, the productions for NT20 is `t17`. Let me check NT20:\n\nWait, NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68 (both non-terminals), and according to the rules, NT27 \u2192 t33 and NT68 \u2192 t14. So NT20 can produce `t17`.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT20 has a production: NT20 \u2192 t17. Yes, that's a direct terminal production.\n\nWait, actually, looking again:\n\nLooking for NTs that have a production leading with 't7'. Let me scan through:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 \u2192 but 11 and 6 are non-terminals until they produce something else. Wait, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to go step by step.\n\nThe string is t7 t37 t4 t30 t16 t28 t36 t30 t11 t16 t27 t14 t33 t14 t6.\n\nSo the first symbol is t7. I need to see if any NT can produce t7 as the first symbol in its production.\n\nLooking through the productions for NTs:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 2 nt productions: NT62 NT27 and also another rule (multiple rules for NT73). Wait, let's check all NT73 rules:\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT73 has:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT44 NT52\n- NT73 \u2192 't36' etc?\n\nWait, actually, looking through the given grammar, I see:\n\nAt the very end, NT73 has a production to 't36', and another to... Wait, going through the list, I see:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT44 NT52\nAnd then somewhere else:\n\nNT73 -> 't36'\nAnother one: HT73 is not present. So NT73 has two nt productions and one terminal production, which is t36.\n\nSo NT73 can produce t36 or other nt sequences. Since the string starts with t7, but t7 isn't directly produced by any NT's terminal production. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong because maybe the initial S's production leads to a string that starts with NT73, which could then go into producing t7 via some path?\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the case. Let me think again.\n\nIf the first symbol is t7, then perhaps it's produced directly by an NT. Let's check each NT's terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the list of NTs and their terminal productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT35 \u2192 t3, t13, t5\n- NT49 \u2192 t3, t9\n- NT64 \u2192 t24, t26\n- NT73 \u2192 t36, possibly others? Wait, wait, no. Let me scan all NT terminals.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT73 has one terminal production: \u2192 t36\n- NT35 has \u2192 t3, t13, t5\n- NT45 has \u2192 t4 (wait, no, NT45's productions are NT44 NT52 and then another production is \u2192 t4? Looking: I think I might have misread NT45's productions.\n\nWait, let me go through all NT productions carefully:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-283","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t12 t14 t18 t11 t17 t13 t16 t29 t16 t29 t17 t23 t5 t24 t6`. Hmm, okay, that's a lot of t's followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule has either two terminals or one non-terminal on the left. So, every production is something like A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe grammar provided has all the production rules. Each rule is either two non-terminals or eventually leads to a terminal. So, the process should be to see if the string can be broken down into these rules.\n\nLooking at the string, I need to parse it step by step. Each part after each '->' in the grammar ends with certain t's. I think I need to see if the string can be derived from S by expanding non-terminals until only terminals are left.\n\nStarting with S, the top-level productions are S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. Both of these are two non-terminals, which correspond to the start symbols. \n\nSo, the string starts with 't12', but wait, let me think about how the non-terminals generate the t's. Each non-terminal (NT) leads to specific terminal strings. For example, S can expand to NT73 and NT20. Each of these NTs then has their own productions.\n\nFor instance, NT73 has S -> NT62 NT27, NT27 becomes 't33', and then NT62 has S-> NT53 which leads to 't11' and 't24', etc. But this seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write out the entire parse tree for the string, step by step. Each token in the string should correspond to a terminal in the grammar, and the structure should align with the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the string: t12 t14 t18 t11 t17 t13 t16 t29 t16 t29 t17 t23 t5 t24 t6. So, 15 tokens in total. That's a lot. Hmm.\n\nI think I'll start from S and see what each step can produce. Since S is split into two non-terminals, say NT1 and NT2, which each produce certain tokens. \n\nBut considering the string is all t's and numbers, perhaps it's better to see if each t corresponds to a production rule. Each NT in the grammar eventually corresponds to a series of t's.\n\nFor example, NT73 -> 't6', but wait, NT73 has productions that go deeper. Wait, the NT73 production is S-> NT62 NT27, but wait, let's get the productions correctly.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, each NT's productions seem to be longer. For example, NT52 -> NT35 NT96, NT35-> NT13 NT17, NT13-> 't13. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a table of each NT's possible productions and their terminal outputs. Let me try that.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\nNT35 -> NT13 NT17\nNT13 -> 't13'\nNT35 goes further: NT35 -> NT49 NT55, NT49 -> NT23, NT55 -> 't17'\nWait, perhaps each NT eventually leads to a sequence of t's. So, for example, NT52 can be expanded as NT35 NT96, each of which expands further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT corresponds to a specific sequence of t's. For example, NT73 might produce 't12 t36', etc.\n\nWait, maybe the better approach is to create a mapping from NT symbols to their expansion in t's. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT52 -> NT35 NT96. Let's see what NT35 and NT96 produce.\n\nNT35: S-> NT13 NT17. NT13 is 't13', NT17 goes to 't17'. But wait, NT17 has productions: NT17 -> NT49 NT2, which in turn NT49-> 't23' and NT2->'t22'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Each NT can expand into other NTs or terminals. So, I need to figure out the terminal sequences that each NT can produce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be compared to the start symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each production is a chain of NTs leading to the t's. So, for the string, it's a series of t's and numbers. The numbers must correspond to the structure of the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the grammar is in CNF, so the parse tree would be a binary tree with height logarithmic in the string length. So, each step is a binary split, and each leaf is a terminal.\n\nGiven the string has 15 tokens, the depth of the parse tree would have log2(15) \u2248 4 levels. But wait, no, because in this case, the grammar is CNF with each production splitting into two, but the terminals are more than one token, so it's not directly applicable. Hmm, maybe a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a derivation starting from S. Each S splits into two NTs, each of which then split into two NTs until eventually, you get down to the t's.\n\nWait, let me try to see. The first step from S would be two NTs. The string starts with 't12', which would come from one of the NTs. Let's see which NT can produce 't12'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\nNT43 is not present. Looking for NT that has 't12' in their production. Wait, the string has 't12' as the first token.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, which NTs produce 't12'.\n\nLooking through each NT's terminal productions:\n\n- NT12: I see NT12 has production S->NT12 NT85, and NT85 leads to 't23'. Wait, no, NT85 is in the NT85 rule: S->NT74 NT73, etc., and NT85 is not a terminal. Wait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first approach is better. It's time-consuming, but let's try to map each NT to their possible terminal strings.\n\nStarting with NT73:\n\nNT73 has productions:\n- S-> NT62 NT27\nNT62: S-> NT53, which leads to NT53-> 't11' and NT24-> 't25'? Wait, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to walk through the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t12 t14 t18 t11 t17 t13 t16 t29 t16 t29 t17 t23 t5 t24 t6.\n\nI think each step in the parse tree must produce a segment of this string.\n\nStarting at S, which splits into two NTs. Let's see:\n\nS can split into S1 and S2.\n\nSuppose the first t12 comes from S1, which is produced by, say, NT73 or another NT.\n\nLooking through the NT73 production:\n\nNT73 can produce either NT62 NT27 or NT27. Wait, no, the production is S-> NT62 NT27. So, NT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nThen, NT62 -> NT53, which has production S-> NT53.\n\nSo, to generate 't12', perhaps the path is NT73 -> NT62 -> NT53.\n\nBut looking at NT53's productions, NT53-> S-> NT49 NT3, which could lead to 't23'? Wait, no, let's check NT53: looking at the grammar, I don't see NT53. Wait, the list of NTs goes up to NT99 and others, but perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, the grammar provided includes entries like NT52, NT73, etc., but I need to see if any NT produces 't12'. Looking through the grammar rules, looking for NT that eventually produce 't12'.\n\nLooking at the NT12: NT12-> S-> NT12 NT85. Wait, that can't be, because NT12 is on both sides. That must be a mistake.

The given grammar follows this because each production on the left (like S) has two parts on the right, and most of the other productions either split into two non-terminals or directly produce a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with several 't's, which are terminals, and others like 'S', 'NT52', etc., are non-terminals. My goal is to parse the string using the grammar and see if it can be derived.\n\nI think about the process of parsing. Usually, top-down parsing or using a CYK algorithm is used for CNF grammars, but since I'm not very familiar with CYK, maybe a recursive approach would be easier.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see what can produce 't' terminals because those are the leaves of the parse tree. I see that several non-terminals like NT99, NT88, NT85, etc., have rules that produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT99 -> 't10' and so on.\n\nLooking at the string, the first word is 't12'. So I need a rule that directly produces 't12'. Checking the grammar, I see that NT12 -> 't11' and NT12 is a non-terminal. Hmm, that doesn't help. Maybe there's a longer chain.\n\nWait, another rule: NT85 -> NT74 NT73, and NT74 -> NT39 NT39, and NT73 -> NT12 NT47. So NT74 can produce 't39' and NT73 can produce 't36' (but that might not be directly helpful). Alternatively, NT27 -> 't27', which is a single terminal, but that's not 't12'.\n\nAnother possibility is NT52, which has multiple rules, including one that directly produces 't88' or other 't's, but not 't12' directly.\n\nWait, what about NT12 -> 't11' and then maybe NT11 can lead to 't12'? Let me check other rules: NT11 -> 't12' (wait, no, looking back, NT11->'t12' is not directly listed. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT11 is defined as NT11 -> 't12'.\n\nYes, looking at the grammar: NT11 -> 't12' (is that correct? Let me scan through. Yes, in the productions, I see NT11 -> 't12'. So NT11 can directly produce 't12'.\n\nSo the first word is 't12', which can be produced by NT11. Now the next word is 't6'. So after NT11, we might have something like NT11 -> 't12' NT6 or similar. Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see a production for NT11 involving another non-terminal. Oh wait, in the grammar, I don't see a rule where NT11 is on the left; instead, the right side might have other non-terminals. Let me check: The rules for NT11 is actually NT11 -> 't12', so it's a terminal. So the production for NT11 is terminal, so it can't produce anything else. But the string after 't12' is 't6', so we need something that can produce 't6' after 't12'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the parsing should start from the top symbol, which is S. The string is a sequence of terminals, so to parse it, we need S to derive that string. So the starting point is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo the string starts with 't12', which is likely from a NT that eventually produces 't12'. Let's see if either of these S productions can lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the first production S->NT73 NT20. Let's see what NT73 and NT20 can produce in terms of terminals. Checking NT73's rules: NT73 -> NT62 NT27 and NT73 -> NT36 NT10, among others. Oh, wait, I see NT73 -> NT36 NT10, and then NT36 has rules that may produce terminals.\n\nLet me see: NT73 can be split into NT62 and NT27. NT62 has a rule that produces 't33', and NT27 has a rule that produces 't27' (a single terminal). So NT73 with S's first production would have NT73 produce something like 't33' 't27', but that doesn't match the beginning of the string which is 't12 t6...'\n\nAlternatively, using the second production S-> NT95 NT83. Let me check NT95 and NT83. Looking up NT95: it has a production NT95 -> NT38 NT6. NT38 can produce 't34' (from the rule: NT99 -> NT38 NT10, but not sure about NT38). No, wait, looking at NT38, it has several options, including NT38 -> 't26', 't28', etc. So if NT95 -> NT38 NT6, and NT6's production is 't8', then combining with NT38's t26 and t8 would give 't26 t8', which isn't matching the string's start of 't12 t6...'\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t12, t6, t11, t36, t1, t37, t27, t10, t17, t4, t33, t31, t6, t22, t27, t36.\n\nI need to see if these can be the result of S's expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree from the string's end. But since I'm not very confident with that, let's try to see if each step can be derived.\n\nWait, another approach: check if the string can be split into parts that each correspond to a production in the grammar. For example, each production in the S's rule (S->NT73 NT20 and S->NT95 NT83) starts with a certain NT that can produce the first few t's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be generated from it.\n\nLet me consider the string as a series of terminals, and each terminal must be derived from a production that ends in a terminal.\n\nLooking at the first word, 't12'. The only rule that directly gives 't12' is NT11 -> 't12'. So to get 't12', the parser must go through NT11.\n\nThen, the next word is 't6'. So after NT11, we need a production that leads to 't6'. But NT11 is a terminal, so that can't have any other productions. So that suggests that the initial part is 't12' from NT11, but then we have 't6' after that, which isn't explained by the grammar, because NT11 can't produce anything else.\n\nWait, that can't be. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't12' is part of a larger substring. Let me see: The string starts with 't12 t6', so perhaps these two t's are leaves of a subtree derived from a single NT.\n\nLooking at which non-terminals can produce 't12 t6' as terminal symbols in their derivation.\n\nLet me see the possible rules that produce a combination of 't12' and 't6', either directly or through multiple steps.\n\nLooking at NT23: I don't think it's a variable in the grammar, so maybe that's not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that can derive sequences of terminals. For example, looking for NT variables where their productions can result in multiple t's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT44's rule is NT44 -> 't4'.\n\nNT68's rule is NT68 -> 't14'.\n\nNT27 can produce 't27' or, in some cases, 't26' (if we look at NT27 -> 't26') but that's only one possibility.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be split into parts that each come from a production.

Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has two conditions: all productions are left-hand sides with two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal, or the entire string can be a single terminal. Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the start symbol can directly produce a terminal, like S \u2192 a. But in this grammar, I only see S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Both are non-terminals, so S can only produce more non-terminals, not terminals.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. But looking at the rules provided, I notice some rules have terminals on the right-hand side, like `NT38 -> 't36'`, which isn't standard for CNF. Oh wait, maybe that's a mistake or a variation. I'll have to proceed carefully.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers, so the string is made up of terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production except the start symbol should involve two non-terminals. \n\nLet me first think about the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which branches into two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So, the initial step should produce two non-terminals that then need to expand into the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t27 t12`. So perhaps one part of the string comes from NT73 expanding to 't27' and another from NT20 expanding to 't12', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one of the NTs expands into a sequence that starts with t27 and the other into t12. \n\nI think I should start by mapping each 't' in the string to a non-terminal that produces it. For example, 't27' might come from some NT, and I can trace back through the grammar to see if these NTs can produce the required terminals.\n\nLet's list all the terminals in the string and see what NTs can produce them:\n\n- `t27`: Can be produced by NT6, NT14, NT24, NT26, NT37, etc. Looking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 t88 t73, but wait, no, the rules are all for NTs producing other NTs except for some that produce 't's directly. Wait, for example, NT68 \u2192 t14 is not a rule, but let's look:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT14 \u2192 ...? Not looking directly. Wait, no, the rules only have a few NTs producing terminals. For example, NT38\u2192 't36', NT44\u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals and their possible NT sources:\n\n- t27: Can come from NT27? Because looking at the rules, NT27 appears in S \u2192 NT62 NT53 and other places. Wait, let me check each rule. Let me go through all the rules that produce 't's:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT64 \u2192 't17'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT35 \u2192 't5'\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT69 \u2192 ... not in the rules? Wait, in the given rules, NT20 \u2192 't17', NT68 \u2192 't14', etc.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36' (twice)\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12' (twice)\n- NT35 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT49 \u2192 't3' once more\n- NT64 \u2192 't17'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10' (twice)\n- NT35 \u2192 't5' (and another t5 as per rule 37)\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT95 \u2192 't18'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT84 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for each 't' value and see what NT can produce it.\n\nLet me go through each 't' in the string and see possible NTs:\n\n1. `t27`: Looking at the rules, I see NT62 \u2192 't24'? No, wait, no 't27' in the rules. Wait, let me check: \n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't24' (from one rule)\n- NT27 \u2192 't33' (another rule)\nWait, no t27 as a terminal. Then perhaps it's coming from NT27 producing other NTs which in turn produce 't27'. Or wait, maybe 't27' is somewhere else. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the RHS of rules, looking for 't27' as a terminal. I see NT62 -> 't24', which is different. Wait, do I see any NTs producing 't27' directly? Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only 't' cases are:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36' (twice)\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12' (twice)\n- NT35 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT49 \u2192 't3' once\n- NT64 \u2192 't17'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10' (twice)\n- NT35 \u2192 't5' once\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT95 \u2192 't18'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT84 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, I don't see 't27' as a terminal in any of the rules. That's a problem because the string starts with t27, but according to the grammar provided, no NT produces 't27'.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me check the rules again carefully:\n\nLooking back at the rules, here's what I have:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't33' (once)\nNT62 \u2192 't24' (twice)\nWait, so 't27' is not directly produced by any NT. So how can the string have 't27' if the grammar doesn't have any rule that produces 't27' from a non-terminal?\n\nThat would immediately mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar, because there's no way to produce a 't27' terminal. Unless it's a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the rules. Let me look again:\n\nFrom the rules provided, I see that NT27 is only on the LHS of NT27 \u2192 NT62 and others, but does any rule on the RHS of the grammar produce 't27'?\n\nLooking through all the RHS terminals:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3' and 't5' (twice)\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT84 \u2192 't1'\n\nI don't see any 't27' terminal, which means the string contains a t27 that cannot be produced by any rule. Therefore, the string is not in the language of this grammar.\n\nSo the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So, to parse the string, I can simulate a reduction process using the grammar.\n\nThe string consists of 17 terms, all starting with 't' followed by numbers. Each of these terms is a terminal symbol. Since the grammar has multiple productions for each terminal, I need to find a way to trace back through the productions to see if the string can be built up from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Each of those non-terminals can further produce other non-terminals or terminals. So, the string starts with t1 t1, which suggests that the first step is to see which non-terminals can produce t1.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT85 \u2192 t1 or NT24 \u2192 t4. So, I might need to backtrack through the productions to see if the initial parts of the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a reduction approach would help. Each token in the string corresponds to a step in the reduction. Since there are 17 tokens, the number of steps in the reduction would be 17, but I have to account for the structure based on the grammar.\n\nWait, I think I'm complicating it. Let me outline the approach:\n\n1. Identify each token in the string and match them to the terminals in the grammar.\n2. Starting from the start symbol S, apply productions to generate the string step by step.\n3. For each terminal in the string, check if there's a production from a non-terminal that starts with that terminal.\n4. Keep track of the possible non-terminals that can generate each part of the string.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string: t1, t1, t5, t23, t29, t22, t33, t33, t13, t31, t35, t31, t11, t36, t18, t9, t0.\n\nSo, I need to go through each token and see if the grammar can produce them in order.\n\nLet me start with the first token 't1'.

Wait, in the grammar, under NT49: \u2192 t9 and \u2192 t3. But none directly go to t1. Hmm, but the first token is 't1', which must come from a non-terminal that goes to 't1'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake because the initial tokens might be parts of longer terminals, not single ones.

For example, NT73 \u2192 t36, and maybe some other step produces 't1's.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the structure.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't1 t1'. Assuming S reduces to NT73 NT20, then each part can be further reduced.\n\nWait, let's think: S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Then NT73 and NT20 are non-terminals that can produce the first two tokens, which are 't1' and 't1'.\n\nSo, if I can find a way to get 't1' from NT73 and 't1' from NT20.\n\nLooking back, under NT73: The production is NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and then each of those can be further reduced. Similarly, under NT20, there is a production NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, let's look up NT73. Under NT73:\n\n\"NT73 -> NT62 NT27\".\n\nThen, NT62 has several productions. Let me look:\n\nUnder NT62: \u2192 NT51 NT84.\n\nWait, so NT62 \u2192 NT51 NT84, which further reduces.\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT64 NT90.\n\nHmm, but then NT64 \u2192 t24, and NT90 \u2192 NT38 NT95.\n\nThis seems like it's going deeper and might not reach 't1' quickly.\n\nLet me check another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nLet me see: NT95's productions: under NT95, \u2192 t18. So, NT95 can produce 't18', which is not the first token 't1', so that can't be the case.\n\nSimilarly, under NT83: nt83 \u2192 nt22 nt45. Then nt45 \u2192 nt44 nt52.

{"custom_id":"request-337","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the context-free grammar is given, and it starts with S. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is a terminal symbol, so the string is a series of terminal tokens. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules of the grammar.\n\nI recall that for context-free grammars, especially when in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal, a single non-terminal, or two non-terminals. However, looking at the grammar provided, it seems more complex because some non-terminals have productions that result in more than two non-terminals or directly into terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is in a more extended form because not all productions are two non-terminals. Some productions involve more than two, especially those where the right-hand side has more than two symbols. For example, looking at rule NT52 -> NT80 NT71 NT99. Oh, no, that's actually three non-terminals. So this grammar is not strictly in Chomsky normal form, which requires all productions to be of the form A->BC or A->a. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit, but I need to double-check.\n\nWait, another look: the original problem stated that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. These are two non-terminals each. Then NT52 -> NT35 NT96, which is two. Then NT71 -> NT68 NT2, which is two. NT39 -> NT51 NT37, two. NT83 -> NT22 NT45, two. NT88 -> NT38 NT24, two. NT52 -> NT80 NT47, two. NT49 -> NT11 NT6, two. NT80 -> NT71 NT99, two. NT22 -> NT44 NT63, two. NT99 -> NT38 NT62, two. NT52 -> NT12 NT85, two. NT73 -> NT62 NT27, two. NT45 -> NT44 NT52, two. NT6 -> NT88 NT73, two. NT38 -> NT26 NT20, two. NT99 -> NT22 NT4, two. NT99 -> NT63 NT2, two. NT90 -> NT38 NT95, two. NT47 -> NT8 NT44, two. NT51 -> NT64 NT90, two. NT47 -> NT49 NT26, two. NT88 -> NT9 NT53, two. NT74 -> NT39 NT39, two. NT96 -> NT82 NT83, two. NT82 -> NT51 NT84, two. NT37 -> NT85 NT55, two. NT45 -> NT2 NT95, two. NT73 -> NT12 NT47, two. NT85 -> NT74 NT73, two. NT20 -> NT27 NT68, two. NT38 -> 't36', terminal. Similarly, NT44 -> 't31', and others.\n\nWait, some of these non-terminals produce more than two symbols. For example, NT52 -> NT80 NT47, which is two, but looking further, I thought I saw a three-symbol production, but maybe I'm mistaken. Wait, checking more carefully, all the productions seem to have either one terminal and one non-terminal or two non-terminals. No production has three symbols. So perhaps the grammar is in Chomsky normal form after all, because each production is either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nI might have misread earlier, so to clarify: in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So as long as each production's right-hand side is either a single terminal or exactly two non-terminals, the grammar is in CNF.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar: Each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal? Let me check a few:\n\n- S -> NT73 NT20: two non-terminals.\n- NT52 -> NT80 NT47: two.\n- NT38 -> 't36': terminal.\n- NT20 -> 't17': terminal.\n- NT44 -> 't31': terminal.\n\nWait, some non-terminals produce a single terminal. So that's allowed in CNF, but their left-hand side is just a single non-terminal producing a terminal (which is like A\u2192a), which is fine.\n\nSo the grammar is indeed in CNF. So, the problem is to parse the given string according to this grammar.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t16 t14 t18 t35 t17 t7 t36 t3 t1 t0 t9 t14 t33 t22 t31 t7 t1 t24.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So I need to see if the sequence of these terminals can be produced by S using the given productions.\n\nI think the standard way to check this is to perform a recursive descent parse or use the CYK algorithm, but given that this might be a bit time-consuming, especially for a human, maybe I can find a way to map the terminals to the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree step by step would help. Let's consider each step.\n\nAnother thought: Since the grammar is in CNF, each production leads to exactly one step in the parse. The number of steps would be equal to the length of the string, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another approach: the string length is 19 tokens. Since the grammar is with only two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S, which has two non-terminals. Wait, but S produces two non-terminals, as per S -> NT73 NT20.\n\nSo perhaps the process is to see if the entire string can be constructed by successively splitting the string and matching the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map each 't' to the corresponding non-terminal and see if the sequence can be parsed.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to model this as a parse tree, starting from the root S, which splits into NT73 and NT20.\n\nLet me try.\n\nFirst production: S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nSo, the string must be broken into two parts: one leading to NT73 and the other to NT20.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t16, which is part of NT73's expansion.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, NT73 is not a terminal; let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, the productions under NT73 are:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n\nBut those are two productions from NT73. However, looking at the string, the first token is t16. Let me check the grammar for t16.\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that produces 't16' as a terminal. Looking through, I find:\n\nNT49 -> 't16'\n\nSimilarly, NT27 -> 't24'.\n\nWait, but in the string, I have a t16 at the very beginning. So that t16 must come from a production rule where the non-terminal on the left is replaced by 't16'. So which rule is that?\n\nIn the given grammar:\n\n- Looking for where a non-terminal produces 't16': found NT49 -> 't16'.\n\nSo, to use this, we can have a production like B -> NT49, and then NT49 \u2192 't16'.\n\nAlternatively, another production could directly produce it, but in this case, only NT49 does that.\n\nWait, but NT49 can produce:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT49's productions are:\n\nNT49 -> NT64 NT90\n\nNT49 -> NT2 NT95\n\nAdditionally, under NT47:\n\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\n\nNT47 -> NT49 NT26\n\nAnd in other places, but primarily, NT49's productions lead to non-terminals.\n\nSo, if I have a rule like NT49 producing 't16', that would be the way t16 is generated. So, the parse path must include NT49 expanding to 't16'.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string starts with t16, which must come from NT49, and so the first symbol in the string is t16, which is produced by NT49.\n\nThus, in the parse tree, one branch would be NT49 -> 't16'.\n\nNow, looking back, where could NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-342","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to see how strings are formed. The grammar starts with S and has production rules that break down S and other non-terminals into terminal symbols and other non-terminals. Terminal symbols are words like t36, t22, etc., and non-terminals are those with \"NT\" in their names, like NT52, NT71, and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t36 t22 t29 t11 t18 t4 t29 t35 t18 t17 t29 t37 t27 t17 t35 t33 t28 t9`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. This helps in parsing because each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two others until we reach terminals.\n\nI'll start from the start symbol, S. Let's look at the possible productions for S:\n\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo S can produce two non-terminals. Let me parse the string by trying to match these sequences.\n\nLooking at the first few terms of the string: t36, t22, t29, t11, etc. I need to see if this corresponds to one of the S productions.\n\nWait, but S is S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83. So each of these non-terminals will further split into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me take the first option: S -> NT73 NT20.\n\nSo NT73 is a non-terminal, and NT20 is another. Let me look at NT73's production rules. Checking the grammar, NT73 has production rules like NT73 -> NT62 NT27, and also NT73 -> 't36'. So NT73 can either be a terminal or split into two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t36. So if NT73 produces 't36', that would match the first token. That would mean the first production step is S -> NT73 ('t36') NT20.\n\nThen the next part is NT20. Looking at NT20's productions: NT20 -> NT27 NT68, NT68 -> 't14', etc. Wait, wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT20, the productions are:\n\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\nNT68 -> 't14'\nNT27 -> 't24'\nNT26 -> 't2'\nNT49 -> 't9'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar, I think I might have mixed up some rules. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\nNT68 -> 't14'\nSo NT20 -> 't17' directly? Or is that another production?\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe grammar lists NT20 with multiple productions. Let me check again:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\nNT68 -> 't14'\nNT20 -> 't17'\n\nAh, so NT20 produces either NT27 and NT68 or 't17'.\n\nIn the string, after t36 (NT73), the next tokens are t22, t29, etc. So if NT73 is t36, then we need to see what NT20 produces. But the immediate next token is t22, which doesn't match 't17', which would be if NT20 is a terminal. Alternatively, if NT20 is splitting into NT27 and NT68, then t20 would lead to more tokens. But in this case, the string after t36 is t22, which doesn't fit. So maybe S -> NT73 is not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, let's try the other option for S: S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nLooking at NT95's productions: There's NT95 -> 't18' in the grammar. So if NT95 produces 't18', that would match the next token in the string, which is t18, since after t36, the next is t18.\n\nThen, the string would be t36 (NT73) t18 (NT95), and then the next part would be NT83. Looking at NT83's productions: NT83 -> NT22 NT45 or NT83 -> 't28'.\n\nIn the string, after t36 and t18, the next token is t29. Wait, the string is t36, t22, t29, t11, etc. So the next token is t22, but NT83 can produce 't28' or split into NT22 and NT45.\n\nWait, the string after t36 and t18 is t29, but in the production S -> NT95 NT83, if NT95 is 't18' and NT83 is, say, 't28', that would give us 't18 t28', but the string has t22 after that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should try to build the parse tree step by step, considering the correct production rules.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since the string starts with t36, perhaps it corresponds to NT73 producing t36. Then, NT73 must be the first part, and the second part is NT20.\n\nSo the first element is t36 (from S's first production NT73 producing t36), and the second part is NT20.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t36, then t22, t29, t11, t18, etc. Wait, perhaps after t36, the NT20 needs to be expanded. Let's think: The string after t36 is t22, t29, t11, t18, etc.\n\nSo after t36, there might be a split of NT20 into two non-terminals. Let's look at NT20's productions:\n\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\nNT68 -> 't14'\nNT27 -> 't24'\nAlternatively, NT20 can produce 't17' directly.\n\nBut in the string after t36, the next is t22. If NT20 is producing 't17', that wouldn't match t22. Alternatively, if NT20 is splitting into NT27 and NT68, then we'd get 't24' and 't14', but in the string after t36, the next is t22, which isn't either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let's recap:\n\nThe string to parse is \"t36 t22 t29 t11 t18 t4 t29 t35 t18 t17 t29 t37 t27 t17 t35 t33 t28 t9\".\n\nIf S is split into NT73 and NT20, and NT73 is t36, then NT20 must produce the rest of the string: t22 t29 t11 t18 t4 t29 t35 t18 t17 t29 t37 t27 t17 t35 t33 t28 t9.\n\nBut NT20's production is either NT27 NT68 (which would produce t24 and t14) or t17. But the string has t22 after t36, so perhaps I'm not correctly splitting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try a different initial split.\n\nWait, perhaps S is split differently. Let me consider another approach: working from the string and seeing if it can be split according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet's look at the entire string. It's 19 tokens: t36, t22, t29, t11, t18, t4, t29, t35, t18, t17, t29, t37, t27, t17, t35, t33, t28, t9.\n\nLooking for possible splits in the string that correspond to the grammar.\n\nOption 1: The string starts with t36, which could be NT73 -> t36.

Let me go line by line through the given rules. So, each line is a non-terminal followed by its production. Let me look for any NT that can produce 't27' directly. Scanning through all the lines, I don't see any NT \u2192 't27'; so maybe the first token 't27' has to come from a non-terminal that expands into two parts, one of which is a non-terminal that itself expands to 't27' or a terminal that's 't27'. But looking again, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't27' as a terminal. That's confusing because the string starts with 't27', which should be produced by a non-terminal if it's part of the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at the provided rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't27'. So perhaps 't27' must be the result of a non-terminal expansion that eventually leads to it. Let me think: How can 't27' be derived? So, looking for a production where one of the non-terminals in the production leads to 't27'.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT27. Wait, in the provided rules, I don't see NT27 having a production. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me scan through all the rules again. \n\nLooking through each line, I see NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85, but I don't see NT27 having any productions. Wait, no, wait: Let me check the non-terminals. NT27 is defined in the rule NT27 \u2192 NT62 NT24. So, that's how it's generated. But then, where does 't27' come from? Because in the string, the first token is 't27'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Each production is of the form NTa \u2192 NTb NTc, except for the terminals. So, in order to get a terminal like 't27', it must come directly from a rule where a non-terminal produces it. But looking through the given rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't27'. For example, looking for NT? \u2192 't27'. But I don't see any such rule. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with 't27', which can't be produced directly or via any chain of productions.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because the string might be something that starts with 't27' somehow. Alternatively, perhaps 't27' is a result of a longer chain. Let me try to see if 't27' can be part of a production.\n\nLet me consider NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85, which is 't25' and 't25' (as 85 \u2192 't25'), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, looking for a production where one of the parts after expansion is 't27', but it seems none of the rules produce 't27' as a terminal. Therefore, the string starts with a 't27' which the grammar can't generate, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-378","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where B or C can be a terminal. Also, the start symbol cannot be on the right-hand side of any production. Oh, wait, but looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and all the productions are between non-terminals. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So each S production breaks down into two non-terminals each.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t17 t13 t6 t35 t0 t37 t35 t24 t30 t29 t5 t28 t25 t37 t1 t28 t1 t17 t0 t10`. Hmm, that's a lot of t-terms. I notice that several of these t terms are also present in the grammar as terminals, like t10, t13, etc. So I need to see how these t's fit into the derivation.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to see if it can be generated by applying the productions in reverse, starting from the terminals and trying to reduce them to the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to see if the string can be built up by starting from S and applying productions step by step. But with such a long string, that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, another thought: since it's in CNF, each step in the derivation increases the length of the string by 1. Because each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. So the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied.\n\nLet's count the number of terms in the string. It's 20 tokens. Let me see: starting from S, each application of a production doubles the number of symbols. So if I have a string of length L, the number of productions applied is log2(L). Let's check if 20 is a power of 2. 2^4 is 16, and 2^5 is 32. 20 is between these, so that's a problem. Because each production can only produce an even number of symbols, right? Wait, no, each production replaces one symbol with two, so the length increases by one each time, not necessarily doubling.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The Chomsky Normal Form allows each production to replace A \u2192 BC, so each step in the derivation replaces one symbol with two. So the length of the string increases by one each time. Starting from S, which is one symbol, the next step would be two symbols, then three, etc. But the string is 20 symbols, so the derivation would need to have 19 steps because each step adds one.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Maybe I should try another approach.\n\nI think the better way is to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But I'm not very familiar with how to apply it step by step, especially with such a large string. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be parsed by building a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, I can start from the string and try to reduce it step by step using the productions. Since the string has many t-terms, I can check if any terminals match the left-hand sides of the productions. For example, looking at the given productions, I see that some non-terminals produce terminal symbols. For instance, NT49 \u2192 't3', and NT82 \u2192 't5', among others.\n\nLet me list out all the t's in the string and see if they appear as productions.\n\nThe string is: t17, t13, t6, t35, t0, t37, t35, t24, t30, t29, t5, t28, t25, t37, t1, t28, t1, t17, t0, t10.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some non-terminals produce these t's:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't36' (but the string doesn't have t36)\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3', 't13', 't5'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't9', 't35'\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT80 \u2192 't7'\n- NT6 \u2192 't88', which doesn't match.\n- NT38 \u2192 't36', 't28', 't29', 't23', 't27', 't37', 't2'\nWait, looking back, the productions for NT38 are several: NT38 \u2192 t33, t11, t35, t26, t20, etc. Wait no, looking at the given grammar, I need to check each production.\n\nWait, the given grammar is quite extensive.

Wait, t17 is produced by NT55 \u2192 't17' and NT80 \u2192 't7' (but t7 matches NT80). Wait, but does any non-terminal produce t17? Yes, NT55 \u2192 't17'.

The start symbol is S, and the productions are as follows:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS can also produce NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, the string starts with S, which means it can either start with NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.

{"custom_id":"request-396","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t36 t23 t13 t5 t3 t31 t35 t31 t2 t24 t31 t20 t0 t10 t5 t7 t37 t16 t4 t20 t12\". \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and a single terminal or non-terminal on the right. That helps because it simplifies parsing, but here I'm just generating strings, so I need to see how the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can go to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Each of these leads to other non-terminals, and so on, until terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to the right-hand side of some production.\n\nI'll analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. Split the string into individual tokens:\n   t36, t23, t13, t5, t3, t31, t35, t31, t2, t24, t31, t20, t0, t10, t5, t7, t37, t16, t4, t20, t12.\n\n2. I need to see if these fit into some derivation path starting from S.\n\n3. The first token is t36. Looking at the grammar, NT73 can go to t36 (since NT73 -> 't36'). Also, NT38 goes to t36 (NT38 -> 't36').\n\n4. Let's check where t36 comes from. So, in the string, the first token is t36, which would be from either NT73 or NT38.\n\n5. S can be NT73 + NT20 or NT95 + NT83. Let's see which path is possible.\n\nLooking at the first token t36, if S is NT73 NT20, then NT73 can produce t36. Alternatively, if S is NT95 NT83, then NT95 would need to produce t36. But looking at the grammar, I don't see a production where NT95 -> 't36'. The closest is NT64 -> 't17' and others, but not NT95. So S cannot be NT95 NT83 because the first token would have to come from NT95, which doesn't produce t36. Therefore, S must start with NT73 NT20.\n\nSo, the first token t36 must come from NT73, which is the first part of S. So the next token should come from NT20.\n\nLooking at NT20: from the production rules, NT20 can go to 't17' (NT20 -> 't17'). But the second token is t23. So that seems like a problem because t23 isn't directly produced by NT20. Alternatively, maybe NT20 is somewhere else in the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. The first token is t36, which is from NT73. Then the next token is t23. So after t36, the next token should come from the production of NT20. But looking at NT20, the only terminal is 't17', not 't23'. So that's an issue because the next token is t23, which is not a terminal that NT20 can produce.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me check if there's another way. Maybe the string doesn't directly start with S -> NT73 NT20, but perhaps through some intermediate steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the entire path. Alternatively, maybe the string includes symbols that come from deeper derivations.\n\nLet me list the entire string again to see the flow:\n\nt36, t23, t13, t5, t3, t31, t35, t31, t2, t24, t31, t20, t0, t10, t5, t7, t37, t16, t4, t20, t12.\n\nSo after t36, which comes from NT73, the next is t23. So the NT20 must derive into something that includes t23 as the next terminal. But in the grammar, NT20 only goes to 't17'. So unless NT20 \u2192 NT... \u2192 t23, but looking at NT20, it's NT20 -> 't17' in the rules. So that doesn't fit. \n\nSimilarly, maybe I need to see if NT20 can produce a sequence that starts with t23, but in the rules, NT20 only directly goes to 't17'. Therefore, the second token can't be t23 if the first is t36 from NT73 NT20.\n\nThis suggests that the string might not be generated by the grammar. But perhaps I'm missing something in the deeper derivations.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The start symbol S can also be NT95 NT83. Maybe the first token t36 comes from NT95. Let me check what NT95 can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see NT95 on the left side in the productions listed. Wait, let me scan the productions. \n\nWait, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT38 -> 't36' (so NT38 can produce t36)\n- NT27 -> 't33' (but t33 isn't in the string)\n- NT24 -> 't25' (not helpful)\n- NT47 -> 't27' (not helpful)\n- NT95 -> 't18' (no)\n- NT35 -> 't3' (no)\n- Hmm, I don't see NT95 producing any terminal, which would be required if the first symbol is t36 from NT95. Because if S is NT95 NT83, the first token must come from NT95. So if NT95 doesn't produce t36, then the first token can't be t36 from NT95. Therefore, S must start with NT73 NT20, leading to the first token t36 from NT73, and the second token from NT20 must be t17, but the string's second token is t23, which is a problem.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the string can't be generated by the grammar because the second token is t23, which isn't produced by either NT73 or NT20 after t36.\n\nWait, but perhaps the derivation is more complicated. Maybe the initial S can lead to a longer sequence where the first few symbols come from other non-terminals that eventually resolve to t36 and t23.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assigning the first token. Maybe the string starts from a different production. Alternatively, maybe NT20 can lead to t23 through some steps.\n\nWait, let me check NT20's productions. According to the grammar rules:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\nThat's the only production for NT20. So it can only directly produce t17. So if S is NT73 NT20, after t36 (from NT73), the next token should be t17 from NT20. But in the string, it's t23. So that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, there's a contradiction. The first token t36 can only come from NT73, and the next token must be t17 from NT20, but the string's second token is t23, not t17. Thus, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, unless I'm making a mistake in the order of derivation. Maybe the string starts with a deeper production where after t36, another non-terminal produces t23. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another non-terminal can produce t23. Let's look at the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT that has a production ending with 't23'. Let's go through all non-terminals that can produce terminals.\n\nFrom the productions:\n\n- NT73 -> 't36'\n- NT38 -> 't36', 't29' (looking at NT38's production rules: I see NT38 -> 't26', NT44, etc. Wait, according to the rules, there are multiple productions for NT38:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, but some entries are duplicated, like for NT38, there are multiple entries. Let me parse them properly.\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, it's presented as a list:\n\n Grammar: ```S -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\nNT71 -> NT68 NT2\nNT39 -> NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-414","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Alright, I'll need to figure out a systematic way to approach this problem.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form for context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because all the non-terminals on the left side of the arrows produce two non-terminals on the right except for the ones that directly produce terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t9 t37 t3 t33 t27 t33 t14 t16 t31 t16 t17 t6 t36 t7 t22 t10 t27 t7 t5 t4 t9`. It's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe grammar has S defined as NT73 NT20, so the start is two non-terminals: NT73 and NT20. Each of these will be replaced by other non-terminals until we get down to the terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to reverse engineer the process. Starting from the string and seeing if each terminal can be matched by a production. Alternatively, I can simulate the parsing process step by step.\n\nWait, maybe using the CYK algorithm would be a good way to parse the string. CYK is designed for CNF grammars and can efficiently parse the string to check if it's in the language. But doing that manually might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to find a derivation path from S to the string.\n\nLet me list the production rules and the terminals they produce for clarity:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96 (and terminal 't3')\nNT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2 (and terminal 't2')\nNT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37 (and 't3', 't37')\nNT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45 (and 't5')\nNT88 \u2192 NT38 NT24 (and 't4')\nNT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47 (and 't7')\nNT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (and 't6')\nNT80 \u2192 NT71 NT99 (and 't9', 't16')\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63 (and 't20')\nNT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62 (and 't3')\nNB: Wait, this might not be the right approach. Let me make a table of NT and their possible terminal productions.\n\nWait, looking closely, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT35 can produce 't3', 't13', 't5', etc. Similarly, NT49 can produce 't3', 't9', 't23', etc. So each of these NTs can produce specific terminals when they are derived.\n\nI think a better approach is to represent each position in the string as a variable and see how it can be broken down. The string has 21 terminals, so each 't' corresponds to a production.\n\nLet me index the string for clarity:\n\n0: t6\n1: t9\n2: t37\n3: t3\n4: t33\n5: t27\n6: t33\n7: t14\n8: t16\n9: t31\n10: t16\n11: t17\n12: t6\n13: t36\n14: t7\n15: t22\n16: t10\n17: t27\n18: t7\n19: t5\n20: t4\n21: t9\n\nWait, actually, the string has 21 terminals, so indices 0 to 20.\n\nI think maybe a top-down approach could work, but it's complicated without a parser. Alternatively, let me see if each 't' can be mapped to the corresponding NT and see if the overall structure fits with the production rules.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe first symbol is 't6'. Looking at the productions, NT49 can produce 't6' (from NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6 \u2192 't6' directly). So the first non-terminal must be NT49.\n\nNext, after NT49, the next symbols must be produced by NT11 and NT6.\n\nLooking at NT11: It can produce 't12', 't37', 't2'. The third symbol is 't37', which is from NT37 (NT37 \u2192 't37' directly). Wait, no: Looking again, NT37 is involved in other productions. Let me check the productions for NT11. From the list:\n\nNT11: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, so NT11's productions are:\n\nWait, I'm mixing up. Each NT has its own productions. Wait, more accurately, each NT's possible productions are listed. So for NT11, looking through the list:\n\nLooking for NT11 \u2192 ...

{"custom_id":"request-423","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should look at the provided grammar. It looks like all the rules are in the form A -> BC or A -> a, which fits Chomsky normal form. So that's good because it simplifies things. \n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t16 t16 t2 t35 t22 t28 t10 t6 t18 t10 t9 t18 t14 t4 t3 t4 t22 t1 t24 t36 t10 t24`. It's a series of tokens separated by spaces. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So each step in the derivation will process the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nLet me start by listing all the variables and terminals. The variables are S, NT52, NT71, NT83, etc., up to a lot of NTs. The terminals are strings like 't16', 't2', etc., down to 't39' or something like that. \n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see S is the start symbol, and it goes to NT73 and NT20. So the string must start with the start symbol S. Since S is NT73 -> NT62 NT27, that means the first step is to derive the string from NT73. So the first part of the string should come from NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't16'. Let me check what rules produce 't16'. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT68 -> 't14' but that's not 't16'. Wait, looking again: is there a rule for NT64 -> 't24' or wait, no, 't16' comes from NT99 -> 't16' somewhere? Looking back, yes, I see NT99 -> 't16' appears in a few places. So that could be a possible starting point.\n\nWait, but if I choose NT99 -> 't16', but in reality, the first rule starts as NT73. So maybe I need to see how NT73 can be expanded. \n\nLet me write down the steps. Starting with S -> NT73 NT20. So the first two tokens should derive from NT73 and NT20. But looking at the string, the next token after t16 is t16 again. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string starts with t16. So perhaps S expands to NT73 NT20, but NT73 can also produce something else, or maybe it's the other way around. Let me check the rules for NT73.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT73 can produce NT62 NT27 (from S) or also appears on the right side of another rule. Wait, no, in the given grammar, S -> NT73 NT20. So each time we have S, it's a combination of NT73 and NT20. So the initial expansion would break into two parts.\n\nWait, but the first token is t16. So perhaps NT73 can produce a terminal t16. Let me check if there's a rule for NT73 -> 't16'. Scrolling through the grammar, I don't see any 't16' production for NT73. The NT64 -> 't24' and NT26 -> 't20' perhaps. So that's confusing.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the grammar. Let me take a closer look. Oh, wait, the non-terminals are all named NT followed by numbers, like NT52, NT71, etc., and some terminals like t16, t2, etc.\n\nI think it's better to list out the possible terminals each NT can produce. Let's go through each NT rule and note their productions.\n\nStarting with NT73: The rule is S -> NT73 NT20. But looking further in the grammar:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT62 -> NT24 NT53\n- NT53 -> NT11 NT49\n- NT49 -> NT23 NT44\n- NT44 -> NT95 NT47\n- NT95 -> NT39 NT39\n- NT39 -> NT51 NT37\n- NT51 -> NT64 NT90\n- NT64 -> NT24 NT23\n- NT24 -> NT47 NT46\n- Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should create a list of all NTs and their productions.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, let me see what each NT can produce in terms of terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that some NTs directly produce terminals, like:\n\n- NT83 -> 't28'\n- NT82 -> 't5'\n- NT85 -> 't27'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT22 -> 't31'\n- NT49 -> 't35'\n- NT80 -> 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't88'\n- NT38 -> 't26', 't29', 't16', 't35', 't23', 't27', 't33', 't10', 't3', 't13', 't9', 't5', 't18', 't0', 't6', 't22', 't25', etc.\n\nWait, this seems too many to handle manually. I should find a smarter way. Maybe I can build a mapping from each NT to its possible terminal outputs to simplify things.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to walk through the string and see if it can be derived by matching the rules.\n\nBut this approach might take a long time, but let's try.\n\nThe string is: t16 t16 t2 t35 t22 t28 t10 t6 t18 t10 t9 t18 t14 t4 t3 t4 t22 t1 t24 t36 t10 t24\n\nStarting with the entire string, I can try to find the leftmost part that matches any NT's production.\n\nGiven that the grammar starts with S, which is NT73 NT20, perhaps the first few tokens are derived from NT73 and NT20.\n\nWait, but the first token is t16. If NT73 can produce t16, that would be the first step. But looking through the rules, does any NT73 rule produce a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking back: NT73 is part of S's production, but as a non-terminal, does it have any rules that produce a terminal? Let me scan all the NT73 rules except the one from S.\n\nLooking through the body of the grammar:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27 (part of S)\n- NT73 is also on the right side of S -> NT73 NT20\nBut in the body, does NT73 have any further rules? Wait, no, the only production for NT73 is part of S. So NT73 cannot produce a terminal directly. The only way to get t16 is via another NT that can produce it.\n\nLooking for rules where a terminal is 't16'. I see:\n\n- NT39 -> 't6' (Wait, no, checking the list: NT39 appears in several rules, but the terminals it produces are 't5', 't18', etc. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules:\n\n- NT85 -> 't27'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT22 -> 't31'\n- NT49 -> 't35', etc.\nWait, actually, looking through all the rules, I see that NT99 -> 't16' is one of the options, yes. So there is an NT99->'t16'.\n\nSo perhaps the first token is produced by NT99 -> 't16'. That would make sense.\n\nBut then, the next token is t16 again. How does that happen? Because in the string, after t16 comes another t16.\n\nSo, perhaps the first t16 is from NT99, which then gets transformed further. But hold on, if NT99 can only produce a terminal, then in the grammar, each production of NT99 would be either another NT99 -> 't16'.\n\nWait, no,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check:\n\nLooking beyond, I see NT35, NT53, etc. But for NT52, it's those three rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let's look again:\n\nAfter NT96 comes NT52: NT52 rules:\n\n- NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nThen after NT83:\n\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\n\nThen NT88, etc., until I reach NT52 again.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there are more NT52 rules. Wait, I might have misread. Let me look at all NT52 entries:\n\nWait, looking at the full list, I see:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nNT52 -> NT80 NT47\n\nNT52 -> NT12 NT85\n\nWait, and is there another rule for NT52? Let me check each line:\n\nAfter NT49 (which has rules), there's NT47:\n\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\n\nWait, no. Let me check if NT52 has more rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT52: has three rules: NT35 NT96, NT80 NT47, NT12 NT85.\n\nIs that all? So, no, in the provided grammar, I only see three rules for NT52.\n\nWait, that seems off because in a typical context-free grammar, each non-terminal should have multiple productions. Maybe I missed some. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT52 is defined three times, each time with two non-terminals. So, in this case, NT52 is a non-terminal that can be expanded into two sequences of other non-terminals. Now, looking at the string, the first part is 't9 t16 t16 t6 t18 t6 t33 t30 t37 t28 t22 t7 t30 t24 t18 t7 t11 t2 t11 t1 t5 t36 t22'.\n\nSince the string starts with 't9', let's see how that can happen. The first symbol is 't9'. The start symbol S can go to NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nSo, let's see which productions can lead to 't9'. Looking at the terminal symbols, I see NT88 can produce 't28', NT93 probably doesn't, but looking at the provided grammar, which terminal symbols do we have?\n\nLooking back, the terminal rules are:\n\nNT99 -> 't10'\n\nNT95 -> 't18'\n\nNT83 -> 't28'\n\nNT52 -> 't5' (Wait, in the provided list, looking for 't' symbols):\n\nWait, I need to list all the productions that produce terminals.

Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, NT52's rules are three, but none produce terminals except for one? Wait, no, wait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me list each terminal production:\n\nLooking at each rule, whenever I see a rule that ends with -> 't*', that's a terminal production.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n\n- NT95 -> 't18'\n\n- NT83 -> 't28'\n\n- NT52 -> 't5'\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back at the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT99 -> 't10'\n\nNT95 -> 't18'\n\nNT83 -> 't28'\n\nBut for NT52, does any rule produce a terminal? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT99 -> 't10'\n\nNT95 -> 't18'\n\nNT83 -> 't28'\n\nOther rules are all combinations of non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-436","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite extensive with multiple productions, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens: `t25 t17 t36 t5 t6 t27 t0 t23 t9 t13 t0 t12 t31 t31 t30 t4 t28 t28 t1 t17 t28 t1 t12`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, each production rule has either a single non-terminal or exactly two non-terminals. The given grammar fits this because every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, that's a good sign.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to parse the string. Since it's a sequence of t's with numbers, these are likely terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived step by step from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the grammar's topmost production, S. Looking at the grammar, I see that S has two main options: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Since S is at the start, the entire string must derive from one of these. So, the string must start with the symbols produced by either NT73 or NT95.\n\nLet me look at the string: it starts with `t25`. I need to find which non-terminal's productions can start with t25. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT44 has a production \u2192 't31', but I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t25. Wait, no, looking again, I see NT24 has a production \u2192 't25' under NT24 \u2192 't25'. But wait, in the grammar, is there an NT24 rule? Let me check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT24 \u2192 't25'. Yes, so NT24 can directly produce t25. Then, after t25, the next token is t17. I need to see what productions NT25 can go to. Wait, no, NT24 is the one that produces t25. So, after NT24, the next symbol is t17.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The string is a sequence of t's with numbers, so each 't' followed by a number is a separate token. So the string is: t25, t17, t36, t5, t6, t27, t0, t23, t9, t13, t0, t12, t31, t31, t30, t4, t28, t28, t1, t17, t28, t1, t12.\n\nSo, let's break this down step by step. The first token is t25. Looking for a production that can start with t25. In the grammar, I see that NT24 has a production NT24 \u2192 't25'. So, the first symbol t25 must come from NT24.\n\nSo, the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t25 from NT24. Wait, but NT24 is part of the grammar, but how does that fit into deriving from NT73 or NT95? Maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire string must be derived from S, which branches into two NTs. So, the string must split into two parts, each derived from either NT73 or NT95 or NT83 etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to derive the string step by step, using the grammar productions.\n\nLet me list all the productions again for clarity, focusing on the relevant parts since the full list is extensive.\n\nFirst, the NT rules that produce terminals (i.e., those ending with \u2192 a):\n\nNT73 \u2192 't36'\nNT44 \u2192 't31'\nNT68 \u2192 't14'\nNT38 \u2192 't26'\nNT99 \u2192 't10'\nNT35 \u2192 't3'\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\nNT64 \u2192 't17'\nNT99 \u2192 't10'\nNT35 \u2192 't5'\nNT63 \u2192 't29'\nNT96 \u2192 't20'\nNT44 \u2192 't4'\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\nNT20 \u2192 't17'\nNT96 \u2192 't27'\nNT27 \u2192 't27' (Wait, that seems off, but maybe it's a recursive rule)\n\nWait, looking again, some of these might be typo-prone. For example, NT27 \u2192 't27' might be a typo, but perhaps it's intended to produce something else. Alternatively, it might be part of a longer production.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the terminals that appear in the string and see how they can be produced.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are: t25, t17, t36, t5, t6, t27, t0, t23, t9, t13, t0, t12, t31, t31, t30, t4, t28, t28, t1, t17, t28, t1, t12.\n\nI see that t24\u2192 t25, but no NT24, only NT24 elsewhere. Wait, is there a rule for NT24? Let me check: yes, NT24 \u2192 't25'.\n\nSo, t25 comes from NT24. But then, looking at the grammar, where else can t25 come from? Only NT24 \u2192 't25'.\n\nSo, the first symbol t25 must be from NT24. Therefore, in the derivation, one of the NTs in S's production must be NT24.\n\nLooking at S's options: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Neither of these are NT24. So, how to get NT24 in the derivation?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. The production rules for NT73 and NT44:\n\nLooking at NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73, and NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. So maybe NT73 can eventually produce t27, but not t25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can be derived into another set of NTs that can eventually produce the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Maybe I should use a top-down parsing approach, applying the productions step by step.\n\nAnother idea: Since it's a CNF grammar, each production has two non-terminals, and the string can be viewed as the leftmost derivation. So, each step produces two symbols.\n\nBut the string has 22 tokens, so each step would need to reduce the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be split into a series of pairs of symbols, each of which is produced by a single production rule.\n\nFor example, the string is a sequence of symbols: t25, t17, t36, t5, t6, t27, t0, t23, t9, t13, t0, t12, t31, t31, t30, t4, t28, t28, t1, t17, t28, t1, t12.\n\nThe first two symbols are t25 and t17. These need to come from a production rule where the left-hand side is an NT that produces t25 and t17. Looking at the grammar, I need to find an NT that has a production of the form NT -> t25 t17. But in the given grammar, there's no rule for any NT that directly produces t25 and t17. Only individual rules for individual terminals.\n\nWait, unless it's part of a longer production. For example, if NT25 exists with a production NT25 \u2192 t25 NT17, but I don't see such a rule in the provided grammar. So, perhaps this approach isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol is t25, which must come from NT24, as we saw earlier. So, we have S \u2192 NT24 NTsomething. But S cannot produce NT24 because the top-level productions are only NT73 or NT95.\n\nHmm, that suggests a problem. S can't directly produce NT24, and we can't have a production that leads to a single NT24. Alternatively, maybe there's a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the entire string as a sequence that needs to be broken down into parts, each part corresponding to a production.\n\nEach step in the derivation would take two non-terminals and expand them into two terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol which can also produce the empty string. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Hmm, the grammar provided has some rules that produce terminal symbols directly, like NT52 -> ... etc., down to some t<number>, which are terminals.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each rule either produces two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. That means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure should make parsing easier using methods like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just trying to determine if the string is generated, maybe I can approach it step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's quite extensive. I see a bunch of non-terminals on the left side, each pointing to two other non-terminals or sometimes a terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t13 t27 t31 t29 t3 t9 t24 t35 t23 t7 t18 t30 t30 t35 t12 t16 t36 t6 t12 t13 t36 t37 t17 t35`.\n\nMy first thought is to try to break down the string into smaller parts, looking for the longest possible matches with the production rules. Alternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help, but that might be complex here. Another approach is to use memoization or dynamic programming (like CYK) to keep track of possible derivations, but maybe I can handle it manually since the string is not too long.\n\nLet me list out the production rules that produce terminals, as these will be essential in generating the string. These are the right-hand sides (RHS) that are single terminals:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 t10\n- NT27 \u2192 t33 (but it's a non-terminal, so maybe not relevant)\n- NT2 \u2192 t22\n- NT4 \u2192 t11\n- NT68 \u2192 t14\n- NT11 \u2192 t12\n- NT22 \u2192 t20\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT49 \u2192 t3\n- NT39 \u2192 t6\n- NT71 \u2192 t2\n- NT38 \u2192 't36' (Wait, in the grammar, is that a terminal 't36' or a production rule?

Each 't' represents a terminal symbol, so that's the end of a production.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two non-terminals on the RHS. So for a terminal to appear in the string, it must be a result of a production that directly goes to that terminal.\n\nSo, for example, if in the string, I have 't36', that must come from a production rule that has RHS as 't36'. Looking back, yes, NT38 \u2192 't36', and also NT73 \u2192 't36'. So 't36' can be derived from NT38 or NT73.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 't33' (but the string has 't27' as 13th token, which is part of 't27 t31'\u2014wait, the string is a sequence of t's, not NTs. Wait, no, the string is a series of tokens, each being a 't' followed by a number.

So all of these are terminal symbols, derived from the grammar. So, perhaps the root S can generate these through a leftmost derivation.\n\nI think a good approach is to build a parse tree starting from S, using the given string as a target, and see if each step can match the string's segments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backwards using the string and see if it can be divided into RHS parts of the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt13 t27 t31 t29 t3 t9 t24 t35 t23 t7 t18 t30 t30 t35 t12 t13 t36 t37 t17"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that every production rule be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all the rules except for the terminals look like A \u2192 BB. Wait, actually, in CNF, terminals are allowed except on the left side. So rules like S \u2192 NT73 NT20 imply that S is a non-terminal, and NT73, NT20 are other non-terminals, and the terminal tokens would be something else. Hmm, but in this case, some rules are directly yielding terminal symbols, which is allowed in CNF because you can have A \u2192 a where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking closer, some rules have more than two symbols on the right. For example, NT73 -> NT62 NT27. That's fine because in CNF, each production can have exactly two symbols on the right. There are no rules with more than two symbols. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t28 t36 t2 t31 t25 t24 t6 t4 t0 t12 t33 t3 t3 t12 t23 t6 t23 t30 t3 t35 t23 t5 t0 t17 t16`.\n\nSo, each of these tokens like t28, t36, etc., are terminal symbols. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to try to build the parse tree for this string, ensuring that each rule in the grammar can produce the corresponding segments.\n\nBut since this is a bit tedious, maybe I can look for patterns or see which rules lead directly to terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are many rules that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT6 \u2192 't88'\n- And so on.\n\nSo, I can start by checking if the string can be broken down into these terminal symbols, following the rules.\n\nFirst, let's note that the string starts with t28. Let me look at the grammar to see which non-terminal directly produces t28.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't22'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT7 \u2192 appears in some rules as NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37, but not directly a terminal.\n- NT38 is a starting point for t36.\n\nWait, I can't find t28 directly in the rules. Maybe I need to look for a rule that produces a terminal that starts with t28. Or perhaps t28 is part of a longer production.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Hmm, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT88 \u2192 NT38 NT24\n- NT96 \u2192 NT82 NT83\n- NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62\n- NT54 \u2192 Not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe t28 is part of a two-symbol production that leads to it. Let me think, perhaps somewhere a non-terminal A produces B t28. Or perhaps t28 is in a production rule with a single symbol on the right. Let me search through the rules:\n\nLooking through each production, looking for any that result in a single terminal symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-476","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step. First, I'll read the grammar carefully and understand how it produces strings, right?\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which seems to expand into two NT parts. Looking at the productions, S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83. Each NT has its own production rules, which eventually expand into terminals (like 't13', 't2', etc.) or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is long: `t13 t2 t3 t7 t18 t0 t4 t1 t18 t10 t5 t9 t22 t2 t23 t6 t31 t6 t23 t28 t36 t18 t22 t7 t1`. \n\nI think I'll approach this by trying to parse the string from the beginning. Parsing involves working from the start symbol and trying to match the string by expanding the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two non-terminals on the left and each step increases the count by one. So the string's length should be 2^n where n is the number of steps. Let's see, the string has 27 tokens, which isn't a power of two (2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32). Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake, or perhaps it's a mistake in the problem setup. Wait, no, 27 isn't a power of two. Maybe the string isn't generated by the grammar? But I'll keep going.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of non-terminals and their expansions could fit. But I might not get bogged down by the string length right away. Let's try to see if the string starts with a production that S generates.\n\nLooking at S's productions: NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So the string should start with either NT73 or NT95 followed by their respective NT20 or NT83. Let's check the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't13 t2 t3...'. Wait, the first token is 't13'. Looking back at the grammar, NT73 can produce 't36' or other NTs. NT73 production: NT73 -> NT12 NT47, but also directly 't36'. So perhaps NT73 expands to 't36'? But in the string, the first token is 't13', which isn't 't36'. Hmm, maybe it's another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The grammar's NTs produce sequences of NTs until they reach t's. So each NT that cannot be further expanded is a terminal. So, for example, if an NT directly expands to a terminal, that's the end.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many NTs have productions that directly map to 't' followed by numbers, like NT99 -> 't10', NT83 -> 't28', etc. So perhaps I should look for these in the string.\n\nLet me list the NTs and their direct terminals:\n\n- NT73 -> 't36'\n- NT95 -> 't18'\n- NT39 -> 't6'\n- NT52 -> 't12', 't85', 't47'\nWait, but earlier I saw NT73's production. Let's check all NTs:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT52 -> 't12' (via NT12), 't85', 't47' (but NT47 produces 't27', etc.)\nBut perhaps the direct t's are in NT99, NT96, NT20, etc.\n\nLet me list all NTs and their immediate terminals:\n\n- NT73 -> 't36'\n- NT95 -> 't18'\n- NT52:\n  -> NT12 NT47: Wait, NT12 is 't11' (from NT12 -> 't11'), and NT47 -> 't27' (from NT47 -> 't27')\n  So NT52 can become t11 t27\n  Or another production: NT52 -> 't85' (from the listed productions)\n  Or another: NT52 -> 't47' (since it also has NT47)\n- NT49 -> 't3' or 't23' or 't9'\n- NT99 -> 't10', 't35', 't63', 't73' according to the productions. Wait, in the grammar list provided, NT99 -> 't10', 't35', 't63', 't73'. So those are direct terminals.\n\nSo the possible first steps could be to get 't13' as the first token. Looking at the string, the first token is t13, which is not in the list above. So perhaps the initial NT doesn't directly produce t13.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT that produces t13 is NT39? Let me check: NT39 -> 't6' or 't5'? Looking at the grammar: NT39 -> NT51 NT37, and others. Wait, in the grammar, it's written as:\n\n\"NT39 -> NT51 NT37\".\n\nWait, but then NT51 and NT37. Do these produce any terminals directly?\n\nWait, let's go step by step. I'm a bit confused because the string starts with t13, and none of the immediate NTs produce t13. So maybe the first part of the string comes from an NT that eventually leads to t13 through expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not correctly split, but that's unlikely. Maybe the first NT is something that eventually reaches t13. Let me look at the grammar again.\n\nLooking for NTs that can eventually produce t13. Let me check all productions:\n\nNT95 -> 't18' or 't35', but no t13. Wait, but NT95 can be 't35' from another production? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar includes NT99 -> 't10' or 't35' or 't63' or 't73'. Hmm, and 't35' is a terminal. So if an NT reduces to 't35', that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but the first token is t13, which isn't in the immediate terminations. So maybe the initial NT must come through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is too long or follows a path that isn't possible. Let me try to look for any immediate matches at the beginning of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t13, so we need an NT that can generate t13. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3', 't5', 't9', 't13'... Wait, is there an NT that can produce t13?\n\nLooking through the list, NT39 -> NT51 NT37. Then NT51 and NT37: do they produce t13?\n\nWait, NT51: NT51 -> NT64 NT90 or 't17', 't44', 't68', 't11', 't38' etc. Let me see, NT51 is listed as:\n\nNT51 -> NT64 NT90, or 't17' (if from NT64), 't44', 't68', 't11', 't38'.\n\nWait, but NT64 is another production.\n\nNT64 -> NT95, NT24, or 't17'. So if NT64 is t17, which is in the string. But how to get to t13?\n\nWait, maybe the initial NT is NT49. Let me check NT49's productions: NT49 -> 't3', 't23', 't4', 't9'. No t13 there.\n\nWait, perhaps NT12? NT12's productions: NT12 -> NT73, NT47, or 't11'. So t11 is possible.\n\nWait, but if the initial NT is NT73, which can produce t36. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial NT is NT12 (from NT73->NT12). So NT73 -> NT12 -> 't11'. But the string starts with t13, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for a matching path through the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be divided into smaller parts that each can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be split into segments that correspond to possible NT productions. For example, 't13' must be produced by some NT, and the next few tokens must be compatible with that NT's production.\n\nWait, looking at the string: t13 t2 t3 t7 t18 t0 t4 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-501","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t10 t18 t30 t37 t16 t23 t4 t2 t27 t13 t1 t18 t11 t16 t31 t25 t7 t9 t23 t33 t6 t0 t0 t14 t12 t27`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. But looking at the grammar, I see that some productions have terminals on the right side, like S -> NT73 NT20, but NT73 could produce more things, including terminals. Hmm, wait, no, the given grammar seems to have some productions that directly lead to terminals, like NT38 -> 't36', etc. So it's a mix where some of the non-terminals produce terminals, and others produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, the user input shows the grammar in CNF with all productions in the form of A \u2192 BC. But in the user's grammar, I saw some productions like NT38 -> 't36', which are terminals. That seems a bit conflicting because in CNF, the right-hand side should consist of two non-terminals. So maybe the grammar isn't strictly in CNF anymore because some of the productions produce terminals. Alternatively, perhaps it's in a form that allows terminals on the right-hand side, which would make it not pure CNF.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Looking at the grammar again, it seems a bit mixed. Many of the rules have two non-terminals on the right, but some have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT38 -> 't36' is a production that produces a single terminal. That would mean it's not strictly CNF, which requires right-hand sides to have two non-terminals. So perhaps the student made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nBut assuming that the grammar is as given, even if it's not pure CNF, I have to work with it. Alternatively, maybe all the rules have either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So the given grammar actually is in CNF because the right-hand sides can have terminals. So that's fine.\n\nNow, my task is to parse the string into the non-terminals using these productions and see if the string can be generated by the grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals, each being a 't' followed by a number. The string has 27 terms, which is 27 tokens.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can approach this by trying to build the parse tree from the bottom up (using a CYK algorithm approach) or top down using memoization. Alternatively, since the grammar is small, I can try to trace from the start symbol S and see if each part of the string conforms.\n\nThe string starts with t10. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT99 -> t10 (from NT99 -> NT38 NT62, but wait, let me check: looking back, I see in the grammar rules, for example, NT99 has several productions, including NT99 -> NT38 NT62, and also NT99 -> NT22 NT4, NT99 -> NT63 NT2, etc. Additionally, there are some NT99 -> 't10' productions, for example: NT99 -> 't10'. Oh wait, yes, looking back, the user provided some rules like NT99 -> 't10', NT95 -> 't5', etc. So some of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo the first token in the string is t10. Let's check if any of the non-terminals can produce t10. Looking through the rules, I see:\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- Also, looking at NT62, does it produce 't10'? No, looking at NT62 -> 't24' and other rules, so no. Similarly, NT49 produces 't23', etc. So the only way to get 't10' is if NT99 \u2192 t10.\n\nSo the first symbol t10 must come from NT99 \u2192 t10. So in the parsing process, the first step is that S must produce NT95 NT83, but maybe that's too long. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with t10, so the very leftmost part of the string is t10, which comes from NT99.\n\nSo to generate t10, the parser must reduce the first part to NT99, which in turn must be derived from the start symbol S. But S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So from S, we get NT95 and NT83, each of which must derive a string. However, t10 is the first symbol, so perhaps the way to generate this is that the first part of the string (t10) is generated by NT99, and the following parts are generated by the other symbols.\n\nWait, but S produces NT95 and NT83, so the leftmost non-terminal must generate the first part. So the first non-terminal is NT95? Or NT83? Wait, let me look again. S can produce NT95 NT83. So the entire string must be generated by the two non-terminals NT95 and NT83. So the string starts with t10, which must be generated by NT95 or NT83.\n\nLooking at NT95's productions: NT95 -> 't18', 't16', 't9', 't5', and others. So NT95 can lead directly to t18, t16, t9, t5, etc. But in the string, the first symbol is t10, which is not among these directly. So wait, maybe NT95 can't directly produce t10. Instead, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.\n\nWait, let me retrace. The string starts with t10. So we need a non-terminal that can produce t10 as its first symbol. Looking through the grammar rules, the only production that directly produces t10 is NT99 \u2192 't10'. Therefore, the first non-terminal in the parse tree must be NT99.\n\nBut the start symbol is S, which has productions S \u2192 NT95 NT83 or S \u2192 NT73 NT20, etc. So S must derive to NT99... So maybe S must produce NT95 NT83, and then NT95 and NT83 derive their respective substrings such that when combined, they form the entire string.\n\nWait, but that's not the case here because the string starts with t10, which comes from NT99, not from S. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which would mean the entire string is generated by NT73 followed by NT20. So perhaps the string is split into two parts, each generated by NT73 and NT20, respectively.\n\nBut the string is long and starts with t10. Let's check if anywhere in the grammar the first symbol t10 can be generated. It's only generated by NT99. So that suggests that the first non-terminal in the parse tree must be NT99, which would imply that S, via one of its productions, must produce something that starts with NT99 and then continues with whatever comes next.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the parse tree more carefully. Let me consider that the entire string must be generated by S, so S must produce NT95 NT83, and each of those non-terminals must produce their respective sequences. But if t10 is the first symbol, then one of the NT95 or NT83 must produce t10. Looking at NT95's productions, do any of them produce t10? From the grammar, looking at NT95's rules:\n\nNT95 has rules like:\n- NT95 \u2192 't18'\n- NT95 \u2192 't16'\n- NT95 \u2192 't9'\n- NT95 \u2192 't5'\n- and others, but no t10. So NT95 can't generate t10.\n\nWhat about NT83? Looking at NT83's rules:\n- NT83 \u2192 't28'\n- NT83 \u2192 't27'\n- and so on; again, no t10.\n\nSo S's two options, NT95 and NT83, cannot generate t10. That suggests that perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all in CNF, meaning each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or a terminal on the right. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, possibly using something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just doing this manually, I'll approach it differently.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t36 t33 t13 t3 t6 t36 t31 t35 t25 t30 t23 t24 t27 t1 t5 t9 t13 t29 t2 t1 t16 t37 t36 t10 t1 t0`.\n\nI notice that the string is composed of various tokens starting with 't', which suggests that many of these are terminals. The rest are likely non-terminals that will eventually derive into these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive.

So, each production either leads to a terminal (denoted by a single 't' followed by a number) or splits into two non-terminals. The string given is a sequence of these terminals, so each token corresponds to a terminal step in the derivation.\n\nNow, to check if the string is in the language generated by the grammar, I can try to parse the string starting from the start symbol S. But since the grammar is in CNF, which is particularly suited for the CYK algorithm, but again, I'm doing this manually. Another approach is to work backwards, starting from the string and seeing if each part can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string for clarity:\n\n1. t36\n2. t33\n3. t13\n4. t3\n5. t6\n6. t36\n7. t31\n8. t35\n9. t25\n10. t30\n11. t23\n12. t24\n13. t27\n14. t1\n15. t5\n16. t9\n17. t13\n18. t29\n19. t2\n20. t1\n21. t16\n22. t37\n23. t36\n24. t10\n25. t1\n26. t0\n\nHmm, that's 26 tokens. Let's see if we can start from S and parse this string.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nLet me check which option could produce the string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 or NT35 NT96 or other options. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT73 \u2192 ... 't36' is one of the terminals, but let's see.\n\nBut in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal splitting into two. So, starting with S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nThen, each of NT73 and NT20 would need to derive sequences that, when combined, match the given string.\n\nLet me see what NT73 can produce. From the list:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 or NT35 NT96 or others, but in our grammar, NT73 has:\n\nLooking back, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 and NTNT35 NT96?

The grammar starts with S, which branches into NT pairs. Each of these NTs further splits into more NTs or terminals.\n\nI should parse the string step by step, trying to find a derivation starting from S and ending with the given string. Since it's a CNF grammar, each production replaces exactly two symbols with two others, so the string's length must be a power of two times the initial length. The initial string is of length 30, which is 2^5 (32) times 1.5, which isn't a power of two. So that suggests the string might be too short or too long. But wait, the initial S in the grammar produces two NTs, so the string length should start at 2 symbols and grow by another symbol each time? Wait no, each production replaces a symbol (a non-terminal) with two symbols, so the string length increases by one each time. Starting from S (1 symbol), after one production, it's 2 terms. Each subsequent step adds one symbol. So the string length must be 1 + the number of steps. So for a string length of 30, the number of symbols is 30. Starting from 1, we need 29 steps. That's possible.\n\nBut maybe I should look for specific productions that can lead to 't's. For example, looking for 't's in the productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, several NTs produce terminals. For instance, NT44 -> 't31', NT99 -> 't10', etc. I see that NT27 -> 't24', NT26 -> 't20', and others. So the string contains terms like t20, t37, etc., which might be derived from certain NTs.\n\nI should try to parse the string backward or forward. Let me try to start building the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string: first few terms are t20, t37, t33, t1, etc. Let me see which NTs produce t20.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT38 -> 't20' (Yes, line 75)\n- NT20 -> 't17' (Wait, but in the string, the first term is t20. So if the first production is NT20, it would produce t17, but the string starts with t20, so that's a mismatch.\n\nWait, but the grammar has S -> NT20 NT73. Wait, no, let me check the grammar rules again. Wait the initial part of the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo each S production produces two NTs. So for S to generate the string, the entire string must come from S, which is split into two NTs, each of which may split further.\n\nSo for the given string, which is 30 terms, but since 30 is 2^5 (32) is the next, but 30 is not a power of two, so perhaps the string is too short.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me count the terms: the string is indeed 30 terms, so starting from S (which is 1), after applying 29 productions, it's possible. Each production adds one symbol, but the initial is already two symbols (from S). Hmm, no, S is one symbol but it splits into two NTs, so each production step increases the symbol count by one. So for the initial S, after k steps, the string length is 2 + k.\n\nWait, this may be getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be completely parsed by following the grammar rules.\n\nLet's start by looking for terminals in the string and seeing which NTs they can come from.\n\nThe first term is t20. Which NTs go to t20?\n\nLooking through the rules, NT38 -> 't20' (line 75) and NT12 -> 't11' (line 6), NT20 -> 't17' (line 7), NT25 -> 't25' via some chain? Wait, let me list all NTs that directly produce t20.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT38 -> t20\n- NT20 -> t17\n\nSo the first term t20 can only come from NT38. So the first split would be S->NT73 NT20, but wait, no. Wait S splits into two NTs, each of which must produce a part of the string. The first term is t20, which comes from NT38, so one of the NTs in the S split must be NT38. Let me see the possible combinations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can be NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So the first split is either:\n\n- Option 1: NT73 and NT20, which produce terms starting from t73 and t20.\n\nBut how does that help? Let me see. If the first NT is NT73, what does it produce? Looking through the rules, NT73 -> NT62 NT27 (line 37). Hmm, then we get more NTs. Alternatively, if the first NT is NT38, which directly produces t20, then that would be the start.\n\nWait, the split from S is into two NTs. The first symbol in the string is t20, so that t20 must come from one of the two NTs in S's production. So the first NT must be NT38 because only NT38 produces t20 directly. So one of the two NTs in S must be NT38. Then the other NT in S's split would be another NT, say X. Then the remaining terms in the string must come from X.\n\nSo the string is t20 followed by others. So after the first split, the first NT is NT38 (producing t20), and the second NT is, say, Y which must produce the rest of the string: t37, t33, t1, t31, t0, etc.\n\nWait, but the second NT in S is either NT72 (I think) or another NT.\n\nWait S's productions are S-> NT73 NT20 or S-> NT95 NT83. So each split from S is into two NTs. So in the first split, we have NT38 and Y, where Y is either NT20 if S was split into S->NT73 NT20, but NT38 is not in that S production. Alternatively, if S was split into S->NT95 NT83, then NT95 and NT83. Then the NT95 would produce t37?\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be generated by following the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start from the beginning and try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's denote the string as a list of tokens: [t20, t37, t33, t1, t31, t0, t23, t35, t37, t17, t2, t37, t18, t31, t17, t13, t22, t12, t10, t7, t18, t0, t29, t3, t5, t25, t7]\n\nI think the approach is to see if this string is a possible derivation starting from S.\n\nLet me consider the grammar rules and see how the tokens can be generated.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS can split into NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nIf I check the string, the first token is t20, which is only produced by NT38. So looking at S->NT38 NT something? But in the grammar, S's rules don't have NT38. Wait, did I miss that? Let me check the initial rules.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So the initial production is into NTs that are part of S. So none of the S rules produce NT38. Therefore, how can the string start with t20? Because t20 is an output of NT38, but S can't directly split into NT38 as one of the NTs.

{"custom_id":"request-521","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding what I'm dealing with here.\n\nThe grammar is a set of production rules where each rule has either a non-terminal giving two non-terminals or a single terminal. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, that checks out. The string I have is a sequence of terminals followed by some 't' followed by numbers, like t22, t30, etc. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see S can produce two options: S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83. So any derivation starts with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Then, each of those non-terminals can further split into other non-terminals until we reach the terminals, which correspond to the letters and numbers in the string.\n\nThe string given is: t22 t30 t37 t7 t10 t4 t25 t27 t13 t30 t30 t33 t4 t5 t17 t5 t12 t4 t33 t36 t22 t37 t22 t20 t30 t31 t28.\n\nSo each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. Therefore, each of these must appear at the leaves of the parse tree. My task is to see if the derivation can result in exactly this sequence.\n\nFirst, let me note that each terminal in the string is a single character, which seems a bit unusual. Typically, terminals are multi-character, but given the grammar, it's possible that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So I have to treat each tX as a single terminal.\n\nNow, I'll try to map the string to the grammar. Let's break down the string step by step. I'll start from the start symbol S and see how it can split into the two production rules and then see how those non-terminals can produce the given terminals.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT73 NT20. So starting with NT73 and NT20. Let's see what NT73 can produce. From the grammar, NT73 -> NT62 NT27. Then NT62 can go to NT53 NT24. NT53 is another non-terminal, and so on. Alternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward path.\n\nAlternatively, Option 2: S -> NT95 NT83. Let's explore both options.\n\nBut before diving deep, perhaps it's better to consider that the string has multiple terminals, so it's likely that both options will have to be split in multiple steps. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string by looking for possible productions that can generate the required terminals, starting from the beginning.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is t22. I need to find which non-terminals can produce t22.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT22 has production rules: NT22 -> NT44 NT63, and I also see NT99 -> NT22 NT4, among others. So does any non-terminal directly produce t22? Let me check. From the list, I see NT74 -> NT39 NT39, but NT39 is another non-terminal. Looking further, NT95 -> t18, so t18 is a terminal.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. From the grammar provided, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nNT44 -> t4\n\nNT73 -> t36\n\nNT88 -> t28\n\nNT99 -> 't10'\n\nNT20 -> t17\n\nNT4 -> t11\n\nNT68 -> t14\n\nNT11 -> t12\n\nNT35 -> t3\n\nNT49 -> t3\n\nNT63 -> t29\n\nNT96 -> t20\n\nNT4 -> t11\n\nNT6 -> t88 NT73\n\nWait, no, NT6 -> NT88 NT73, which in turn produce more non-terminals until terminals. So I think some non-terminals directly produce terminals, and others don't.\n\nWait, from the grammar, some non-terminals have direct terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT44 -> t4\n\nNT49 -> t4\n\nWait, yes, NT44 is t4, NT49 is t4? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT44 -> 't4'\n\nNT49 -> t3\n\nWait, wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, each line is a rule:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT22 -> NT44 NT63\n\nNT99 -> NT22 NT4\n\nSo NT22 produces NT44 and NT63, which themselves might produce more non-terminals.\n\nLooking for direct terminals:\n\nNT22: does it have a rule that ends with a terminal? NT22 -> NT44 NT63. Both are non-terminals, so no.\n\nNT44 -> t4, yes.\n\nSimilarly, NT49 -> t3.\n\nNT20 -> t17\n\nNT4 -> t11\n\nNT68 -> t14\n\nNT11 -> t12\n\nNT35 -> t3\n\nNT49 -> t3\n\nSo NT35 produces t3\n\nNT49 produces t3\n\nNT20 produces t17\n\nNT4 produces t11\n\nNT68 produces t14\n\nNT11 produces t12\n\nLooking elsewhere, do any non-terminals directly produce t22? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\n\nNT62 -> NT53 NT24\n\nNT27 -> NT27 NT62\n\nHmm, so that's a loop.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the start symbol S and see if any of its direct productions can lead to t22.\n\nWait, if S -> NT73 NT20, then NT73 and NT20 are non-terminals that need to produce t22 and t30, maybe. Alternatively, if S -> NT95 NT83, then NT95 and NT83 must produce t22 and t30 as well. Wait, let's see.\n\nLooking at the string: first is t22, then t30. So perhaps the first rule is S -> NT95 NT83 because NT95 can produce a t18, but that's not t22. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-terminal starts with t22 via some rules. Let me look for non-terminals that can directly produce t22.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT73 can produce t36 or more non-terminals.\n\nNT99 is involved in some rules, like NT38->t26.\n\nWait, let me check if any non-terminals directly produce t22. Scanning through all the rules:\n\nIs there a non-terminal that when applied results in t22? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly gives t22. So perhaps t22 is the result of some non-terminal expanding into more non-terminals until it reaches t22.\n\nThus, I have to find a production path from NT73 or NT95 (if the first rule is S->NT95 NT83) for the first element t22.\n\nWait, but if S->NT73 NT20, then NT73 needs to produce t22 and NT20 needs to produce t30.\n\nBut I just realized that in the string, the first is t22, so maybe the first non-terminal is NT95 or NT73.\n\nWait, but NT95 is part of the S->NT95 NT83 rule. So if S starts with that, the first part is NT95, which when derived, must generate t22, or perhaps another non-terminal down the line.\n\nWait, maybe the start symbol is S -> NT73 NT20. Then, NT73 must generate the first part t22, and NT20 must generate t30.\n\nAlternatively, if S->NT95 NT83, then NT95 must generate t22, and NT83 must generate t30.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, does NT95 generate a terminal like t22? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT95 appears in NT55-> t17?\n\nWait, NT95 is involved in NT95: do any of its productions include t22? Let me check: looking through all the rules again.\n\nWait, I'm looking for any rule where NTsomething produces t22. Perhaps via a chain.\n\nFor example, if NT22 is generated by other rules, but from the rules, NT22 is only in NT99->NT22 NT4, which would require NT99 to be expanded further, but NT99's production is NT38->t26, perhaps leading to t26, which is another terminal."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-542","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding what I'm dealing with here.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that non-terminals start with 'NT' followed by numbers and some have productions to other non-terminals, while others directly produce terminals like 't1', 't2', etc. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t25 t25 t13 t7 t20 t17 t37 t25 t12 t7 t25 t35 t25 t31 t33 t18 t16 t35 t28 t30 t9 t23 t30 t16 t13 t4 t30`.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is separated by spaces, so each token is a terminal. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll check how the start symbol S can produce the initial terminals. From the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, every derivation starts with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Let me look at the first few steps.\n\nBut before that, perhaps it's more efficient to approach this by building the string step by step and ensuring that each step follows the grammar rules, ensuring that each part is derived correctly.\n\nLet me break down the string token by token:\nt6, t25, t25, t13, t7, t20, t17, t37, t25, t12, t7, t25, t35, t25, t31, t33, t18, t16, t35, t28, t30, t9, t23, t30, t16, t13, t4, t30.\n\nI need to see if these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, I have two options, as above. Let me pick one and see if the string can be built from that.\n\nFirst, consider S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Let's see what NT73 and NT20 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT73 can produce:\n- NT62 NT27 (I think, looking at the productions, I see NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27)\nAnd NT20 can produce:\n- NT27 NT68 (from the grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68).\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nThen for NT73: the productions are listed, but looking for NT73, the user provided the list. Let me scan through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT73, I see:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nYes, so NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nNT20 is in the list. The user provided all the productions, so looking for NT20, the productions are:\n- NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68\n- NT20 \u2192 t16 (from the grammar lines: `NT20 -> NT27 NT68`, `NT20 -> t16`. Wait, no, looking again, is that correct? Let me check: Oh, no, in the list, I see NT20 \u2192 t16, that's correct. Because under NT44, it says `NT44 -> 't4'`, and so on. Wait, looking for NT20: One of the productions is `NT20 -> NT27 NT68`, and another is `NT20 -> t16`. So, that's a crucial point.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which is (NT73) followed by (NT20). Now, each of these can produce either a non-terminal or a terminal. So, let's see:\n\nFirst, the initial step is S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nThen, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and NT20 \u2192 t16. So, after the first step, the derivation would be NT62 NT27 t16.\n\nBut wait, that's only the start. Let me think about how the parsing works. Each time, a non-terminal can be expanded, but in this case, perhaps we need to consider that the entire string must be derived from S, and each step must generate the correct terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step, seeing if each terminal can be matched by the productions, and ensuring that the non-terminals can be expanded appropriately.\n\nWait, but given the length of the string, maybe it's better to approach this by building the parse tree and seeing if it fits within the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach with memoization or something, but that might be too time-consuming manually.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each production step reduces the number of non-terminals. So, starting with S, each time we expand a non-terminal, we replace it with either terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a stack-based approach where we start at S and see if we can produce the string by matching the top symbols.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nFirst, let me check if all the terminals in the string are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see terminals like t1, t2, t3, up to t35, t36, t4, etc., which include all the terminals in the string. So, that's good.\n\nNow, each occurrence of a non-terminal must be able to generate the corresponding terminals in the string.\n\nLet me try to see if I can match the string from the start.\n\nThe first token is t6. So, to get t6, we must have a production where a non-terminal directly produces t6. Looking at the grammar, I see NT64 \u2192 t17, NT44 \u2192 t4, NT68 \u2192 t14, NT49 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t29, NT99 \u2192 t10, NT35 \u2192 t3, etc. Wait, is there an NT that directly produces t6?\n\nLooking through the list: I see NT49 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t29, which doesn't produce t6. Let me check all:\n\nWait, in the user provided grammar, the direct productions for terminals are:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t14\nNT20 \u2192 t16\nNT27 \u2192 t33\nNT62 \u2192 t24\nNT53 \u2192 t11\nNT96 \u2192 t27\nNT49 appears in several productions, but does it directly produce t6? Wait, no, looking through all the direct productions, I don't see a production for t6. Wait, t6 is not directly a terminal in the grammar. Wait, that's a problem because in the string, we have t6, but in the grammar, looking at the direct productions, I don't see any that produce t6. So that's immediately a problem.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar lines, under NT35, there's a production like NT35 \u2192 t5, and NT39 \u2192 t6, which is not correct because in the user's grammar, the line is:\n\nIn the user's grammar, here's a line: NT35 -> t3 (multiple times), and others like NT39->t6 is not present. Wait, in the user's provided grammar, do I see any NT that directly produces t6?\n\nLooking at the entire grammar provided by the user:\n\nYes, here's a line: NT99 -> t10, but nowhere does a non-terminal directly produce t6. Only terminals that are part of the grammar have t1, t2, etc., but no t6 is directly produced by any NT. So, this suggests that the grammar, as provided, does not have any production that directly yields t6, which is present in the string. \n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because there's no production for terminal t6. That would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed a line. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the user-provided grammar:\n\n- I see NT35 can produce t3, t5, but no t6.\n- NT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96 (both non-terminals)\n- NT38 \u2192 't36', which is a terminal, so yes, 't36' is present.\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't9', etc.\n- NT64 \u2192 't17'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16', etc.\n\nNo, 't6' doesn't appear as a direct terminal production.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I notice that most rules are in the form of two non-terminals, but some have terminals. For example, NT38 \u2192 't36' is a rule where a non-terminal produces a terminal. So this grammar is in CNF because all non-terminals produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: it starts with t30 and ends with t37. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I think I can use a parsing approach, possibly checking if each terminal in the string can be derived through the rules.\n\nBut parsing an entire string step by step might be time-consuming. Maybe I can approach this by looking for each terminal in the production rules and see how they can be combined. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is binary, which might help in breaking down the string.\n\nLooking at the string, each part is separated by spaces, so it's a list of terminals. I'll need to see if each terminal in this list can be found in the grammar or if it can be derived through a series of rules.\n\nLet's start with the first terminal, t30. Looking at the rules, t30 appears as NT8 \u2192 't30'. So, to produce t30, the starting symbol S must derive into NT8 eventually. Wait, let me check the starting productions. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So S must produce one of these two, which are both combinations of NTs. Therefore, the initial step would involve NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nBut t30 is in S, so how does S lead to t30? Let's see the derivation steps. If S \u2192 NT73 NT20, then NT73 and NT20 need to produce the rest of the string. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT95 NT83 could also be a path. I think I should consider both possibilities, but perhaps the string has enough information to guide the path.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, the first term is t30. t30 appears in NT8 \u2192 't30', as I mentioned. So perhaps the derivation somewhere needs to split into NT8 and the other non-terminal? But wait, S splits into two non-terminals, so each step splits each non-terminal into two more, or into a terminal.\n\nLet's try to reconstruct a possible derivation from the start, given the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if each terminal can be obtained by some non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as reverse engineering. The string is a sequence of terminals, so starting from the end and working backward to the start might be more efficient, considering the string is long.\n\nLet's look at the last part of the string: t37. In the rules, I see NT82 \u2192 't5', but t5 isn't relevant here. Wait, looking for t37. There are multiple rules that produce 't37'. For instance, NT82 \u2192 't5' isn't it? Wait, checking the rules, I see:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT39 \u2192 't6'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't37' as well, wait, no, checking again. Looking through the rules, I see NT35 has two productions: one is NT49 \u2192 't9' and NT35 \u2192 't3', and NT35 \u2192 't13'. Wait, sorry, no, perhaps I mixed up the rules.\n\nLooking more carefully at the rules for NT35: I see NT35 \u2192 't3' and NT35 \u2192 't13', but not t37. Hmm, perhaps I missed that. Wait, let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see t37 on the right-hand side, except maybe in other non-terminals. Wait, maybe NT27 \u2192 't37' is one of the rules? No, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT37: it has productions like NT85 \u2192 't73' and others, but more importantly, perhaps some other NTs produce t37. Oh, I see: NT96 \u2192 't37', but that's in NT96 \u2192 't37'. So NT96 can produce t37.\n\nWait, but in the rules provided, I see:\n\nWait, let me list all the rules where a non-terminal expands to a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the rules given:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT99 \u2192 't22'\n- NT90 \u2192 't38'\n- NT47 \u2192 't27'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 't13'\n- NT39 \u2192 't6'\n- NT11 \u2192 't37'\n- NT95 \u2192 't18'\n- NT39 \u2192 't5'\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT96 \u2192 't20'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT49 \u2192 't23'\n- NT88 \u2192 't28'\n- NT37 \u2192 't31'\n- NT95 \u2192 't35'\n- NT8 \u2192 't30'\n- NT64 \u2192 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\n- NT49 \u2192 't9'\n- NT88 \u2192 't28'\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\n- NT84 \u2192 't1'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT96 \u2192 't27'\n- NT88 \u2192 't27'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT62 \u2192 't24'\n- NT53 \u2192 't11'\n- NT96 \u2192 't37'\n- NT20 \u2192 't1'\n- NT53 \u2192 't23'\n- NT27 \u2192 't33'\n- NT62 \u2192 't36'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT49 \u2192 't0'\n- NT99 \u2192 't16'\n- NT27 \u2192 't27'\n- NT49 \u2192 't2' (Wait, is that correct? Let me check.)\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals, and others produce two non-terminals. So, to get a terminal string, we need to find a path where each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that directly outputs that terminal.\n\nSo, for the string, each token must be matched by some production chain starting from the grammar.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, every step in the derivation appends either two non-terminals or a terminal. But to get a terminal string, each step must eventually produce a terminal, and these are concatenated as per the string.\n\nGiven that the grammar is a context-free grammar, perhaps the string can be represented as a series of such productions.\n\nBut instead of trying to derive the entire string, perhaps it's easier to note that each terminal in the string must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string's last part: the last token is t37. From the rules, I see that NT96 \u2192 't37'. So, we need to have a path that produces t37 via NT96.\n\nThen, before that, the second last token is t17. Let's see which non-terminals produce t17. Looking through the rules, I see NT64 \u2192 't17' and NT47 \u2192 't4', but t17 comes from NT64. So, we'd need a non-terminal that produces t17.\n\nBut wait, let me check: looking at the rules, I see NT64 \u2192 't8' and others, but also NT26 \u2192 't20', but I'm looking for t17.

{"custom_id":"request-561","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols followed by 't' and numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF looks like. CNF is a set of production rules where each rule left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two terminal symbols or two non-terminals. Importantly, no single production generates more than two symbols, and there are no epsilon productions (rules that produce nothing). So, each step in the derivation replaces one non-terminal with exactly two symbols.\n\nThe given string is: `t27 t14 t33 t3 t16 t4 t20 t24 t5 t2 t7 t24 t37 t25 t31 t20 t35 t28 t1 t29 t22 t17 t3 t7 t14 t3 t11 t2 t7`. So, it's a series of 't' followed by numbers\u2014probably the terminals of the grammar. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that many non-terminals have productions that expand into two other non-terminals, except for those that expand directly into terminals. Also, some non-terminals only have productions that might not be directly useful unless they can reach a terminal string.\n\nThe first step is to parse the string from the start symbol 'S'. The grammar starts with S producing NT52 and NT73 or NT95 and NT83. So, the initial symbols are S -> NT52 NT73 or S-> NT95 NT83. But looking at the string, the first symbol is 't27', which I need to see if it's reachable via some non-terminals after expanding.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to parse the string in reverse. Since each production in CNF can produce at most two symbols, the string can be built from the start symbol by repeatedly breaking down into two parts each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. But since the grammar is given in CNF, the CYK algorithm can efficiently determine whether the string is in the language.\n\nBut maybe I should first map the terminals in the string to their possible sources in the grammar. Let's go through each term:\n\nThe string is:\nt27, t14, t33, t3, t16, t4, t20, t24, t5, t2, t7, t24, t37, t25, t31, t20, t35, t28, t1, t29, t22, t17, t3, t7, t14, t3, t11, t2, t7.\n\nEach 't' followed by numbers likely corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Let's see which non-terminals produce these terminals. Looking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3', 't13', 't5', etc.\n- NT49 -> 't3', 't9', etc.\n- NT64 -> 't17', 't24', etc.\n- NT12 -> 't11', 't2', etc.\n- NT20 -> 't14', 't17', 't20', etc.\n- NT44 -> 't4', 't11', 't16', etc.\n- NT68 -> 't0', 't14', etc.\n- NT26 -> 't20', 't2', etc.\n- NT37 -> 't29', 't31', etc.\n- NT99 -> 't10', 't37', 't16', etc.\n- NT24 -> 't25', 't28', etc.\n- NT47 -> 't27', 't2', etc.\n- NT53 -> 't11', etc.\n- NT88 -> 't28', etc.\n- NT9 -> 't10', etc.\n\nWait, some terminals are 't' followed by digits. I should see if each terminal can be derived by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT99 can produce 't10' and 't37', 't16', etc. So, 't10' comes from NT99.\n- 't27' can come from NT47, which has the rule NT47 -> NT8 NT44, which in turn NT44 can go to 't4' or other non-terminals, but wait, looking back:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, some terminals are directly produced. For example:\n\n- NT37 -> 't29', 't31', etc.\n- NT47 -> 't27', 't2', etc. So, NT47 can produce 't27' via the rule NT47 -> 't27' NT2? No, looking again:\n\nWait, in the rules, NT47 has two rules:\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\nNT47 -> NT49 NT26\n\nLooking for NT47, does it have a production that directly produces a terminal? No. Both rules produce NT44 and NT26. Then, maybe NT44 or NT26 can produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT44:\nNT44 -> NT45 NT45\nAh, both rules for NT44 are producing further non-terminals, so it can't produce a terminal itself. Similarly, NT26 has NT6 and NT20, which can produce terminals.\n\nWait, let's look at NT99's rules:\nNT99 -> NT38 NT62, etc. For example, it also has:\nNT99 -> NT22 NT4, which has 't22' but 't4' is a terminal. But wait, 't22' is a terminal, but 't4' is also. So, NT99 can produce 't22 t4'?\n\nWait, no, each production is a pair of symbols. So, if I have a production S -> NT52 NT73, then to produce a string, NT52 and NT73 would each need to derive a terminal string.\n\nIf NT52 produces a terminal string, say 't7', and NT73 produces 't27', then together they would make 't7 t27'. But looking at the given string, it starts with t27 t14... So maybe the first part comes from a different NT.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, looking for possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for the start symbol S, which can be NT52 and NT73 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the string can be divided into two parts: one derived from NT52 and the other from NT73, or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe first part: t27 t14 t33 t3 t16 t4 t20 t24 t5 t2 t7 t24 t37 t25 t31 t20 t35 t28 t1 t29 t22 t17 t3 t7 t14 t3 t11 t2 t7.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built from left to right by applying productions. Since S has two non-terminals, each left as a separate branch.\n\nSo, the idea is that each non-terminal can produce a sequence of terminals through a series of productions.\n\nPerhaps starting from S, we have two branches: one for NT52 and one for NT73, or one for NT95 and one for NT83.\n\nI need to see which of these start points can generate the corresponding part of the string.\n\nLet's check the first symbol: t27. So, in the NT52 branch or NT73 branch.\n\nLooking at NT52's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT52 has several rules:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\nNT52 -> NT80 NT47\nNT52 -> NT12 NT85\nNT52 -> NT88 NT24\nNT52 -> NT52 NT90 \u2192 Wait, that's a left-recursive rule, which complicates things. But perhaps it's better to follow the productions that reach terminals.\n\nWait, let's list all NT52 production rules:\n\n1. NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n2. NT52 -> NT80 NT47\n3. NT52 -> NT12 NT85\n4. NT52 -> NT88 NT24\n5. NT52 -> NT52 NT90 \u2192 this is problematic, as it can cause infinite recursion.\n\nBut perhaps in CNF, all productions are non-left-recursive, so maybe this was a typo, or perhaps it's properly considered.

{"custom_id":"request-559","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step because I'm still new to this.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It's all the S productions and the NT productions. I notice that every production seems to be a non-terminal generating two other non-terminals, except when a terminal is reached, indicated by 't' followed by a number. Each production is of the form NT -> NT NT, which is typical for a Chomsky normal form grammar.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t33 t1 t23 t29 t37 t17 t13 t17 t18 t11 t25 t18 t33 t2 t14 t1 t35 t35 t13 t33 t20 t33 t9 t4 t2 t18 t14 t9 t23`. It looks like each token starts with 't' followed by a number, which corresponds to terminal symbols.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach terminals. So, the strategy here is to parse the string from the leaves (terminals) up to the root (start symbol S) by decomposing the string into possible derivation steps.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their productions for clarity:\n\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n- S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nFor NT73:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n\nAnd NT12:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT35 NT96\n- NT12 \u2192 NT85 NT55\n- NT12 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT12 \u2192 NT44 NT99\n- NT12 \u2192 NT95 NT39\n- NT12 \u2192 NT27 NT20\n\nWait, NT20 appears in the string as well, so I should track any NT20 productions.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this from the end. The string ends with t23, which is a terminal. Let's see where that can come from. Looking at the grammar, the only NT that directly produces a 't' is NT26, NT27, etc. But in the given grammar, I see NT26 \u2192 't20', and NT27 has several productions ending in t's.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals are:\n\n- t33, t1, t23, t29, t37, t17, t13, t18, t11, t25, t18, t33, t2, t14, t1, t35, t35, t13, t33, t20, t33, t9, t4, t2, t18, t14, t9, t23.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, the string has 27 tokens.\n\nI think a better approach is to model this as a parse tree and see if the string can be derived. Since the string is provided, perhaps the best way is to build the parse tree from bottom up.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use dynamic programming for parsing, similar to the CYK algorithm. But since this is a more straightforward case, perhaps I can try to break down the string into possible segments that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate the parsing step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, the first step is to choose which production to use.\n\nLooking at the string, the first word is t33. So, perhaps it comes from a production that starts with NT73 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check each production for NT73, NT95, etc.\n\nStarting with NT73:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 or NT12 NT47.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT73 NT20 would produce the sequence of two productions.\n\nBut in the string, the first word is t33, which is the result of a non-terminal production. Let's see which non-terminals produce t33.\n\nLooking through all productions, t33 appears in NT62 (as NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT6?), but actually, looking at the original grammar, I see:\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT27 (from somewhere?

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string to check is a sequence of terminals: t1 t29 t28 t1 t20 t6 t24 t5 t33 t25 t13 t22 t9 t3 t7 t2 t28 t2 t25 t31 t14 t16 t12 t31 t3 t12 t22 t22 t17 t16.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right using the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-580","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because each production rule either directly produces a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. The starting symbol is S, and the productions for S are S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So, S always expands into a combination of two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals, like NT73, NT95, etc., have their own productions. \n\nLooking at NT73, I see it can produce either 't36' or 't12' (from other rules, but I notice NT73 has two entries: one for NT73 -> NT12 NT47 and another for NT73 -> 't36') Wait, no, looking more carefully, the NT73 production is in the list of rules. Let me parse each rule correctly.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is presented as a list of production rules, each line being a rule. Each production is of the form A -> B C or A -> t, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo each line is a production. So I need to parse each production correctly.\n\nStarting with S, which has two productions:\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\nI need to see if the given string can be derived from S.\n\nThe string is: t17 t13 t35 t4 t33 t12 t3 t13 t2 t35 t17 t33 t11 t36 t28 t11 t22 t12 t0 t12 t17 t11 t16 t24 t13 t6 t0 t16 t17 t2.\n\nThat's a long string with 32 tokens. Since each production can only produce two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must correspond to a derivation where each step appends two non-terminals, which are then expanded further until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be matched.\n\nBut given the length, maybe it's complex to do manually. Alternatively, perhaps we can work backwards: process the string and see if we can reduce it step by step according to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the production rules.\n\nEach production either directly produces a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. So, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until the leaves are terminals.\n\nLet me list all the production rules:\n\nS:\nNT73 \u2192 NT73 NT20 (Wait no, that can't be. Wait, looking back, S has two rules:\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nWait no, that's the first two lines after S. So the initial S productions are each of the form S \u2192 NTX NTY.\n\nWait for example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which means S is split into NT73 and NT20, each of which are non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, the first step is to pick which of S's production to use. Let's assume we can choose either, but given that the string starts with 't17', which likely comes from a production of NT17 to t17, we need to find a path that leads to that.\n\nWait looking for 't17' in the grammar rules, I see NT96 \u2192 't96'? Wait no, actually, looking through the rules, I see lines like:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't17', so token 't17' comes from NT20. Similarly, I see NT17 \u2192 't17', but wait, looking through the rules: \n\nWait, wait the rules include:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't17' (line: NT20 -> 't17'),\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 't12' (line: NT12 -> 't12').\n\nBut wait, checking the rules, I see:\n\nFor example,\n\nNT68 \u2192 't14',\n\nNT44 \u2192 't4',\n\nand so on.\n\nBut I need to trace how 't17' is produced. So, let's see which NT can produce 't17'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- Line: NT20 \u2192 't17'\n\n- Line: NT12 \u2192 't12'\n\n- Line: NT99 \u2192 't16'\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 't17'. So the token 't17' comes from NT20. So in the string, whenever we have 't17', it must come from an NT20 production.\n\nSimilarly, the string starts with 't17', so the first step is NT20 \u2192 t17.\n\nBut wait, NT20 is in S's production as S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So S splits into NT95 and NT83. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which would split into NT73 and NT20. So the first production after S would need to split into NT20 somewhere in the tree.\n\nBut perhaps the string can be processed by finding all the 't's and seeing if they can originate from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive approach, starting from the string and applying grammar rules in reverse.\n\nEach time, I look for a part of the string that matches a rule, replace it with the left-hand side (a non-terminal), and repeat until I reach the start symbol S.\n\nThis is known as the top-down parsing approach.\n\nFor example, let's see: the string is a sequence of terminals. So, starting from the entire string, we can look for any production that produces a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces a terminal or splits into two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the first step is to find any 't's that can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't17'. According to the rules, NT20 \u2192 't17', so 't17' can come from NT20. So, in the parsing, 't17' can be replaced by NT20.\n\nSo, string becomes: NT20 followed by the rest: t13 t35 t4 t33 t12 t3 t13 t2 t35 t17 t33 t11 t36 t28 t11 t22 t12 t0 t12 t17 t11 t16 t24 t13 t6 t0 t16 t17 t2.\n\nWait no, the entire string is being processed. Let me correct: initially, the string is 't17 t13 ...' So if 't17' is matched by NT20, then the first part is 't17' \u2192 NT20. So the string is now split into NT20 and the rest of the string.\n\nSo new string is: NT20, t13 t35 t4 t33 t12 t3 t13 t2 t35 t17 t33 t11 t36 t28 t11 t22 t12 t0 t12 t17 t11 t16 t24 t13 t6 t0 t16 t17 t2.\n\nWait no, actually, when replacing 't17' with NT20, the entire string is NT20 followed by the rest. So the string becomes [NT20] [t13 t35 ...].\n\nNow, this new string has to be parsed further. We look for other terminals in this new string. The next token is 't13'. Let's see if 't13' can be matched.\n\nLooking through the rules, do any NT produce 't13'? Scanning the rules, I don't immediately see a production for 't13'. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, checking all the production rules, I don't see any NT that produce 't13'. So perhaps this path is invalid. Alternatively, I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37, etc., but do any NT produce 't13'?\n\nLooking through all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n\n- NT95 \u2192 t18\n\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t3\n\n- NT64 \u2192 t17\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t22\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t11\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t14\n\n- NT11 \u2192 t12\n\n- NT35 \u2192 t5 (wait, is that a separate production?

Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit because all productions either expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t29 t22 t36 t23 t36 t35 t30 t16 t33 t17 t22 t13 t7 t13 t10 t1 t20 t1 t22 t0 t1 t22 t24 t23 t6 t28 t36 t14 t20 t4 t12\n\nWait, that's a lot of symbols. So each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The non-terminals are everything else like S, NT52, NT71, etc.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, so every derivation must start from S. The possible productions for S are NT73 NT20 and NT95 NT83. So the string should, in theory, expand from S into these non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at each part of the string and see how it can be broken down.\n\nLooking at the start: t29. So the first part of the string is t29. In the grammar, there's a rule NT29? Wait, no, let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT26 \u2192 t20, NT24 \u2192 t25, but I don't see any production for NT29 \u2192 t29. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' is in the end.\n\nWait, actually, for NT26, it's NT26 \u2192 't20'.

Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' is there?\n\nWait, yes: \"NT22 -> 't22'\". So NT22 directly produces t22.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string: the second symbol is t22, which could have come from NT22.\n\nSo the first two symbols are t29 and t22. Let's see: t29 must come from somewhere. Looking at the productions for non-terminals, I don't see a direct production for NT29.

{"custom_id":"request-596","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, but they're a bit complex. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in an (unsigned) Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided has productions in this form, with different non-terminals (like S, NT52, etc.) and terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to check is: `t28 t0 t3 t9 t20 t9 t18 t22 t23 t12 t9 t18 t31 t25 t7 t7 t7 t0 t30 t27 t4 t10 t20 t6 t7 t7 t20 t3 t33 t16 t22`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can approach this by building the string using the productions, ensuring that each step follows the rules.\n\nI'm thinking of using the CYK algorithm, which is effective for membership testing in CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm checks whether the input string can be generated by the grammar by filling out a table that tracks the possible non-terminals at each step based on the substrings of the string.\n\nLet's list out the terminals in the string: t28, t0, t3, t9, t20, t9, t18, t22, t23, t12, t9, t18, t31, t25, t7, t7, t7, t0, t30, t27, t4, t10, t20, t6, t7, t7, t20, t3, t33, t16, t22.\n\nI'll need to construct the CYK table. The first step is to initialize the table with dimensions (length of string)x(length of string). Each cell CY[i][j] will represent the possible non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nGiven the string length is 32, the table will be 32x32. That's a lot, but perhaps there are patterns or common non-terminals in the grammar that can help simplify the process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar has a structure that allows certain sequences to be built up step by step. For example, many productions end with certain terminals. Looking through the productions, I see that many end in 't' followed by numbers like t3, t7, etc.\n\nI should look for the start symbol S and see what productions it can take. From the grammar, S has two productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo S generates a string that starts with what NT73 can derive followed by what NT20 can derive. Now, let's see what NT73 and NT20 can do.\n\nLooking at NT73's productions:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\nNT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\nNT73 \u2192 NT27 NT36\nNT73 \u2192 NT36 NT73\nNT73 \u2192 NT33 NT16\nNT73 \u2192 NT24 NT22\nNT73 \u2192 NT90 NT39\nNT73 \u2192 NT53 NT44\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\nNT73 \u2192 NT44 NT52\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT24\nNT73 \u2192 NT90 NT39\nNT73 \u2192 NT27 NT37\nNT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\nNT73 \u2192 NT47 NT73\nNT73 \u2192 NT24 NT22\n\nWait, I notice some repetitions here, like NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 appears twice. Also, looking at the NT73 productions, some end with longer steps, like NT90, which in turn can produce other non-terminals. This seems complex, but maybe we can track how the terminals appear in the string.\n\nFor NT20, looking at the productions, NT20 \u2192 NT68, and NT20 \u2192 't7' in another production, as well as NT68 \u2192 't14', and NT4 \u2192 't11', and so on. Hmm, maybe I can follow through the possible derivations.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal corresponds to a terminal production. The length of the string should be 2^k for some k, but the given string is 32 characters, which is 2^5, so maybe that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions that expand into the given string. Since the string is quite long, perhaps there's a structured approach.\n\nAnother idea: For each terminal in the string, find what non-terminals can produce it. Then try to build a derivation tree that matches the string.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with t28, which is in the productions. Let's check where t28 comes from. Looking at the grammar, I see NT28 isn't a non-terminal, but in the productions, t28 is present under NT27 as part of a production. Wait, looking for 't28' in the productions, I see NT27 \u2192 't24' and some others. Wait, maybe t28 comes from a production where the string is t27 followed by something else, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for how terminals are derived. For example, t28 is a terminal, but in the grammar, is there a production where t28 appears? Looking through the grammar symbols, I don't see any production that directly leads to t28. Hmm, that might be a problem because t28 is in the string but not directly derivable from any non-terminal in the grammar. That could mean the string can't be derived, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The productions show t28 as part of NT28? No, NT28 isn't in the productions. Let me look through the productions again:\n\nLooking for anything with 't28', but I see t28 is in the NT27 productions as:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't33' NT16, and other combinations. Wait, maybe t28 comes from NT27's other productions. Let me check the first part of the string:\n\nThe first terminal is t28. So, can NT27 produce t28? Looking through the productions, I don't see NT27 deriving a terminal 't28'. All NT27 productions seem to derive combinations of non-terminals or t's like t24, t33, etc. So, perhaps the first terminals in the string can't be derived because there's no production that leads to t28. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Scanning the productions again:\n\nLooking through each NT's productions, I don't see any that directly produce 't28'. For example, NT27 has rules like NT27 \u2192 't33' NT16, and others, but none that produce 't28'. So, the first symbol in the string is t28, but there's no production for that from any non-terminal. Hence, the string can't be derived.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with the terminal 't28', but there are no non-terminals in the grammar that directly produce 't28'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has multiple production rules for non-terminals (NT followed by a number, like NT52, NT71, etc.). Each non-terminal seems to be split into two other non-terminals, except for some that produce terminals (like 't36'), which are the leaves of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: `t28 t1 t30 t22 t20 t24 t0 t4 t6 t14 t6 t20 t13 t4 t35 t13 t6 t5 t17 t14 t4 t11 t29 t7 t7 t6 t9 t2 t35 t22 t3 t36`.

{"custom_id":"request-617","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'll start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember has productions where each RHS is two non-terminals or a terminal. The string in question is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar's start symbol, which is S.\n\nThe string is: t2 t29 t11 t35 t29 t17 t2 t27 t25 t14 t1 t11 t18 t28 t5 t1 t30 t36 t25 t20 t30 t9 t9 t31 t0 t27 t23 t13 t36 t16 t20 t18.\n\nHmm, that's a pretty long string with 33 tokens. I know that in CNF, the parsing uses a method akin to the CYK algorithm, where we track possible non-terminals at each step based on the current substring. But parsing can be time-consuming, especially for longer strings. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string into parts that might correspond to the rules in the grammar, working my way from the start symbol S down to the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo the string must start with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Let me check the string. The first token is t2. I need to see if any NT can produce t2. Looking through the grammar rules, I see NT22 -> NT44 NT63, and NT22 has a production that eventually might lead to t22, but wait, NT22 might also produce t27 in some cases. Actually, I should check each NT rule for possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the rules, some NTs directly produce a single 't' like NT26 -> 't20', NT2 -> 't22', NT4 -> 't11', NT68 -> 't14', etc. So I should identify all NTs that produce single 't's.\n\nLet me list all NTs that directly expand to a single 't':\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT2 -> 't22'\n- NT4 -> 't11'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT35 -> 't13' (Wait, no, correction: NT35 appears in multiple rules, but some expand to 't3' and others to other NTs)\nWait, I need to be careful. NT35 is defined in multiple places. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT35:\n- NT35 -> NT51 NT37\n- NT35 -> NT49 NT37\n- NT35 -> NT64 NT90\n- NT49 -> NT2 NT95\n- NT37 -> NT85 NT55\n- NT64 -> 't17'\n- NT90 -> NT38 NT95\n- NT47 -> NT8 NT44\n- NT55 -> 't17'\n\nHmm, so NT35 can produce 't17' via NT64 and NT90: Wait, no. NT35 has a production like NT35 -> NT64 NT90. But NT90 in another production is NT90 -> NT38 NT95. So perhaps that's not directly a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by seeing which productions result in 't' terminals directly, as those can serve as the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nLet me go through each production's RHS:\n\n- S -> NT73 NT20: So NT73 and NT20 must produce the string. But looking at NT20: NT20 -> NT27 NT68, and NT27 -> 't33' or other NTs. So it's not a single 't'.\n\n- S -> NT95 NT83: NT95 needs to produce the first part, and NT83 the next. Check NT95: NT95 is in several rules. For example, NT95 -> 't18' (looking through the rules: no, wait, NT95 appears as 't35', 't9', etc. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all NTs that can produce a single 't'. Let me scan each rule:\n\nLooking for NT -> 'tXXX':\n\n- NT2 -> 't22'\n- NT4 -> 't11'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT12 -> 't11' (Wait, does NT12 have a rule that produces t12?)\nWait, looking at NT12: In the rules, I see NT12 -> 't11' (from NT73 -> NT12 NT47, but NT73 also has production NT12 -> 't11').\n\nWait, let me go through all the productions:\n\n- NT73 appears in several rules, but none directly produce 't's except in some rules like NT73 -> NT62 NT27, but that doesn't expand to 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT rules that produce a single 't' as their terminal:\n\nLooking at each rule in the grammar:\n\n- NT52 -> 't8'? No, NT52 is 't7' in some rules. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking down the list:\n\nSearch for any NT with a rule ending in something -> 'tXXXX':\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT52 -> NT35 NT96: no t's.\n- NT71 -> NT68 NT2: NT68 is t14, NT2 is t22. So yes, NT71 can generate products where some of the right-hand sides produce t's.\n\nWait, NT71 is in the production NT73 -> NT71 NT47. Wait, no, that's part of a larger production, but I should look for NTs that themselves have production to t's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead look for each NT and see which rules produce single 't's.\n\nLooking term by term:\n\nLooking for rules where RHS is one 't' and another NT or the other way:\n\nWait, in the rules, for example, NT26 -> 't20' (yes), that's a terminal. Similarly:\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT2 -> 't22'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT4 -> 't11'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT35 -> 't3' and other t's? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all NTs with rules directly expanding to a single 't'.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT26 -> 't20' \u2192 yes.\n- NT2 -> 't22' \u2192 yes.\n- NT4 -> 't11' \u2192 yes.\n- NT68 -> 't14' \u2192 yes.\n- NT11 -> 't12' \u2192 yes.\n- NT35 appears in several rules but I don't see any -> 't'.\n- Hmm, wait, other NTs:\n\nWait, let me check all NTs:\n\n- NT73: rule 1 is NT73 -> NT62 NT27; another rule is NT73 -> NT12 NT47. Not t's.\n- NT71: rule is NT71 -> NT68 NT2. NT68 is t14, NT2 is t22. So NT71 can produce t14 t22.\n- NT52: rule is NT52 -> NT35 NT96. Both NT35 and NT96 are NT's.\n- NT99: several rules. For example, NT99 -> NT49 NT37; but in other rules, NT99 can produce t's. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking again through all the rules, let's find any that have a terminal as something:\n\n- NT99 has a rule: NT99 -> 't10' (yes, last line before the list of rules). Wait, looking at the grammar's rules: \n\nLooking for any rule that ends with -> 'tXXX':\n\n- NT99 -> 't10' (Yes, looking at the end of the list: NT99 -> 't10'.\n- NT20 -> 't17' (Wait, no.

Hmm, the string is: t6 t37 t5 t18 t36 t17 t35 t7 t22 t6 t3 t27 t7 t0 t23 t31 t2 t14 t2 t20 t5 t0 t28 t14 t17 t17 t3 t35 t30 t0 t28 t17 t17.\n\nFirst, I remember that each of these grammar productions starts with S and breaks down into non-terminals (NTs) and terminals (t's). The end symbols, like 't0', 't1', etc., are directly written into the string. The non-terminals need to be rewritten until we reach the terminals only.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's all in CNF, which means each rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two on the right, or a single terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So in this case, all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nSo the process would involve starting from S and trying to derive the string step by step, replacing non-terminals with their right-hand sides until we only have terminals left, checking if it matches the given string.\n\nBut given the length, it's going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the structure of the string and see if it could fit together using the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, each non-terminal seems to correspond to a specific sequence of 't's. For example, NT52 seems to produce a certain 't's, and so on. Maybe I can reverse-engineer the possible derivation path.\n\nWait, the string starts with t6. So I need a production for some NT that ends with t6. Looking at the grammar, the production NT49 \u2192 t4 and t9? Or wait, no, looking at the rules, I need to find which NTs can produce t6.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT39 \u2192 t6.

For the string, each 't' follows a path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the tree structure. Each step in the derivation adds more symbols until the string is fully expanded.\n\nBut given the length of the string, and the fact that each production is context-free with two non-terminals, the number of steps would be O(n), but with a context-free grammar, the number of possible derivations could be huge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a series of terminals, each corresponding to a path in the grammar. Each 't' in the string must come from a production that directly produces that 't'. So for each 't', I can check which NTs produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list each NT that can produce each 't' followed by the 't's and what NT they produce.\n\nFor example:\n\nt6: From NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37, and NT51 has t17, but I'm confused. Wait, perhaps I should look up each 't' and see which NT it comes from.\n\nt6: Looking at the rules, NT39's right-hand side is NT51 and NT37, and I don't see any NT that produces t6 directly except maybe NT39 itself? Wait, looking back:\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n\nBut looking for 't6', I need to see which NTs directly generate it. Let me go through the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules for each NT:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT85 NT55\n- NT55 \u2192 t17\n- NT85 \u2192 NT74 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- NT47 \u2192 NT8 NT44\n- NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- NT30 \u2192 t1 or others? Let me check.\n\nLooking for 't's, each occurs only in specific NTs. For example, NT30 is t1? Let me see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking at NT96 \u2192 t20, t27, etc.\n\nBut wait, in NT69 \u2192 t17. Wait, no, the 't's are under different NTs.\n\nFor example:\n\nt6 appears in NT39 \u2192 t6.\n\nWait, no, let me find which NTs have terminals.\n\nLooking at each rule, for example:\n\nNT44 \u2192 t4\n\nSimilarly, some NTs directly produce 't's:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t9\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules:\n\nIt seems that for some NTs, they directly produce a single 't'.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t1?

{"custom_id":"request-641","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is one of these 't' followed by a number. The grammar has production rules that break down non-terminals (NTs) into other strings, eventually leading to terminal strings made up of 't's and numbers.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be two terminals, a terminal and a non-terminal, or two non-terminals. Since all rules here are either two terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two non-terminals, I'm confident the grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string to check is: `t16 t31 t35 t13 t12 t24 t36 t17 t20 t0 t22 t7 t5 t14 t4 t28 t35 t23 t24 t35 t28 t14 t33 t27 t7 t37 t24 t22 t37 t24 t25 t22 t5`.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI remember that for strings in CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. However, since the string is fairly long, that might be tedious to do manually. Alternatively, I could try to see if each token in the string corresponds to the right-hand side of some production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, every production either ends with two terminals or includes a mix. Since all the non-terminals on the left produce two elements on the right, each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols, but in a specific pattern.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right. So the string length has to be a power of two. Let me check the string length: it's 34 tokens. 2^5 is 32, and 2^6 is 64, so 34 isn't a power of two. That\u2019s a red flag. But wait, maybe the grammar allows more complex derivations. No, in CNF, each step produces two symbols, so starting from S, which produces two symbols, then each of those can produce two, etc. So the number of symbols should be 2^n where n is the number of steps. 34 is not a power of two, so perhaps the string isn't in the language. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT73 NT20. Each NT in the grammar will eventually produce a terminal string. So the initial step gives two symbols, each of which may produce more symbols. The total number of symbols in any derived string must be a power of two, because each step doubles the number of symbols. But 34 is not a power of two. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So 34 isn't a valid length. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps the grammar allows for some other structure? No, in CNF, every production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, so each step must double the count, starting from 1 (the start symbol). Wait, actually, the start symbol S is a single non-terminal. When expanded, each production of S gives two symbols, but each symbol can further be expanded. So the length after k steps would be 2^k. The initial expansion after S is 2^1=2 symbols. After the next step, it's 2^2=4, then 8, 16, etc. If the string has 34 symbols, that's not a power of two. So that would immediately disqualify the string from being in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something? Let me count again: the input has 34 tokens. 34 isn't 2^k for any integer k, so the derivation can't produce 34 symbols. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-663","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. In CNF, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, and I see that all the provided rules follow this pattern except perhaps some where a non-terminal might expand into a terminal. Wait, no, looking closer, some rules have terminals directly, like \"NT80 -> 't7'\". Hmm, that's a bit confusing because in standard CNF, all productions must have two non-terminals, but this grammar allows some terminals, which might mean it's not in strict CNF. Maybe I need to adjust my approach here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, mostly 't' followed by numbers. I notice there are multiple 't's with different digits. Each of these could either be a terminal in the grammar or a result of non-terminals expanding into a terminal. So, I'll need to see how these 't's are produced through the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S, and S has two production rules: S -> NT73 NT20, or S -> NT95 NT83. So, any valid string must be derived from one of these two initial expansions.\n\nBreaking down the string: \"t36 t9 t5 t9 t9 t37 t35 t14 t2 t14 t9 t3 t11 t22 t10 t17 t2 t4 t27 t23 t24 t28 t25 t9 t16 t22 t9 t12 t9 t3 t1 t4 t9 t3\"\n\nEach 't' token is separated, so the string is a sequence of thirty-six terminals. My task is to see if there's a way to break this string into parts that match the productions in the grammar.\n\nStarting with S -> NT73 NT20. Let's see if the string starts with NT73 and NT20.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t36, t9, t5, t9, t9, t37, t35, t14, t2, t14, t9, t3, ...\n\nWait, but NT73 would expand into something, and so would NT20. Similarly, if S uses the other production S -> NT95 NT83, the string should start with those.\n\nLet me outline the possible steps:\n\n1. Check which initial production (S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83) the string starts with.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe first token is t36. But wait, in the grammar, S can only expand into two non-terminals. So any initial step must produce NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83, but I don't see any 't's in the first step of S's productions. Wait, looking back, the grammar has some rules where the right-hand side is two non-terminals, and others where it's a terminal. For example, NT80 -> 't7', so sometimes a non-terminal can produce a terminal.\n\nBut when S expands, it can only do so into two non-terminals. So the expansion of S starts with NT73 and NT20. Then each of these NTs must produce some sequence of terminals and non-terminals that eventually expand to the tokens in the string.\n\nWait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a path from S down to the given string, expanding each non-terminal and matching the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the string upwards, trying to match the string to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: try to reverse engineer the expansion steps. Each NT node will produce two parts, which can be terminals or non-terminals. The string is a linear sequence of tokens, and each step in the grammar's expansion must form a valid structure in the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to parse the string by starting from the beginning and using the grammar to see if each part can be matched.\n\nLet me try to write down each step.\n\nThe string is:\nt36 t9 t5 t9 t9 t37 t35 t14 t2 t14 t9 t3 t11 t22 t10 t17 t2 t4 t27 t23 t24 t28 t25 t9 t16 t22 t9 t12 t9 t3 t1 t4 t9 t3\n\nHmm, this is quite long. Let me split it into smaller sections.\n\nFirst, S starts with either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nLet me see the productions that produce the first 't36'. Maybe NT73 produces something that starts with t36? Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see any rule where NT73 is on the left leading directly to t36. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT73: It expands into NT62 and NT27, which further expand. NT73 --> NT62 NT27. Then NT62 --> NT6 NT24, etc. So t36 isn't directly produced by NT73. But looking at the string, the first token is t36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first step is S -> NT95 NT83. Let's see NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at NT95: nt95 -> nt18 nt35. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar rules, NT95's production is not shown, but in the provided rules, perhaps I missed it.

Then, maybe that NT38 is part of a larger expansion.\n\nLooking ahead, the string is t36 t9 t5 t9 t9 t37... So after t36 comes t9.

Looking at the grammar, t20 comes from NT20 \u2192 t27 or t68. Wait, no. Let me see: in the grammar, NT20 is defined as NT20 \u2192 t22 or NT38 \u2192 t29. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the grammar as presented has the NT productions. For example, some of them have 't' followed by a number, which are terminals. I need to note down all the NT productions and see which have terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all the non-terminals and their productions, then see for each t in the string whether it's reachable from the start symbol.\n\nWait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work from the start symbol and see if the string can be broken down into the productions.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be divided. The string starts with t20 t20. So looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT73 NT20, then I need to see if NT73 can produce the first part and NT20 can produce the second part.\n\nLet's see what NT73 can do. From the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 or 't36'. Similarly, NT95 \u2192 NT39 NT37 or 't18' (from the rules, S \u2192 NT95 NT83, and NT95 can go to 't18' and NT37 can go further).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the start and see possible sequences.\n\nThe string starts with t20 t20. So looking for where 't20' can come from:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 t22 or NT99 \u2192 t10 (wait, no, NT20 has a production: NT20 \u2192 t22 or NT68. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT20 having a direct production to t20. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT20 \u2192 't22' or 't68' is incorrect. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nWait, I think I misread some of the non-terminals. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nEach NT has its own productions. For example, NT73 has NT73 -> NT62 NT27 or 't36'. Similarly, NT20 can go to 't27' or NT68. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see that NT20 is in some productions, but I need to list all the NTs and their possible productions.\n\nLet me try to list all the NT productions:\n\nNT73: NT73 -> NT62 NT27 or 't36'\n\nNT71: NT71 -> NT68 NT2 or NT68 NT24?\n\nWait, no, looking again, NT71 is defined as NT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all NTs and their productions:\n\n1. NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 | 't36' (from S production)\n2. NT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2 | NT68 NT24 | NT22 NT45? Wait, no, from the grammar, looking at the non-terminals:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write down all the NTs with their rules. Let's go through the grammar step by step.\n\nThe grammar has the following rules (I'll group them by NT):\n\n- NT52: NT52 -> NT80 NT47 | NT12 NT85 | NT80 NT47 | NT52 NT35 | NT35 NT96\n- NT73: NT73 -> NT62 NT27 | 't36' | NT44 NT5 | etc. Wait, perhaps I should list each NT and their rules.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see which terminals are present in the string and check if they are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are t20, t4, t33, t33, t23, t1, t14, t23, t35, t37, t18, t7, t10, t16, t5, t13, t9, t1, t6, t16, t3, t29, t7, t12, t9, t5, t28, t30, t25, t3, t13, t16, t16.\n\nSo the distinct terminals are t1, t3, t4, t5, t7, t9, t10, t13, t14, t16, t18, t20, t23, t25, t28, t29, t30, t33, t35, t37.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some of these might not be present. Let me check the grammar's terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NTs have terminals attached as direct productions. For example:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT26 \u2192 't68' is not correct; wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think it's NT68 \u2192 't14'.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar and list all the direct terminal steps.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT38 NT24 | NT9 NT53\n  Hmm, I don't see any terminals here.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT38 can produce 't36' directly because S \u2192 NT95 NT83 and NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45, etc. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for all rules where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't36' (so this is a terminal)\n- NT99 \u2192 't10', 't1', 't16', 't27', 't12', 't9', 't5', 't28', 't30', 't25', 't3', 't13',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-675","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol which goes to two non-terminals. Or wait, actually, in CNF, the start symbol can be the only one with a single non-terminal on the right, but in this case, the start symbol S is splitting into two non-terminals each time, like NT something or other. So, the start symbol S can produce two NTs each time.\n\nThe given string is: t29 t36 t2 t23 t27 t4 t2 t11 t12 t7 t5 t24 t31 t7 t33 t29 t6 t1 t17 t23 t4 t24 t30 t22 t6 t22 t23 t1 t18 t33 t17 t16 t18 t12 t27.\n\nHmm, that's a long string with 35 tokens, I think. Each token is a 't' followed by a number. The grammar uses NT52, NT71, etc., as non-terminal symbols, and some of these have productions that eventually lead to terminals (the t tokens with numbers). My task is to see if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which may have more if it's not in CNF. But here, every rule seems to have two non-terminals on the right, except perhaps some that directly go to terminals. Wait, looking back, some of the rules for NT... have a terminal as one of their right-hand sides, like NT38 \u2192 't29', or NT2 \u2192 't22'. So actually, I need to build a parse tree where each node is either a non-terminal or a terminal, with non-terminals having only two children, other non-terminals, and terminals as leaves.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if there's a parse tree starting from S that can generate this sequence.\n\nSo, the first step is to see the overall structure. S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Then each of those NTs will split into two more NTs or terminals. Since S produces two NTs, the string must be a combination of two terminal sequences, each starting from an NT.\n\nWait, but the string given is a single sequence without any splitting point. So I need to find a way that the string is built by expanding the NTs step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me look at the string structure. It starts with t29, then t36, t2, t23, etc. Let's see if these can correspond to the expansions.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the string has 35 tokens. Since each production is binary, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n - 1 for some n, because each step doubles the number of symbols, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since S produces two NTs, the initial derivation would produce two sequences, and each step each of those could produce more, leading to a tree structure. But since the string is a linear sequence, the parsing must follow a leftmost or rightmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a leftmost derivation path.\n\nBut with 35 symbols, which is an odd number, it's a bit confusing. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64; 35 is in between, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find the parse tree by starting from the top and seeing if each part of the string can be matched.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start is S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Then each of these NTs needs to produce a certain number of terminals.\n\nLet me list some of the NTs and their productions. For example, NT38 has a production to 't29' directly, others have more NTs. So I need to see if parts of the string can be generated by these NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that each NT eventually resolves into a certain number of 't's. Since S starts as NT73 and NT20, each must generate a sequence of t's and NTs that eventually resolve to the full string.\n\nLooking at NT73, the productions are:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT36\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- NT73 \u2192 NT47 NT33\n- NT73 \u2192 NT27 NT36\n- NT73 \u2192 NT36 NT33\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar, each NT has several productions. Wait, let me check the grammar again carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the productions explicitly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can see that each line represents a production, e.g., S -> NT73 NT20. Then each NT has multiple productions, like NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to build the entire parse tree step by step, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can check whether each t in the string can be matched to a production.\n\nAlternatively, note that each production is a step where a non-terminal expands into two other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So each step increases the number of symbols by one in the derivation, but the string is the result of a full derivation from S.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, perhaps I can look for the structure by seeing if the string can be split into the correct subparts.\n\nAnother approach is to try to reconstruct a possible parse tree by considering possible splits. For example, the string starts with t29 t36, which could be part of some NT's productions.\n\nLooking at the NTs that can produce 't29': NT35 \u2192 t5, but I think that's not 't29'. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, I see that some NTs have direct terminal productions. For example, NT38 \u2192 't29', so if the string starts with t29, perhaps it's produced by NT38.\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking for NTs that lead to 't29':\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT38 \u2192 't29', so that's one possibility.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't2 t12 t17...' and so on. My goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar by following the production rules.\n\nI'll start by examining the grammar rules because it's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production is either a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example:\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT24 \u2192 't25'\n- And so on.\n\nThese terminals correspond to parts of the string we're given. So, if the string starts with 't2', I need to see if there's a production rule that allows NT?

Looking at the string 't2 t12...', each number after t is a terminal.\n\nSo, each 'tX' must come from a production where the non-terminal X (like NT? For example, NT99 might produce 't10', so NT99\u2192't10'), meaning NT99 can produce 't10'.\n\nNow, I'll try to map each 'tX' in the string back to the possible non-terminals that can produce it.\n\nLet me list the string in order: t2, t12, t17, t5, t10, t23, t36, t11, t20, t14, t25, t27, t12, t24, t13, t1, t28, t36, t30, t4, t33, t3, t7, t12, t37, t27, t7, t4, t0, t31, t3, t7, t4, t17, t17.\n\nEach 'tX' needs to be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nFor instance:\n- t2: Look for a production where NT... \u2192 't2'.

{"custom_id":"request-696","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single non-terminal symbol on the left with two terminals on the right. Wait, no, wait: in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, yes, each rule has either two non-terminals on the left or one non-terminal and a terminal, but in this case, I see that some rules have terminals directly, like NT99 -> 't0', so perhaps this is a mix.\n\nWait, but the initial productions are S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which is two non-terminals. Then each non-terminal seems to have productions that are either combinations of two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the grammar allows for strings to be built by combining these non-terminals, which eventually produce terminal strings.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of 't' terms: `t0 t29 t27 t29 t18 t20 t1 t2 t12 t18 t4 t6 t1 t20 t29 t1 t13 t31 t0 t3 t17 t16 t4 t22 t12 t9 t25 t10 t0 t35 t33 t1 t28 t37 t33 t9`. That's a pretty long string with 33 't' symbols.\n\nNow, I need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. The approach here is to see if the string can be split into the production rules of the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can consider a top-down or bottom-up parsing approach, but given the size of the string, it might be easier to parse from left to right, trying to match the symbols against the non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, each non-terminal on the left side of the production can expand into either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, working from the start symbol S, which is derived from either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83, etc. Each of these non-terminals can further split into other non-terminals or eventually into terminals.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to parse the string using the grammar's productions, starting with the entire string and recursively checking if each part can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a recursive descent parser approach. Let's think about the string's structure. The string starts with 't0', and in the grammar, there's a NT99 -> 't10' and NT35 -> 't3', etc. But wait, the first symbol in the string is 't0', and under NT99, there's 't10' if that's a possible derivation.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar, the only 't0' production I see is from NT68 -> 't14' and NT26 -> 't2', etc., but I don't see an NT rule that directly produces 't0' from a single symbol. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT47 -> 't27'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT35 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't88' -- Wait, NT6 could produce 't88'? Or wait, in the given rules, there's NT44 -> 't4', but where is 't0' being produced?\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT99 -> 't10', 't9', 't16', 't10', etc. Wait, actually, in the given rules, I'm seeing a lot of 't' strings, but I'm not seeing any NT rule that produces 't0' directly. Hmm, that's confusing because the string starts with 't0'. If no non-terminal directly produces 't0', then perhaps the string is invalid. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule NT47 -> 't27', and perhaps other rules. Let me check all 't' rules:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT47 -> 't27' (twice)\n- NT99 -> 't10', 't9', 't16'\n- NT53 -> 't11', etc.\n\nBut nowhere do I see a rule for NT99 -> 't0', or any other NT rule that directly produces 't0'. Hmm. That's a problem because the string starts with 't0', but if no non-terminal can directly produce 't0', then the string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules to make sure I didn't miss an 't0' production.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT99 -> 't10', 't9', 't16' etc.\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT38 -> 't29', 't28', 't26', 't36', 't13', 't31', 't33'\n- NT44 -> 't4', 't24'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT47 -> 't27'\n- NT53 -> 't11' etc.\n\nWait, but I don't see any NT rule that produces 't0'. So, the very first character of the string is 't0', which isn't produced by any rule, which would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar. Therefore, I must conclude that the string isn't in the language defined by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Oh, in the list of given rules, looking for 't0'\u2014wait, no, in the rules under NT, there's 't10', 't14', 't17', etc., but no 't0'. So, actually, the first symbol 't0' can't be derived from any non-terminal, so the entire string can't be generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-698","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single symbol or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is composed of several 't' followed by numbers, which might correspond to terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list out the grammar productions and the string. The grammar has a bunch of S and NT rules, all starting with S -> NT followed by another NT. Each NT can either be another NT or a terminal, which is a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking at the string: t10 t28 t1 t0 t18 t13 t23 t20 t0 t0 t16 t29 t20 t5 t24 t11 t14 t2 t22 t16 t33 t29 t25 t11 t20 t23 t5 t14 t28 t3 t11 t30 t30 t5 t17 t10.\n\nI notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So the question is whether the grammar can derive this sequence.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary tree structure where each non-terminal expands into two others. To prove the string is generated, I need to see if there's a way to break down the string into the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to represent the string as a sequence of terminal symbols and see if there's a way to match them step by step using the grammar.\n\nStarting with the top-level productions, S can only be NT52 and NT95. So S must derive to NT52NT95 or NT95NT52. Each of these NTs can then expand further into other NTs or terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with t10. Let's see which NTs can produce t10. Looking through the grammar, NT64 produces t17, NT99 produces t10, NT43 isn't in the grammar, so t10 must come from NT99.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 has several productions:\n\nNT99 -> NT38 NT62\nNT99 -> NT63 NT2\nNT99 -> NT96 NT83\nNT96 is 't20', NT83 is 't28'.\nSo, one of the expansions of NT99 is 't20 t28', which matches the first two symbols of the string: t10 t28... Wait, no, the first symbol is t10, which is from NT99, but looking at the productions, NT99 doesn't produce t10 directly. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar: NT99 has a production NT99 -> NT22 NT4? No, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, checking the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT99 -> NT38 NT62\nNT99 -> NT63 NT2\nNT99 -> NT96 NT83\n\nNone of these directly produce 't10'. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm misremembering the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT90 -> NT38 NT95, which is an internal production. But for NT99, checking the rules:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNT96 -> NT82 NT83 \u2192 which are 't5' and 't28' (I think), because NT82->'t5' and NT83->'t28'\n\nBut wait, the first symbols of the string are t10 t28. So t10 t28. Looking for a production that starts the string with t10 followed by t28.\n\nLet me see which NTs can produce t10 and t28 in sequence. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\nNT99 can produce t10? Let me check NT99 -> NT38 NT62: Does NT38 produce any terminal? Wait, in the grammar:\n\nNT38 appears multiple times as a rule. Like NT38 -> 't29' in one rule, 't36' in another, 't23' and 't31'. Wait, no, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT38 has multiple productions:\n\nNT38 -> 't29', NT38->'t36', NT38->'t23', NT38->'t27', etc. Wait, actually, let's find all NT38 productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT38 appears on the right-hand side of various productions. For example:\n\nNT82 -> NT51 NT84\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\n...\nBut focusing on NT38's productions:\n\nLooking at each rule, does NT38 ever appear on the right as a non-terminal? Yes:\n\nNT55 -> NT74 NT39\nWait, no, looking more carefully, the rules involving NT38 are:\n\nNT37 -> NT85 NT55\nNT38 -> 't29'\nNT38 -> 't36'\nNT38 -> 't23'\nNT38 -> 't27'\n\nSo NT38 can produce t29, t36, t23, or t27.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second symbol is t28, which is part of 't28' from NT83, which is derived from NT99.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t10. So I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break the string down:\n\nThe string is t10 t28 t1 t0 t18 t13 t23 t20 t0 t0 t16 t29 t20 t5 t24 t11 t14 t2 t22 t16 t33 t29 t25 t11 t20 t23 t5 t14 t28 t3 t11 t30 t30 t5 t17 t10.\n\nI need to see if each of these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with S -> NT52 NT95 or S-> NT95 NT52.\n\nLet's try S -> NT52 NT95.\n\nNT52 can produce two symbols, so let's see what NT52 can generate.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT52:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96 \u2192 't3' and 't20'? Wait, NT96 is 't20', yes.\n\nNT52 can produce t3 t20.\n\nNT52 can also produce other things, but let's check if the first two symbols are t3 t20, which would start with t3 t20... But in the string, the first two are t10 t28, so that doesn't match. So we'd have to see if there's another production for NT52 that starts with t10 t28.\n\nLooking through the NT52 productions:\n\n- NT52 -> NT49 NT37 \u2192 NT49 could be 't11', 't14', 't23', 't9', etc. Let me check NT49's rules.\n\nWait, wait. If NT52 produces NT35 and NT96, then NT35's rules:\n\nNT35 -> NT51 NT37 \u2192 but looking further down, NT35 also has:\n\nNT35 -> 't3' and NT35 has other rules like 't13', 't5', 't10', etc.\n\nSo for example, if NT52 produces 't10' and something else, perhaps.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, NT35 has a production NT35 -> 't10'. So if NT52->NT35 NT96, and NT35->'t10', and NT96->'t20', then NT52 can produce 't10 t20'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t10 t28, so that would not match 't10 t20'. So perhaps we need to look for another production for NT52.\n\nLooking further, NT52 can produce:\n\nNT52 -> NT49 NT37 \u2192 checking NT49's rules.\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6 \u2192 but NT6's rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT88 NT73 \u2192 which are 't24' and 't33'.\n\nBut in the string, the next symbols after t10 t28 would be t1, which is from NT26?

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My task is to figure out if this string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF looks like. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S. So all productions start with a single non-terminal, and each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each production is either S \u2192 NT followed by two NTs or S \u2192 NT followed by two digits (like 't36'). However, looking closer, actually, most productions are like NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT13 or similar, ending with some terminal 't' followed by numbers, like 't35' as a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t22 t13 t14 t2 t6 t27 t30 t10 t33 t2 t13 t25 t22 t13 t1 t0 t6 t4 t10 t22 t23 t20 t12 t33 t2 t16 t11 t27 t27 t23 t2 t18 t2 t28 t1 t30`.\n\nSo I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals according to the productions until all non-terminals are resolved to terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces one terminal or two non-terminals. So in the leftmost derivation, we will start from S and apply productions step by step, expanding non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string, which has 41 tokens, each token being a terminal like 't35', 't22', etc., I can think of this as a sequence where each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT73 NT20, as per the first production. So S becomes NT73 NT20. Then each NT (Non-Terminal) must be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT73: in the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. So replacing NT73 with NT62 NT27. Now the string becomes NT62 NT27 NT20.\n\nNext, NT62: looking at the productions, NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT11. So replace NT62 with NT53 NT11. Now the string is NT53 NT11 NT27 NT20.\n\nNT53: production is NT53 \u2192 NT44 NT90. So replace NT53 with NT44 NT90. Now string is NT44 NT90 NT11 NT27 NT20.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT24 NT95? Wait, looking back, let me check. The productions: NT44 has multiple productions. Let me list them all to be precise. Wait, from the given grammar snippets, I see NT44 has a production NT44 \u2192 't4' but wait, in the grammar, some NTs have multiple productions.

Each non-terminal expansion adds one non-terminal and splits into two non-terminals, so the number of symbols would increase by one each time. The initial S is one symbol, so to reach 40 terminals, we need 39 expansions. But each step can increase the number of symbols, so it's possible.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for possible structures.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol is t3. Looking if any rule leads directly to t3. Yes, NT35 and NT49 can produce t3. Now, if the first non-terminal is NT35 or NT49, and then that leads to t3.\n\nBut perhaps looking at the first few symbols:\n\nt3 t12 t3 t10 t4 t20 t2 t22 t5 t24 t24 t4 t1 t14 t13 t20 t3 t25 t25 t7 t18 t9 t37 t6 t29 t25 t20 t31 t3 t13 t4 t11 t3 t37 t27 t27 t29 t31.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the first symbol t3 can stem from a rule. If the first rule is S \u2192 NT73 NT20, but then NT73 and NT20 must generate.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps S is expanded into NT73 and NT20, each of which splits, and so on.\n\nThis might get too involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the string can be generated by tracing the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the string is in the language.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the string is not in the language, but I need to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check for the first few symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-737","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on my parsing, but let's see what I can figure out.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF looks like. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the productions don't have any other forms.\n\nThe grammar provided has non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t35 t36 t25 t9 t25 t37 t22 t33 t29 t16 t24 t25 t36 t6 t33 t16 t0 t27 t36 t12 t23 t1 t5 t4 t27 t23 t3 t10 t11 t31 t18 t6 t23 t16 t10 t30 t23 t11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive. The non-terminals range from NT52 down to NT88, etc., but I don't think I need to list all of them. Instead, I should focus on the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nIn CNF, each production either generates a single terminal or two non-terminals. Since the string is a linear sequence, the derivation must follow these two options step by step, making sure that each step either replaces a non-terminal with a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nTo start, the initial symbol is S. The grammar has two productions for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, S must be derived into either of these. Let me check if either of these leads to the given string.\n\nLooking at the first production, S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Let's see what NT73 and NT20 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT73 can produce NT62 and NT27, or 't36'.\nBut in this case, the string starts with t35, which doesn't match 't36' directly. Alternatively, if NT73 is 't36', but the first symbol is t35. So maybe this path is not leading us here.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Let's check NT95 and NT83.\n\n- NT95 can produce NT32 NT39 or 't18', but I don't see NT32 in the grammar. Wait, actually, looking back, NT35 is present, but let me check the productions again. Hmm, in the given grammar, NT95 has a production to 't18'. So if NT95 \u2192 't18', and NT83 can produce 't28', then together, the string starts with t18 t28, but the input string starts with t35 t36, so maybe that's not the right path either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go step by step.\n\nEach step in the string corresponds to a derivation. So the string has 39 tokens, which implies that each non-terminal in the grammar that's part of the derivation must be decomposed into the correct sequence of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can parse the string starting from the beginning and try to match it with the grammar. However, doing a full parse is time-consuming, so maybe a better approach is to look for any known properties or to see if the string can be decomposed into parts that fit the productions.\n\nWait, also, in CNF, the only possible ways to combine non-terminals are through two steps. That is, each application of a rule replaces a single non-terminal with two others. So the derivation is a binary tree where each node has either one terminal (a leaf) or two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string length should be one more than the number of productions applied. For example, the initial S (a single symbol) can derive into two symbols after one step. Each step after that can potentially increase the number of symbols by one each time a non-terminal is replaced.\n\nWait, no: in CNF, each production for a non-terminal either replaces it with a terminal (length 1) or two non-terminals (length 2). So the maximum possible length of a derivation after k steps is 2^k - 1. But our input string is 39 tokens, which is quite long, so the derivation would be quite deep. However, manually checking this isn't feasible.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to note that the string must parse according to the given CFG without left or right recursion, but the grammar seems to have a mix of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for known patterns. Let's see if any of the given productions can match the string's beginning.\n\nLooking at the start S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Let's see what NT95 and NT83 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT95 \u2192 't18'\n- NT83 \u2192 't28'\n\nSo S \u2192 t18 t28 in this case. But the string starts with t35 t36, so that can't be right. Thus, maybe the other production is used.\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20:\n- NT73 can produce 't36' or have other options. Let's see:\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 or 't36'\n\nIf NT73 produces 't36', then the first token would be t36. But the string starts with t35, so that's a mismatch.\n\nWait, but NT73 can also go further. So, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. Then, NT62 can produce:\n- NT62 \u2192 NT35 NT96 or 't24'\n\nIf NT62 produces 't24', then we have t24 and NT27. NT27 can produce 't33' or 't6'? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT27 has productions:\n- NT27 \u2192 NT62 NT27 (wait, that's a recursive production; maybe it's not part of S's production)\nWait, no. Looking back, the grammar includes:\n- NT27 \u2192 't33'\n- NT62 \u2192 NT35 NT96 or 't24'\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT27:\nIn the given grammar, I see lines like:\n- NT52 -> NT12 NT85\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT62 -> NT35 NT96 or 't24'\n- NT27 -> 't33'\n\nSo, NT27 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo, if NT62 \u2192 't24', then the path would be NT73 \u2192 NT62 (\u2192 't24') and NT27 (\u2192 't33'). So that gives 't24 t33', but the string starts with t35 t36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the path is different.\n\nAnother option: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 \u2192 't24' 't33'. But that's t24 t33, not matching the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's take the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t35 t36 t25 t9 t25 t37 t22 t33 t29 t16 t24 t25 t36 t6 t33 t16 t0 t27 t36 t12 t23 t1 t5 t4 t27 t23 t3 t10 t11 t31 t18 t6 t23 t16 t10 t30 t23 t11.\n\nIt starts with t35. So maybe looking for a production that leads to t35 somewhere.\n\nLooking in the grammar for t35:\n\n- NT35 has several productions:\n  - NT35 \u2192 NT13\n  - NT35 \u2192 NT1 t3\n  - NT35 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo where do these t35's appear?\n\nLooking for tokens that could lead to t35.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any non-terminals directly produce t35.\n\nLooking for NT transitions where a terminal is just t35, but I don't see that. The productions for NT35 are all to longer non-terminals or to t5, t3, etc.\n\nSo maybe I need to look into that.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT95 NT83 could produce something that leads to t35.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT95 NT83:\n\n- NT95 can produce 't18' or possibly something else, but wait, looking back, NT95 has:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT32 NT39 or 't18'\nBut I don't think we have NT32 in the grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at the productions, the start symbol is S. The initial production rules for S are:\n- S -> NT73 NT20\n- S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT73 followed by NT20 or NT95 followed by NT83. Then each of these NTs can further be split into other NTs until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string given has a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are the terminal symbols. Each 't' like 't9', 't1', etc., is a terminal, and the NTs must expand into sequences of these terminals.\n\nI'll break down the string into parts and see if it can be generated by the grammar. Each 't' must come from an NT production that eventually leads directly to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that many NTs expand into other NTs, but some expand into 't' terminals. For example:\n- NT53 -> t11\n- NT99 -> t10\n- NT27 -> t33\n- NT24 -> t25\n- NT47 -> t27\n- NT37 -> t29 (from two rules)\n- NT99 -> t16\n- NT24 -> t25 and so on.\n\nI need to map each 't' in the string to the corresponding NT production. Let's list out the first few 't's:\n\n1. t9\n2. t1\n3. t28\n4. t2\n5. t11\n6. t37\n7. t16\n\nAnd so on. Wait, hold on. The start symbol S produces either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So the first part of the string must be either NT73 followed by NT20 or NT95 followed by NT83.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t9. Let's check which NTs can produce t9. Looking through the rules, I don't see a direct production for t9. Hmm, looking again:\n\nWait, the rule for NT55 is t17, and NT47 is t27. But I don't see a production for t9. Let me check all the NT rules to see if any generate t9.\n\nLooking through the list, the 't' production rules:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 t12 (from NT11 ...)\nWait, let me list all the NT \u2192 't' rules I see:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT55 \u2192 t17\n- NT47 \u2192 t27\n- NT37 \u2192 t29 (two different rules)\n- NT49 \u2192 t3 (two rules)\n- NT64 \u2192 t24\n- NT26 \u2192 t20\n- NT49 \u2192 t9 (Wait, looking back, I see NT49 -> t9 as a rule: NT49 -> t9. Oh yes, in the list, near the end, there's \"NT49 -> t9\". So NT49 is t9. Great, that's the first token.\n\nSo the first part is t9, meaning the first NT must be NT49. Now, where does NT49 come from? Let me see the rules leading to NT49.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6 (rule 46)\n- NT49 -> NT63 NT2 (rule 56)\n- And also, earlier in the list: \"NT49 -> t3\", but that's a terminal, while another rule says NT49 -> t23.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules: Oh, NT49 has two rules: one that leads to NT63 NT2 (t23? Wait, no: looking again, NT49's rules:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n- NT49 -> t9\n- NT49 -> t23\n- Also, elsewhere: NT49 \u2192 NT63 NT2 (which leads to 't23').\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. So NT49 can be either 't9' or 't23' or via other routes.\n\nWait no, the rules for NT49 are:\n1. NT49 -> t3 (appearing multiple times)\n2. NT49 -> t23\n3. NT64 -> t24\n4. NT26 -> t20\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nLooking carefully, the grammar has:\n\nNT49:\n- \"NT49 -> t3\" (several times)\n- \"NT49 -> t23\"\n\nAnd another production:\n\n\"NT49 -> NT63 NT2\"\n\nSo, in the string, the first 't9' is problematic because none of the NTs I looked up directly produce t9. Wait, no, earlier I thought NT49 -> t9. Let me check:\n\nIn the list provided, I see \"NT49 -> t9\" as rule number 55. So yes, NT49 can expand to 't9'. Therefore, the first token t9 must come from NT49 \u2192 t9.\n\nSo, the first part is NT49 (which is t9). Now, after NT49, what's next? The string continues with t1. Let's see what comes after NT49 in the production chain.\n\nLooking at NT49's rules:\n- NT49 can go to t9 directly.\n- Or it can go to t23 via another production.\nWait, no: in the rules, maybe the production paths are more complex. Wait, no: for NT49, the direct productions are:\n\n1. NT49 -> t9 (immediate terminal)\n2. NT49 -> t23 (another immediate terminal)\n3. Or perhaps, NT49 can go to NT63 NT2, which would produce t23, meaning that NT63 and NT2 must each produce their terminals.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t9, that's from the first production NT49 \u2192 t9. Then the next part of the string is t1. But NT49 can't produce any other NT beyond that, because in this case, after t9, it's just a terminal. So the next character after t9 should come from another NT production, perhaps.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again: the entire string is a sequence of 't's, which means every token must come directly from a production that leads to a terminal. Therefore, each 't' must be the result of some NT rule that directly produces it.\n\nSo, the entire string is:\n\nt9 t1 t28 t2 t11 t37 t16 t16 t35 t0 t29 t35 t9 t12 t28 t6 t2 t25 t22 t23 t16 t0 t23 t29 t27 t4 t16 t20 t31 t37 t33 t31 t0 t5 t6 t5 t0 t33 t10\n\nEach of these must be generated by some NT production. So, for example, t9 comes from NT49, t1 comes from... which NT can produce t1?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT2 -> t22, t2 (from NT26?), no. Let's list all terminals:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 t1. Wait, I don't see a production for t1 in the grammar. Hmm. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t1. That's a problem because the string starts with t1 after t9. If t1 can't be generated by any NT, then the entire string can't be generated, so the answer would be 'No'. But wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me check all NT rules again for any that produce t1. Scanning through the provided rules:\n\nI see rules for NT30 (t30?), but not t1. Hmm, or perhaps I might have missed a rule. Wait, the grammar provided has multiple NTs, but I don't see any rule that directly produces t1. So that would mean that t1 can't be generated, so the string can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-757","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I remember that CNF has specific rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Also, sometimes the RHS can have a single non-terminal, but in this case, all the productions are either two non-terminals or mixed with terminals.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of production rules. Let me look at them quickly. For example, S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83. These are the starting points. The initial symbol is S, so any string generated must start with either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So the first part of the string should be one of these.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t11 t12 t37 t10 t33 t22 t13 t5 t3 t0 t13 t22 t25 t4 t12 t3 t9 t17 t12 t36 t35 t20 t36 t30 t2 t25 t0 t28 t3 t33 t11 t33 t5 t28 t14 t35 t11 t3 t1`\n\nWow, that's a long string with a lot of 't' followed by numbers. I need to see how these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step either breaks down a non-terminal into two symbols or stops if it's a terminal.\n\nI notice that the grammar has certain terminals: like t3, t5, t7, etc., but looking closely, the terminals used in the string are various 't' with numbers, but the RHS of the grammar often have combinations like NT followed by numbers or other NTs, but also sometimes terminals like 't3'.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, it seems that some NTs can be replaced by terminals. For example, several NT entries have rules ending with a terminal. Like NT35 can go to t3, t5, etc.\n\nSo, the approach is to parse the string step by step, checking if each part of the string can be expanded from the grammar.\n\nI think the best way is to start with the entire string and see if it can be generated through the grammar by replacing symbols from the rules.\n\nAlternatively, since both S productions start with NTs, the string should be built up from these starting non-terminals. Let's see the first few tokens: t11, t12, t37, etc. So starting from the first symbol, which should be derived from the first part of S's expansion.\n\nLooking at the S productions: S can go to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So the entire string must be generated by expanding these.\n\nI can try to break down the string into parts that correspond to the RHS of the productions.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is a sequence of 't's, so maybe each 't' is a terminal that comes from a specific NT rule. So, for example, if NT37 has a production to 't31', then when we see t31, it's derived from that.\n\nBut looking at the string, each 't' is a single token, so each 't' in the string is a terminal symbol. So, for it to be generated by the grammar, each 't' must appear somewhere on the RHS of the productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, many of the NTs have productions that end with 't' followed by a number. For instance:\n\nNT35 -> t3\nNT49 -> t3\nNT64 -> t17\nNT99 -> t10\nNT35 -> t13\nNT39 -> t6\nNT11 -> t12\nNT35 -> t5\nNT63 -> t29\nNT96 -> t20\nNT4 -> t11\nNT49 -> t23\nNT88 -> t28\nNT37 -> t31\nNT95 -> t35\nNT8 -> t30\nNT64 -> t24\nNT26 -> t20\nNT49 -> t9\nNT88 -> t28\nNT12 -> t11\nNT84 -> t1\nNT44 -> t4\nNT68 -> t0\nNT20 -> t17\nNT96 -> t27\nNT88 -> t27\nNT9 -> t10\nNT62 -> t24\nNT53 -> t11\nNT27 -> t33\nNT62 -> t36\nNT26 -> t2\nNT49 -> t0\nNT99 -> t16\nNT27 -> t27\nNT49 -> t2\nNT24 -> t25\nNT47 -> t27\nNT12 -> t31\nNT20 -> t25\nNT96 -> t37\nNT88 -> t37\nNT9 -> t10\nNT62 -> t24\nNT53 -> t11\nNT27 -> t27\nNT49 -> t2\nNT24 -> t25\nNT47 -> t27\nNT12 -> t31\nNT20 -> t25\nNT96 -> t37\nNT88 -> t37\nNT9 -> t10\nNT62 -> t24\nNT53 -> t11\nNT27 -> t27\nNT49 -> t2\nNT24 -> t25\nNT47 -> t27\nNT12 -> t31\nNT20 -> t25\nNT96-> t37\nNT88->t37\nNT9->t10\nNT62->t24\nNT53->t11\nNT27->t27\nNT49->t2\nNT24->t25\nNT47->t27\nNT12->t31\nNT20->t25\nNT96->t37\nNT88->t37\nNT9->t10\nNT62->t24\nNT53->t11\n...\n\nSo, each 't' number must correspond to a terminal generated by some NT.\n\nNow, the initial string starts with t11. Let's see if t11 is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see NT11 -> t12, and NT11 can go to other things, but does any NT have a production that ends in t11? It seems none of the NT rules end with t11. Hmm. So, t11 must come from another NT that can go directly to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t11 is a terminal; maybe somewhere in the grammar, a NT can go directly to t11.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that goes directly to t11. So t11 must be a problem unless it's generated via a longer chain.\n\nWait, no. The question is whether the grammar can generate the string, so each 't' must be part of some NT's production that has a terminal symbol. Since t11 isn't directly produced by any NT, it's impossible for the grammar to generate t11 as a standalone terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the productions again, I don't see any NTs that have a terminal 't11'. So, if the string contains t11, t12, etc., those 't's must come from NTs that can produce that 't'. So, for example, NT11 can go to 't12', which can perhaps be broken down further.\n\nBut in the string provided, we have 't11', followed by 't12', etc. So, t11 must come from a production. Let's track that:\n\nLooking at the entire string: it's a series of 't's with numbers. The first token is t11. Since t11 isn't directly a terminal but instead derived from some NT, we must have a series of NT steps that produce these 't's.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that none of the NT rules lead to 't11' directly. Let's check all the NTs and their productions:\n\nLooking through all NT rules:\n\nFor example, NT53 -> 't11' (one production), but then there's NT99 -> 't10', t16, etc. But 't11' doesn't appear except in NT53.\n\nWait, NT53 has a production NT53 -> 't11'. So, if the string has 't11', that can be directly generated by NT53.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar rules provided:\n\nThe NT53's productions are listed as:\n\nNT53 -> 't11'\nNT24 -> 't25'\nNT47 -> 't27'\nNT12 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-779","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. All the non-terminal symbols (like S, NT, and various NT followed by numbers) have productions that either expand into two other non-terminals or directly into a terminal 't' followed by a number. The start symbol seems to be S, and the productions for S are S -> NT73 NT20 and another S -> NT95 NT83. So every S production starts with two NTs.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't3', 't18', etc. Since the grammar only produces terminal strings consisting of these 't' followed by numbers, the string we're evaluating is a terminal string. So, my task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Let's break down the string into components:\n\nt3 t18 t5 t33 t35 t18 t9 t10 t37 t5 t5 t13 t33 t12 t7 t30 t2 t14 t10 t37 t35 t14 t22 t14 t5 t33 t30 t1 t35 t16 t36 t27 t23 t36 t24 t33 t18 t13 t36 t0\n\nThis is a long string, so I'll try to find subtrees or perhaps look for repeated patterns that might indicate how the grammar could have generated it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the NT symbols have direct productions to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT52 -> NT35 NT96 \u2192 which could go to t3 t...\n- NT71 -> NT68 NT2 \u2192 t68 and t2\n- NT83 -> NT22 NT45 \u2192 t22 and t45\n\nI also see that some NTs directly produce terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT38 -> 't36'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT2 -> 't22'\n- NT96 -> 't27'\n- And so on.\n\nThis suggests that some parts of the string can be generated directly by certain NTs. So maybe the string can be broken down into these components.\n\nBut the string is complex, so I'll try to see if I can map parts of it to the grammar.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step:\n\n1. Starting with the entire string, maybe I can split it into parts that match the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nThe first part is t3 t18 t5 t33 t35 t18 t9 t10 t37 t5 t5 t13 t33 t12 t7 t30 t2 t14 t10 t37 t35 t14 t22 t14 t5 t33 t30 t1 t35 t16 t36 t27 t23 t36 t24 t33 t18 t13 t36 t0\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of t followed by numbers. Each production in the grammar either results in two terminals or two non-terminals. So, the string must be a concatenation of these productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S -> NT73 NT20. So, the entire string should be generated by expanding S into two NTs: NT73 and NT20. Then, each of these NTs can expand further either into terminals or other NTs.\n\nSo, S becomes NT73 NT20. Then, each NT73 and NT20 must expand into sequences of terminals and\/or NTs that, when combined, form the entire string.\n\nLet me try to find where NT73 and NT20 might lead.\n\nLooking at NT73 productions:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\n\nAnd NT62 -> NT36, so NT62 could produce t36. Then NT27: looking at the productions, NT27 -> NT62 NT27 and NT26 NT43? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar has NT27 -> NT62 NT27 and NT26 NT43? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT27: There's NT27 -> NT33 NT36. Also, from elsewhere, I see NT27 -> NT26 NT43? Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I might have to list all:\n\nLooking back, I see:\nNT27 -> NT33 NT36\nNT26 -> NT20 NT14\nAnd other rules: NT24 -> NT25 NT47, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to figure out how to get each part.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to look for the right-most or left-most derivations. Let me try to think recursively.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to look for specific chunks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the number '16' in the string. Because I see 't16' appears towards the end. So, looking for where 't16' comes from.\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for NT productions that produce 't16'. Scrolling through the rules:\n\nI see NT20 -> 't22' and NT4 -> 't11', but wait, do any NTs directly produce 't16'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT38 -> 't36'\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT68 -> 't14'\nNT2 -> 't22'\nNT96 -> 't27'\nNT88 -> 't27'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT53 -> 't11'\nNT26 -> 't20'\nNT47 -> 't27'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT84 -> 't1'\nNT73 -> 't36' (from an SN production)\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT99 -> 't10' (multiple times)\nNT59? Wait, I don't see an NT directly leading to 't16'. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nI don't see any NT production that directly produces 't16'. So perhaps 't16' comes from an NT production that expands into two terminals, perhaps 't16' is part of a longer expansion.\n\nWait, maybe 't16' is part of a larger NT production. For example, NT39 -> NT51 NT37, which might expand further. But where does 't16' come from?\n\nWait, perhaps 't16' comes from NT8 -> 't30', but I don't see NT8 being part of any rules. Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT8 as a non-terminal. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check if I listed all the rules correctly.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of rules, perhaps some are missing from my review. Let me go through the rules again to spot any that lead to 't16'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n... \nNT27 -> NT62 NT27\nNT26 -> NT20 NT14\nNT47 -> NT49 NT26\nNT12 -> NT11 NT47\nNT84 -> NT1 NT44\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT85 -> NT74 NT73\nNT99 -> NT82 NT83\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\n...\n\nWait, perhaps I missed an NT that directly produces 't16'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't16' is part of a longer expansion from a two-symbol NT production. For example, if an NT produces something like 't16' followed by another terminal, or followed by another NT that becomes t16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a structure where parts can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each element of the string can be matched directly. Let's try to parse from left to right, matching each part to the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first 't3':\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't3'. From the rules, NT38 -> 't36', but that's not t3. Wait, in the list, perhaps I missed some.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT39: NT51 NT37 \u2192 but production is NT51 and NT37.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back:\n\nIn the initial rules, the user listed:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nNT71 -> NT68 NT2\n\nWait, looking at that: NT71 -> 't68' 't2'\n\nSo, if we can expand NT71 into t68 t2, that's a possibility.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which has two rules:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the string we're checking starts with t20, t7, etc. I'll break down the string into parts that might match these production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: `t20 t7 t25 t6 t11 t30 t30 t29 t0 t11 t33 t5 t3 t33 t4 t35 t18 t14 t25 t24 t24 t20 t9 t1 t30 t25 t25 t0 t24 t23 t35 t24 t20 t1 t30 t31 t17 t36 t9 t37`.\n\nI notice a lot of t's with numbers. Let me check the terminal symbols in the grammar to see which ones exist. From the grammar, the terminals are: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t9, t11, t14, t17, t18, t20, t24, t25, t27, t29, t30, t33, t35, t36, t37, t38, t44, t47, t49, t51, t52, t53, t55, t64, t68, t71, t73, t80, t82, t83, t88, t90, t99.\n\nThe string includes some of these, like t20, t7, t25, etc. So, let's see how they could be derived.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's consider the first option: NT73 and NT20.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t20 t7 t25. Hmm, t20 is a terminal. So maybe the NT20 would produce t20. Let's see, in the grammar, NT20 -> 't20'. So that's consistent. So S can produce NT20, which is t20.\n\nNow, the next part after t20 is t7. Since S's other part is NT73 and NT20, so the NT73 needs to produce t7. Looking at the grammar, NT73 -> NT47 NT27. Then, NT47 can go to NT8 NT44 or NT49 NT26. Let's see: NT8 is 't8', but our next symbol after t20 is t7. So that doesn't fit. Maybe another path.\n\nWait, NT73 can go to NT12 NT47. NT12 is 't12', which isn't t7. Hmm, maybe another path. Or perhaps I'm looking at the wrong route. Maybe I need to parse the string step by step using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S starts with NT95 NT83, because the first token is t20, which could come from NT20. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string from the start, using the grammar's productions. The string is quite long, so it might be helpful to break it down.\n\nLet me list the tokens again: [t20, t7, t25, t6, t11, t30, t30, t29, t0, t11, t33, t5, t3, t33, t4, t35, t18, t14, t25, t24, t24, t20, t9, t1, t30, t25, t25, t0, t24, t23, t35, t24, t20, t1, t30, t31, t17, t36, t9, t37].\n\nLooking at the first token t20, which matches NT20 -> t20. So the first part of S is NT20, which is t20. Then the next part is NT73.\n\nNow, NT73 can go to NT47 NT27. So after t20, the next tokens should be NT47 followed by NT27. Let me see: after t20, the next token is t7. So that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no, because NT73 may produce more than two symbols.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. S can be NT73 NT20. So the first symbol t20 must come from NT20. Then, the grammar says S produces NT73 NT20. So the next part is NT73, which I need to parse into the next tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT73 -> NT47 NT27. So after NT73, the next symbols should be NT47 and then NT27. But our next token is t7, which is 't7'. Does that fit?\n\nLooking at the grammar, are there any productions that produce t7? Let's see, yes: NT53 -> 't11', NT68 -> 't14', NT71 -> 't2', but where does t7 come from? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT27 can produce NT62 NT24, but does it lead to t7?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT62 has a production NT62 -> NT53 NT6. Then NT53 -> 't11'. So if NT62 is followed by 't6', but that's t6, not t7.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let's see if there's a production that starts with t7. For example, NT99 -> t9, but that doesn't help. Or is there any NT that produces t7?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see an NT production that directly results in t7. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each production to see if they produce t7.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\nNT52: no\nNT73: produced NT47 NT27\nNT47: produced NT8 NT44 or NT49 NT26\nNT8: no, it's 't8'\nNT44: 't4'\n...\nWait, maybe I've missed something. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, in the list provided, I see that NT47 -> NT8 NT44, NT64 -> 't24', etc. Hmm, I don't see any NT that produces t7. But wait, the grammar's terminals include t7. So perhaps there's a production I missed that directly gives t7.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, the only terminals listed are a subset, but in the production rules, only certain NTs produce terminals. I don't see any NT directly producing t7, which suggests that t7 cannot appear as a terminal. But the string has t7 as the second token after t20.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if S is NT73 NT20, then the first token is NT20 -> t20, then the next should be NT73. Let's see NT73's productions:\n\nNT73 -> NT47 NT27\n\nSo after t20, next is NT73, which becomes NT47 and NT27. Now, NT47 can go to NT8 NT44 or NT49 NT26.\n\nIf NT47 is NT8 NT44, then NT8 is 't8'. But the next token after t20 is t7, so that's a mismatch.\n\nIf NT47 is NT49 NT26, then NT49 -> NT9 NT63, which then -> 't9' and something else. Not matching t7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the initial S isn't NT73 NT20 but NT95 NT83? Let's check. If S is NT95 NT83, then the first symbol would come from NT95 or NT83.\n\nBut the string starts with t20, which isn't produced by NT95, as NT95 -> t9. So the first symbol is t20, which can only come from NT20. So the S must be NT73 NT20.

{"custom_id":"request-803","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production either replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or directly with a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t12 t20 t16 t13 t17 t16 t35 t1 t20 t4 t14 t33 t23 t18 t36 t29 t6 t29 t20 t24 t29 t18 t9 t10 t22 t3 t27 t37 t10 t12 t12 t13 t25 t28 t16 t0 t30 t16 t33 t13 t11`.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Each token is either 't' followed by a number or a number itself, right? So, each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nNow, let me look back at the grammar and see which non-terminals produce terminals. Seems like most of the productions directly give a terminal, but some don't\u2014they produce other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20; both NT73 and NT20 might produce terminals or non-terminals. So, I need to parse the string step by step to see if each token can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a parsing tree or at least simulate the parsing process. Since this is a CFG in CNF, I can try using the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for such structures. The CYK algorithm tries to determine whether a string is in the language by checking possible ways to split the string into parts that can be generated by productions.\n\nLet me list all the unique non-terminals in the grammar to see how they connect to terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n- NT73: t36, t27\n- NT71: t22, t2\n- NT52: t80, t47, t12, t85, t62, t1\n- NT95: t18\n- NT99: t38, t62, t10\n- NT45: t44, t52\n- NT6: t88, t73\n- NT38: t26, t20\n- NT96: t82, t83\n- NT83: t22, t45\n- NT88: t38, t24, t9, t53\n- NT52: multiple productions, including generating t12, t85, t62, t1\n- NT27: t33, t62, t27\n- NT49: t9, t16\n- NT64: t24, t17, t99\n- NT26: t20, t2\n- NT47: t8, t44\n- NT85: t74, t73\n- NT24: t25\n- NT49: t2\n- NT20: t17, t1\n- NT96: t27, t20\n\nWait, I might be making a mistake here. Let me parse each production correctly.\n\nWait, NT73 \u2192 t36 or t27. So, for example, NT73 can produce 't36' or 't27'. Similarly for others.\n\nI should now map each non-terminal to the terminals they can produce.\n\nLet's list all non-terminals and their possible terminals:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t36, t27\n- NT71 \u2192 t22, t2\n- NT52 \u2192 t80, t47, t12, t85, t62, t1 (wait, but some of these might be non-terminals again)\nWait, no, some of these are non-terminals. Let me clarify each production:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 \u2192 so NT62 produces something, and NT27 might produce a terminal. Wait, but NT62 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, each production is a single step. So, for example, NT73 can either produce t36 or t27. So, if NT73 is a non-terminal, it can directly produce one of these terminals, but if the grammar has NT73 appearing on the left, it's still a non-terminal that can only produce those two options.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: each production is an alternate for a single non-terminal. For example, NT73 can be written as:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 or NT27. So, each production for NT73 gives it two options. The first option is NT62 followed by NT27, which are both non-terminals, meaning they would need to be expanded further. Alternatively, NT73 can directly produce t36 or t27, which are terminals.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, the production NT73 has two types of expansions: some that are terminals and some that are combinations. For example, the first three productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\nNT73 \u2192 NT27.\n\nWait, no, looking back, it's structured as:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT27.\n\nWait, so S is a non-terminal that expands to either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Then, NT73 can either expand to NT62 NT27 or directly to t27 (if that's a valid option). Wait, but looking at the productions for NT73, it seems like NT73 can either produce t36 or t27, or other combinations. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, let me re-express the grammar correctly. The grammar is given as a list of productions, each at the form of a non-terminal on the left and a sequence of non-terminals or terminals on the right. Each production is an alternative for that non-terminal.\n\nLooking again:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\n...\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT27\n\nWait, so NT73 has two productions: one where it's split into NT62 and NT27, and another where it's directly t27? No, wait, looking back, the productions are in the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the given grammar correctly. Let me look at the entire set of productions again.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, and other non-terminals like NT52, NT73, etc., each have their own productions. Let me list each non-terminal and their possible expansion options.\n\n- S has two options: NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n- NT73 has two options: NT62 NT27 or NT27.\n- Wait, no, looking carefully, the productions are as follows:\n\nThe first production for NT73 is NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. Then, the next NT73 production is NT73 \u2192 NT27? No, in the list, after NT71 production, it's NT73 coming again. Let me list all NT73's productions:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT27 (is this correct? Wait, no, because the next is 'NT73 -> NT60'\u2014no, wait, perhaps I'm misplacing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list each production step by step:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-796","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has rules where each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. Here, the rules look like they're mostly in CNF, with the exception of some rules that have a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nThe string starts with `t24`. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that some terminals are directly defined as symbols. Let me scan for any rules that produce `t24`.\n\nLooking through the rules, I spot `NT24 -> t25` and `NT49 -> t4`, but I'm looking for `t24`. Let me go through each production:\n\n- NT55 -> t17, NT45 -> t2, but those are t17 and t2, not t24.\nWait, I see one rule: `NT24 -> t25`. So, to have `t24`, the production must be looking into something else. Maybe `NT44` or `NT99` can produce t24? Or perhaps I'm missing a rule.\n\nWait, looking again: No, the rules where NT24 appears is on the left side only in `NT47 -> NT24 NT44`. So, I need to see how to get `t24` somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again. Oh, wait, I think I spotted it: There's a rule `NT23 -> t24`? Or wait, no. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't25' which I think might be a typo because in the rules, NT24 isn't on the left side of any production except perhaps in another rule. Wait, perhaps looking for rules that have 't24' on the right side.\n\nLooking, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't25' on line: NT24 -> 't25'?\nWait, let me be precise. Scanning the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for any production that generates 't24' as the terminal. Scanning through:\n\n- I see NT24 -> 't25'\u2014so that's t25, not t24. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking again for 't24':\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't25' (this is line: NT24 -> 't25')\n\n- Line: NT53 -> 't11'\n\n- Line: NT99 -> 't17'\n\n- Line: NT20 -> 't1'\n\nWait, I don't see any production that directly produces 't24' as a terminal. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built through non-terminals that eventually derive to t24. Let me think. Maybe the string is broken down into non-terminals that reduce to t24. For example, if the string starts with t24, perhaps the initial part is generated by NT24.\n\nBut since t24 isn't directly produced by any rule, perhaps the original string isn't generated by this grammar. But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in identifying the rules.\n\nWait, line: NT47 -> NT74 NT24. So NT47 can produce NT74 and NT24. So to get t24, we need NT74 to produce t24? Or perhaps NT24 is a rule that produces something else.\n\nWait, NT24 -> 't25' so the only way to get t24 is if NT24 somewhere is used to get t25 and then somehow processed, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look deeper into the structure. Let me take the string and see if it can be broken down starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t24. Since it's not produced directly, the only way is if there's a non-terminal that expands to t24. But as per the grammar, there's no such non-terminal\u2014every rule that writes a terminal is either t25, t12, t20, etc., but not t24.\n\nWait, let me check line by line for any rule where the right-hand side has t24.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT47 -> NT74 NT24 (line 24) and NT24 -> 't25' (line 64?). Wait, no, NT24 appears on the left in one rule: NT47 -> '74' and '24'. But I'm looking for t24 as a terminal, which isn't there.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is written wrong. Let me check: in the given grammar, under NT47: NT47 -> 't27' and 't24' or something. Let me check line 12:\n\nNT47 -> 't27' and 't24' (line 12 of the grammar): \"NT47 -> 't27' 't24'\".\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, line 12 says: NT47 -> 't27' 't24'? Or maybe it's a typo. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, line 12: \"NT47 -> 't27' 't24'\". Hmm, that would mean NT47 -> 't27' and 't24'? No, in the data, it's written as:\n\n\"NT47 -> 't27' 't24'\"\n\nSo, that would be two separate terminals, t27 and t24. So, NT47 can produce t27 and t24 in a single step.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, each rule is split by commas if multiple non-terminals on the right. For example, NT53 -> 't11' is one rule, but if a rule has multiple non-terminals separated by commas, they are combined into a single expansion. But if a rule has a mix of terminals and non-terminals, it's not possible since it violates CNF.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is written incorrectly. Let me re-examine the list.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLine 12: NT47 -> 't27' 't24' (assuming that's the case). But wait, in CFGs, a production with mixed terminals and non-terminals is allowed, but in CNF, it's only allowed to have terminals or non-terminals, but each production on the RHS can be either a terminal or a single non-terminal. So having two terminals in a single production would violate CNF.\n\nWait, but looking back at the provided grammar, for example:\n\nUnder NT24, there's a line: \"NT24 -> 't25'\".\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT23: does it produce anything? Hmm, perhaps I need to correct my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the way they listed the rules. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nAt NT47 -> 't27', 't24'?\n\nNo, looking at the grammar:\n\nAt line numbers, line 12 is:\n\nNT47 -> 't27' 't24'\n\nBut I think that might be a typo because NT47 can't produce both 't27' and 't24' unless it's written as 't27' and 't24' as two separate rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a comma-separated list, meaning NT47 can produce 't27' AND 't24', which would imply that a production can't have two terminals, as that would lead to ambiguity. Because in CNF, each production's RHS must be two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo if a production has two terminals, that's invalid. Therefore, perhaps this rule was intended to be NT47 -> 't27' and another rule for 't24', or the correct production for NT47 has only one terminal or one non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar has some errors, but that's beyond my current scope; I need to work with what's provided.\n\nSo, back to the problem: the string starts with t24.\n\nLooking at the rules, is there any NT that can produce a string that leads to t24?\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules, I don't see any NT that produces t24 except perhaps in NT24 -> 't25', but that's t25.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT47 can produce multiple terminals, but that's against CNF. So, I'm confused.

{"custom_id":"request-815","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding everything that's been given.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side or a terminal. Each production right-hand side has exactly two symbols. That should make parsing easier, but maybe it's a bit tricky.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, they all seem to be going from non-terminals to two other non-terminals or a mix until they reach terminals which are represented by 't' followed by a number. For example, S -> NT73 NT20, so S is followed by NT73 and NT20, which eventually break down into terminal symbols like 't36', 't28', etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. Let me count them to see how long it is. There are 40 tokens in the string. That's a bit long, but I'll have to break it down.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process will proceed in a way that each step increases the string length by one. Starting from S, which is two non-terminals, each application of a production adds one symbol, so for a string of length n, the derivation steps will be n-1.\n\nWait, actually, starting with one non-terminal, each production adds two symbols. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of symbols. Let me think.\n\nWait, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So starting with S, which is one non-terminal, after one step, you get two symbols. To reach a string of length m, you need m-1 steps because each step adds one symbol. So for a string of length 40, starting from S, it would require 39 steps. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of symbols in the string should be equal to 2^k where k is the number of steps. Wait, no, because each step replaces one symbol with two, so the number of symbols doubles each time. Starting from 1, then 2, 4, 8, etc. So a string of length 40 is not a power of two, which is 2^5 (32), 2^6 (64). So 40 is in between. That might suggest that the string might not be acceptable, but maybe the parsing can be partial.\n\nBut perhaps the string is too long, or the structure isn't matching the grammar. Alternatively, maybe it's better to look for patterns.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the S production leads to two non-terminals: NT73 and NT20. Let me see what those produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\n\nSo S can be expanded as NT62 NT27 NT27 NT68. Wait, but in the string, after t37, it's t33, t37, t12, etc. Let me try to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to traverse the string and see if each part matches the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string's tokens in order:\n\nt37, t33, t37, t12, t29, t10, t12, t7, t6, t11, t20, t1, t24, t3, t35, t25, t2, t22, t24, t33, t7, t28, t12, t2, t11, t29, t23, t4, t9, t13, t14, t18, t36, t27, t31, t17, t0, t33, t5, t11, t20, t5.\n\nThat's a lot. Let me see if I can find a way to split this into parts matching the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be derived by expanding S using the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, we have S -> NT73 NT20.\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\n\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68.\n\nSo after one expansion, we have NT62 NT27 NT27 NT68.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first two symbols are t37 t33. So maybe NT62 is t37 and NT27 is t33? Let me check the rules for NT62 and NT27.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT62 -> t24\n\nWait, no, NT62: Let me search for NT62 in the rules.\n\nWait, scanning the rules:\n\nNT62 -> t24. So NT62 directly expands to 't24'. So how does NT62 become part of the string? If NT62 is directly t24, then in the string, t24 would be part of NT62?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Non-terminals like NT62 are symbols, and the productions for NT62 are rules that expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT62 -> t24.\n\nYes, so NT62 is a production that goes directly to t24. So in the expansion of S, if we have NT62, it's replaced by 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 has rules:\n\nNT27 ->t33, and others, let me check:\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't see NT27 \u2192 t33. So maybe I was wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, let me find all NT27 rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, the only NT27 I see is:\n\nNT27 -> ... Hmm, actually, in the above rules, I don't see any NT27 \u2192 t33. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT27 -> t33? Wait, no. Wait, NT27 is actually in NT27's productions? Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT27 -> t33: No, actually, checking through the rules, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT27 is defined in a few places. Let me look for NT27:\n\nNT27 -> t33? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT27 -> t33: Wait, no, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps it's another non-terminal that produces t27?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me list all the NT27 rules.\n\nLooking through, I only see:\n\nNone. Wait, actually, looking again, the rules are:\n\nLooking for NT27, perhaps in the grammar, it's present.\n\nWait, no, looking through the list, I don't immediately see NT27 as a non-terminal with t33. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t37, t33, t37, t12, etc.\n\nLooking for the leftmost symbol, t37. So that's the first symbol.\n\nI need to check if t37 is a terminal or a non-terminal. Since all symbols in the string are terminals (they start with 't'), they are all terminals, so the string consists of terminals only. So the entire string is a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nTherefore, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, I need to see if the string can be generated by replacing S with a sequence of terminals.\n\nSince S -> NT73 NT20, and both NT73 and NT20 are non-terminals, each of these must expand into more non-terminals until the symbols become terminals.\n\nSo, expanding S once more:\n\nS can be NT73 NT20. So we expand NT73 and NT20.\n\nLooking at NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nSo NT73 becomes NT62 NT27.\n\nThen NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68.\n\nSo now S becomes NT62 NT27 NT27 NT68.\n\nSo the string must start with t corresponding to NT62, which is t24, followed by NT27, etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t37, which in our expansion is t24 from NT62. Wait, that's a mismatch. So t37 is supposed to be the first symbol, but according to S's expansion, the first symbol is t24.\n\nThat's a problem. So that suggests that either S is not the starting point, which it is, because the string starts with 't', so it must be derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S expands differently, but according to the grammar, S only goes to NT73 NT20.\n\nSo perhaps that's a problem.

The grammar and string are quite long, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for terminals which can be single symbols or something else. But in this grammar, I see a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, but in BNF, terminals are represented by themselves, and non-terminals by uppercase letters. So in this grammar, NT represents a non-terminal, and the rest are terminals with 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe start symbol is S.

So NT99 -> 't23' is possible.\n\nWait, actually, looking closely, in the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT47 -> NT44 NT52, which then goes to 't24' and 't27'? Or maybe I'm mixing up.

{"custom_id":"request-834","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string given is a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t31 t28 t36 t33 t33 t17 t37 t36 t22 t10 t30 t17 t18 t0 t36 t3 t37 t7 t36 t35 t37 t29 t12 t24 t9 t11 t23 t31 t28 t3 t37 t30 t5 t9 t36 t14 t9 t20 t7 t4 t9 t2 t13.\n\nI notice that this is a fairly long string, so checking it manually would be time-consuming. I think the best approach is to construct a parse tree starting from S and see if I can derive this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20 \u2192 t36 (from NT73) t20? Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar's first rule is S \u2192 NT73 NT20. But looking at the NT73 and NT20 rules, I see that NT73 can produce 't36' or another NT production. Similarly, NT20 can produce 't17' or other NT productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should first parse the string into possible tokens. Let's list the tokens in the string:\n\nt31, t28, t36, t33, t33, t17, t37, t36, t22, t10, t30, t17, t18, t0, t36, t3, t37, t7, t36, t35, t37, t29, t12, t24, t9, t11, t23, t31, t28, t3, t37, t30, t5, t9, t36, t14, t9, t20, t7, t4, t9, t2, t13.\n\nEach of these tokens seems to be a terminal symbol. Now, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string by applying the productions step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this by breaking down the string into parts that match the grammar's rules. Since the grammar has multiple layers, maybe I should start from the top and see if the string can be split into components that match the production rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So the first step is that the entire string must start with NT73 and NT20. But in the given string, the first token is t31. Wait, let me check the NT productions.\n\nLooking at all the NT productions, I see that NT31 has a rule: NT31 \u2192 't31'. Similarly, NT73 produces 't36' or other NTs. Wait, but in the first rule, S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So the string must start with NT73 followed by NT20.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t31. So NT73 would produce t36, but the string starts with t31, which could be produced by NT31. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the top-level productions. Let me make sure. The grammar's S has two rules: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. The first rule is used to generate strings starting with NT73, which is S \u2192 NT73 NT20, but the string starts with t31, which is produced by NT31, not NT73. Therefore, perhaps the string isn't generated by S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT95 NT83 is used. Let me check what NT95 and NT83 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT95's only production seems to be NT95 \u2192 t18. Wait no, let's see: NT95 \u2192 t18. And NT83 \u2192 t28. So if S \u2192 NT95 NT83, the string would be t18 followed by t28, which doesn't match the first tokens here. Therefore, the string must be generated by S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t31, which can't be from NT73, as per the initial S rule. So maybe the string is not part of the language. But that seems too quick; maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parse the string step by step using the grammar. Let's see.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nNT73 can be expanded into: either another NT production or a terminal. Similarly, NT20 can be expanded into another NT production or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the NT73 productions, I see: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and from there, these can be broken down further. Similarly, NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68, and NT27 can be t33 or broken down further.\n\nWait, perhaps I can build a parse tree, but with such a long string, this is complex. Alternatively, maybe the string starts with t31, which is produced by NT31, so perhaps the first part of the string is generated by a different branch of the grammar. Therefore, it's impossible for S to derive a string starting with t31 because S always starts with NT73 or NT95, which do not produce t31.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT95 or NT73 producing t31. The NT productions for t31 are NT31 \u2192 t31 and NT37 \u2192 t31. So maybe the initial step is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which production S uses. So S has two productions: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Neither of these directly produce t31, so the initial step would produce strings starting with t36 (from NT73) or t18 (from NT95). But in the string, it starts with t31, which is not possible because S can't start with t31.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe S can derive a substring that starts with t31. But no, the entire string must be derived from S, which starts with NT73 or NT95, which can't produce t31 as their first token. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to split the string into parts where each part starts with the correct NTs. Let me think: Since the first token is t31, which is generated by NT31, but S doesn't produce t31, then perhaps the entire string isn't in the language. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-842","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is in the language it defines. The string is `t12 t30 t11 t14 t7 t22 t11 t20 t6 t5 t37 t23 t13 t13 t13 t2 t4 t6 t20 t3 t18 t1 t13 t10 t25 t9 t22 t25 t28 t33 t28 t30 t2 t6 t6 t11 t9 t4 t3 t14 t12 t18 t25`. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is context-free and either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S. Looking at the productions, S can go to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Each NT has further productions, and eventually, the non-terminals resolve to terminals, which in this case are labeled as 't' followed by a number.\n\nI notice that a lot of the NTs produce other NTs or terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and NT62 \u2192 NT24, and so on. It seems each step breaks down the NT into a combination of other NTs until we reach the terminals.\n\nI'll try to work backwards from the string. Since the grammar is for t's with numbers, maybe I need to see if each 't' in the string can be traced back through the productions.\n\nStarting with the first token, t12. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t12? Scanning through all the rules, I see NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85, and NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37, but also NT12 seems to appear in other places. Wait, looking at the last part, S can go to NT52 NT12, but not sure.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should parse the string step by step. Let's think of the string as a sequence of t's separated by spaces, so the whole string is a concatenation of these t's. Each t corresponds to a terminal symbol.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production either results in two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. In Chomsky normal form, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one on the right. So each non-terminal expansion results in one non-terminal. But how do we build up the string? It's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to derive the string. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But given the size of the string, that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, the string has 68 tokens, which is quite long. It might not be feasible to do a full parsing. Alternatively, maybe I can look for the structure of the string.\n\nWait, let's look at the string. It starts with t12, t30, t11, t14, etc. Looking at the grammatical rules, maybe I can find a way that the t's correspond to the non-terminals. But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that each non-terminal can be expanded into a sequence of terminals, so the string is a concatenation of these expansions. So S ultimately should expand to a string of terminals. Let me think about how the start symbol S can be expanded.\n\nLooking at the first productions: S can be NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Each of these NTs can further expand. For example, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, which can go further. Let's see if these can eventually lead to the given string.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can look for the last part of the string and see if it corresponds to any known productions. The last part is ...25 t9 t22 t25 t28 t33 t28 t30 t2 t6 t6 t11 t9 t4 t3 t14 t12 t18 t25.\n\nLooking at the last t25, which production could lead to it? Looking through the NT productions, I see NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and also NT62 \u2192 NT24, which becomes NT4, which then becomes 't14' or 't6' or ... Wait, maybe this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains t12 and t53, and in the grammar, NT53 has a production NT53 \u2192 NT96 NT27. Wait, no. Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT53 is only in one place: NT38 \u2192 NT75? No, wait. Looking again, the user provided a long list. Let me see NT53: Oh, the rules provided include NT53 \u2192 NT11 NT39, and also NT53 \u2192 NT27 NT37. Wait, no\u2014here it is: looking at the list, NT53 is only in the rules as:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT53 \u2192 NT11 NT20? No, no. Wait, let me go step by step through the provided rules to see if I can find any relevant pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider that each non-terminal can be expanded until it reaches a terminal. So for t12, t30, etc., there must be a path from the NTs down to these terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to notice that each t in the string must be the result of a production that ends in that t. For example, t12 appears in NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85. So if NT52 is reached, then one of its expansions could produce t12. Similarly, t53 appears in NT53 \u2192 NT27 NT37, but I don't see a t53 in the rules. Wait, looking through, I see that in the rules, NT99 can produce t10, t16, t20, etc., but not t53. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for example, NT99 \u2192 't10', 't16', 't20', 't22', 't25', 't27', 't28', etc. Hmm, looking deeper:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT44 \u2192 't4'; NT49 \u2192 't3', 't14', 't16', etc. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Maybe I should create a mapping from each NT to its possible terminal productions. Let me try to list all the NTs and see what terminals they produce.\n\nFrom the given rules, terminal symbols are lowercase 't' followed by numbers. So let me list each NT and its possible terminals:\n\n- NT73: \u2192 t3 (twice?), no, wait, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27; but then looking deeper, NT62 \u2192 NT24, then NT24 \u2192 't4', so NT73 can produce t4.\n\n- NT52: \u2192 NT12 NT85; NT12 \u2192 't12', NT85 \u2192 't35' eventually? Wait, NT85: looking through, I don't see any rules for NT85. Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to look at each t in the string and see if there's an NT that can produce it directly or through expansion.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, each NT can end in a terminal or produce other NTs. So for example, NT6 \u2192 't88' according to one rule: NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73 \u2192 then NT88 \u2192 t28, etc. Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count the number of tokens. Since S starts with two NTs, each of which may generate a certain number of tokens. For example, each NT may expand to a certain number of terminals. If the total number of tokens is 68, perhaps each NT contributes half. But 68 is even, so perhaps each NT in the top level (S) contributes 34 tokens. But each NT in the next level would contribute half of that, and so on. But I'm not sure if that's possible here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of tokens is 68, and each NT on each level splits into two NTs, so the total depth is log2(68), but since 68 is not a power of two, it might not be possible. Maybe that's an issue.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can check each t in the string to see if there's an NT that can generate it. For example, t12 appears twice.

{"custom_id":"request-861","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to formal grammars, but I'll try to figure this out. So, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has productions where each non-terminal on the left side produces exactly two non-terminals or terminals on the right. CNF is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making it easier to parse, though I might not need a full parser here.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. The non-terminals are S, NT20, NT22, NT35, etc. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t36, t17, up to t49, t68, t99, and so on. The goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce two options:\n1. NT73 followed by NT20\n2. NT95 followed by NT83\n\nSo, the string must start with one of these two sequences. The given string starts with t16, which is a terminal. I need to find which non-terminals derive to t16.\n\nLooking through the production rules for NT, I see that NT44 produces t4, but that's probably not relevant. Wait, I should check the NTs that produce t's.\n\nLet me look at all the rules where a non-terminal leads to a terminal:\n\nNT53 -> t11\nNT62 -> t24\nNT55 -> t17\nNT73 -> t36 (multiple times)\nNT38 -> t36 (multiple times)\nNT44 -> t4 (but that's a non-terminal, so probably not useful)\nNT99 -> t10\nNT20 -> t17 (multiple times)\nNT96 -> t20\nNT73 -> t36\nNT49 -> t3 (multiple times)\nNT64 -> t24 (multiple times)\nNT88 -> t28\nNT12 -> t11\nNT84 -> t1\nNT44 -> t4\nNT68 -> t0\nNT20 -> t17\nWait, but in the rules provided, some NTs have multiple rules leading to the same terminal. For example, NT73 has two rules both leading to t36. Similarly, NT38 has multiple rules ending in t36, t29, t16, etc.\n\nBut I'm looking for NTs that directly produce the terminals present in the string. Let's list all the terminals in the string and see their sources.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt16, t17, t5, t9, t35, t31, t29, t33, t37, t16, t20, t16, t29, t27, t6, t1, t2, t10, t23, t2, t2, t2, t7, t22, t36, t23, t20, t12, t14, t11, t5, t22, t5, t16, t1, t7, t27, t6, t1, t27, t29, t20, t31, t31.\n\nSo, the first term is t16, which must come from some NT that has a production ending in t16.\n\nLooking at the rules, which NTs produce t16?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT62 -> t24 (no)\n- NT20 -> t17, but that's t17, not t16\n- NT88 -> t28 (no)\n- NT2 -> t22 (no)\n- NT73 -> t36 (no)\n- NT38 -> t36 (no)\n- NT44 -> t4 (no)\n- NT99 -> t10 (no)\n- NT20 -> t17\n- Wait, perhaps I missed some rules.\n\nWait, in the provided rules:\n\nLooking through all the NT -> rules:\n\nI see that NT99 -> t10, NT38 -> t36, NT12 -> t11, etc. Hmm, maybe I need to look carefully.\n\nWait, looking again, some rules like NT26 -> t20, but that's t20, not t16. Maybe I need to check each rule that ends with t16.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed that somewhere. Let me go through each rule for every NT to see which produce t16.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT88 has a rule nt88 -> t37.\n- NT12 has NT12->t11, so no.\n- NT85 -> nt85 is not in the rules provided?

{"custom_id":"request-859","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, so I'll start by understanding the structure and the components involved.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. CNF means that each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all the productions here fit that structure. The starting symbol seems to be S, as it's the only one on the left side without another non-terminal expanding.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t28 t30 t10 t20 t30 t0 t3 t33 t17 t10 t16 t18 t30 t11 t1 t0 t10 t36 t3 t16 t28 t12 t16 t9 t6 t7 t3 t24 t16 t33 t36 t6 t33 t35 t13 t16 t17 t22 t31 t30 t22 t22 t29 t6`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar starting from S. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can approach this by trying to parse the string using the productions, either top-down or bottom-up. But given the structure of the grammar, it's probably easier to use a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the string's beginning symbols.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual tokens, each representing a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are for non-terminals, so every symbol on the left is a non-terminal, and on the right, it's either two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that the only terminals are 't' followed by numbers. So, every token in the string is a terminal symbol, meaning that when deriving, each step must consume one or two terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, each production is A -> BC or A -> a. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The string provided is a sequence of terminals (t28, t30, etc.), so each step must consume these terminals by matching the productions.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can try to use a top-down approach: start from S and see if the entire string can be broken down using the grammar rules, replacing non-terminals with their productions until all are replaced with terminals, resulting in the given string.\n\nAlternatively, I can simulate the parsing process, trying to match the string's beginning with the left-hand side (LHS) of the productions. Since S is the start symbol, I'll check if the first part of the string matches the LHS of any production of S.\n\nLooking at the productions for S:\n- S -> NT73 NT20\n- S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo S can expand to either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Each NT is a non-terminal, so I'll need to expand those as well.\n\nLet me consider the first production: S -> NT73 NT20.\n\nNow, the string starts with t28. So after expanding S to NT73 NT20, the next step would be to expand NT73. Looking at the grammar, NT73 has productions:\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT36\nWait, looking back, yes, in the grammar, NT73's productions are:\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT12 NT47\nNT73 -> NT36\nWait, no, actually, looking at the user's grammar, I see:\nThe user wrote:\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT38 -> 't36'\n\nWait, no, no, in the user's grammar, under NT73, it has:\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT36\nWait, no, the user's grammar after NT73 is:\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT36\n\nWait, no, the user's grammar entries include:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT38 -> 't36'\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, I need to parse the user's grammar correctly. The user provided a list of lines where each line is a production. Each line is like 'NTa -> NTb NTc' or 'NTa -> a', where 'a' is a terminal.\n\nSo looking at the user's grammar, for example, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\n\nNext line:\n\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nThen NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nWait, I think the best approach is to list all productions for each NT.\n\nLet me start compiling all productions for each non-terminal. Since the grammar is extensive, I'll have to make a big list, but perhaps I can find a way to match the string's tokens.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I can outline the approach:\n\n1. Start with the string: t28 t30 t10 t20 t30 t0 t3 t33 t17 t10 t16 t18 t30 t11 t1 t0 t10 t36 t3 t16 t28 t12 t16 t9 t6 t7 t3 t24 t16 t33 t36 t6 t33 t35 t13 t16 t17 t22 t31 t30 t22 t22 t29 t6.\n\n2. The string is all terminals, so we need to break it down step by step by replacing non-terminals with their productions.\n\n3. The first step is to match the start symbol S. Each production for S is either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\n4. Let's try S -> NT73 NT20 first.\n\n5. So, the first two symbols must be the expansion of NT73 followed by NT20. So, the first terminal after S would be the expansion of NT73, and the second would be the expansion of NT20.\n\nWait, but in the string, it starts with t28. So, the first step would involve NT73 expanding into some sequence that starts with t28.\n\nLooking at NT73's productions:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT36\n- (Are there others? Let me check the user's provided grammar.)\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, under NT73, the productions are:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT36\n\nSo, NT73 can expand into NT62 NT27 or directly to t36.\n\nBut the string starts with t28, so if NT73 expands to t36, that's t36, which doesn't match t28. Therefore, the only way for NT73 to start with t28 is if it expands into a sequence that produces t28 as the first symbol. But from the productions, NT73 doesn't have any terminal except t36. So, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Looking at the user's grammar:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT36\n\nSo, NT73 always starts with NT62 or NT36. But since the first token is t28, and t28 doesn't appear in these productions, this suggests that S -> NT73 NT20 is not a viable path because it can't start with t28.\n\nLet me check S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nSimilarly, the first token in the string is t28.\n\nLooking at NT95, its productions:\n\nLooking again, NT95 isn't listed in the user's grammar. Wait, the user's grammar includes:\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under which non-terminals are we?\n\nLooking back, the user provided a list. Let me make sure I have all the NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all NTs and their productions:\n\nHere's a summary, but it's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can focus on the tokens that appear in the string and see if they can be reached from any NT.\n\nLooking at the tokens in the string: t28, t30, t10, t20, etc.\n\nNow, t28: Do any NTs produce t28?

{"custom_id":"request-877","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I have to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens starting with 't' and some others. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and the right side, except for the start symbol which can sometimes have a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, each rule starts with S and then has two non-terminals on the right, except for the cases where it's S -> NTsomething, but I see that eventually, these non-terminals are replaced by terminals through other rules.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of t-suffixed tokens like t27, t30, etc., which I think represent terminal symbols. The grammar's production rules eventually lead to terminals, so each production must eventually resolve to these t-something strings.\n\nTo see if S can generate this string, I should probably try to parse the string from the start symbol S using the grammar. That means starting from S and applying the rules step by step until I can break it down into the given string.\n\nBut parsing can get complicated, especially with a string of 43 tokens. Maybe I can look for a way to parse it using a recursive descent approach or by checking if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider building a parse tree where the root is S, and each node is either a non-terminal (S, NT) or a terminal (t with a number). Each non-terminal has exactly two children according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into components. The string is:\n\nt27 t30 t31 t5 t11 t6 t5 t25 t4 t27 t24 t2 t30 t28 t16 t14 t2 t6 t20 t22 t6 t2 t18 t35 t37 t35 t23 t2 t2 t4 t6 t22 t12 t10 t27 t18 t12 t5 t36 t7 t6 t36 t28 t14 t7\n\nI notice all are 't' followed by a number, so they seem like terminals. Now, looking at the grammar rules, each terminal corresponds to a specific production. For example, 't36' is derived from NT73 in one rule and NT53 in another. Similarly, 't28' is from NT83, and other 't's come from various NTs.\n\nI need to see how the initial S rule applies, which has two parts: S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So S can be broken into two non-terminals, each of which must then break down into the rest of the string.\n\nLet's try both possibilities. Suppose we take S -> NT73 NT20 first. Then we need to see if NT73 can generate the first few parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT73 has a production rule:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nSo NT73 generates NT62 and NT27. Then, each of those can continue breaking down. NT62 has rules like NT62 -> NT53 NT24. Wait, but looking at the given grammar, NT62 is broken down into NT53 and NT24, which in turn break down further.\n\nThis seems like a lot of steps, but I can try to parse the string step by step, checking if each part of the string corresponds to the possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree for the entire string is tedious, but perhaps I can find if the string can be represented as a product of the non-terminals that S can split into.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse strings in CNF grammars. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, CYK could be applicable here. However, implementing CYK for this would require a lot of setup, considering the number of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut given the time, maybe I can find another shortcut. Let's look at the string and see if the 't's correspond to known terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t27. Looking at the grammar, t27 can come from several NTs:\n\n- NT62 -> ... t27?\nWait, let me check the rules. Looking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT62 is broken down into NT53 and NT24:\n\nNT62 -> NT53 NT24.\n\nLooking at NT53's rules, NT53 -> NT44 NT52, and then NT44 is 't4', and NT52 can go to various things, including t36, t12, etc.\n\nWait, maybe that's a dead end. Alternatively, looking for t27 in the grammar, it appears in NT62 and others.\n\nWait, looking at the list, NT62 -> NT53 NT24, which leads to various steps. But I'm getting lost here.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find the entire string as a derivation starting from S.\n\nThe string is 43 tokens, which is quite long. Let's see how many steps that would take. Each production splits into two, so for a string of length N, the parse tree could have up to N-1 levels.\n\nGiven that S produces two non-terminals, each of those could produce two more, and so on. So maybe it's manageable but time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be broken down using the grammar by starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t27, which must come from a production of some NT that eventually becomes t27.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, 't27' comes from:\n\n- NT96: NT96 -> NT82 NT83\nBut wait, no, looking again, I see that 't27' is in NT62 and NT27.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT37 -> NT31 t37. Wait, maybe not. Let's list out all 't's and see where they come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each 't' corresponds to a specific production. Let me create a map:\n\n- t2 -> NT2\n- t3 -> NT35\n- t4 -> NT11, NT24\n- t6 -> NT68\n- t7 -> NT73\n- t10 -> NT99\n- t11 -> NT11, NT35\n- t12 -> NT12\n- t14 -> NT64\n- t16 -> NT26\n- t17 -> NT6\n- t20 -> NT4, NT22, NT27\n- t22 -> NT22\n- t24 -> NT24\n- t25 -> NT25\n- t26 -> NT11, NT68, NT27\n- t27 -> NT62, NT27?\nWait, looking through the rules, t27 appears as:\n\n- NT62 -> t27 from NT62's rule: NT62 -> NT53 NT24. Then NT53 can go to NT44 and NT52, which might produce t4 and t36 or similar. Alternatively, maybe NT27 branches into t30 and something else.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to attempt to parse using a step-by-step method. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into exactly two non-terminals, so the parse tree will be a binary tree.\n\nGiven that the original string is 43 tokens, and each non-terminal production requires splitting, the parse tree will have a depth of 42, but that's a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the derivation by trying to match the string to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from S, which can produce S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nLet me try both options.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT73 NT20\n\nNow, we need to derive the string starting from NT73 and NT20.\n\nNT73 has the production rule: NT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nSo, NT73 becomes NT62 NT27.\n\nNow, the string starts with t27, which is the second part of NT73's split. So, the string would have to have NT27 producing t27 at some point. But NT73 is split into NT62 and NT27, so the first part of the string (t27) is part of NT27's derivation.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string starts with t27 as the first symbol, which would mean that the first production must derive t27. So, that would require NT27 to generate t27, but looking at the grammar, does any production for NT27 lead to a terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT27 is derived from NT62 in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which usually means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side or a terminal.

Looking at the string, it's a sequence of t-something, so I think those must be terminal symbols because non-terminals would be uppercase Ns or Ts? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, many rules have right-hand sides with other non-terminals and sometimes 't' followed by a number. So I think 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and others are non-terminals.\n\nSo each rule in the grammar is S -> NT1 NT2, where NT and numbers are non-terminals. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, all productions are of the form NT followed by a number on the left, except S which also has non-terminals on the left.

{"custom_id":"request-897","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, it seems some productions have more than two non-terminals on the right side, like S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Wait, no, actually, all the productions seem to have exactly two non-terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, S \u2192 NT95 NT83, etc. So the grammar is in CNF because each non-terminal produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string we need to evaluate is `t4 t28 t24 t13 t0 t22 t22 t33 t2 t0 t27 t3 t17 t25 t7 t31 t37 t22 t0 t10 t22 t35 t36 t10 t20 t13 t4 t4 t7 t20 t29 t23 t36 t29 t0 t22 t17 t2 t25 t5 t10 t35 t1 t13 t18 t0`. It's a series of t tokens with numbers. I think each tX is a terminal symbol, where X is an index.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I can simulate the derivation process or use a parsing approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can potentially use the CYK algorithm, but manually handling such a long string would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to break the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the top symbol S and see if we can derive the string step by step. Since S is the start symbol, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. I can check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nNT73 has productions like NT73 \u2192 t36, but also NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47. Wait, let me list all NT73's productions:\n\nLooking back:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT47 NT36\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\nWait, no, from the given grammar:\n\nLooking back, for NT73:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT47 NT36? Wait, no, looking at the given productions:\n\nLet me list all for NT73:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT47 NT36? No, checking the initial list:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT47 NT36\n- NT73 -> NT12 NT47\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the initial grammar given is a list of productions. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nFor NT73:\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT47 NT36\n- NT73 -> NT12 NT47\n\nWait, checking each line:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT73 NT20\nLine 2: S -> NT95 NT83\nThen, for NT52:\n- NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n- NT52 -> NT80 NT47\n- NT52 -> NT12 NT85\n... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs and their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to map out the possible derivations.\n\nWait, but this could take a lot of time. Let me try to think differently.\n\nEach step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The string has 40 tokens (t followed by some numbers). Each production except when it's a terminal would split a non-terminal into two parts, so the length of the string would be equal to the number of terminals in the leftmost derivation. So for a string of length N, the grammar would have to produce it in N-1 steps, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the given string and see if each t is matched by some production.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the structure of the string can help. Let me break the string into parts and see if they match any terminals or can be part of a production.\n\nLooking at the first part: t4 t28 t24 t13 t0.\n\nLet me check if t4 is a terminal. Looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nFor example, NT44 \u2192 t4, NT11 \u2192 t12, NT11 \u2192 t37, etc. So t4 is a terminal, specifically from NT44.\n\nSo the first step would be NT44 \u2192 t4.\n\nBut wait, in the start symbol S, the first production is NT73 \u2192 ... which starts with NT73. Hmm. So perhaps the string starts with NT73 \u2192 ... . But looking at the grammar, I don't see a production that starts with NT73 immediately becoming a terminal, except perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, let me look back. The first production is S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So in the derivation, S first needs to split into NT73 and NT20. Each of these can further split into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT73's productions:\n\nNT73 can produce t36, which is a terminal (since NT73 -> NT12 NT47 and NT47 -> NT47? Wait, no: from the grammar, NT47 -> NT8 NT44, and NT44 -> t4. So NT47 can produce NT8 NT44 or NT44 NT26 or NT44 NT95. Wait, no: looking at the grammar:\n\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44, NT47 -> NT49 NT26, NT47 -> NT49 NT95.\n\nWait, let me list the NT47 productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\nNT47 -> NT49 NT26\nNT47 -> NT49 NT95\n\nWait, that doesn't include NT8 or NT26 as terminals. However, NT44 -> t4, which is a terminal. So, for example, NT47 can produce NT8 (if NT8 is a terminal?), but from looking at the grammar, NT8 is only defined by productions into other non-terminals. So perhaps the terminal t44 is derived from NT44 \u2192 t4. So, in NT47, one of the productions is NT44 \u2192 t4, so if NT47 has NT44, it can produce t4 when that non-terminal is expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to map each non-terminal to its possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each production either ends in a terminal or continues with non-terminals. So for each non-terminal NT, if it has a production that directly produces a terminal, like NT52 \u2192 t9, for example.\n\nWait, looking for all NTs that have a production leading directly to a terminal:\n\nLooking through each NT's production list:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT47 NT36: NT47 and NT36 are non-terminals, so NT73 can't produce a terminal directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should go through each NT and see if any of their productions result in a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT73 NT20 (both non-terminals)\nLine 2: S -> NT95 NT83\n...\nLine 3: NT52 -> NT35 NT96\nLine 4: NT71 -> NT68 NT2\nLine 5: NT39 -> NT51 NT37\nLine 6: NT83 -> NT22 NT45\nLine 7: NT88 -> NT38 NT24\nLine 8: NT52 -> NT80 NT47\nLine 9: NT49 -> NT11 NT6\nLine 10: NT80 -> NT71 NT99\nLine 11: NT22 -> NT44 NT63\nLine 12: NT99 -> NT38 NT62\nLine 13: NT52 -> NT12 NT85\nLine 14: NT73 -> NT62 NT27\nLine 15: NT45 -> NT44 NT52\nLine 16: NT6 -> NT88 NT73\nLine 17: NT38 -> NT26 NT20\nLine 18: NT99 -> NT22 NT4\nLine 19: NT99 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-902","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and it can produce two different NT (non-terminals) followed by another NT. My task is to see if the provided string can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the productions are either combining non-terminals or producing terminals. Some non-terminals produce single terminals, which are strings like 't3', 't10', etc. Others produce combinations, which would lead further to more non-terminals that eventually produce the terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is part of a terminal string, like 't2', 't29', etc. My job is to check if this entire sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string from the bottom up, starting from S and seeing if I can build the string through the grammar's productions. Alternatively, I can try to split the string into parts that each correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT followed by NT, like S -> NT73 NT20. Each of these NT can then produce other NTs or terminals. Since the production is a binary tree, each step breaks down a non-terminal into two parts, which themselves can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, I think the best way is to see if the string can be split into a series of these productions. Let me list the grammar productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT73 -> 't36'\nNT73 -> 't36' also shows up again elsewhere, so maybe it's a recurring production.\n\nWait, no, looking again, NT73 appears in multiple productions, but one of them is NT73 -> 't36' and another is S -> NT73 NT20. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me look at all the productions again.\n\nWait, I see a lot of NTs that produce a single terminal. For example:\n\nNT73 -> 't36'\nNT74 -> NT39 NT39, but NT39 produces 't6', so NT74 produces 't6t6' as part of the string.\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the leftmost derivation. The idea is to replace the leftmost non-terminal step by step.\n\nGiven the start symbol S, which produces NT followed by NT. So the first step is to replace S with two non-terminals. Let's say the string starts with 't2 t29 t33 t27...'. So, to get a 't2' as the first symbol, I need to find a production that starts a subtree with 't2'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT4 -> 't11'\nNT26 -> 't20'\nNT49 -> 't23'\nNT53 -> 't11'\nNT90 -> 't95' but that's longer, perhaps not needed right now.\nNT51 -> 't64' and 't90' as well, which might not help.\n\nWait, let's see. The terminals are like 't2', 't29', 't33', etc. So each 't' is part of the production.\n\nI think the way to do this is to parse the string, breaking it down into parts that correspond to the grammar. Each time, we look for a productions that can produce a part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to reverse engineer the string, starting from the leaves (terminals) and see if they can be grouped into the grammar's productions.\n\nBut another approach is to note that each of the non-terminals in the grammar has productions that can generate a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step combines two symbols, either two non-terminals or one non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, all productions are of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. So, for example, S can produce two NTs, each of which can further produce NT NT or a terminal.\n\nSo, the entire string can be considered as a binary tree, where each internal node is a production in the grammar, and leaves are terminals.\n\nGiven that, I can represent the string as a series of non-terminals that, when expanded, produce the string.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, I might need a better strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can list all the possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal in the string, and see if they can be arranged in a way that the entire string is built.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nThe string is: t2 t29 t33 t27 t4 t20 t25 t22 t2 t1 t24 t25 t22 t16 t31 t10 t2 t11 t31 t1 t18 t4 t6 t28 t31 t35 t37 t16 t12 t25 t17 t13 t5 t33 t22 t29 t5 t13 t18 t6 t14 t13 t1 t25 t11 t23.\n\nEach of these 't' followed by a number. Now, I need to see if each of these terminals can be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar, and whether the sequence can be formed by combining the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals correspond to certain non-terminals. For example:\n\n- 't2' is produced by NT26: 't20' is from NT48? Wait, no, checking the grammar:\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT68 -> 't14'\nBut wait, I need to find which NTs produce each 't'. Let me go through the grammar productions:\n\nLooking for any NT -> 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nI see:\n\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT4 -> 't11'\nNT26 -> 't20'\nNT49 -> 't23'\nNT53 -> 't11'\nNT90 -> 't95' (wait, that seems longer; perhaps that's a mistake, maybe a longer production?)\nNT6 -> 't88' but that's a production to 't7' maybe?\nWait, no, let's go through each rule:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that many rules have 't' followed by numbers as their right-hand side. For example:\n\nNT83 -> 't28'\n\nNT44 -> 't4'\n\nNT6 -> 't88, but actually, I think that was a typo? Wait, in the grammar, it's:\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the grammar has:\n\nNT44 -> 't4'\n\nNT49 -> 't23'\n\nNT88 -> 't28'\n\nNT4 -> 't11'\n\nNT26 -> 't20'\n\nNT53 -> 't11'\n\nNT90 -> 't38 NT62' Wait, no, that's incorrect.

{"custom_id":"request-919","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar consists of productions where each non-terminal on the left is rewritten as two non-terminals on the right. Some non-terminals are terminals, denoted by 't' followed by numbers. Each production ends with a terminal, which suggests the strings generated are composed of these specific terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- S -> NT73 NT20\n- S -> NT95 NT83\n\nNT73 can produce 't36', and NT20 can produce 't17'. So, S can produce \"t36 t17\" or \"t36 t17\" (same as the first one, perhaps a typo). Wait, no, looking closer, NT73 can have multiple productions:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27, which then breaks down into more non-terminals until it reaches a terminal. So, the string we're evaluating must align with the derived symbols from these non-terminals.\n\nThe provided string is a series of terminals: t33, t1, t7, t3, t29, t30, t22, t33, t12, t27, t22, t13, t16, t4, t31, t24, t11, t31, t16, t31, t36, t28, t5, t17, t7, t14, t22, t14, t30, t33, t13, t16, t37, t35, t25, t25, t37, t31, t33, t27, t17, t13, t37, t0, t17, t3, t31.\n\nI notice that the string begins with t33, which must come from a production in the grammar. Checking the grammar, I see NT62 can produce t24, and NT26 can produce t20. Wait, perhaps looking at the start symbol S, which is NT73 NT20 (from S -> NT73 NT20). Since S must be rewritten into two NTs, and each can then be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is two non-terminals, so in the parse tree, the root will have S as the parent, which branches into NT73 and NT20. Each of these must be expanded all the way down to terminals.\n\nLooking at NT73: It can produce various non-terminals, but when expanded fully, it must end with a terminal. So the entire string must be built by expanding S into NT73 NT20, then expanding each until terminals are reached.\n\nThe string has 38 elements, so each NT must expand into a certain number of symbols. Let's see:\n\n- T33 must come from NT62 (since in the grammar, NT62 can produce t24, but that's not t33). Wait, looking for NT that can produce t33. Let me go through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NTs that have 't33' in their productions. In the given grammar:\n\n- NT62 -> NT53 NT27 (and other variations, but looking through all, I don't see a production that directly produces t33. So perhaps t33 comes from a deeper expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the production that leads to t33. Wait, no, let me think. The production NT62 can produce t24, which is present in the grammar. But t33 is somewhere else. Wait, in the productions, NT27 can produce t33: looking through the NT27 productions, I see NT27 -> NT62 NT27, but nowhere does it directly produce t33. Wait, checking through all NTs:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces t33. Scanning through:\n\n- NT26 -> t20\n- NT27 -> various non-terminals, but I don't see t33. Wait, NT62 can produce t24 (as per one of the rules: NT62 -> t24). So t33 might be deeper in the hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by working backwards. Starting from the given string and trying to find a path in the grammar that could generate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can construct the parse tree.\n\nBut considering the time, maybe a better approach is to check if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through the string, I see 't33', 't1', 't7', etc. Let me check if all these are present in the grammar.\n\nFrom the grammar's terminal list:\n- t1: yes\n- t3: yes\n- t4: yes\n- t5: yes\n- t7: yes\n- t11: yes\n- t14: yes (looking at the grammar, NT55 -> t17, but wait, the grammar has several 't' nodes. Checking for t1, t7, etc., I think all needed t's are there. So that's not the issue.\n\nNext, I need to see if the structure of the string allows for the grammar rules. Each non-terminal expansion should lead to the correct sequence.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which splits into NT73 and NT20. S produces two NTs, each of which must be expanded into a string of terminals and non-terminals that ultimately resolve to terminals only.\n\nLet's see what each NT73 and NT20 can expand to.\n\nLooking up NT73: It can produce various non-terminals, but eventually, it must end in 't's. For example, one possible expansion is NT73 -> NT62 NT27. Then, NT62 can produce t24, and NT27 can produce... let me check NT27's productions. NT27 can be NT62 NT27 or NT49 NT31. Wait, so let me pick the latter: NT27-> NT49 NT31.\n\nThen, NT49 can produce NT26 and NT95. Wait, NT95 can be 't35' or other non-terminals. Let's go further.\n\nAlternate path: NT73 -> NT69 NT... Wait, no, NT73's productions don't include that. Let me check NT73's rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT49 NT31\nWait, yes. So from NT73, we can have either NT62 NT27 or NT49 NT31.\n\nIf I choose NT49 NT31 for NT73, then each of these non-terminals must expand into the correct sequences.\n\nNT49 can produce NT26 NT95 or NT99 NT35. Let's go with NT26 NT95 for NT49.\n\nNT26 can produce t20, and NT95 can produce t35 or other non-terminals. Let's assume NT95 is 't35', giving us 't20 t35'.\n\nNow, the other part of NT73 is NT31. NT31 can produce NT44 NT95 or NT44 NT52. Let's pick NT44 NT52.\n\nNT44 can produce 't4', and NT52 can produce NT80 NT47. So, NT80 is 't7', NT47 can produce NT8 NT44.\n\nWait, that's going into more depth. Let's see: if NT47 is 't8 nt44', and NT44 is 't4', then NT47 would produce 't8 t4'.\n\nPutting this together: NT73 -> NT49 NT31 -> (assumed as) NT26 (t20) and NT95 (t35). Then NT31 -> NT44 (t4) and NT52. NT52 -> NT80 (t7) and NT47 (t8 t4). So the expansion is t20 t35 t4 t7 t8 t4.\n\nThat's one possible path, but the string starts with t33, which is much later. So perhaps this isn't the right path for the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to choose a different branch in NT73's expansion. Let's try the other option for NT73: NT62 NT27.\n\nSo, NT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nNT62 can produce 't24' directly, and NT27 can produce... Let's see, NT27 can be NT62 and NT27 again or NT49 and NT31. Let's choose NT49 and NT31.\n\nNT49 can produce NT26 and NT95. As before, assuming NT26 is t20 and NT95 is t35,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-917","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is quite long, so I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure should make parsing manageable, maybe even with a recursive descent parser or something similar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol. The production rules for S are S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So the start symbol branches into two different possibilities. My string starts with 't22', which is a terminal, so I need to see if any production rule leads to that.\n\nI should probably build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can derive the entire string. But given the length of the string, this might be tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can use memoization or dynamic programming to see if the grammar can generate such a string.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I can represent this as a series of steps, trying to match the terminals in the string by following the production rules. Each step should lead me closer to the entire string being parsed.\n\nStarting with S, which can go to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. The string starts with 't22', which suggests that one of these non-terminals must lead to a derivation that includes 't22'.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's check NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. Hmm, NT62 can produce 't24', and NT27 can produce 't33' or other terms. Wait, NT27 \u2192 t33 in one production and in another, NT27 can become t27, which then can produce t3. But the string starts with t22.\n\nWait, let me check NT20 production. NT20 \u2192 t68, but wait, I see NT111 somewhere? No, looking back at the productions, NT20 \u2192 t17. Wait, no, checking the productions carefully:\n\nWait, the productions for NT22 are given as NT22 \u2192 t20, but looking through the list, I see NT22's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar list, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63\n\nOh, right, NT22 is defined as NT44 NT63. And NT44 has a production: NT44 \u2192 t4, so NT22 can produce t4 NT63. NT63 \u2192 t29, so overall NT22 can produce t4 t29, which is 't4 t29'.\n\nBut in the string, the first term is 't22'. So how do I get 't22'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the production list, I see NT22 \u2192 t20. No, wait, that's not right. Let me go through the productions step by step.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83\n- NT52 has several productions\n- NT71 has NT68 NT2\n- NT39: NT51 NT37\n- NT83: NT22 NT45\n- NT88: NT38 NT24\n- NT52: NT80 NT47, and others\n- NT73: NT62 NT27\n- NT6: NT88 NT73\n- NT38: t36, t26, etc.\n- Looking for where NT22 is, I see NT22 \u2192 t20. Oh! So NT22 can produce t20 directly.\n\nWait, so NT22's productions include:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT22's productions? Let me check the list:\n\nLooking for NT22, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63\n\nAh, yes, so NT22 can only produce t20 via NT22 \u2192 t20? No, wait, no, in the productions, I don't see NT22 \u2192 t20. Let's recheck:\n\nThe productions list is:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63\n\nYes, that's the only production for NT22. So NT22 must be followed by NT44 and NT63. But the string starts with t22, which is a terminal. So perhaps the initial S's production leading to NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83, needs to be considered.\n\nWait, the string starts with t22, so perhaps one of the NTs in S's productions can generate t22.\n\nLooking at S's first rule: NT73 NT20. What can NT73 produce? Looking at the productions for NT73:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. NT62 can be t24 or further. NT27 \u2192 t33 or other.\n\nSo with NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and then NT62 \u2192 t24, NT27 \u2192 t33, that gives t24 t33. But the string starts with t22, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second rule for S: NT95 NT83.\n\nNT95: production is NT95 \u2192 NT11 NT6. NT11 \u2192 NT10 NT39.\n\nWait, NT11's production is NT10 NT39. So NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT39. Then NT10 \u2192 NT9 NT14, but looking deeper, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, but maybe only the first few terms can be matched, and then I can't proceed further. Alternatively, perhaps the string contains at least one term that cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few terms are t22, t30, t17, t16, t13, t11, etc. Let me see if any of these can be generated.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, is there a production rule that directly generates some of these terminals? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the productions, some NTs have direct terminal productions:\n\n NT44 \u2192 t4\n\n NT6 \u2192 t88\n\n NT38 \u2192 t36, t26, t29\n\n NT11 \u2192 t12, t37\n\n NT68 \u2192 t14\n\n NT14 \u2192 t4\n\n NT49 \u2192 t3, t23, t0\n\n So, some of the terminals can be directly generated.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t22. So I need to see if any production for NT22 can lead to t22. But according to the productions, NT22 only has NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63 as a production. So NT22 is a non-terminal and must be expanded into other non-terminals, not terminals. Therefore, the string cannot start with NT22 as a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t22, which is a terminal. How can that be? Or is there a non-terminal that can produce t22? Let me check all NTs to see if any of them can produce t22.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t22. So the only way the string can have 't22' is if one of the non-terminals in the derivation can produce it.\n\nWait, perhaps via a chain: for example, if an NT produces another NT that eventually leads to t22.\n\nLooking at the productions, perhaps NT22 can be a part of a longer chain. Let me see if any NTs can lead to t22.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a part where a certain NT produces t22.\n\nBut according to the given productions, I don't see any NT that can produce t22 directly or via other productions. So if the string has 't22', then it must be produced by a rule where an NT generates t22. Since none of them do, the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, but the productions do show some paths leading to specific terminals. Let me check NT26. NT26 \u2192 t20. So that's okay, but t22 is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe some NT production branches can eventually lead to 't22'.\n\nWait, for example, let's see if any NTs can go to t22 through their productions.\n\nLooking further, NT22 is directly used in S \u2192 NT22 NT20 (no, wait, no, the productions from S are S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83). Wait, no, NT73 and NT95, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT73 NT20. NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. NT62 \u2192 t24.

{"custom_id":"request-937","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long, and the grammar is quite extensive, so I should approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the steps I'll take to analyze this.\n\n1. **Understand the Grammar Structure**: The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\n2. **Tree Building Approach**: Since the grammar is in CNF, the language will consist of strings where each non-terminal's derivation corresponds to a binary tree. The leaves of the tree will be terminals, and each internal node is a non-terminal. The entire string can be viewed as the concatenation of the leaves of this tree.\n\n3. **Top-Down Parsing**: The top-down approach starts from the start symbol S and tries to derive the string. Each non-terminal is replaced by its productions until only terminals remain. Given that the grammar has multiple productions for each non-terminal, I might need to explore different paths.\n\n4. **Identify Key Productions**: I should look at the start symbols (S) and the target string to see if it can be broken down into parts that match any of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n- S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo the string should be a combination of the strings generated by NT73 and NT83. Let's check the target string.\n\nThe target string is: `t14 t14 t30 t16 t37 t23 t24 t9 t11 t7 t7 t33 t6 t6 t30 t23 t28 t36 t30 t18 t12 t20 t31 t17 t17 t33 t7 t17 t20 t16 t6 t16 t14 t14 t16 t30 t3 t37 t37 t4 t5 t36 t23 t16 t20 t3 t18 t35`.\n\nSince S can split into NT73 and NT83, let's see what NT73 and NT83 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT73 can be:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- NT73 \u2192 NT27 NT27 (from NT27 \u2192 t33, etc.)\n\nSimilarly, NT47 has multiple productions:\n- NT47 \u2192 NT8 NT44\n- NT47 \u2192 NT49 NT26\n- NT47 \u2192 NT27 NT27\n\nLet's take the first production of NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nThen NT62 can be:\n- NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36\n- NT26 \u2192 NT20 NT2\n\nWait, wait. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, for NT62, the productions are:\n- NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36\n- NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT27\n\nSo if NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, then NT62 can be either NT24 NT36 or NT53 NT27.\n\nLet's consider both possibilities.\n\n1. NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 (where NT62 is NT24 NT36):\n\nThen NT73 becomes NT24 NT36 NT27.\n\nNT24 is:\n- NT24 \u2192 NT25 NT47\n\nWait, NT24 \u2192 NT25 NT47? Let me check the grammar.\n\nYes, the productions for NT24 are:\n- NT24 \u2192 NT25 NT47\n- NT24 \u2192 something else? I think just that is given.\n\nSo NT24 \u2192 NT25 NT47.\n\nThen NT25 is:\nLooking at the grammar, NT25 doesn't have any productions listed. Wait, the grammar I have doesn't list any for NT25. That might be a problem. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT25, there are no productions. So NT25 is a terminal? But that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the initial problem states the grammar is given as a list, but the formatting might be an issue. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I see that under NT25, there's a production: NT25 \u2192 t25. So NT25 is a terminal. So that would mean NT24 \u2192 t25 NT47.\n\nSimilarly, NT47 has productions:\n- NT47 \u2192 NT8 NT44\n- NT47 \u2192 NT49 NT26\n- NT47 \u2192 NT27 NT27.\n\nSo if NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and NT62 is NT24 NT36, then NT73 would produce t25 NT47 and NT36.\n\nWait, but NT36 is a non-terminal. Wait, looking at NT36's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT36, there's:\n- NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT23.\n\nSo NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT23.\n\nThen, NT6 is:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73.\n\nSo, substituting back, we have:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT25 NT47\n\nNT25 \u2192 t25\n\nNT47 \u2192 ?\n\nLet me try to trace this step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to represent the string as a tree and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nThe target string is: \nt14 t14 t30 t16 t37 t23 t24 t9 t11 t7 t7 t33 t6 t6 t30 t23 t28 t36 t30 t18 t12 t20 t31 t17 t17 t33 t7 t17 t20 t16 t6 t16 t14 t14 t16 t30 t3 t37 t37 t4 t5 t36 t23 t16 t20 t3 t18 t35\n\nThat's quite long. Let's split it into parts as per the grammar.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83, let's check if the entire string starts with the concatenation of the strings from NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t14 t14 t30...\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT14: Wait, the grammar doesn't have a NT14. Wait, in the list, I see that NT68 \u2192 t14, and NT44 \u2192 t16. Wait, but the string starts with t14, which would have to come from a non-terminal that produces t14.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT68 \u2192 t14 and NT20 \u2192 t16. But the string starts with t14, so perhaps it's NT68, but is there a production for NT68?\n\nWait, the grammar as given is under the NT** (e.g., NT52, NT73, etc.), but I don't see NT68 or NT14 productions except for NT68 \u2192 t14 and NT44 \u2192 t16, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again, I see:\n\nNT44 \u2192 t16 (Yes, under NT44: NT44 \u2192 NT2 t99, but also NT44 \u2192 t16).\n\nSo, if we have t14, that would come from a non-terminal that produces t14. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT productions that directly produce t14 except for:\n\nWait, under NT68, the production is NT68 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo, NT68 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo, the first t14 could be from NT68. Then the next t14 would also have to come from NT68.\n\nBut how does this fit into the overall structure? Because the target string is a concatenation of the outputs from NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nWait, but in the case of S \u2192 NT95 NT83, the target string might start with NT95 and then NT83. Let's see what NT95 produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT95 has production: NT95 \u2192 NT38 NT53 and NT95 \u2192 t18.\n\nSo, NT95 can produce either t18 or a combination of NT38 and NT53.\n\nSimilarly, NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-934","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. \n\nLet me first parse the grammar and see how it's structured. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all from S or non-terminals to two non-terminals until the right-hand side has a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, some production rules have terminals in them, like NT38 \u2192 't36'. So, the grammar allows non-terminals to directly produce terminal strings by having at least one terminal on the right side. That's consistent with CNF, which allows for a mix.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t14 t30 t31 t27 t5 t30 t2 t29 t22 t10 t6 t0 t31 t36 t5 t10 t3 t37 t14 t18 t25 t11 t1 t29 t11 t31 t6 t36 t5 t4 t36 t1 t9 t24 t3 t28 t5 t37 t25 t31 t13 t24 t6 t30 t31 t23 t9 t7.\n\nWow, that's a long string. Let's see how I can approach this. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of any string must consist of a series of productions that expand the non-terminals until we reach the terminals. Each step must produce exactly two non-terminals, except for the leaves which produce one terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals, many of which have direct productions to terminals, such as NT38 \u2192 't36', NT44 \u2192 't4', etc. So, the string can be broken down into these terminal symbols.\n\nLet me see how the string can be formed. Starting from S \u2192 NT73 NT20, so each time the start symbol S expands, it must produce two non-terminals that eventually produce the respective parts of the string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation must involve expanding S as S \u2192 NT73 NT20, and then each of these NT73 and NT20 must eventually produce parts of the string via their own productions.\n\nBut looking at the entire string, it's quite long, so I need a more systematic approach. Maybe I should try to parse the string using the grammar, seeing if each terminal can be generated by the right non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt to parse the string step by step, splitting it into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, the string is: t14 t30 t31 t27 t5 t30 t2 t29 t22 t10 t6 t0 t31 t36 t5 t10 t3 t37 t14 t18 t25 t11 t1 t29 t11 t31 t6 t36 t5 t4 t36 t1 t9 t24 t3 t28 t5 t37 t25 t31 t13 t24 t6 t30 t31 t23 t9 t7.\n\nI notice that the first part is t14. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t14? Let's see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo, to produce t14, we need NT68. Now, does NT68 appear in the grammar? Yes, according to the given productions, NT68 \u2192 't14'.\n\nSo, for the first t14, the non-terminal is NT68. Now, looking at the grammar, NT68 must be derived from its production. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see that NT68 is a terminal itself because it's listed as 't14', so it doesn't have a production in the grammar. So, NT68 \u2192 't14' is a direct production.\n\nThus, the first symbol t14 can be obtained from NT68. But how does NT68 get its value? Since it's a terminal, it must be generated directly during a production.\n\nBut wait, NT68 is on the right-hand side of S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So, in order to get t14, the NT68 must be derived from a production. But in the given grammar, there's no production where NT68 is on the left; instead, it's only on the right. So, NT68 is a terminal, which means it's directly produced as 't14'.\n\nTherefore, the first part is fine. Now, moving to the next symbol, t30.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t30? Let's check:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 't30' Wait, no, looking through the list, I see:\n\nWait, the productions include NT26 \u2192 't2', NT24 \u2192 't25', etc. Hmm, actually, looking through the terminals:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT64 \u2192 't17'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT35 \u2192 't5'\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT96 \u2192 't20'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT38 \u2192 't36' (twice)\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT6 \u2192 't1'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT13 \u2192 't13'? Wait, no, in the grammar, there are entries like:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are some lines like:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't2'? No, looking at the given grammar, some have multiple productions but many are terminals:\n\nWait, for example, NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85 (among others), but also NT55 \u2192 't17', NT80 \u2192 't7', etc.\n\nWait, to get t30, I need to see which non-terminal ends with t30 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, the only terminals are listed as:\n\n- 't0' (multiple times)\n- 't1'\n- 't2'\n- 't3'\n- 't4'\n- 't5'\n- 't6'\n- 't7' (from NT90)\n- 't10' (from NT99)\n- 't11' (from NT11)\n- 't12' (from NT12)\n- 't13' (from NT83)\n- 't14' (NT68)\n- 't17' (NT64, NT99, NT55, NT26)\n- 't18' (from NT39)\n- 't20' (NT20 and NT96)\n- 't22' (NT22)\n- 't24' (NT26, NT53)\n- 't25' (NT27)\n- 't26' (NT24)\n- 't27' (NT62, NT53, NT6)\n- 't28' (NT83, NT37, NT25)\n- 't29' (NT44, NT88)\n- 't30' nowhere? Hmm, wait, in the string, the second symbol is t30, but in the given grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce 't30'? Looking through all the lines, I don't see 't30' being a terminal in any production. That's a problem because in the string, the first terminal is t14, which is produced by NT68 as a terminal, but the second is t30, which perhaps is a non-terminal that needs to produce t30 via a production.\n\nWait, but looking through all the production rules, the terminals are only certain ones like 't0', 't1', up to 't37', but not 't30'.

{"custom_id":"request-958","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure to understand how the non-terminals expand. The start symbol is S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So the string must be generated by expanding S into these non-terminals and then further expanding them.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t11 t27 t27 t7 t14 t12 t5 t9 t33 t25 t36 t31 t20 t17 t24 t36 t3 t5 t2 t29 t29 t0 t1 t37 t31 t1 t37 t27 t36 t12 t20 t17 t12 t36 t12 t33 t23 t30 t25 t7 t17 t6 t29 t1 t31 t36 t6 t1 t33.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from S. To do this, I can work backwards by starting from the end of the string and see if each part can be matched by a production in the grammar. Alternatively, I can try to build the string using the grammar's productions or parse it step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production either combines two non-terminals or a non-terminal expands into a terminal. Since all non-terminals are eventually replaced by terminals, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by replacing them with their expansions.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the grammar. The start symbol S splits into two branches: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So each branch can be considered separately.\n\nI think using a recursive descent parser approach might help here, but since I don't have the full parser, I'll try to parse the string step by step.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the beginning of the string. Looking at either production for S:\n\n- The first production is NT73 followed by NT20.\n- The second production is NT95 followed by NT83.\n\nLet me check if the string starts with either NT73 or NT95.\n\nThe first few tokens are t11, t27, t27, t7, t14, etc. So the first token is t11. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t11.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nCheck for non-terminals that can derive t11.\n\nNT33 has t33 as a terminal.\nNT14 has t14.\nNT25 has t25.\nNT27 has t27.\nNT9 has t9.\nNT11 has t11.\n\nLooking through the production rules for each non-terminal:\n\n- Let's check if any non-terminal produces t11. Looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT37, so it can only derive 't12' eventually.\nWait, no, NT11 has a production NT11 \u2192 NT37, but there's no production for NT37 leading to t11. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT37. NT37's productions include NT85 and NT55. NT85 \u2192 t5, which is '5'. Wait, no, NT85's terminal is '5'? Or is it 't5'? Wait, in the grammar, NT85 \u2192 t5. So 't5' is '5' in the terminal.\n\nWait, no, the grammar uses 't' followed by a number, like t3, t5, etc. So 't5' is the terminal symbol, which represents a string \"5\".\n\nSo NT11 has a production that eventually leads to t12 (from NT37\u2192t12). Wait no, wait:\n\nLooking back, I might have miswritten.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar rules again:\n\nLooking for NT11: NT11 \u2192 NT37.\n\nWait, and NT37 \u2192 NT85 NT55.\n\nWait, NT85 \u2192 t5 (terminal '5'), so 't5' is the terminal symbol. Similarly, NT55 \u2192 t17 (terminal '17').\n\nSo NT37 expands to '5' '17' as terminals, right? Because the productions for NT85 and NT55 are terminals.\n\nSo NT37 \u2192 t5 t17, which would be \"5 17\" as the string.\n\nBut in the string to match, early tokens are t11, which is a different terminal.\n\nSo if the first non-terminal is NT11, it would expand to NT37, which is 't5 t17', not t11. So that can't be.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t11. So perhaps the first non-terminal is NT11?\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT11 can only go to NT37, which further expands to 't5 t17'. So the first part of the string is t11, which doesn't match, unless I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, none seem to directly produce t11 except:\n\nLooking for where a non-terminal directly goes to 't11'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at all the productions:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT37. No direct production to 't11'.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 has t10, but NT10 is not a non-terminal.\n\nWait, checking all the productions, the terminals are things like t3, t5, t7, etc., and NT11 is only in a production that leads to t5 and t17.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t11, which isn't any of the terminal symbols listed in the grammar, except for t11 being in NT11. So unless NT11 can somehow produce 't11' directly, which it can't because looking at the grammar, NT11 only has a production to NT37.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The grammar's left-hand sides are the non-terminals, and their right-hand sides are either other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo all terminals are like t3, t5, etc. So each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and all other parts are non-terminals.\n\nSo in the string, every token starting with 't' is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with t11, which is a terminal. So the first token in the string must come from a production that directly gives t11.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t11.\n\nWait, so that's a problem. The string starts with t11, which is a terminal, so there must be a production that directly expands to t11.\n\nLooking through all the rules again:\n\nLooking at the productions, none directly produce t11. For example, looking at NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT62 NT27 or other, but none directly produce t11.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that directly produces t11.\n\nI don't see any NT that directly maps to t11.\n\nFor example, NT99 \u2192 t10, NT95 \u2192 t18, NT10 \u2192 t10, etc.\n\nWait, so the string starts with t11, but according to the grammar, there's no non-terminal that directly produces t11. That means it's impossible for the string to start with t11, because the grammar doesn't allow that.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it begins with a terminal that is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the string starts with t11, so unless I'm missing something, that indicates the string is not derivable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, I see that NT11 \u2192 NT37, and NT37 \u2192 NT85 NT55, and NT85 \u2192 t5, NT55 \u2192 t17. So nothing directly leads to t11. Therefore, the grammar can't produce t11 as a terminal, which is the start of the given string.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-963","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because each production is either a terminal or two terminals. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all from the NT non-terminals to terminals or other NTs. The string to check is a series of 't' followed by numbers.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each step produces one symbol at a time. So for the string to be generated, each symbol must be reachable through the right sequence of productions.\n\nLet me list the productions again to see what each NT can produce:\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n- S --> NT73 NT20\n- NT52 has several productions, including ones leading into t2, t3, t4, etc.\n- Many NTs are connected directly to 't' followed by a number, except some. For example, NT73 can produce t36. Wait, no, some NTs are already terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree for the given string. Let's see. The string is a sequence of t37, t30, t14, etc., down to t29, t36, etc.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT73 NT20. So the parse would start with NT73 and NT20 each expanding into something that produces t's.\n\nBut let's think: S can only produce two NTs, so the string must be a production of S. The first symbol in the string is t37. Let me see what NT37 produces.\n\nLooking for NT37 productions. Hmm, in the given grammar, NT37 is part of some productions. Oh, wait, in the grammar, NT37 appears as NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47 when NT24 \u2192 NT25, etc. Wait, maybe I'm mixing variables.\n\nWait, wait, the grammar has many NT productions. Let me try to find which NTs can produce a 't' and the specific t's in the string.\n\nBut perhaps instead of parsing, I can check if each t in the string corresponds to a production of some NT.\n\nWait, but each production in CNF produces two symbols. So each 't' must come from a production that results in a terminal. So for example, any NT that can produce a 't' followed by another 't' or so.\n\nBut in the grammar, many NTs have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47. Wait, but some NTs are directly 't' plus numbers. Like NT52 may produce a 't' followed by numbers, but I need to see the exact productions.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, many NTs end up producing a single 't' followed by some number. For example, I see NT38 \u2192 't36', NT44 \u2192 't4', NT49 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nSo each NT can only produce either a single terminal (like 't38') or a combination of two NTs, which themselves can produce terminals or more combinations.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a way to derive it starting from S, expanding two symbols each time, ending up with the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a recognition problem where each 't' must match the possible 't's from the NTs, and the structure follows the parse tree.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps a better approach is to note that the string is made up of various t's, and each t in the string must correspond to a path through the grammar where each step leads to that t.\n\nLet me check if each 't' in the string can be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt37, t30, t14, t25, t5, t25, t27, t0, t13, t16, t5, t16, t5, t35, t12, t30, t33, t11, t17, t33, t6, t2, t1, t37, t23, t6, t17, t7, t31, t1, t20, t1, t16, t35, t3, t33, t6, t31, t29, t36, t33, t30, t18, t9, t22, t11, t10, t10, t7.\n\nSo each of these t's must be produced by some NT in the grammar.\n\nFor each t in the string, check if there's a production that allows a NT to produce that t.\n\nFor example:\n- t37: Looking through the grammar, I see NT37 \u2192 something? Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n- NT16 \u2192 't16'\n- NT17 \u2192 't17'\n- NT18 \u2192 't18'\n- NT2 \u2192 't22'\nWait, looking for 't37'\u2014do any NTs produce t37? Let me scan all NT's productions to see if any NTs have a terminal with that number.\n\nLooking down the list:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't35' (Wait, looking at the grammar, NT35 produces t35? Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, there is NT35 \u2192 't35' and also NT35 \u2192 't3', 't13', 't5', 't6', 't33', etc. So 't37' must come from some NT that can produce 't37'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any production for NT37. Let me check again. Let me look for any NT whose production includes 't37'.\n\nLooking through the production list:\n\nHmm, I don't see any productions that directly produce t37. Wait, maybe indirectly.\n\nFor example, NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47. Then, if NT80 and NT47 can produce certain t's, perhaps combining them gives t37. But that seems unlikely because each production only handles either terminals or two NTs, each of which only produce t's when they end in 't'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Each production is a single symbol (two NTs or a terminal if it's a leaf). So in the given grammar, some NTs produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT37 is listed as part of some productions? Wait, no, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar includes:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't35', among others.\n- NT6 \u2192 't88'\n- NT7 \u2192 't73' etc. Hmm, but t37 isn't directly a production. So perhaps 't37' must come from a production that is itself a terminal, but in the grammar, which NTs produce t37?\n\nLooking again, in the list:\n\nNo NT in the grammar directly has a production to 't37'. So perhaps 't37' is not generated by this grammar, making the string invalid.\n\nWait, let me check again. The given grammar has NT37 as a production, but does any NT produce 't37'? Looking through all productions, I don't see any NT X where X \u2192 't37'. The closest is NT13 \u2192 't22', etc. So 't37' is not a terminal in this grammar.\n\nTherefore, since t37 is not present in any terminals, it's not possible for the string to be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-974","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals, possibly with the start symbol S appearing on the left. I notice that the grammar has several NT rules and then a bunch of terminal rules, which are indicated by the arrows to specific t followed by numbers. For example, NT55 \u2192 't17', meaning it's a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n\nt33 t28 t13 t22 t18 t23 t31 t9 t22 t27 t30 t14 t30 t2 t28 t0 t24 t9 t23 t18 t17 t2 t11 t28 t37 t22 t24 t25 t25 t29 t31 t17 t35 t12 t33 t18 t0 t22 t12 t9 t31 t17 t28 t14 t36 t27 t31 t3 t16 t14.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens, but each is a single character or a multi-digit number. But from looking at the grammar, I see that most of these are single-digit terminals, though like 't33' which is two digits. So I need to parse this string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nLet me try to outline the approach I can take. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parsing approach. I'll start by checking the top-level grammar rules to see which non-terminal can generate the start of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, starting with S, I need to see if the string starts with either NT73 followed by NT20 or NT95 followed by NT83.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t33 and t28. I need to check if either production can lead to this.\n\nWait, let's see: NT73 is a non-terminal. Let's look at the production rules for NT73. Scanning through the list, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nAnd both NT62 and NT27 are non-terminals. So NT73 can't be a terminal; it must expand further. Similarly, NT20 has a production:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT73 NT20 would expand to (NT62 NT27)(NT27 NT68). But the start of the string is t33 t28, which suggests that S must be expanding to something that directly starts with t33. But both NT73 and NT62 are non-terminals, so this might not be the right path. Alternatively, maybe the productions can chain to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should trace the string step by step, seeing if it can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach with memoization would be better. Let me consider that.\n\nAnother approach is to model the parsing as a series of steps, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until all are terminals matching the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a CYK algorithm is appropriate since the grammar is in CNF. But implementing CYK would be time-consuming, and the string is quite long.\n\nAnother idea is to see what the start symbol S can derive. Let's see what the first tokens could correspond to.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t33. Let's check if any non-terminal directly produces t33.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT53 \u2192 't11'\n- NT62 \u2192 't24'\n- NT99 \u2192 't16'\n- NT38 \u2192 't22'\n- NT27 \u2192 't27'\n- NT35 \u2192 't5'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT39 \u2192 't6'\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\n- NT45 \u2192 't44' ... wait, no, looking again, some terminals like:\n\nLooking for any NT that produces 't33':\n\nNT... I see in the rules:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't20'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT99 \u2192 't16'\n- NT64 \u2192 't17'\n- NT99 \u2192 't22'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't13'\n- NT49 \u2192 't9'\n- NT82 \u2192 't5'\n- NT88 \u2192 't28'\n- NT80 \u2192 't7'\n- NT53 \u2192 't23'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT27 \u2192 't33'\nAh, here we go. NT27 \u2192 't33'. So one possibility is that the first part of the string is derived from NT27.\n\nNow, since S expands into NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83, let's see if one of these can derive NT27.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the parse tree. Let me try to map the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t33, which is NT27 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo, the string is t33 followed by t28 t13..., which comes from... Since NT27 is expanded directly to t33, the remainder of the string after t33 must come from NT20.\n\nLooking at the production S \u2192 NT73 NT20: after the initial NT73 (which doesn't produce a terminal directly), we have NT20.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's process the first part of the string: t33. Which NT could produce t33? Looking through the terminals:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't33'. So perhaps NT27 is the first non-terminal to be expanded.\n\nSo, NT27's production is looking for ways to expand into other symbols, which eventually lead to the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT27:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT62 NT27 (recursive)\nNT27 \u2192 NT49 NT4\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the provided rules:\n\nNT62 \u2192 't24' [Wait, no, that's NT62 \u2192 NT24? Wait, no, looking back, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, no. Looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT24, which is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through the rules for NT27:\n\nLooking at the list of rules for NT27, I don't see anything direct.

{"custom_id":"request-980","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string I'm testing is a sequence of symbols that might correspond to these rules. My task is to figure out if the grammar can produce this exact string.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down the grammar and the string to get a clear picture. The grammar has non-terminals on the left side of the arrows, and the right side consists of other non-terminals and terminal symbols. The string I have is in the form of 'ts' like 't5 t11 t25...' and so on. My initial thought is that these 't' followed by numbers might be terminals, so the string is a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, to check if the string is generated, I can parse it step by step by seeing if each part can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nI think a good approach is to use top-down parsing, starting from the start symbol S and expanding it according to the grammar rules until I reach the terminals, which should match the string exactly.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I see it has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo the string must start with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Let me check the string. The first part is 't5 t11...', which would correspond to NT73 and NT20 if t5 is part of NT73 and t11 is part of NT20, but I'm not sure. Wait, no\u2014the string is a series of terminals, so each component after S is an NT followed by a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar, each production is either non-terminals or terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, but in the grammar, some productions have terminals like 't3', 't5', etc. So each production can either be a terminal or a combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step. The string is:\n\nt5 t11 t25 t24 t16 t27 t23 t7 t35 t22 t36 t17 t22 t28 t1 t37 t0 t30 t33 t5 t3 t29 t7 t16 t18 t18 t37 t10 t1 t18 t13 t9 t7 t22 t25 t2 t14 t16 t30 t25 t2 t7 t2 t12 t3 t2 t18 t35 t29 t37\n\nThat's a lot. It might help to parse it in smaller chunks. Let me first see if I can identify the structure.\n\nThe entire string must be generated by the start symbol S, which either goes to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nLet me see if the first few letters can be matched by one of these. The first symbol is t5. Suppose S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nThen, NT73 must generate a string, and NT20 must generate another string, such that their combined output is the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT73's productions:\n\nNT73 can go to NT62 NT27 or NT47 NT44. Neither of those are terminals, so probably needs further expansion. Wait, but in the given string, the first part is t5, which could be the result of NT73 expanding into terminals. Let me check the rules for NT73.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT73 has two productions:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT47 NT44\n\nAnd NT62 is followed by NT53, and NT53 goes to 't11' (from the grammar: NT53 \u2192 't11'). So if NT62 can derive 't11', and NT27 can derive 't5', then NT73 would produce t11 t5, which doesn't match the first t5. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking for t5 elsewhere.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string's first part is t5, so maybe NT73 produces t5 as a terminal, but in the grammar, NT73's productions don't have any terminal; they go to other NTs. So NT73 must expand into other NTs, which in turn expand into more NTs or terminals. So, for example, if NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, then NT62 must produce something, and NT27 something else.\n\nLooking up NT62's productions: NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT53. NT53 \u2192 't11', and NT52 has several productions. Let's see, for example, NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47. Let me check if NT52 can reach a terminal.\n\nWait, NT52 can go to NT80 NT47, and both might need to expand further. NT80 can produce NT71 NT99 or NT22 NT45, etc. This seems like a long chain, and it's possible, but I'm trying to see if it can produce 't5' eventually.\n\nAlternatively, if S starts with NT95, let's see. NT95's productions are:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT39 NT37\n- NT95 \u2192 NT63 NT2\n\nLooking at NT39: NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37. NT51 \u2192 NT64 NT90. NT64 \u2192 NT24 NT95 or NT95? Wait, let me check. The grammar for 64: NT64 \u2192 NT24 NT95. So if NT64 goes to NT24 NT95, that could get into a loop. Alternatively, looking at NT95 again, if NT95's production is NT39 NT37 or NT63 NT2, let's see if any of those produce terminals.\n\nFor example, if NT63 is present, its productions are NT99, NT22, or NT49. NT99 has several terminals, like t10, t16, t27, etc.\n\nBut looking back, the initial string starts with t5, which isn't an immediate terminal in any of the initial NTs like NT73 or NT95. So perhaps the initial split isn't correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Each production starts from S, so the entire string is generated starting from S, expanding non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree for the given string, starting from the top.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t5, t11, t25, t24, etc. Let me assume that the start symbol generates NT95 and NT83 because t95 is later in the string.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to see what each non-terminal can expand into terminals.\n\nLet me look at each non-terminal and see what's possible.\n\nNT52: has several terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT52 can go to 't11' (from earlier in NT52 \u2192 NT11 NT6). So if any path leads to NT52, it can produce a terminal 't11', 't12', 't16', etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47. NT80 can produce NT71 NT99 or NT22 NT45. NT71 goes to NT68 NT2, and NT22 to NT44 NT63, etc. This could generate several terminals, but I'm not sure if it can produce t5.\n\nAnother approach: check each non-terminal for any direct production to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't3' at one point (from earlier in the grammar: NT52 \u2192 't3'. Wait, no, checking the full grammar, the left-hand sides have various non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Actually, in the grammar, some productions have terminals as their right-hand sides, like NT52 \u2192 't35' or 't6' in some cases.\n\nWait, let me see. In the given grammar, for example, there are entries where a non-terminal is assigned a terminal. For example, NT64 \u2192 't4'.

The string to check is \"t36 t17.\" Alright, let's dive into this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and either a single terminal or a single non-terminal on the right. Looking at the grammar, it's a bit long, but I can see that each rule branches out, which suggests a lot of possible derivations. \n\nThe target string is \"t36 t17,\" which has two terminal symbols. I should start from the top-level symbol, which is S. The S rules are S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So from S, each production gives two non-terminals. Both NT73 NT20 and NT95 NT83 are on the right side, so any derivation starting from S will produce two parts.\n\nLooking at the string, it's two parts separated by a space, so the entire string is a sequence of two terminals. That suggests that each part of the production (NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83) must each derive down to a single terminal.\n\nLet me focus on each part of the production separately. Starting with the first part of S: NT73 -> NT62 NT27, and so on. Wait, but the top-level is S, which branches to two NTs, so each of those NTs must produce a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t36 t17,\" which is two terminals, so each NT in S's production must produce a single terminal. Let me check how each NT can lead to a terminal.\n\nLooking for NTs that directly correspond to terminals. Scanning the grammar rules, I see several NTs that end with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT6 -> 't88', NT11 -> 't12', etc. Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, no, some NTs have 't' symbols in their productions. For example, NT73 can go to NT62 NT27, but further down, NT62 has a rule NT62 -> 't24' or 't27' or others. Similarly, NT68 has a rule NT68 -> 't14'.\n\nLet me try to find how each NT can produce a terminal. Let's take the first part of S: NT73 and NT20.\n\nStarting with NT73. From NT73, the rules are NT73 -> NT62 NT27 and NT73 -> NT12 NT47. So from NT73, it can branch into two NTs each time. I need to see if NT73 can directly produce a terminal. Looking through the production rules, I see NT55 -> 't17', NT49 -> 't3', and others. Hmm, none of the NTs immediately leading from NT73 end in 't'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look deeper. For example, NT62 has a production NT62 -> 't24' and others like NT62 -> NT53. So if I have NT62, one way is to produce 't24' directly.\n\nWait, no, NT62 has multiple options. Let's trace back. From S, the first option is NT73 and NT20. So both NT73 and NT20 need to produce single terminals.\n\nFor NT73: Looking deeper, NT73 can go to NT62 NT27. Then NT62 can go to 't24' or other NTs. For example, NT62 can go to 't24' directly if there's a production NT62 -> 't24'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT62 -> 't24', yes, there's a rule NT62 -> 't24'\n\nSo from NT62, if you take the production to 't24', then NT73 can derive 't24' if the other part leads to a terminal. But wait, NT73 -> NT62 NT27, so if NT62 becomes 't24' and NT27 leads to 't33' or others, but the string we're looking for is 't36 t17'. Hmm, maybe I'm going the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT73 can directly produce a terminal in one step. Wait, no, all NTs on the right are two NTs, none produce a terminal in one step except the ones that directly have 't' symbols.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT52 has a rule NT52 -> 't17', for example. So not all NTs produce terminals; some still require further expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider the string \"t36 t17.\" The first part is 't36.' Looking at the grammar, which NTs lead directly to 't36'? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice several NTs ending with 't36', like NT62 -> 't24' or 't27', but also NT26, etc. Wait, no, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't36' except NT62: Wait, no, checking:\n\nWait, wait, let me go through the rules again. For example:\n\n- NT62 -> 't24' or other NTs\n- NT53 -> 't11'\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT37 -> 't31'\n- Hmm, perhaps I'm missing. Wait, no, I don't see any production for any NT directly going to 't36' in the initial expansion. Let me confirm.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT62: NT62 -> 't24' | NT53\n- NT53: NT53 -> 't11'\n- So NT62 can produce 't24' or 't11' after further expansion.\n\nWait, so if I have 't36' as the first part, is there any NT that can lead to that?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the productions. Maybe I missed an NT that leads directly to 't36,' but I don't see any. Let me check each NT:\n\n- NT55 -> 't17'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT64 -> 't17'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT47 -> 't27'\n- NT73 -> 't36' ?\n\nWait, wait a minute. Looking at the production for NT73: There's a rule NT73 -> 't36', because the last line:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- But looking at the continuation, for example, the line says \"NT73 -> NT62 NT27\". Wait, no, I don't see any production where NT73 directly goes to 't36' except perhaps in another rule.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\n- The first line is S -> NT73 NT20\n- Then NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n- ...\n- Then I spot \"NT73 -> NT62 NT27\"\n- And another line: \"NT73 -> NT12 NT47\"\n- Hmm, no direct 't36' from NT73. So how does 't36' come about?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let's see: 't36' is produced by NT62 when it takes the production NT62 -> 't24', but we need 't36.' Wait, perhaps another NT produces 't36'?\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. Looking again:\n\nI see \"NT62 -> 't24' | ...\", so 't24' is produced, not 't36'. Hmm, but in the line above, wait, I see \"NT73 -> 't36'\" Is that correct? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list, yes, at the very end, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- But wait, no, that's not 't36'. Wait, maybe another NT. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nWait, looking for any NT that ends with 't36'. I see:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT39 -> 't6'\n- NT37 -> 't31'\n- NT64 -> 't17'\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT44 -> 't4' and 't16' etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT directly leading to 't36' except maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, perhaps some of the NTs have rules that eventually produce 't36,' but that would require multiple expansions.\n\nWait, let's see the other terminal in the string is 't17.'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. The grammar provided seems to follow that structure. Each rule is S -> NT followed by something, or it breaks down into smaller non-terminals until it hits terminals like 't' followed by a number or letters like NT.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is \"t35 t28\". Hmm, wait, no, it's \"t35 t28\"\u2014each token is separated by a space, so that's two tokens: \"t35\" and \"t28\".\n\nNow, the grammar's rules seem to have \"t\" followed by numbers as terminals. So each \"t\" token is a terminal, followed by numbers. But looking at the rules, for example, NT53 might produce \"t11\", so \"t11\" is a terminal. Similarly, other NT rules end with \"t\" followed by a number, as seen in the rules.\n\nGiven that, the string is essentially \"t35\" followed by \"t28\", so each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nNow, in the grammar, the top-level non-terminal is S, which produces NT followed by NT. So S -> NTsomething NTsomethingElse. Each NT something is a non-terminal, so for the string \"t35 t28\" to come from S, each part must be derived from the NTs.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\nThe string is two terminals. Since S expands to two NTs, each of which can then expand further. So each \"t35\" and \"t28\" must come from the respective NTs.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT35 can produce \"t3\", \"t5\", etc. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT35 -> t3 and t5. So \"t35\" is not a direct terminal; but maybe it's built from other rules. Wait, no, in the grammar, every production ending with NT... is a non-terminal, but some of these have productions that end with terminal \"t\" followed by numbers. For example, NT55 -> t17, NT37 -> t31, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces \"t35\". Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT38 -> 't36', but no NT35. Wait, let's see:\n\nScanning through the rules, yes, I see NT35 has two productions: NT35 -> t3, and NT35 -> t5. So \"t35\" is not a production that exists. Wait, no, that can't be, because \"t35\" is part of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is constructed. The string is \"t35 t28\", so each \"t35\" and \"t28\" is a terminal. But in the grammar, the NTs don't have a production that generates \"t35\" as a terminal. Instead, the NTs have productions that generate single terminal symbols like \"t3\", \"t5\", etc. So \"t35\" would not be a possible terminal because each NT only produces a single terminal symbol at each step.\n\nHmm, so for \"t35\" to be in the string, the NT token must have a production that ends in \"t35\". But looking through the rules, the NTs never generate a two-token terminal string. Each production either goes to a terminal single token or another NT pair.\n\nTherefore, \"t35\" can't be generated directly. Wait, but maybe \"t35\" is somehow derived through several steps. Let me check if any NT rule can produce \"t35\" as a single token.\n\nLooking again, all the NT rules have as their right-hand side either two NTs, or a single terminal like 't3' or 't5'. For example, NT35 can produce t3 or t5, but no production where NT35 directly produces 't35'.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that \"t35\" cannot be generated from any non-terminal in this grammar because no production rule exists that yields 't35' as a single terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t35 t28\" can't be generated by this grammar because both \"t35\" and \"t28\" require a production that produces these two tokens, which don't exist in the grammar.\n\nSo, the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-26","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t11 t27 t17\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex with a lot of production rules, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form entails. CNF requires that each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF since all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t11 t27 t17\". Since the terminals are separated by spaces, I think the input string is divided into tokens like \"t11\", \"t27\", and \"t17\". Each of these must be generated by the grammar through some production rules.\n\nMy approach will be to backtrack from the string to the start symbol S, trying to find a derivation path. I'll consider each token and see if there's a production rule that can produce it, starting from the end.\n\nLet's start by looking at the string: t11, t27, t17. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S can go to either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So, I need to see if these combinations can lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the rightmost token \"t17\", I'll check if there's a production rule that directly produces t17. Scanning through, I see NT64 \u2192 t17. So, the last token could come from NT64.\n\nBut wait, \"t17\" is just a terminal, so that's the end of that. Now, looking at the middle token \"t27\". From the grammar, NT27 \u2192 t27. So, the middle token is produced by NT27.\n\nNow, the first token \"t11\" needs to be produced. Checking the grammar, I don't see a production rule where NT directly generates t11. So, this approach might not work since \"t11\" might not appear as a terminal in any rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first token is part of a larger non-terminal production. Let's consider that \"t11\" could be the result of a non-terminal expanding into it. Looking back at NT rules, I don't see a production that ends with t11, except perhaps some I'm missing. Wait, perhaps it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me re-examine the non-terminals. Looking for NTs that can lead to \"t11\". From the list, I see NT82 \u2192 t11, because looking at the rules:\n\nNT82 -> NT51 NT84\n\nBut NT84 has a rule NT84 \u2192 t1, so that's a terminal. Wait, looking further:\n\nLooking for production rules where NT51 goes somewhere. From the given rules, NT51 \u2192 NT64 NT90, and NT64 \u2192 t17, and NT90 \u2192 NT38 NT95. NT38 has a rule NT38 \u2192 t29, t16, or t27, t31, t5, etc. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a path that can produce t11 via multiple steps. Let me look if any NTs directly produce t11. From the rules:\n\nLooking for a rule where A \u2192 a where a is t11. Checking the list, I see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT99 \u2192 t10, t16, etc., but not t11.\n\nWait, maybe \"t11\" is part of a longer production. Let me see if any NTs produce a string that includes t11. For example, NT12 \u2192 t11.\n\nYes, here's a rule: NT12 \u2192 t11. So if the string starts with \"t11\", that could come from NT12. So then, perhaps the string \"t11 t27 t17\" comes from NT12 \u2192 t11, NT27 \u2192 t27, NT17 \u2192 t17. So, maybe the entire string is generated by some combination of these.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, the entire string would be the combination of two NTs expanding into three terminals, but the string has three tokens, so each NT expands into two tokens? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, \"t11 t27 t17\" is three tokens. So, perhaps each NT produces one token, but that doesn't make sense because each NT in the grammar is a non-terminal, and each rule either produces two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nBut for \"t11 t27 t17\", we need three terminals. So, perhaps one of the NTs expands into two terminals and the other into one, but the start symbol S gives two NTs. So, that would make the string have two NT expansions, which could be a combination of terminals and non-terminals, but in this case, all three are terminals.\n\nWait, that can't be. If S is NT1 NT2, and each NT1 and NT2 expand into a terminal, we would get two terminals, but the string has three. So, perhaps one NT expands into two terminals, and the other expands into one? But that would still give three tokens, but the way the grammar is structured, each NT either produces one terminal or two NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps the NTs can produce sequences of terminals by expanding their non-terminals. Let me consider whether any NTs can produce two terminals through their expansion.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62. Then, looking at NT38 \u2192 t29, t31, t5, t35, t26, t16, t33, t27, t9, t39, t55, t4, t3, t13, t11, etc. So, NT38 can directly produce a terminal like t27. Similarly, NT62 \u2192 t24. But if NT99 produces two non-terminals that then produce t27 and t24, that would give two terminals. So, maybe there's a path where two NTs expand into two terminals, and the other NT in S expands into another, making three terminals in total.\n\nWait, but I think my approach is getting tangled. Let me try another way.\n\nThe string is t11, t27, t17. So, three tokens. Looking at the grammar, I need to see if there's a way for each token to be produced via a chain of productions.\n\nLet me start by considering each token one by one.\n\n- t17: Looking for a rule that produces t17. From the grammar, NT64 \u2192 t17. So, t17 is produced directly by NT64.\n\n- t27: Similarly, NT27 \u2192 t27, so directly by NT27.\n\n- t11: Looking for a rule that produces t11. From the grammar, NT12 \u2192 t11. So, directly by NT12.\n\nSo, each token can be directly produced by an NT. But how do they fit into the start symbol S, which is NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83?\n\nWait, that's the issue. The start symbol S produces two NTs, so the derived string would consist of the concatenation of the derivations of these two NTs. So, for the string to be three tokens, one of the NTs must produce two tokens, and the other one token.\n\nLooking at the possible NTs:\n\n- NT73: Looking at the rules, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. NT62 \u2192 t24, so that's one terminal. NT27 is another rule that produces t27. So, NT73 can produce \"t24 t27\".\n\n- NT20: Let's see, NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68. NT27 \u2192 t27, and NT68 \u2192 t14. So, this produces \"t27 t14\".\n\nOther options for the start symbol's NTs:\n\nLooking at NT95 \u2192 t18. Wait, no, in the rules, NT95 \u2192 NT35 NT39. Then, NT35 can produce t3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, let's check each possibility for the start symbol.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT73 NT20, then:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 \u2192 t24 t27\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68 \u2192 t27 t14\n\nSo, combining, S would produce t24 t27 t27 t14, which is four tokens, not matching our three-token string.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, but maybe NT73 produces two non-terminals, and one of them expands into two terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and how it works.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with nonterminals S and NT followed by numbers. It looks like all the productions are in the form of two nonterminals on the left and two on the right, except for the terminals, which are represented by names like t31, t27, etc. Some nonterminals seem to be directly connected to terminals, which probably act as leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is \"t31 t27 t1\". Let me break this down into individual tokens: t31, t27, t1. I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I see it has two productions:\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo S can generate either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Let me explore both options to see if any of them can lead to the target string.\n\nStarting with the first production, S -> NT73 NT20. I need to see if NT73 can produce t31 and t20, and NT20 can produce t27. Wait, but the string has t31, t27, t1, which is three tokens. Since S produces two nonterminals, the parse tree would have S at the top, and two nodes in the next level, each producing more nonterminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I might have to find a way to get three terminals. Each nonterminal in the grammar can produce either another nonterminal or a terminal. So, for example, NT52 has a production -> NT35 NT96, which can lead to more nonterminals, but somewhere down the line, these nonterminals have productions to terminals.\n\nLet me look at NT73 and NT20:\n\nFrom S -> NT73 NT20.\n\nNT73 has a production -> NT62 NT27. So NT73 can produce NT62 and NT27. Then NT62 can produce NT26 and NT27 (from NT62 -> NT26 NT27).

The string we're testing is \"t31 t9 t20 t1\". I'll split this into tokens: \"t31\", \"t9\", \"t20\", \"t1\".\n\nSince each production can only result in terminals or non-terminals, and in Chomsky normal form, each production for a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form actually has each production being either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each production for a non-terminal N is either N -> AB, N -> A, or N -> a, where A, B, and N are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nBut in our grammar, looking at some rules, like NT55 -> 't17', which is a terminal. But others like NT38 -> NT26 NT20 are two non-terminals. So, this grammar is in CNF except for the rules where a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either A->BC or A->a. So in our grammar, all non-terminals have productions that are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So it's indeed in CNF because every production has either two symbols on the right or a single terminal. So that's correct.\n\nNow, I'll need to see if \"t31 t9 t20 t1\" can be derived from S. Since S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83, let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's see if \"t31\" can be a terminal in any non-terminal production. Looking at the list, NT44 -> 't31' is one, which is helpful. So if we can derive \"t31\" from NT44, that works.\n\nNext, looking at the string, the second token is \"t9\". Checking for productions that result in 't9', I see NT49 -> 't9', as well as NT99 is 't16' and so on. So, \"t9\" can come from NT49.\n\nThird token: \"t20\". Looking for terminals that are 't20'. Checking the rules, NT84 -> 't1', which is different. Looking at NT20, the rules are:\n\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n- NT20 -> NT38\n- Wait, looking back, NT20 is on the left side of multiple productions. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, I think I made a mistake.

Oh, no, wait, I think I confused NT20 with another. Wait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I think I might have misread the NT20 rules. From the initial list:\n\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n- NT20 -> NT38\n\nWait, but that can't be because in terms of Chomsky normal form, a rule should be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps the production is that NT20 can go to NT27 NT68, or perhaps another path. Wait, in the given grammar, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\n\nand\n\nNT20 -> NT38.\n\nWait, but I'm seeing under NT20: -> NT27 NT68 and -> NT38. So that would mean two options for NT20: either produce NT27 followed by NT68, or produce NT38. Wait, that's actually allowed in CNF because each production has either two non-terminals or a single non-terminal. But wait, NT20 would be on the left side, so:\n\nWait, actually, for Chomsky normal form, each production must be A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-46","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t31 t2 t2 t1\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the start symbol S. The two productions for S are:\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar starts with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. The string I'm given is \"t31 t2 t2 t1\". That breaks down into four tokens: t31, t2, t2, t1.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from S using the grammar. Let's see how the tokens correspond to the rules.\n\nLooking at the production rules, some terminals (like t*) correspond to NTs. For example, t31 corresponds to NT44, t2 corresponds to NT2, t1 corresponds to NT11, and so on. So I can represent the string as a sequence of these non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBreaking down \"t31 t2 t2 t1\" into NTs:\n- t31 \u2192 NT44\n- t2 \u2192 NT2\n- t2 \u2192 NT2\n- t1 \u2192 NT11\n\nSo the string becomes NT44 NT2 NT2 NT11.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S, which branches into either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Let's see which branch makes sense. Looking at the given string, I see that the string has NT44, which might connect to the second branch (NH95 \u2192 NT...). But let's explore both options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20\nThis would require both NT73 and NT20 in the string. Looking at our tokens, do we have NT73 or NT20? The tokens are NT44, NT2, NT2, NT11. Not seeing NT73 or NT20, so this path might not work.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT95 NT83\nSimilarly, this requires NT95 and NT83. From our string, we have NT44, which seems unrelated. So maybe S doesn't directly produce this string, but perhaps through other productions.\n\nWait, but both S options don't include NT44. Hmm, that might be a problem. But perhaps the NTs in the string can derive down to the required symbols.\n\nLet me see what rules produce NT44. Looking through the productions:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT2 NT95 (production 49)\nNt2 \u2192 something else? NT2's production is NT47 \u2192 NT49 NT26, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for NT44's production: I see NT44 \u2192 NT26 NT20? No, let me check the list.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT44:\n- NT44 \u2192 NT26 NT20 (Wait, no, checking the list: I see NT44 is under NT24's production, but that's for NT24. Hmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me list out all NT productions that lead to NT44.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't31' (if it's a terminal) No, because NT44 is a non-terminal, so it cannot produce a terminal directly unless I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking again. Wait, in the given grammar, under NT44, there's \"NT44 -> 't31'\", but that's actually a terminal. So NT44 directly produces t31. Similarly, some NTs produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, but in NT44's productions, looking through the list:\n\nLooking for rules where the left side is NT44. Wait, the provided grammar only shows production rules for NTs but some are terminals. Wait, the list is a mix of NTs and terminals, but each line is A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a.\n\nWait, I need to parse each line correctly. Each line is a production rule for a non-terminal A.\n\nLooking through the lines again:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT12 NT47\n- NT55 -> 't17'\nWait, so when it's written as \"NT55 -> 't17'\", that means NT55 directly produces 't17'.\n\nSimilarly, for NT44: Checking the list, I see:\n\n- NT44 -> 't31' (so NT44 is a terminal 't31')? Or is it a rule? Wait, no, I think that's a production of NT44: NT44 \u2192 't31' means that NT44 can produce the terminal t31. So that's a terminal. But that doesn't make sense because NT44 is a non-terminal and should derive into other NTs. Wait, but in the grammar, some NTs can directly produce terminals, which means they are terminal symbols.\n\nWait, aha. So, in the grammar, when a production for NT X is written as -> a, where a is a terminal, that means NT X is a terminal and can't produce further. So, for example, NT44 -> 't31' is a terminal production, meaning NT44 is a terminal symbol and can't be expanded further. So in our string, we have 't31' as a terminal, so that's allowed if the grammar allows NT44 to produce it.\n\nWait, wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, any rule that ends with a terminal symbol (like NT35 -> 't3') is a terminal production, meaning that the non-terminal can only produce that terminal, no further expansion.\n\nSo, looking at the production for NT44, NT44 -> 't31' means that NT44 is a terminal and can only produce 't31', no further.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first token is 't31', which is exactly what NT44 produces. So, in the derivation, somewhere, there must be an NT44 that directly produces 't31'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first element is 't31', corresponding to NT44.\n\nSo, let's see how the entire string can be generated.\n\nThe string is 't31 t2 t2 t1', which in terms of NTs is NT44 NT2 NT2 NT11.\n\nNow, to find a derivation starting from S.\n\nLooking at S, the possible first steps are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nLet's explore each possibility.\n\nFirst, option 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n\nThen, NT73 must derive into some expressions, and NT20 must derive into others.\n\nLooking at NT73's productions:\n\n- NT73 can produce NT62 NT27\n- NT73 can produce NT12 NT47\n\nLooking at NT20:\n\n- NT20 can produce NT27 NT68\n- NT20 can produce 't17' (since there's a production NT20 \u2192 't17')\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the list has:\n\nNT20 -> 't17' as a production? Or is it another NT?\n\nWait, let me check under NT20:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n\nWait, no, let me check the line:\n\nI think the line is \"NT20 -> 't17'\", but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's an error, but more likely, let me check.\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn the provided list, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> 't17': Oh, yes, in the line \"NT20 -> 't17'\", so NT20 is a terminal that produces the string 't17'.\n\nSo, in option 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20, and NT20 \u2192 't17', so the first part of the string after S would be something derived from NT73, followed by 't17'.\n\nWait, but our string starts with 't31', which is NT44, but in this path, the first part is NT73, which produces downstream symbols. So, seems not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The initial string is \"t31 t2 t2 t1\", which corresponds to NT44 NT2 NT2 NT11.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then S would produce NT95 and NT83. Let's see if that helps.\n\nLooking at NT95:\n\n- NT95"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t31 t30 t31 t27 t0`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production either generates two non-terminals or directly a terminal. This structure is useful for parsing with algorithms like CYK, but since I'm doing it manually, I'll have to track how the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules. The string has five tokens, which suggests that each token is either a terminal or part of a non-terminal derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.

So for a string of length n, the structure of the derivation must produce exactly n symbols, with each production contributing either a terminal or leading to more productions.\n\nI think the process is to see if each token can be matched by a direct production or if the tokens can be grouped into pairs that derive from a parent non-terminal.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string in order:\n\n1. t31\n2. t30\n3. t31\n4. t27\n5. t0\n\nNow, let's look at each terminal and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- t31 comes from NT44, NT49, NT68, etc.\n\nWait, let's map out each terminal to possible sources.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can make a list of non-terminals that produce each terminal:\n\n- t30: from NT64 (since NT64 \u2192 t24, but wait, looking at the rules, does any non-terminal directly produce t30?

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how the non-terminals can derive into terminals.

For example, 't31' could correspond to a non-terminal that expands into 't31', which is likely NT4 because in the grammar, NT44 \u2192 't4'. So 't4' would come from NT44. Similarly, 't30' might be from NT30, but wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT30.

{"custom_id":"request-88","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t35 t31 t29 t4 t3 t37`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure CFGs where each production rule is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, applicable.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the production rules seem to follow CNF. Each rule on the left side (like S, NT52, etc.) leads to exactly two other symbols on the right. Some of them are terminals, others are non-terminals. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t35 t31 t29 t4 t3 t37`. Each of these is a terminal symbol because they end with a number, not a capital letter which I assume represents non-terminals. The first step is to see if this string can be derived by some sequence of productions in the grammar.\n\nI know that for a CFG in CNF, a string of length n (geq 2) can be generated only if it can be broken down in a way that corresponds to the structure of the grammar. Each production rule directly leads to two symbols, which can themselves be terminals or non-terminals. So, to parse the string, we can use a recursive approach or a table-driven method like CYK.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I might try to see if the string can be broken down into smaller parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me look at the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t35 t31 t29 t4 t3 t37\n\nThat's six tokens, so n=6. The minimal number of productions needed is log2(n), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each terminal as being produced by a single non-terminal symbol directly. So I need to find a path of productions that leads to this sequence.\n\nLet me see if I can backtrack from the string. Each pair of symbols in the string could be part of a production.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nt35 is a terminal. I need to find a production rule where the left-hand side non-terminal (NT) leads directly to t35 and something else. Looking for 't35' in the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLooking at NT35 -> t3. That's not helpful because 3 is a number, which would be a terminal. Wait, no, t35 is a terminal, right? Wait, in the productions, I see:\n\nNT35: NT35 -> t3\n\nWait, that's just a single terminal, but in our string, it's t35. So unless NT35 can produce t35 directly, which it doesn't, because the production NT35 -> t3 is just 't3'. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nI see NT35 -> t3. So that's a production that would produce 't3'. So if I have t35 in the string, it's a single terminal symbol, which would require a production NT35 -> 't35'. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT35 -> t35. Instead, NT35->t3. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, that might be a problem. Because in the string, the first symbol is t35, but in the grammar, NT35 can only produce 't3', not 't35'. So perhaps that's an issue. That might indicate that the string cannot be generated because the first symbol doesn't have a matching production.\n\nBut let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking through all the NT35 productions:\n\nNT35 -> t3 (from NT1, etc.) Is there any other production for NT35? No. So if the string starts with t35, there's no production that directly allows that.\n\nWait, so that would mean that the string can't be generated because t35 can't be tokenized as a single terminal. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 't35' isn't a token but is formed by multiple productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built recursively. Maybe t35 is a single symbol that comes from a longer production. Wait, but in the grammar, all the terminals are single letters or digits. So 't35' would directly come from a production like NT35 -> 't35', but I don't see such a rule.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, I see that many NT symbols have productions that end with 't' followed by numbers, but the individual entries are like:\n\nNT35 -> t3\n\nNT49 -> t3\n\nNT64 -> t17\n\nNT99 -> t10\n\nBTW, in the string we have t35, t31, etc. But in the grammar, looking at all N terminals, none have a production that outputs 't35' directly. So that seems to be a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the t35 is constructed from multiple steps. However, since the grammar is in CNF, it can only produce two symbols at each step. So for example, to produce 't35', we would need a production NT35 -> NTa NTb, where NTa and NTb produce 't' and then '35', but wait, that's not possible because 't35' is a single terminal, and to get 't35' as a single token, it would have to be a direct production, which it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is made up of multiple symbols, and some of them combine. But in this case, t35 isn't a single terminal but the problem is that in the grammar, NT35 can only produce 't3', not 't35'.\n\nSo that suggests that 't35' cannot be produced by any NT, making the string invalid.\n\nBut let me double-check. Did I read the grammar correctly? For NT35, the only production is NT35 -> t3.\n\nSo the string begins with t35. If the string is t35 followed by t31, etc., this t35 cannot be produced because the grammar doesn't have a rule where NT35 directly generates 't35'. Instead, it only generates 't3'.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the grammar again. Maybe I made a mistake in reading. The grammar provided has:\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\nNT35 -> t35? No, I don't see that. There's a production for NT135?

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. I notice that most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs, except when a terminal is present, like NT38 \u2192 't36'.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is `t35 t31 t29 t4 t13 t20`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, so the string is a sequence of these.\n\nI'll break down the string into individual terminals: 35, 31, 29, 4, 13, 20.\n\nNow, I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar. I'll try to construct a derivation starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start rule: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.

Then each of these needs to go further.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT53 NT24, but wait, in the grammar, NT62 is a rule: NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT27? Wait, in the given grammar, looking back, I see NT62 is actually a terminal 't24'. Oh wait, the grammar entries have some NTs pointing to terminals. So let's check all the NT symbols to see if they lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT44 \u2192 't4', NT49 \u2192 't23', NT55 \u2192 't17', NT80 \u2192 't7', NT73 \u2192 't36', NT38 \u2192 't36', etc.\n\nBut in the case of NT73 as NT62 NT27, wait no, let's clarify.

Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't1', which is strange because the string ends with 't1'.\n\nThis might already be a hint that the string is invalid because it contains a terminal that isn't produced by any rule.

So I need to see if t31 can be the leftmost symbol in the derived string. Looking at the grammar, t31 is produced by NT68. So for t31 to appear first, the first NT in S must expand to NT68, and the second NT must expand to something that, when expanded, gives the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no, because S is S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83.

Instead, t31 comes from NT68, which is in the first position.\n\nWait, no, the root S is two NTs, but the string is a single sequence of terminals. So the root S must expand into two NTs, each of which produce some string, which concatenate to the overall string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should look for a path that leads to the given string.

{"custom_id":"request-105","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can go directly to terminals. But looking at the grammar provided, I notice that some productions include terminals on the right-hand side as well, which might mean it's not strictly in CNF. Hmm, wait, actually in CNF, each production must be a single non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals on the right, except the start symbol which can produce a terminal. So if the grammar allows terminals on the right side of the productions, it's more like a general context-free grammar. \n\nLooking at the grammar, many productions have terminals, like S \u2192 NT73 NT20, but then others have terminals too, like NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45 and NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45 is already there, but wait, actually no, let me check. Oh, wait, actually in the given grammar, most productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which fits CNF, but some have terminals, like NT83 \u2192 NT22 nt45, but no, looking again, the productions seem to be of the NTx \u2192 NTy NTz form except for some that just map to a single terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me look again. For example, the production NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45 is correct in CNF. Similarly, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 is correct. But then looking at the later productions, I see NT82 -> NT51 NT84; that's right. But then there's a production like NT35 -> 't3'; so here, one side is a terminal. So this grammar allows terminals on the right-hand side, meaning it's a general context-free grammar, not strictly CNF. Because in CNF, all productions must have two non-terminals on the right, except the start symbol which can go to a terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user made a mistake and the grammar includes terminals in the productions. So to clarify, CNF requires every production to be of the form A \u2192 BC, except the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal. So if any production on the right-hand side contains a terminal, then the grammar is not in CNF. But in this case, the user provided a grammar that includes NT productions with terminals on the right. So perhaps this is a mistake, but I'll proceed as given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant to present a CNF grammar, but some productions have terminals. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the grammar is not in strict CNF because there are terminals on the right-hand side of the productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t18 t4 t29 t31 t7 t30 t4\". So it's a sequence of terminals.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that S has productions S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So the string must start with either NT73 or NT95.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t18. Now, let's see if any of the productions of NT73 or NT95 can lead to t18 directly.\n\nLooking at NT73's productions: it's listed as S \u2192 NT73 NT20, and in the grammar, NT73 has a production NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 and also somewhere else, I see NT73 -> 't36'. So NT73 can directly produce 't36', but not 't18'. Similarly, NT95 has a production NT95 -> 't18', as per the grammar (NT95 is listed as a production to 't18').\n\nWait, looking back: in the given grammar, NT95 -> 't18', so if NG95 can directly produce t18, then S \u2192 NT95 NT20 would produce t18 followed by whatever NT20 produces.\n\nSo the string starts with t18, which matches NT95's production. So the first part is S \u2192 NT95 NT20.\n\nNow, the string is 't18' followed by 't4 t29 t31 t7 t30 t4'. So after t18, we have 't4 t29 t31 t7 t30 t4', which comes from NT20.\n\nSo I need to check if NT20 can derive 't4 t29 t31 t7 t30 t4'.\n\nLooking at NT20's productions: in the grammar, NT20 \u2192 't17', and also NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT68. So NT20 can either produce 't17' or NT11 NT68.\n\nIf we take NT20 -> 't17', then the next symbol after t18 would be t17, but in our string, after t18, the next is t4, so that's not matching. Therefore, we must take the other production: NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT68.\n\nSo now, the string after t18 is 't4 t29 t31 t7 t30 t4', which comes from NT11 and NT68.\n\nSo let's split the string after t18 into two parts: the part from NT11 and the part from NT68.\n\nFirst, NT11: looking at the grammar, NT11 has production NT11 \u2192 't12'. So NT11 can produce 't12'. Then, the next terminal is 't4', so that would not match. Therefore, perhaps NT11 can't produce 't4' directly. Alternatively, maybe we need to look deeper into NT11's productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT11 \u2192 't12', so it can only produce 't12'. So the next symbol after t18 must be 't12', but in our string, after t18 is t4, so this approach might not be working.\n\nThis suggests that maybe we took a wrong turn earlier. Let me backtrack.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT95 NT20, and then NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT68, leading to 't12' from NT11. But in the string, after t18 comes t4. So maybe this is not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT20 can produce something else. Wait, let me check all possible productions for NT20.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT20 \u2192 't17' and NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT68.\n\nSo no, NT20 only has these two options.\n\nSo maybe this path is not possible. Let's consider another approach.\n\nWait, maybe after S \u2192 NT95, NT95 produces 't18', so the first symbol is t18. Now, what's after t18? The next symbols are t4 t29 t31 t7 t30 t4, which need to come from the next non-terminal, which is NT20.\n\nSo we need to see if NT20 can produce t4 t29 t31 t7 t30 t4. But from the grammar, NT20 can either produce 't17' or NT11 NT68.\n\nSo the only way is to go through NT11 and NT68.\n\nSo let's try that.\n\nSo NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT68.\n\nNow, the string after t18 is t4, which comes from NT11. So we look at NT11's productions: NT11 \u2192 't12' or does it produce any other combinations?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT11's production is NT11 \u2192 't12', so it can only produce 't12' directly. So if NT11 is supposed to produce t4, but it can't, that's a problem. Because NT11 can only produce t12.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the productions. Let me check: the grammar includes NT11 \u2192 't12' and also some other NT11 productions? Let me see the complete list.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT13 -> 't3'\n- NT95 -> 't18'\n- NT63 -> 't29'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n\nSo NT11 only has one production: \u2192 't12'.\n\nSo if after t18, the next symbol is t4, which is not t12, then this path can't be followed. Therefore, S \u2192 NT95 NT20 and then NT20 \u2192 NT11 NT68 doesn't lead to the desired string.\n\nWait, that suggests that maybe the initial choice S \u2192 NT95 is correct, but then NT20 can't produce the next symbol correctly.\n\nAlternatively"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-132","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. So I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the string `t11 t37 t29 t25 t36 t27 t2 t1` is generated by it. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So all the rules here seem to fit that structure. That's good because it means the grammar is straightforward in a way, but also a bit complex since there are so many rules and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t11, t37, t29, t25, t36, t27, t2, t1. I think the approach here is to try to parse the string from the end and see if I can derive it step by step using the given grammar.\n\nLet me start from the end. The last token is t1. I check the grammar to see which rule produces t1. Scanning through, I see a rule: NT24 -> 't25', but that doesn't help. Wait, looking for 't1'. There's a rule where NT99 -> 't10', but that's t10, not t1. Hmm, wait, is there a rule for 't1'? Let me check again. Oh, yes, here's NT20 -> 't17' and NT84 -> 't1'. Oh, right, so the rule for 't1' is NT84 -> 't1', but then NT84 must derive to something that can produce t1. Wait, no, NT84 is a non-terminal that produces 't1' directly. So if the string ends with t1, that must come from NT84.\n\nSo the last part is 't1', which comes from NT84. So the string before 't1' must derive to NT84. Let's go back one step: the string before t1 is t2. So the substring before t1 is t27 t2 t1, but wait, let me list the string step by step:\n\nThe string is t11 t37 t29 t25 t36 t27 t2 t1. So the last part before t1 is t27 t2. Wait, no, the entire string before t1 is t27 t2 t1. Wait no, the string is sequential. Wait, the string is t11, t37, t29, t25, t36, t27, t2, t1. So to derive this, the entire string must be derived from S using the productions. Let's start from the left.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t11. Where does t11 come from? Looking at the grammar, I see NT11 -> t12, and NT11 -> t37. Wait, no: the rules are:\n\nNT11 -> 't12'? Wait no. Looking back, the rules under NT11: It seems NT11 has a rule where it produces 't12', but that's not the case here. Wait, looking closely: the rules are:\n\nNT11 -> NT35 NT37 and NT11 -> NT95 NT55.\n\nBut also, looking for where t11 is produced as a terminal. Oh, looking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT64 -> 't17'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT96 -> 't27'\n- NT88 -> 't28'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT96 -> 't27'\n- NT88 -> 't27'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT24 -> 't25'\n- NT47 -> 't27'\n- NT12 -> 't31'\n\nAh, I see. There's a rule NT12 -> 't11'. So the first part of the string, t11, comes from NT12. So the initial part of the derivation is S -> NT12 NT20. But wait, the string starts with t11, which is 't11', which is from NT12. So let's check.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT12 has two production rules: NT12 -> NT39 NT55 and NT12 -> 't11'. So to get 't11', the non-terminal NT12 must be replaced by 't11'. So that's the first step. So the derivation starts with S -> NT12 NT20, and NT12 becomes 't11', so now we have the string t11 NT20. But we also have other parts, so we need to see how the rest of the string is built.\n\nWait, no, because the entire string is a sequence of terminals. So perhaps we can split it into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is t11 t37 t29 t25 t36 t27 t2 t1.\n\nSince S is the starting symbol, let's see how S is used. Looking at the first rule: S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83. Hmm, but how does that correspond to our target string?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider each step as building the string from right to left, trying to match the end of the string with the end of a production.\n\nSo, in this approach, I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to perform a forward derivation, but since the grammar is quite complex, perhaps a better approach is to try to split the string into the components that each rule produces.\n\nLet me try to look at the string and see if I can break it down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nStart with the entire string: t11 t37 t29 t25 t36 t27 t2 t1.\n\nWe can think that S must derive this string, so perhaps S splits into two parts that each derive a substring.\n\nLooking at the rules for S, S can go to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's see which of these fits.\n\nThe first option is S -> NT73 NT20. Then, the string starts with t11. Looking at the NT73 rules: NT73 can become 't36' or 't22' or 't3'. Hmm, but 't11' is part of the string, which comes from NT12, not NT73. So maybe S doesn't use the first option. Alternatively, perhaps S uses the second option: S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nChecking NT95, perhaps. Looking at NT95's rules: it goes to NT84, which then becomes 't1', and also has other rules. So maybe NT83 is another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire string as being the result of S's production.\n\nWait, another approach is to see that the string has 8 elements, and since S is S -> A B, A and B would each have to derive a substring. So perhaps A is the first n tokens, and B is the remaining (8 -n) tokens. But I don't know n, but since each production of S uses two non-terminals, maybe I can recursively try each split.\n\nWait, perhaps more systematically: to see whether the string is a concatenation of two parts, each of which can be derived by some NT1 and NT2 in S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nSo for the entire string to be NT1 NT2 with NT1 deriving the first part and NT2 the second part.\n\nThe string is 8 tokens: [t11, t37, t29, t25, t36, t27, t2, t1]\n\nI can try splitting it into two parts at every possible point and see if any split allows both parts to be derived from NT1 and NT2 in S's production.\n\nSo possible splits:\n\n1. Split after 1 token: [t11] and [t37 t29 t25 t36 t27 t2 t1]. Check if t11 is possible from NT1 and the rest from NT2.\n\nLooking for NT1 that can derive t11. From the grammar, NT11 has two rules: NT11 -> NT35 NT37 or NT11 -> NT95 NT55. But none of these produce 't11'.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals. This grammar is given in CNF, so each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 aB, or A \u2192 Ba, where A and B are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nMy strategy will be to work backwards from the string. I'll start from the rightmost symbol and try to find possible productions that could derive these symbols. If I can successfully parse the entire string by matching the productions, then the string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. So each of these must be derived from the productions where the RHS has terminals.\n\nLet me list out each terminal in the order they appear:\n\n1. t31\n2. t37\n3. t29\n4. t25\n5. t24\n6. t33\n7. t2\n8. t1\n\nI'll start from the end to see how each terminal can be derived.\n\n8. t2: Looking for a production where the RHS includes t2.

Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if each terminal can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's split into 9 parts: `t31, t37, t36, t25, t36, t27, t2, t33, t14`.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which simplifies parsing because all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the productions and terminals to understand how the string can be broken down. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n- S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the string starts with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. I'll need to see which one of these can derive into the given string.\n\nNext, I'll look at the other productions. Each NT seems to produce other NTs and eventually terminals (t followed by a number). For example:\n- NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47\n- NT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2\n- NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n- And more, up until several NTs end with a terminal like 't35', 't4', etc.\n\nGiven the string, I notice it starts with t35. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT35 can produce 't3' but also other combinations. Wait, in the list, there's a production: NT49 \u2192 NT23. Hmm, maybe I need to check which NTs can lead to t35.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for NTs that end with 't35'. From the grammar:\n- NT35 appears in NT49 \u2192 NT23 and other places, but I don't see a production for NT35 directly ending with a 't'. Hmm, perhaps looking more carefully, perhaps a production like NT35 \u2192 NT27 NT62, and then those can produce 't3' and 't4'?\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I'll try to match them from the start to the end.\n\nThe string is t35 t4 t29 t31 t7 t37 t28 t36 t2.\n\nLet's start by considering the first part, t35. I need to find a production that can derive t35. Looking at the grammar, does any production lead to 't35' directly or via other steps?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see a production: NT49 \u2192 NT23. But 49 isn't 35. Wait, looking for t35. Perhaps a production like NT35 is not present, but perhaps NT64 or another node can produce t35.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to work backwards. Let's see which NTs produce t35. Looking through the list, I don't see any production of the form NT35 \u2192 't35' or an intermediate that leads to t35. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, let me list all productions where a terminal is produced:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't31'\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT73 \u2192 't36'\n- NT38 \u2192 't29'\n- NT2 \u2192 't22'\n- NT4 \u2192 't16'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT64 \u2192 't17'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT35 \u2192 't13'\n- NT39 \u2192 't6'\n- NT11 \u2192 't37'\n- NT95 \u2192 't18'\n- NT35 \u2192 't5'\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT96 \u2192 't20'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT49 \u2192 't23'\n- NT82 \u2192 't5'\n- NT83 \u2192 't28'\n- NT37 \u2192 't31'\n- NT95 \u2192 't35'\n- NT8 -> 't30'\n- NT64 \u2192 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\n- NT49 \u2192 't9'\n- NT88 \u2192 't28'\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\n- NT84 \u2192 't1'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT96 \u2192 't27'\n- NT88 \u2192 't27'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT62 \u2192 't24'\n- NT53 \u2192 't11'\n- NT96 \u2192 't37'\n- NT20 \u2192 't1'\n- NT53 \u2192 't23'\n- NT27 \u2192 't33'\n- NT62 \u2192 't36'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT49 \u2192 't0'\n- NT99 \u2192 't16'\n- NT27 \u2192 't27'\n- NT49 \u2192 't2'\n- NT24 \u2192 't25'\n- NT47 \u2192 't27'\n- NT12 \u2192 't31'\n\nWait, I'm looking for any production that ends in 't35'. Let's see.\n\nNT95 \u2192 't35' is a production. Yes, so NT95 can directly produce 't35'. That's a helpful point. So, if I have a production that leads to NT95, then I can get 't35'.\n\nLooking back at the string, it starts with 't35', which would need to come from NT95. So, the first step would be S \u2192 NT95 NT83 as one of the options. Then, from NT95 and NT83, derive the rest of the string.\n\nWait, let's see: the entire string is t35 t4 t29 t31 t7 t37 t28 t36 t2.\n\nSo, after t35, the next is t4. Let me check where t4 comes from. Looking at the productions, 't4' is produced by NT44. So, perhaps we have a path where a non-terminal leads to NT44, which then produces 't4'.\n\nSimilarly, the next term is t29. Looking for 't29' production: NT38 \u2192 't29' (twice), and NT63 \u2192 't29'. So, could be from NT38 or NT63.\n\nBut let's approach this step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is 't35', which comes from NT95 \u2192 't35'. So, the first part of the string is 't35', which is the production from NT95.\n\nSo, the leftmost symbol in the string is derived from NT95.\n\nNow, after NT95, we need to handle NT83. So, the string is now t35 followed by 't4 t29 ...'.\n\nSo, from S \u2192 NT95 NT83, the leftmost NT95 can produce 't35', and the right NT83 needs to produce 't4 t29 ...'.\n\nSo, let's look at NT83's productions. From the grammar, NT83 can produce NT22 NT45 or other combinations, but the end terminals are 't28' or 't45' (but wait, 't45' isn't a terminal; let me check.\n\nLooking at the list, NT45 can produce 't4' and 't45' leads to NT44. So, perhaps NT83 can produce 't28', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the string after 't35' is 't4', which is a terminal, so we need to see if NT83 can directly produce 't4' or through some intermediate steps leading to 't4'.\n\nWait, another option is that NT83 can produce NT22 NT45, but then each of those can produce other terms.\n\nAlternatively, NT83 can produce 't28' as a terminal. Let me check the grammar: looking for NT83 \u2192 't28'. Is there such a production? Yes, under NT88 \u2192 't28' and NT83 \u2192 't28'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45. But also, in the given grammar, does NT83 have a production to 't28'? Wait, the list says:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 't28'\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT82 \u2192 NT51 NT84"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) can generate specific strings based on the production rules. In this case, the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to determine if the target string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. Since the string only contains terminals (denoted by 't' followed by numbers), I need to see if I can trace back from S to the string by expanding the non-terminals appropriately.\n\nLet me first note the start symbol, which is S. The initial productions from S are:\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n- S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the first step from S is to choose between NT73 and NT95, and then NT20 and NT83, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t35`, which is the last symbol of the string. Let's see where 't35' appears in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find that NT73 \u2192 't36' and NT55 \u2192 't17', but 't35' is in NT35. Wait, NT35 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking at the NT35 productions:\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3\n- NT35 \u2192 NT3 NT13\n- NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n- NT35 \u2192 NT96 NT56\n- Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT35 is mentioned as:\n\nNT35 has:\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3\n- NT35 \u2192 NT3 NT13\n- Also, looking again, I see NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37 might be incorrect; actually, checking the list, I see NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37, but NT35 has NT49 \u2192 't3' (so NT49 \u2192 't3'), and NT35 \u2192 NT96 NT56? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at each NT:\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3' (also NT49 \u2192 NT33 NT44)\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3, and NT35 \u2192 NT3 NT13\n- Also, other NTs have terminal rules, like NT2 \u2192 't22', NT4 \u2192 't11', etc.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find where 't35' comes from. Looking through the terminals in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't36'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3 or NT3 NT13\n- So, 't3' comes from NT49, but that's a single symbol, not 't35'. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check:\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go through each terminal production:\n\nLooking through the given productions, I see each terminal is assigned to an NT. So, 't35' would correspond to an NT that has a production rule \u2192 't35'.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't35'. Let me check each line:\n\nFor example, 't35' is assigned to NT35?\n\nWait, the line says:\nNT35 -> NT49 NT3 \u2192 perhaps that's the production. Wait, the line is:\nNT35 -> NT49 NT3\nWait, no, that's the production. Then, where is 't35' coming from? Looking at the list, I don't see an NT directly producing 't35'. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each line carefully. The question is whether the string has 't35'. Let me recount:\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT64 \u2192 't24'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3\n- NT35 also appears in other productions, but I don't see an NT that directly produces t35.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through each production, I notice that some entries have 'a' being terminals:\n\nFor example:\n- NT38 \u2192 't36' (since the line is 'NT38 \u2192 't36' NT24')\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT22 \u2192 't24'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- And so on.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that directly produces 't35'. I see that in the list, there's a line:\nNT73 \u2192 't36'\nBut that's in NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\nAnd in NT73 \u2192 't36' is the production, which would mean NT73 can produce 't36'.\n\nBut looking for 't35', I don't see any NT directly leading to 't35'. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me read each line carefully.\n\nLooking again through the given grammar:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT82 \u2192 't14'\n- NT37 \u2192 't31'\nWait, but is there any NT that can produce 't35'? I don't see it. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't35' is derived from a chain of non-terminals leading to it. But if there's no NT that has a production rule directly producing 't35', then 't35' cannot appear in any string generated by this grammar. Hence, the string cannot be generated, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but that's a big conclusion. Let me make sure.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't35', which would require that the first symbols derived from the grammar include 't35'. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't35'. Therefore, it's impossible for 't35' to be in the derived string, making the answer 'No' without even considering the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, perhaps 't35' can be derived through some combination. For example, perhaps an NT can produce another NT that eventually leads to t35. But in this case, I don't see any path. All the terminal symbols in the grammar end with a number, and none map directly to 35.

{"custom_id":"request-165","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to check is `t35 t31 t29 t4 t7 t37 t27 t24 t27 t2`, and the grammar is a big set of productions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how CNF works. CNF requires that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left, except for the start symbol which can have just a single non-terminal (like S here). Each production involves only non-terminals except for the terminals which are the end points of the string. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, all the production rules start with S and then have two non-terminals, which fits CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which breaks down into NT73 and NT20, both of which are non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals. \n\nThe string consists of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t35, t31, t29, etc. Each of these 't' terms is a terminal symbol because their productions directly lead to them (e.g., NT35 \u2192 t3, etc.). So my job is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar by following the production rules step by step.\n\nI think the best approach is to use memoization and recursive descent parsing. But given that the string is 10 tokens long, it might be manageable. Let me try to map each 't' token back to the NT rule that produces it.\n\nLooking at the string in order:\n\nPositions:\n1. t35\n2. t31\n3. t29\n4. t4\n5. t7\n6. t37\n7. t27\n8. t24\n9. t27\n10. t2\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\n1. t35: Looking at the productions, NT35 can go to t3. So the first step must come from NT35.\n\n2. Next, t31: NT31 is in one of the productions? Looking through, I don't see NT31 as a terminal. Wait, the productions don't have NT31 as a single terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again. No, I don't see NT31 \u2192 t... anywhere. Wait, that might be an issue. Did I misread the grammar?\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT44 \u2192 t4, which is t4. But t31 is looking for something else. Wait, maybe it's not a single NT but a combination. Wait, let me see: the string is t35, t31, t29, etc. Each of these corresponds to NT rules, but perhaps each NT can be decomposed into multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built by breaking down each NT into smaller parts. But this could get complicated quickly.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's see the NTs in the grammar and map them to their terminals:\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3 ( productions: NT35 -> t3 )\nWait, no, looking at the grammar list: NT35 \u2192 t3, so when NT35 is a symbol, it can only produce t3. So in the string, t35 is supposed to come from NT35, which only produces t3. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nNT35 -> t3\n\nSimilarly, NT39 -> t6, etc.\n\nSo, for the string to have t35, perhaps it refers to NT35 \u2192 t35? Wait, no, in the provided grammar, each NT's production ends with a terminal. For example, NT52 \u2192 t36 or such. So perhaps the string is in terms of NT35, which would require that NT35 directly produces t35, but checking the grammar, I don't see any production like NT35 \u2192 t35. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Or maybe the NT35 in the string refers to a different NT? Wait, perhaps the string is in terms of the NT identifiers as in the productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me get the string right. The string is `t35 t31 t29 t4 t7 t37 t27 t24 t27 t2`. Each 't' is followed by a number, so each represents a terminal. So to get the string, the entire derivation must expand into these terminals in order.\n\nSo, starting from S, which is S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nSo the first two NTs must be NT73 and NT20. Let's check their productions:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nSo the first symbol is 't35', which corresponds to NT35's production. But NT73 doesn't directly produce t35. So perhaps this approach is not working. Maybe I should reverse-engineer from the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t35. So perhaps the top-level NT is NT35, but checking the grammar, NT35 \u2192 t3. That doesn't make sense because the string's first token is t35. Wait, maybe the grammar includes a 't35' somewhere, but looking through the productions, I don't see 't35' as a terminal. Only 't3', 't4', etc. So perhaps the string's first token isn't correctly mapped in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NTs in the string have multiple steps. Maybe the first NT is NT35, which expands to t3, but the string has t35. So that would not match. Therefore, this suggests that the string might not be derived from this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NTs. Maybe in the given grammar, each NT's production produces a tree of terminals. For example, NT35 could be combined with another NT to produce the string. But without a production for NT35, it's impossible.\n\nLet me confirm: In the grammar, I see NT35 \u2192 t3. So it only produces 't3'. Therefore, to get a 't35' in the string, the NT must be NT35, which only gives 't3' as a terminal. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, unless 't35' is another NT. Let me check if any NT in the grammar produces 't35'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT with a production ending with `t35`... I don't see any. So that means that the grammar cannot produce a string containing `t35` unless it's through combining NTs, which leads to 't35', but since NT35 only produces 't3', that doesn't add up.\n\nTherefore, the string `t35 ...` can't be generated by this grammar because there's no NT that directly produces `t35`.

The string provided is `t35 t4 t29 t4 t0 t22 t31 t29 t16 t2 t2`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. From what I remember, a grammar is in CNF if each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. That means each production has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side, and if there are two, they must both be non-terminals, not terminals. Also, the start symbol shouldn't be rewritten into a terminal directly; that could be a mistake.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that all the productions either start with S and transform into combinations of NTs, which are non-terminals, or they end with a terminal like 't35', 't4', etc. Each production seems to follow the form of two NTs producing a terminal or another NT. So, that part checks out.\n\nThe string to evaluate is all terminals: `t35 t4 t29 t4 t0 t22 t31 t29 t16 t2 t2`. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation path to this string should involve the start symbol S eventually producing this sequence through a series of steps where each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals until terminals are reached. \n\nSince the start symbol is S, I need to see if starting from S, through a series of productions, I can derive this string. Each time I apply a production, it reduces the number of non-terminals by replacing them with more symbols, eventually leading to all terminals. The string has 11 tokens, which would require (11-1)\/2 steps since each production replaces two symbols with one. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production can only generate two symbols at a time. So, for a string of length n, the number of steps is n-1.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to look for each terminal in the string and see if it can be derived from some non-terminal. So, I'll go through each terminal in the string and check if there's a production rule that directly produces it.\n\nLet's list out the terminals in the order they appear:\n1. t35\n2. t4\n3. t29\n4. t4\n5. t0\n6. t22\n7. t31\n8. t29\n9. t16\n10. t2\n11. t2\n\nNow, I need to check which non-terminals produce each of these terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n- t35 is produced by NT37 \u2192 t35 and NT35 \u2192 t35, as well as NT49 \u2192 t3 (Wait, no, checking the rules, I see NT35 -> t3, NT37 -> t3, but t35 is directly produced by NT35 and NT37. Wait, am I confused?\n\nWait, let me look again. The rules are:\nNT35 -> t3\nNT37 -> t3\nSo, t3 is produced by both. But t35 is another terminal.

So S expands into two Nts, each of which will further expand until they reach terminals.\n\nSo the string must be a sequence of terminals derived from S by expanding the non-terminals in a way that the entire string is formed.\n\nLet me write down the string: t35, t4, t29, t4, t13, t24, t2, t1, t35, t1, t28. The length is 11. Each non-terminal expansion produces two terminals, so the number of terminals should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. Since we start with S, which is a single non-terminal, the first expansion produces two, then four, etc. But the string has 11 terms, which is odd. That can't happen because each step doubles the number of non-terminals. Wait, but the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which is two. Then each non-terminal can expand into two more, so after k steps, the number of non-terminals is 2^k. Each terminal is a leaf, so the total number of terminals should be 2^k. But 11 is not a power of two, so this string can't be derived from S because the number of terminals must be even.\n\nBut wait, the initial S produces two non-terminals, so every production step appends more non-terminals, but the count of non-terminals is a power of two. Let me think again. The number of terminals in any derivation starting from S must be equal to 2^n for some n \u2265 1. Since 11 is not a power of two, that would mean this string can't be generated by the grammar. So my initial thought is No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe the string can be split into multiple sequences that are correct. Let me see. The string is t35 t4 t29 t4 t13 t24 t2 t1 t35 t1 t28. So 11 tokens, which is odd. So it can't be generated because each step doubles the number of symbols from non-terminals. Starting from one symbol S, each step produces two, so it's 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. So 11 isn't achievable.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible sequences. Maybe it's built from multiple expansions, but no, the count would still be a power of two. For instance, if S expands to two non-terminals, each of which then expands, you get four, and so on. So the total number of terminal symbols must be a power of two.\n\nChecking 11 again: it's 2^3 (8) plus 3, which isn't a power. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mix? Let me consider that maybe some non-terminals expand deeper than others, but that doesn't change the total count\u2014each split replaces one non-terminal with two, so the total number increases by one each time a non-terminal is expanded. Wait, no. When you have two non-terminals, and each expands once, the total number of non-terminals becomes four. If you have four non-terminals, the next step could make it eight. So the number of terminal symbols at the end must be a power of two.\n\nSo since 11 isn't a power of two, the answer must be No.\n\nWait, but maybe I should look into the string structure more deeply. Could it be that the string consists of multiple valid parts that somehow fit together despite the count? I don't think so, because in a context-free grammar, the entire string must be a single leftmost derivation or some form of nesting, but the terminal count must fit the expansion steps.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the string's length isn't a power of two, so it can't be generated by this grammar. The answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-213","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a form where every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It's a list of production rules for non-terminals (like S, NT52, NT71, etc.) that eventually lead to terminal symbols labeled 't' followed by numbers. So, each production splits a non-terminal into two other non-terminals, except the base cases where they produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t17 t29 t35 t31 t24 t33`.\n\nI remember that in CNF, the derivation process works by expanding the start symbol through a series of productions until only terminals remain. Each production takes exactly two steps since each production has exactly two parts. So, for a string with n terminals, the derivation tree would have height log2(n) rounded up, I think.\n\nBut the string here has 12 terminals. That means the derivation would require how many steps? Let me think: each step is a production, so for each step, the number of symbols increases by one. Starting from S, which leads to two non-terminals, then each of those could split again, and so on. The number of productions needed would be one less than the number of terminals. So, for 12 symbols, I'd need 11 splits. But wait, maybe I'm getting the depth wrong. The height of the tree should be log2(12) \u2248 3.58, so 4 levels. But the number of productions would be equal to the number of terminals minus 1, which is 11. But I'm not sure if that's the exact way to count it, but I think for the purpose of this problem, knowing that the length of the string must be a power of 2 in a strictly CNF grammar might help. But this string has 12 elements, which is not a power of 2. Hmm, but wait, actually, the CNF grammar allows for the string length to not necessarily be a power of 2 because after a certain point, non-terminals can produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, no, if all productions are of the form two non-terminals or a terminal, then the total number of symbols in the string must be 2^n for some n because each step splits every non-terminal into two, doubling the count. But if you have some non-terminals that produce terminals without splitting, then you might have a mix. But in this case, looking at the grammar, several rules produce terminals. For example, 'NT2 \u2192 t22', 'NT4 \u2192 t11', etc. So, during a derivation, some non-terminals produce single terminals, which would make the string not double each time.\n\nWait, actually, no. In CNF, every rule is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So, when A\u2192a is used, that non-terminal becomes a terminal. But the string length can vary because some reductions can happen in the same place. For example, splitting into two, then one of them splitting again, etc. Wait, but no\u2014since each expansion can be either a two-split or a terminal production. So, for example, starting from S \u2192 NT52 NT93 (assuming NT93 is a typo, but wait, in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT73 NT20). So, S splits into NT73 and NT20. Each of these could split or produce a terminal. But the string is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal comes from a production rule where a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce two terminals. For example, 'NT2 \u2192 t22'. So, perhaps I need to look at the string and see if it can be built by a series of replacements where each non-terminal is expanded appropriately.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm. I remember that CYK parses strings in CNF grammars by checking possible non-terminals at each step.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by initializing a table where each cell represents a substring of the input. It tries to find non-terminals that can generate that substring using two smaller substrings. The steps are:\n\n1. Initialize the table with each position and the possible non-terminals that can generate the corresponding single terminal symbol.\n2. For each length of substring from 2 up to the entire string, check for each substring of that length if there's a non-terminal that can split into two parts, each of which is generated by non-terminals in the previous steps.\n3. If the entire string can be generated by a non-terminal, then the string is in the language.\n\nSo, let's try to apply this.\n\nFirst, our input string is: t18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t17 t29 t35 t31 t24 t33.\n\nLet me write that as a list of symbols for easier handling:\nIndices 0 to 11: t18, t31, t29, t31, t31, t6, t17, t29, t35, t31, t24, t33.\n\nNow, the first step is to create a table where each position corresponds to the possible non-terminals that can generate the single symbol at that position.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal symbol has a production rule where a non-terminal directly goes to that terminal. So, for each 'tX', we need to find which non-terminals have a production rule ending with 'tX'. Then, for each position, those non-terminals are the possible starting points.\n\nFor example:\n\nt18: Looking for NT \u2192 t18. From the grammar, I see S \u2192 NT73 NT20, and perhaps other rules. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT90 \u2192 t38, etc. Wait, I need to check each production rule where a non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t22\n- NT4 \u2192 t11\n- NT6 \u2192 t8\nWait, actually, let's check each rule:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t22\n- NT4 \u2192 t11\n- NT6 \u2192 t8 (Wait, in the given rules, NT6 \u2192 t8?

Each production rule ultimately terminates in a terminal symbol (like 't36', 't29', etc.) so I must check if the entire string can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nThe string has 12 tokens. Looking at the grammar, S can produce either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Each of these will then need to produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me start by assuming the top-level production is S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So the first part is NT73 and the second part is NT20.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT73 can be \u2192 NT12 NT47, \u2192 NT62 NT27, or \u2192 T36.\n- NT20 can be \u2192 NT27 NT68 or \u2192 T17.\n\nLet me consider the first part: NT73.\n\nFrom the rules, NT73 can be either NT12 NT47 or NT62 NT27 or T36.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t35. So that's a terminal. Wait, so in the first step, if NT73 produces T36, but the string starts with t35, that doesn't match. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting symbol S is supposed to produce the entire string, which is a sequence of terminals, so S needs to derive the given string through a series of productions.\n\nWait, no. The start symbol is S, and S needs to produce the given string. But the given string is a sequence of terminals, so the entire derivation should end with S producing that sequence.\n\nBut since the grammar has only terminals at the bottom, each production chain from S must end with a terminal.\n\nLet me approach this by trying to parse the string backward. Sometimes, parsing from the end helps.\n\nThe string ends with t36. Looking at the terminals, t36 appears in NT73's production: NT73 can go to T36. So the end could be NT73 \u2192 T36.\n\nSo let's assume the last production is NT73 \u2192 T36, so before that, we have NT73.\n\nBut wait, since S is the start symbol, it produces two non-terminals, so the string must be a concatenation of two sequences derived from these non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the string as a sequence that must be built from the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach: create a parse tree, starting from the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the grammar.\n\nThe string is 12 tokens long. Let me list them:\n\n1. t35\n2. t31\n3. t31\n4. t31\n5. t11\n6. t6\n7. t24\n8. t20\n9. t17\n10. t35\n11. t31\n12. t36\n\nI need to see if this can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nFirst, looking at the first token, t35. In the grammar, t35 can be produced by NT73 (as per rule: NT73 \u2192 T36, but wait, in the production rules, I don't see T35 as a terminal. Wait, looking back, in the production rules, do I see any 't35'?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, under 'productions':\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT63 \u2192 't29'\n- NT99 \u2192 't16'\n- NT35 \u2192 't5'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT tokens with terminal t tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-224","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t6 t17 t2 t17 t18 t31 t24 t27`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. So each production either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal. This structure should help in parsing the string step by step, ensuring that each terminal is derived from non-terminals following the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that all the production rules are indeed in CNF. Each right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That's a good start.\n\nNow, the string consists of a series of terminals: t35, t31, t29, etc. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S, so I'll need to trace the derivation starting from S and see if I can end up with this string.\n\nThe first step is to see what the start symbol S can produce. Looking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nEach of these is a production that S expands into two NTs. So, when S is used, it must be replaced by one of these two options. Either NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83. Both are non-terminals, so the next step would be to expand those.\n\nLet me outline the process as a tree. Starting with S, I need to pick one of the two branches. Let's consider both possibilities to see if either leads to the given string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20\nSo now, we have NT73 and NT20. We'll need to see how these NTs derive the respective parts of the string.\n\nLooking for NT73 production rules:\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 (Rule is in CNF, so each step is a split)\nNT62 \u2192 NT53 NT73 (Wait, NT62 has production NT53 NT73? But NT53: Looking through the rules, NT53 is mentioned in two places: as a production of NT62 and NT96. Wait, let me check all NTs:\n\nWait, I see for NT52, there are multiple productions. I'll have to list all the NTs and their possible productions to make sense of this.\n\nBut given that parsing each step could get lengthy, maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string corresponds to a production starting with NT followed by the appropriate symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree bottom-up could be more efficient. Starting from the string and trying to match it to the grammar.\n\nWait, the string has 13 tokens, each starting with 't' and a number. Looking through the grammar, each 't' corresponds to a specific production, like NT20 \u2192 't17', etc.\n\nLet me list each token in the string alongside the grammar's 't' rules to see possible sources.\n\nThe string is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t6 t17 t2 t17 t18 t31 t24 t27\n\nSo, each 't' is from some NT production. Let me map each 't' to its possible NT production:\n\nt35: From NT49 \u2192 t3, and NT49 \u2192 t10? Wait, looking back, NT35 has production NT35 \u2192 NT13 NT3, but that's in CNF. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the grammar rules provided.\n\nWait, the grammar rules provided are all for NTs. So, for each 't', we need to find which NT production leads to that 't'. Let's list each NT and their possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT99: t10, t22, t27 (based on the rules, for example NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62 (if it leads to 't10'?), but need to check each rule.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to create a list of 't' and the NT that can produce 't' based on the given rules.\n\nLet me go through the grammar rules line by line and note down each NT and the terminals they can produce.\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-230","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form for context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar starts with a start symbol, usually S, and the string is derived by expanding non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that all the production rules are either non-terminals producing two non-terminals or non-terminals producing a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which means S can be replaced by NT73 followed by NT20. Each of these NT symbols, like NT73, NT95, etc., also have similar production rules.\n\nThe string to check is: `t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t24 t29 t18 t31 t31 t9 t2`.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is a terminal symbol, some of which correspond to specific productions. For instance, 't35' maps to NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37 or maybe another production. Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, each NT symbol has specific productions. For example, NT35 can produce 't3' in one rule and 't13' in another. \n\nWait, let me list out the terminals in the string: t35, t31, t29, t31, t31, t6, t24, t29, t18, t31, t31, t9, t2.\n\nI think the approach here is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string by expanding all non-terminals step by step, ensuring that each expansion produces the right sequence.\n\nBut directly expanding S might take a lot of steps, so perhaps I should look for a way to work backwards from the string. That is, see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions of the grammar.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the string. It starts with t35, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, which NT symbols produce t35? Looking at the production rules, I see that NT35 can produce 't3' and 't13'. Wait, so in the string, the first token is t35, which doesn't directly match any of NT35's productions. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Actually, no, each NT symbol has specific rules. For example, looking for t35 as a terminal in any production, but in the grammar provided, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces t35. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar has:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37\nNT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\nBut in the string, the first token is t35. How does that happen? Because NT35 can only produce two non-terminals, so to get a terminal, it would have to be through another production. Maybe I need to see if any of the non-terminals in the string can derive to t35.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the possible ways each terminal can be derived. For example, t35 can be produced by which NT symbols? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37 (so produces t6 and t31 perhaps)\n- NT35 is defined as NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37 (so it also produces t6 and t31)\nWait, but looking for t35 as a terminal, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing t35. So maybe I'm wrong. Maybe t35 is a terminal in another rule. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that NT49 \u2192 t3 and t23, and NT55 \u2192 t17, but no t35. So perhaps t35 is a terminal in another production that's not listed. Wait, no, the string is given as 't35', so I have to assume that t35 is a terminal that is produced by some NT rule. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, NT35 appears twice: once in S \u2192 NT73 NT20, but that's as a non-terminal. But as a production, NT35 is defined as NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37. So t35 would only appear if the NT51 or NT37 expand into terminals that start with t35. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the string is made up of certain terminals, and I need to see if they can be derived by the grammar. So, for example, t35 is the first terminal. To have t35 in the string, perhaps it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, let me consider that the string may be a series of terminals generated by expanding non-terminals in a certain way. Maybe I should see if the entire string can be derived by starting from S and expanding all the way down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps working backwards would be easier. Let's see.\n\nThe string is t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t24 t29 t18 t31 t31 t9 t2.\n\nIf I parse this from the end, I can start from the last non-terminal that ends with t2, which is probably NT2 \u2192 t2. So the last token is t2, which comes from NT2. Before that, t9 comes from NT44 \u2192 t9, but wait, looking at the grammar, NT44 \u2192 t4 or something else? Wait, in the grammar, NT44 is defined as NT44 \u2192 t4, but wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT44 is listed as NT44 \u2192 t4? Wait, no, I don't see that. Let me check:\n\nNT44's productions are: NT44 \u2192 t4? Wait, no, I think I need to list them all:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 t17\n- NT49 \u2192 t3 and t23\n- NT55 \u2192 t17\n- NT88 \u2192 t28, but wait no: NT88 \u2192 t28? Let me check the list.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nI see a long list of production rules.\n\nLooking for where a non-terminal produces a terminal like t35, t31, etc. For example, NT38 \u2192 't36' and 't29', but I don't see 't35' listed as a terminal from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In the grammar, some non-terminals have rules that result in a single terminal, others result in two non-terminals.\n\nSo, for instance, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which are both non-terminals. Each of those can be expanded further until we get to terminal symbols.\n\nIn the given string, the first token is t35. So, somewhere in the derivation, we must have a non-terminal that can expand to t35.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any NT symbols have a production that includes t35? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the end of each production, is there a rule that directly produces t35? For example, NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37, which would then have to be expanded further.

{"custom_id":"request-247","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of symbols: `t18 t31 t29 t4 t5 t24 t20 t17 t18 t1 t31 t29 t22 t18`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what to do. I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars, where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I can see that each S, NT, and other non-terminals indeed have production rules that are either splitting into two non-terminals or terminal symbols. So that checks out.\n\nThe task is to determine if the given string can be produced by the grammar starting from S. Since this is a parsing problem, it might be complicated to do it manually, but perhaps I can break it down step by step.\n\nI'll start by counting the number of symbols in the string. The string is: `t18 t31 t29 t4 t5 t24 t20 t17 t18 t1 t31 t29 t22 t18`. Let's count the tokens separately:\n\n1. t18\n2. t31\n3. t29\n4. t4\n5. t5\n6. t24\n7. t20\n8. t17\n9. t18\n10. t1\n11. t31\n12. t29\n13. t22\n14. t18\n\nThat's 14 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of steps in any derivation must follow the rule: a string of length n must have (n-1) productions, each of which doubles the number of symbols. So starting from S, each step either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal.\n\nThe initial string S is at the top level. The string we're checking has 14 symbols. Wait, 14 is even but not a power of 2. The maximum number of symbols a derivation can produce is 2^m, where m is the number of productions, but 14 isn't a power of 2. So that might be a problem. Wait, 14 is 8 + 4 + 2, but let me think.\n\nBut actually, considering the structure of the grammar, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. For a string of length l, the number of non-terminals in the initial derivation would be l. But wait, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each production replaces a single symbol with two symbols. So for a string of length k, the derivation must have exactly k-1 splits. So if the string is 14 symbols, that would require 13 splits. But 2^13 is way larger than 14, so that can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but perhaps the grammar might have certain symbols that can be terminals or non-terminals. Looking back, the grammar has some rules where non-terminals produce a single terminal. For example, NT35 \u2192 t3, etc. So each of those is a terminal. So the idea is that every non-terminal eventually must produce a terminal symbol, and the overall string is built up by replacing non-terminals.\n\nSo for the string, each symbol is either a terminal or a result of a split production. If the string is of length n, the initial grammar must derive it in n-1 steps, since each step increases the string length by one (from one symbol to two). Wait, no, in CNF, each step produces two symbols, so the number of symbols doubles each step. Wait no, that's not correct. In CNF, all productions are binary, so each production replaces one symbol with two. So starting with one symbol (S), after one step, we have two symbols. After another step, four symbols, then eight, etc. So the length must be a power of two. \n\nLooking back at the string, its length is 14, which isn't a power of two. The closest powers are 8 (2^3) and 16 (2^4). Since 14 isn't a power of two, it's impossible for the grammar in CNF to derive a string of that length. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the string length again. The string has 14 symbols, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount: t18, t31, t29, t4, t5, t24, t20, t17, t18, t1, t31, t29, t22, t18. That's 14 symbols. So it's definitely not a power of two. Therefore, my initial thought is that the string cannot be generated because the length isn't compatible with the grammar's structure.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about possible ways to structure this. If the grammar can have non-terminals that produce terminals directly, then perhaps the string can be of any length that's achievable by the non-terminals through their productions. But in CNF, the number of symbols should always follow the 2^n rule after each step. So unless there's a way to have a mix of some non-terminals that don't split further, I don't think so. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the string can be generated without the entire process doubling each time, but that's not how derivations work. Each production step must replace a single symbol with two, so the total length after each step is multiplied by two, unless you have other rules. But looking back, the grammar seems to only have binary productions and some terminals, so the total length must be a power of two. \n\nThus, since 14 isn't a power of two, the string is definitely not in the language of the grammar. So my conclusion is that the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-246","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t24 t20 t17 t18 t31 t11 t2 t2`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or one non-terminal expanding to two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and I see two initial productions: S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So, the string could start with either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't18'. Let me check which NT productions lead directly to 't's. Scanning through the grammar rules, I notice that some NTs expand into terminal symbols, for example, NT73 can produce 't36'. But I'm looking for 't18'.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I find NT95 -> 't18'. So that's useful. So if I start with S -> NT95 NT83, then the first part is NT95 which gives 't18'. Now, we need to check the next part.\n\nThe next token in the string is 't31'. Let's see, what NTs produce 't31'. Scanning, NT73 -> 't36' which isn't it. NT44 -> 't4' nope. NT26 -> 't20' no. Wait, looking again, I see NT68 -> 't0', no. Hmm, maybe NT55 -> 't17' but no. Wait, let me check NT31. Wait, looking through the rules, I see that NT4 -> 't11', NT68->'t14', NT2->'t22', etc. Wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree starting from S, using the first token 't18' from NT95. So, S becomes NT95 NT83. The first NT95 produces 't18', so the next token should be 't31', which is from NT83. Let me check the productions for NT83: I see NT83 -> NT22 NT45. So NT83 can be split into NT22 and NT45. Now, the next token is 't31', which should come from either NT22 or NT45.\n\nLooking at NT22 production, it's NT22 -> NT44 NT63. So NT22 doesn't produce a terminal directly; instead, it breaks down further. Similarly, NT45 -> NT44 NT52. So NT45 also breaks down. Hmm, but 't31' is an atomic token. So perhaps I'm looking for a path where NT22 or NT45 eventually produces 't31'.\n\nWait, let me check NT44: it's NT44 -> 't4'. Nope. NT12 is 't11', NT26 is 't20', NT49->'t3', but maybe another path. Let me look for NT62, which is NT62-> 't24' and NT53->'t11'. Wait, I'm getting stuck because 't31' doesn't directly appear in many rules. Maybe the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string could start with S -> NT73 NT20. Let's see: S becomes NT73 NT20. The first token is 't18' from NT95, so that doesn't fit because S's first production is NT73 NT20. So that path won't work unless I find another NT73 rule that gives 't18', but checking NT73 rules: I see NT73 -> 't36' and also other rules like NT73 -> NT27 NT27, which doesn't help directly. So maybe the only way to get 't18' is via NT95, which requires the first S production to be NT95 NT83.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't18', which would come from NT95. So then the next token should come from NT83. NT83 expands to NT22 NT45. So after 't18', the next two tokens should be the two parts of NT83's expansion: 't31' and whatever comes from NT45.\n\nWait, but the string is a flat list of tokens, so after 't18', the next token is 't31', which should be the first part of NT83, which is 't31' coming from NT22 or NT45. Let me see if any of those can produce 't31'.\n\nLooking at NT22: it produces NT44 NT63. Both NT44 and NT63 produce terminals. NT44 -> 't4' and NT63->'t29'. So NT22 produces 't4' and 't29'. Therefore, if the second token is 't31', it can't come from NT22, so it must come from NT45.\n\nSo, the second token is 't31' from NT45. Let's check the production for NT45: NT45 -> NT44 NT52. So, NT45 must produce two terminals: NT44 and NT52. NT44 is 't4', so the first token from NT45 is 't4', but the next token in the string is 't31'. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the tokens are generated. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each NT production can sometimes directly produce a terminal, but in this case, 't31' is a terminal, so it must come from a single NT. Looking through the rules, I can't find any NT that directly produces 't31'. So perhaps the string cannot be generated because there's no NT that directly produces 't31'.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the second token is 't31', which cannot be produced by any NT. Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking at all NT rules: I see NT55 -> 't17', NT44->'t4', NT26->'t20', NT4->'t11', NT68->'t14', NT2->'t22', etc. I don't see any NT rule that produces 't31' directly. So, if the second token is 't31', the grammar can't produce it, which would mean the string is invalid. But wait, maybe I'm missing a path where multiple expansions can lead to 't31' through intermediate NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to backtrack: if the second token after 't18' is 't31', which is supposed to come from NT83, which is NT22 NT45. So, NT83 -> NT22 NT45, which would expand into 'some token from NT22' and 'some token from NT45'.\n\nNT22 -> NT44 NT63: 't4' and 't29'.\n\nNT45 -> NT44 NT52: 't4' and then NT52.\n\nNT52 has several productions, perhaps leading to 't31' eventually.\n\nLet me trace through NT52:\n\nNT52 -> NT12 NT85\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT2\n\nSo NT12 expands to 't31' and 't2'. \n\nWait, so if NT52 -> NT12 NT85, and NT12 -> 't31' 't2', then the tokens generated from NT52 would include 't31' and 't2'. But in the initial string, after 't18' comes 't31', then 't29' from NT83, etc. But I'm not sure if this fits.\n\nWait, let's try reconstructing:\n\nS -> NT95 NT83 (gives t18, t31,...)\n\nBut NT83 is NT22 NT45, which would give t22's tokens and t45's tokens.\n\nBut in our case, the second token is 't31' which came from NT45, but NT45 is NT44 NT52, which is 't4' and NT52.\n\nSo NT52 is supposed to produce 't31' as one of its tokens. Let's look into NT52's productions:\n\nNT52 can produce NT12 NT85, NT35 NT96, NT52 -> NT80 NT47, etc.\n\nLooking for sequences that can result in 't31'.\n\nNT52 -> NT12 NT85.\n\nNT12 -> NT31 NT2.\n\nSo, NT12 produces 't31' and 't2'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Both of these start the string with 't73' and 't95' respectively, but wait, the string starts with t18, so maybe that's not the right path. Wait, no, because in the grammar, t18 is a terminal, so the first part must match one of the right-hand sides of the S rules.\n\nWait no, looking again, S's productions are S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So NT73 and NT20 are non-terminals. I need to see if these can be expanded into sequences of terminals that will form the string.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT73 NT20 first. NT73 is a non-terminal; its productions are:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- Other rules for NT73, but probably the first one is relevant here because other productions may have more terminals.\n\nSo NT73 expands to NT62 NT27. Now, NT62 has productions like NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT62, or NT53 NT62, or others. Wait, but that might get too long. Alternatively, perhaps we should look for the terminals in the string and see if they match the possible sequences from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should parse the string top-down, starting from S and trying to match the string's tokens, ensuring that each production matches the necessary non-terminals.\n\nBut this might get complex, so perhaps it's easier to parse the string using the grammar rules, treating each token in the string as a step. Let me try to list the tokens in the string and see how they could be generated.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt18, t31, t29, t31, t31, t17, t36, t18, t31, t17, t2, t1, t35, t31, t36.\n\nThat's 15 tokens. Let's see how the grammar can generate this.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Neither of these directly match the string's first token, which is t18, so perhaps the S \u2192 NT73 NT20 is the correct first step.\n\nWait, but NT73 and NT20 may produce sequences that start with t18. Let's check the productions of NT73 and NT20.\n\nLooking at NT73, its productions include:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\nWait, but I don't see 't18' in these, so maybe that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if any non-terminal directly can produce a terminal, like checking the lower non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t88\n- NT24 \u2192 t25\nWait, but t18 is a terminal. Let me look for non-terminals that can produce t18.\n\nLooking through, I see NT27 \u2192 t27, which is t27, not t18. What about NT9? Wait, no, the grammar doesn't have NT9 as a primary non-terminal. Wait, perhaps NT95 can produce t18. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT95 \u2192 t18. Yes, so if a non-terminal can reach NT95, it can produce t18.\n\nSo perhaps, in the string, the first t18 comes from NT95.\n\nSo, starting from S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, let's see: NT95 \u2192 t18. So the first token is t18, which matches NT95. Now, the next is t31. So, after NT95, the next non-terminal is NT83.\n\nNT83's productions include:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24\n- NT83 \u2192 t28\nSo among these, does any of these lead to t31? Not directly, except if the non-terminal can eventually produce t31.\n\nLooking for where t31 comes from:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t38 is a terminal? No, in the given grammar, NT38 \u2192 t36 and other steps, but wait, in the top-level, it's defined as NT38 \u2192 't36' which is t36, not t31. So where does t31 come from?\n\nLooking at NT44's productions: NT44 \u2192 t4, t9, t16, etc.\u2014wait, in the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 t4 and others.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at NT44, its productions include:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT44 \u2192 t9\n- NT44 \u2192 t16\nI don't see t31 here. Looking through other non-terminals:\n\nAh, I see NT62 \u2192 t24, NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT62, etc. Maybe it's deeper.\n\nWait, let me check NT26:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t20\n- NT26 \u2192 NT49 NT37\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT26 is a non-terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking further, the string after t18 is t31, then t29, etc. Let me try to map this:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT95 NT83 (since NT95 can produce t18)\n2. NT95 \u2192 t18\n3. Now, after t18, the next token is t31, so the remaining part after NT95's expansion must be NT83. But wait, S \u2192 NT95 NT83, so after NT95 is NT83, which must expand into the remaining tokens: t31 t29 t31 t31 t17 t36 t18 t31 t17 t2 t1 t35 t31 t36.\n\nWait, no, the string is t18 followed by the rest: t31, t29, t31, t31, t17, t36, t18, t31, t17, t2, t1, t35, t31, t36.\n\nWait, sorry, the entire string is:\n\nt18, t31, t29, t31, t31, t17, t36, t18, t31, t17, t2, t1, t35, t31, t36.\n\nSo after the first t18 from NT95, the next is t31, which must come from NT83. So let's see how NT83 can produce t31.\n\nLooking at NT83's productions, I don't see a rule that directly gives t31. Let's check all possibilities:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24\n- NT83 \u2192 t28\n\nNone of these directly produce t31. So perhaps the t31 comes from expanding these into sequences that produce t31.\n\nLooking at NT22 NT45 first. So NT22 and NT45.\n\nNT22's productions include:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63\n- NT22 \u2192 NT68\nSo if NT22 expands to NT44 NT63, then NT44 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT44's productions:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT44 \u2192 t9\n- NT44 \u2192 t16\nHmm, but none of these are t31. Alternatively, NT44 \u2192 NT52 NT95? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking at NT63"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-269","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the grammar is quite extensive with multiple terminals and non-terminals, but let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the given grammar seems to adhere to CNF since each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t18 t4 t29 t31 t11 t6 t24 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t33`. It looks like a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can reach the given string. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, can split into either NT49 or NT83. So, the root of the parse tree would be S.\n\nLooking at the productions for S:\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, each of these NT symbols can split further. For example, NT73 can produce NT62 NT27 or NT12 NT47, and so on. This seems complicated because there are many options, so maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string from the start and see if it can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me list the string again for clarity:\nt18, t4, t29, t31, t11, t6, t24, t36, t35, t6, t6, t36, t17, t36, t33.\n\nI notice that some of these terminals appear as productions. For example, t18 is produced by NT9, which is part of NT95 or other paths. Similarly, t4 is produced by NT44, which is part of NT26 or other productions.\n\nMaybe I should try to match the string from left to right, choosing which productions to follow. Let's start.\n\nThe first symbol is t18. Looking at the grammar, NT95 can produce t18. So, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the next step is to process NT95 and NT83.\n\nNT95 can produce t19? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT95 seems to have a production: NT99 \u2192 NT35 NT62, NT35 \u2192 t3, among others. Wait, let me check all the productions for each NT symbol step by step.\n\nWait, I might need a table of productions for each NT. Let me list all the NT symbols and their possible productions and terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20, S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, NT49 \u2192 t3, etc.\n- NT95 needs to be checked. Wait, in the productions, I see NT95's production maybe? Oh, I see: NT44 \u2192 t31, NT24 \u2192 t25, NT68 \u2192 t14, etc. Wait, actually, NT95 is part of S's production, so perhaps I'm missing some NT95 \u2192 something. Wait, looking back, in the given grammar, I don't see an explicit production for NT95 except in S \u2192 NT95, so maybe NT95 is a non-terminal, but its only role is in the S production, so its children would be derived from its own productions.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, each NT symbol is a non-terminal that produces other NT symbols or terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 or NT49 \u2192 t3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back.\n\nThe start symbol is S. It can split into two options: either NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83. Each of these NT symbols can produce something else.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT95 NT83 because the string starts with t18, which seems to come from NT95 \u2192 t18 (from NT99 \u2192 NT35 NT62, and NT35 \u2192 t3? Wait, maybe that's a longer derivation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the reverse: the terminals t35, t62, etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me go back. I have the string: t18 t4 t29 t31 t11 t6 t24 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t33.\n\nLet me list the string as a list: [t18, t4, t29, t31, t11, t6, t24, t36, t35, t6, t6, t36, t17, t36, t33]\n\nI think the best way is to try to construct the parse tree, but with so many NT symbols and productions, this might be time-consuming. Maybe I should try to find a path where each step in the string can be matched by a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent approach or the CYK algorithm could help, but with the given grammar, that might be complicated.\n\nWait, let's try to break down the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nBecause the first symbol is t18, which is produced by NT95: looking through the productions, I see NT95 \u2192 t18 is in the grammar? Wait, looking at NT99's productions: NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62, etc., but where does t18 come from? Wait, looking at the productions, NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62, but I don't see NT95 \u2192 t18 directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 and NT49 \u2192 t3, but perhaps I'm confusing NT95 with others. Alternatively, maybe t18 comes from another production, like NT44 \u2192 t31, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

NT99 \u2192 t35, t6, t20, t10, etc.\n\nWait, let's list for each NT the possible direct terminals they produce:\n\n- NT52: looking through its productions, does it produce terminals? Hmm, I don't see NT52 directly producing any terminals. NT52 splits into NT35 and NT96, and those may produce terminals further down. For example, from NT35, you get t3, etc.\n\n- NT83: NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45, which then further split, but perhaps via some path, it can produce t28. Wait, NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45, but I don't see any direct terminal in NT22 or NT45. Wait, look at NT83: no, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, from the grammar, NT83 produces NT22 NT45, and NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63, NT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52.

{"custom_id":"request-292","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for certain types of parsing and theoretical analysis.\n\nGiven the grammar provided, it looks like it's in CNF because each production on the left side of the arrow (like S \u2192 NT73 NT20) either has exactly two non-terminals or directly a terminal. Wait, actually, some of the productions for NTs have two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF since each production can produce two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t18 t31 t29 t31 t11 t24 t36 t35 t31 t17 t2 t1 t35 t31 t11 t27`. Hmm, let me break this down. It's a series of tokens separated by spaces, each token starts with 't' followed by a number. So, there are 16 tokens in total.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string from the left using the grammar to see if it can be derived step by step. Since it's a context-free grammar, top-down parsing is suitable, perhaps using a method like the CYK algorithm, but maybe more straightforward since the string isn't too long.\n\nAlternatively, I can construct a parse tree to see if each token can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar, working my way from the roots down to the string.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the productions given. The NTs are all the non-terminal symbols, so NT52, NT73, NT95, etc., and all the terminals are t followed by numbers like t18, t31, etc.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S.

Each production ends with a terminal or is a non-terminal. Wait, actually, the productions are all in the form of non-terminals on the left producing a combination. So, I think the right-hand side of each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which is two non-terminals, but the string starts with 't18', which is a terminal. So, perhaps in the parse tree, the S non-terminal would produce the first two NTs, which in turn would produce the terminals.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is long, so let's see if it can be derived from the S \u2192 NT73 NT20 production. Let's check if the first few symbols can be derived from NT73 and NT20.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT73 has a production: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 and NT73 \u2192 't36'. But looking back, in the provided productions under NT73, there's a production: NT73 \u2192 't36' as well as others. So, perhaps S \u2192 NT73 NT20 could lead to 't36' and the beginning of 't31'.\n\nWait, the string starts with t18, which doesn't match 't36' or 't31' from the beginning of NT73. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if another production for S can be used.\n\nThe other S production is S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Let's see what NT95 and NT83 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT95, in the provided productions, I see NT95 \u2192 't18' (from line ... wait, let me check. The provided productions for NT95 is indeed 't18'? Let me look.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT99 -> NT38 NT62\n- NT99 -> NT63 NT2\n- NT90 -> NT38 NT95\n- NT47 -> NT8 NT44\n- NT51 -> NT64 NT90\n- NT47 -> NT49 NT26\n- NT88 -> NT9 NT53\n- NT74 -> NT39 NT39\n- NT96 -> NT82 NT83\n- NT82 -> NT51 NT84\n- NT37 -> NT85 NT55\n- NT45 -> NT2 NT95\n- NT73 -> NT12 NT47\n- NT85 -> NT74 NT73\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n- NT38 -> 't36'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT49 -> 't9'\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, under NT95, looking at the productions: \n\nLooking through the provided productions for NT95:\n\n- There's NT45 -> NT2 NT95\n- Also, looking for NT95, does it have a production leading to a terminal? I don't think so. Wait, let me check each NT.\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\n- NT52: \u2192 NT35 NT96; \u2192 NT80 NT47; \u2192 NT12 NT85; \u2192 NT71 NT68; \u2192 NT99 NT37; \u2192 NT83 NT22; \u2192 NT52 NT12; does it have a production to a terminal? No, all are non-terminals except perhaps for some where I see a terminal in the RHS. For example, for NT49, there's a production \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, looking at NT95, do I see any production that leads to a terminal? From the provided list:\n\nLooking at NT95,\n\n- NT45 -> NT2 NT95\n\nBut no, not NT95. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each NT's productions.\n\nLet me go through each NT and see their productions.\n\nStarting with NT95:\n\nI don't see NT95 having any production that ends with a terminal, so maybe S \u2192 NT95 NT83 would require that NT95 and NT83 can both produce terminals, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking back, the string starts with t18, t31, etc. Let's look at where t18 is.\n\nIn the productions, for NT95, looking through the lines:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't18' (I'm not sure; did I miss that? Let me check the provided productions again. Oh, yes, line 'NT95 -> 't18''. So NT95 can produce 't18' directly.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT95 NT83, and NT95 can produce 't18', so that's the first token. Then, NT83 can produce the next part of the string.\n\nNow, after 't18', the string is t31 t29 t31 t11 t24 t36 t35 t31 t17 t2 t1 t35 t31 t11 t27.\n\nSo after 't18' comes 't31'. So NT83 needs to produce a sequence starting with 't31'.\n\nLooking at NT83, what productions are available? Checking the productions for NT83:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT83 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n- NT83 \u2192 't28'\n- So, NT83 can produce a terminal 't28' directly.\n\nWait, but the second token is 't31', not 't28'. So perhaps if NT83 produces 't28', that won't match. So perhaps that path is stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a longer production. Let's see if we can derive more than one symbol from NT83.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT73 NT20 is a better starting point. Let's try that.\n\nNT73's productions include NT62 NT27 and also \u2192 't36'.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT73 NT20, then NT73 could produce 't36' or lead to more symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't18', not 't36', so that doesn't match. Hence, perhaps S \u2192 NT73 NT20 is not the right path, because it can't produce 't18' directly.\n\nSo that means the start symbol must expand via"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-293","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t29 t35 t31 t24 t36 t35 t31 t11 t30 t31`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Hmm, I've done some parsing before but I need to carefully go through this.\n\nFirst off, let me recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the derivation starts from S, ending in the target string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So the initial steps would involve expanding S into either of these two options. The string we're checking starts with t35, t31, etc. I suppose I need to see if the start symbol can derive the given string.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT35, NT29, etc. Wait, actually, the string consists of t's with numbers. The right-hand side of some grammar rules expand into t's. For example, NT20 might produce t17 (as per the rule NT20 -> 't17'), and so on.\n\nWait, so each terminal in the string is a 't' followed by a number, and the non-terminals are things like NT35, which produce various 't's. So the strategy is to see if we can find a path from the start symbol S, expanding the non-terminals step by step until we get only terminals, matching the string.\n\nThe given string is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t29 t35 t31 t24 t36 t35 t31 t11 t30 t31.\n\nFirst, let's see if the string can start with any of the productions of S.\n\nLooking at the first symbols: t35, t31, etc. Let's think about the possible NTs that produce t35. Looking through the rules, I see NT35 has a production like NT35 -> NT49 NT33, but also others like NT35 -> 't3', 't5', 't13', 't35' (seems like a loop or a direct production). Wait, looking back, I see NT35 has a production NT35 -> t13. Wait, no, let me check the rules again. Oh, actually, in the provided grammar list, I see:\n\nNT35 -> t3\nNT35 -> t5\nNT35 -> t13\nNT35 -> t35\n\nHmm, that seems like possible loops, maybe leading to infinite recursion if not handled properly. But in our target string, the first part is t35, which requires that the NT generating it must have a production that starts with t35. Wait, but wait, the rule is like NT35 -> NT49 NT33? Or maybe it's something else. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT35 is defined with several productions, including NT35 -> 't3', 't5', 't13', 't35'. So NT35 can produce 't35' directly, but I also see a rule like NT52 -> NT35 NT96. So if I have NT35, I can derive 't35' directly, which is helpful because the string starts with t35.\n\nAlternatively, another option is S -> NT73 NT20. So let's see NT73's productions. From the rules, I see NT73 -> NT62 NT27, and NT73 can also go to 't36' and 't33'? Wait, no, looking again: I see NT73 has some options, like NT73 -> NT62 NT27 and also NT73 -> 't36' (wait, in the given rules, it's NT73 -> 't36') and another rule is NT73 -> 't33'. No, wait, looking again, I think I missed that. Let me check:\n\nThe grammar rules include:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> 't36'\n- Also, looking through, I see a rule like NT73 -> 't33' perhaps? Wait no, in the given rules, I see NT73 -> NT49 NT27? Wait, maybe not. Let me list all NT73 rules:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> 't36'\n- Wait, also looking further, I see another rule: NT73 -> 't33' perhaps? Hmm, no, let me confirm:\n\nWait, no, actually in the provided rules, I don't see NT73 -> t33. It seems like the only t in NT73 is 't36'. So starting with S -> NT73 NT20, and then trying to expand NT73 to 't36' and NT20 to 't17', which would give 't36 t17', but the string starts with t35, which doesn't match 't36' or 't17'. So that path can't be correct.\n\nAlternatively, S can produce S -> NT95 NT83. So let me look at NT95 and NT83.\n\nNT95's productions: NT95 -> NT38 NT62, etc. Also, looking through the NT95 rules:\n\n- NT95 -> 't18'\n- Also, NT95 can expand to other NTs, but the direct t production is 't18'. So if we have S -> NT95 NT83, then the initial expansion would lead to something like 't18' from NT95 and something else from NT83. But the string starts with 't35', so NT95 might not be the starting point.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't35', so perhaps the initial step is to expand via S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83, but as I saw, S -> NT73 NT20 would lead to either 't36' or other t's, but not 't35'. S -> NT95 NT83 would lead to 't18' if NT95 is expanded directly, but starting with 't35' so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial expansion isn't directly to the t's but through some NTs that can produce the required symbols. Wait, but if S produces NT73 NT20, then each of these can either expand into other NTs or terminals. So perhaps the first symbol t35 comes from NT73, which in turn expands into other NTs, and so on.\n\nWait, but looking at the initial step, S is replaced by NT73 NT20. The first symbol in the target string is t35. So let's see how NT73 can derive t35. Looking at the rules for NT73:\n\n- NT73 can expand into NT62 NT27 or 't36' or perhaps 't33'\u2014I'm not sure. From the rules listed, I think NT73 has a production like NT73 -> NT62 NT27 and also NT73 -> 't36', and another rule like NT73 -> 't33'\u2014no, actually, looking again, in the given grammar, I don't see that. It only says NT73 -> NT62 NT27, and NT73 -> 't36'. So to get t35 from NT73, there's no direct path unless we have another production.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm wrong. Let me get back. The target string starts with t35, so perhaps the initial NT73 needs to expand into 't35' somehow, but based on the rules, NT73 doesn't have a production that directly yields 't35'. So maybe the only way is through other NTs. Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this systematically. Let's consider the entire string.\n\nThe string is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t29 t35 t31 t24 t36 t35 t31 t11 t30 t31.\n\nSo 16 symbols in total. Let's see if they can be generated by the grammar, starting from S.\n\nThe approach is to see if the entire string can be derived from S by expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals, ending up with all terminals matching the string.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which makes parsing manageable with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, CNF has a specific structure where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Also, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can have a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure, so that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t18 t4 t29 t4 t31 t6 t17 t2 t27 t0 t18 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t27`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar's top-level rules. The start symbol is S, and the first production rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo S can be broken down into two parts: NT73 followed by NT20, or NT95 followed by NT83. Now, looking at the string, it starts with t18. I need to see if any of these right-hand sides can derive a sequence that starts with t18.\n\nLooking at NT73 and NT20:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68\n\nSo combining, S \u2192 NT73 NT20 would be [NT12 NT47][NT27 NT68]. Similarly, S \u2192 NT95 NT83 would be [NT95 NT85][NT83 NT24].\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the individual NT rules. Let me see how each of these non-terminals can derive into terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, some of the NT's have terminals as their right-hand sides. For example, NT64 \u2192 't17', NT24 \u2192 't25', etc. So each time a non-terminal with a terminal production appears, that terminal is part of the string.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct a possible derivation for the string. The string begins with t18. Let's see which NT rule leads to t18.\n\nLooking at the list of rules, I don't see an NT that directly produces t18. Wait, actually, NT9 \u2192 't10' and NT4 \u2192 't11', etc., but I don't see any NT directly producing t18. Hmm, that seems problematic.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.

The string is a sequence of t's with numbers, like t18, t4, and so on. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it makes parsing easier. Each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That means every step of production either adds two symbols or stops.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t-terms. I think each t-term must be produced by a terminal production in the grammar. So, the string consists of these terminals, and I need to check if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two main productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo any derived string must start with the symbols from either of these productions. Since the string starts with t18, I need to see where t18 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that NT73 can produce t36 or go further. Wait, no. In the grammar, some NTs have t rules, others don't. Let me check NT73:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27  \nNT62 has\u2192 't24' or NT53. NT53\u2192 NT63, etc., but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string starts with t18, I need to find a production that leads directly to t18. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62  \nBut I don't see NT38 or NT62 directly leading to t18. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the rules for terminals:\n- NT95 \u2192 t18\n- NT99 \u2192 t10\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT49 \u2192 t3\n- NT68 \u2192 t14\n- NT11 \u2192 t12\n- NT35 \u2192 t3, t13, t5, etc.\n- NT73 \u2192 t36 in some cases, but how does that get to t18?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial symbols derived from S are combinations of NTs leading to t's. Maybe I should try constructing the string step by step.\n\nBut another approach is to see if each t in the string is present in the grammar's terminals. Let me scan the string:\n\nt18, t4, t29, t31, t31, t24, t2, t27, t0, t18, t31, t24, t36, t18, t31, t36, t27.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nt18 is produced by NT89? Wait, no, NT95 \u2192 t18.\n\nt4 is produced by which rule? Looking through, I see NT4 \u2192 t11. Wait, no, that's t11. Does any NT produce t4?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t4. Hmm, that's a problem. Because in the string, we have t4, but if no NT produces t4, then that t4 is invalid. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The rules:\n\nLooking for 't4':\n- NT4 \u2192 t11\n- NT6 \u2192 t8 (from NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73; and NT88 \u2192 t28; NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27; but NT27 leads to 't24'? Wait, in the rules:\n\nWait, NT4 is a terminal producing t11. Are there any other rules for NT4? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through all NT and T rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73\n- NT4 \u2192 t11 (I think that's the case, as I see under NT44 \u2192 't31', but wait, no. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nOh, wait, in the grammar provided, the production is under NT44: NT44 \u2192 't4', so NT44 produces t4.\n\nAh, okay, I see. So NT44 \u2192 't4' is a production. So in that case, t4 is allowed because NT44 can produce it.\n\nSimilarly, I need to check each t in the string to see if there's a corresponding NT that can produce it.\n\nBut in the grammar provided, I see:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 t18\n- NT35 \u2192 t3, t5\n- NT39 \u2192 t6\n- NT52 \u2192 several productions, but some leading to t's like in the rules.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to check each t in the string against the grammar to see if there's a path.\n\nSo for each t in the string, I'll check if it's a terminal or if it can be produced by some NT.\n\nt18: from NT95 \u2192 t18. Yes.\nt4: from NT44 \u2192 t4. Yes.\nt29: looking for NTs that produce t29. Let's see, in the rules:\n\nLooking at the NT29: Hmm, I don't see any NT with t29 as a terminal. Wait, maybe NT38 \u2192 NT26 NT20. NT20 \u2192 t17. NT26 \u2192 t2. Then NT49 \u2192 't9'? Wait, no, NT49 \u2192 't23'? No, wait, let me check:\n\nLooking again, under NT49: NT49 \u2192 't3' and 't23'. So no, NT49 \u2192 't23'.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. So t29: does any NT produce t29? Looking through all the terminals, I don't see any NT that directly produces t29. So maybe t29 is not allowed. Therefore, the string has t29, which isn't produced by any NT in the grammar.\n\nIf that's the case, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because t29 is not a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but I might have missed something. Let me check all NTs for t29.\n\nLooking at:\n\n- NT33 is produced by NT62 \u2192 't24', and other rules, but no t29. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, in the provided grammar, under NT62: NT62 has productions leading to 't24' or other NTs. NT62 is used in NT37 \u2192 NT31 NT62, which might lead to more t's. But t29 is not present anywhere. \n\nSo, if t29 is not a terminal, but must be generated by some NT, but if there's no NT that produces t29, then the string contains a t that the grammar cannot produce, so the string is not in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe t29 is produced somewhere else. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT85 NT55\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT38 \u2192 NT26 NT20, NT26 \u2192 't2', NT20 \u2192 't17'. So NT38 \u2192 leads to t2 t17, so t26 and t20 are 't2' and 't17'. Hmm.\n\nWait, I'm getting too deep into a specific path, but the main issue is that t29 is in the string and I don't see any NT producing t29. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since all the RHS are either two non-terminals or single terminals, that's correct. \n\nThe target string consists of a sequence of symbols, some of which are terminals (like t18, t4, etc.).

Since the string is a sequence of terminals, every non-terminal in the derivation must be expanded into a terminal through the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can be replaced by either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.

The grammar has several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should understand what it means for a string to be generated by a grammar. Context-free grammars generate strings through a series of substitutions starting from the start symbol. Here, the start symbol is S, and the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that S is derived from either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83, etc. Each of these NT symbols eventually substitute into terminal strings 't' followed by numbers. The string to check is a series of terminals, so I need to see if this series can be obtained through a series of substitutions starting from S and replacing non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nThe string is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t29 t18 t6 t17 t29 t18 t31 t36 t33 t17 t6 t36.\n\nFirst step: The initial symbols are t35 and t31. Wait, no\u2014 actually, the entire string starts with t35. So the first part is t35, which means the first substitution must end with t35, implying a path where the leftmost non-terminal expands to t35.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, 't35' must come from the right-hand side of some production. Checking the production rules, I see entries like:\n\nNT35 -> t3, t5, etc. But wait, in the grammar provided, for example, NT99 -> 't10', and so on. Wait, actually, some NT rules go to terminals directly. For example, NT35 appears in multiple productions like NT35 -> NT62 NT27, but also has some rules going to terminals like t3, t5, etc.\n\nLooking back, the string starts with t35. So how does that happen? Let me check if any production leads directly to t35 or through a chain.\n\nLooking at production rules, I see NT35 has a rule: NT35 -> t3, which suggests that it can directly produce t3.

So perhaps there's a chain where a non-terminal A produces to B and C, each of which eventually produce the terminal t35. But let's see the structure more carefully.\n\nThe string is t35 followed by t31, then t29, and so on. So perhaps S can expand into parts that produce these t terminals in sequence.\n\nWait, the start symbol S can produce either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's explore both.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Then each of these NT symbols will expand. Let's look at NT73: from the rules, NT73 can produce NT62 NT27 or directly to 't36'. Similarly, NT20 can produce NT27 NT68 or 't17'.\n\nBut in the given string, the first few characters are t35, t31, t29. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if the string can be split into possible derivation steps.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT95 NT83 is a better starting point since t35 is one of the possibilities in NT35, which is part of NT95's production.\n\nLooking at NT95, in the grammar, I see NT95 \u2192 NT35 NT39. So, perhaps S \u2192 NT95 NT83 would expand into NT95 (which is NT35 NT39) and NT83 (which is NT22 NT45).\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT95 NT83 \u2192 (NT35 NT39) (NT22 NT45).\n\nNow, NT35 can produce t3, t5, etc., and NT22 can produce NT44 NT63 or 't11'. Wait, but in the string, after the initial t35, we have t31, t29, etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first NT95 produces a sequence that includes t35, t31, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a chain of NT symbols that can generate the t's in order.\n\nAnother approach: parse the string backward to see if it can be generated by looking from the end.\n\nThe last part of the string ends with t36, which could come from NT62 (since NT62 can produce t24) or NT73 (which produces t36). Alternatively, looking at the grammar, NT38 can produce t36 because there's a rule NT38 -> t36.\n\nWait, in the grammar, earlier, there is NT38 -> 't36' in multiple places, but also, NT62 can produce t24 and t6, but also, NT38 can be produced by other rules. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, I need a systematic way. Let's list the productions that generate each terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production that ends with a terminal is as follows:\n\n- NT35 -> t3, t5\n- NT39 -> t3, t5, etc.\nWait, no, more carefully, I need to list each terminal as being generated by certain NT rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3 (once), t5 (once)\nNT37 \u2192 t31 (once), t33 (once), t55 (once)\nWait no, NT37 has productions like NT85 -> t74 nt73, but that's a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I should look for all terminals in the rules.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let's focus on the given string and the possible steps.\n\nThe string is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t29 t18 t6 t17 t29 t18 t31 t36 t33 t17 t6 t36.\n\nWait, let me parse it as a sequence: each character is 't' followed by a number, from t35 down.\n\nI think it's going to take a lot of steps, but perhaps I can find a path from S to this string by breaking it down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parsing the string to see if each t corresponds to a non-terminal that can generate that t.\n\nLet me think of the derivation as starting from S and expanding each symbol until reaching terminals.\n\nBut manually doing this for a long string would be tedious. Maybe I can look for the presence of certain sequences that can only be generated in specific ways.\n\nLooking at the string, the third symbol is t29. Let's see where t29 comes from.\n\nLooking at all production rules, the terminals include t29 via:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t20 and t4\n- NT47 \u2192 t27 and t8\n- NT64 \u2192 t17 and others\n- NT62 \u2192 t24 and t6\n- NT22 \u2192 t11 and t63\nWait, NT27 is 't33' and 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for which non-terminals produce t29.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT12 \u2192 t11 and t85, but no terminals. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar rules, do any non-terminals produce t29? Let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking through all production rules:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 t31, t33, t55\n- NT26 \u2192 t20, t4\n- NT47 \u2192 t8, t27\n- NT73 \u2192 t36 (twice)\n- NT35 \u2192 t3, t5\n- NT39 \u2192 t3, t5, etc.\n- NT45 \u2192 t4, t5\n- NT68 \u2192 t14\n- NT11 \u2192 t12\n- NT35 appears as a terminal in other rules, but I don't see t29 being generated directly by any NT rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps NT64 \u2192 t17 and others, but again, not t29.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's generated via a rule that I'm overlooking. Wait, let me re-express all terminal rules first.\n\nTerminal production rules are cases where A \u2192 a, where a is a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I can collect each terminal production:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 t80, NT47\n- NT71 \u2192 t68, t2\n- NT83 \u2192 t22,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-352","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has multiple productions, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left, except for the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, it seems like most productions are two non-terminals on the left, except for some that have a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, some rules have things like S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Here, NT73 and NT20 are non-terminals, but the RHS is two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must derive exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, no more. So in this grammar, all productions on the left are non-terminals, but the RHS is either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or vice versa? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20: two non-terminals, okay.\n- S \u2192 NT95 NT83: same.\n- NT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96: two non-terminals.\n- NT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2: one non-terminal and one terminal.\nWait, that's a problem because in CNF, each production can have only one terminal on the RHS. So for example, NT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2 is two symbols, but NT2 is a terminal. So that's allowed as it's one terminal and one non-terminal, but I think in CNF, each production can only have terminals and non-terminals, but the entire RHS can have any number as long as each production is of the form A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 BC D? Wait no, no, in CNF, each RHS must have exactly two symbols. So each production must have exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal or two terminals. Wait, but in standard CNF, terminals are not part of the grammar; that is, the grammar only has non-terminals, and terminals are the result of the end productions. So maybe the given grammar is mixed with terminals on the RHS, which is acceptable as long as each production only replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, which can include terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, some rules have three symbols on the RHS, like NT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96 (two non-terminals), NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62 (two non-terminals), but then some have, like, NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85 (two non-terminals again), and some seem to combine a non-terminal and terminals. Wait, let me look again. For example, NT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2: that's two symbols, one non-terminal (NT68) and one terminal (NT2? Wait, no, NT2 is a terminal, right? Because NT2 is a terminal symbol. Wait, but NT2 is under the list of terminals? Let me check the string: looking at the string, I see terms like t35, t31, t29, etc. So the terminals are like t35, t31, etc., and non-terminals are things like NT52, NT71, etc. So in the productions, like S \u2192 NT73 NT20: that's a production where S is replaced by two non-terminals. Similarly, S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nBut then look at NT71 \u2192 NT68 NT2: that's a production where NT71 is replaced by NT68 followed by NT2. Wait, but NT2 is a terminal, as the string has a 't2' token, right? So that's allowed. So each production is replacing one non-terminal with two symbols, which can be a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nNow, the string to check is: t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t20 t27 t14 t18 t31 t24 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36.\n\nWait, but let me count the tokens in the string. Let me write them out:\n\nt35, t31, t29, t4, t31, t24, t20, t27, t14, t18, t31, t24, t36, t35, t6, t6, t36, t17, t36.\n\nThat's 18 tokens. Now, each production in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So the length of the string derived from a non-terminal will increase each time. However, in this case, I'm given a specific string to check, so I need to see if it can be derived by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parsing problem, trying to parse the string using the grammar. But since this is a CFG, perhaps the best way is to use the CYK algorithm or some form of step-by-step derivation. But given that the string is quite long (18 tokens), that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to construct the derivation tree step by step. Let me start by identifying what the start symbol is. The grammar starts with S, which has productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo first, the string must start with the result of either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at the given string, it starts with t35. Let me look at the possible production rules that result in t35. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3 (from NT35 in the grammar)\nNT35 \u2192 t13 (so another t13)\nAlso, looking at production rules where NT35 is on the left, for example:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37\nNT37 \u2192 NT65 NT55 (Wait, no, looking back: No, the grammar has NT37 \u2192 NT85 NT55).\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided rules, the NT37 production is: NT37 \u2192 NT85 NT55. So that's a production for NT37.\n\nAlso, looking at NT36: It has NT36 \u2192 t36, as per the grammar.\n\nBut looking for t35, I see that:\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3 (from NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3)\nWait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking for t35, the grammar has:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3 (but wait, that's NT3, which is a terminal, right? Or is it a non-terminal? Wait, no, let's look again. In the grammar, some tokens like t35 are terminals, and others, like NT39, NT49, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nIn the given grammar, for example:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3.\n\nWait, NT3 is a terminal, right? Because in the string, we have t3, t13, etc., which are terminals.\n\nSo, NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3. So that's replacing NT35 with NT49 followed by t3.\n\nSimilarly, another rule is NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3\n- NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37.\n\nSo both rules for NT35 produce two non-terminals followed by a terminal? Wait no, NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3, but wait, wait a second: in the provided grammar, the rule is written as NT35 -> NT49 NT3. Wait, but NT3 is a terminal. So that's a production where NT35 is replaced by NT49 (a non-terminal) followed by t3 (a terminal). Similarly, another rule is NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37, which would be two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, the rules are written with non-terminals in uppercase (NT), followed by a number. So, for example, S is the start symbol, and the productions are S \u2192 NT73 NT20, etc. So, NT73 is a non-terminal, and so is NT20.\n\nNow, looking at the string to parse: the first token is t35. So, in the grammar, how can t35 appear as the first symbol? The only production for t35 is either as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-350","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier, albeit maybe a bit more complex than needed here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to understand the productions. Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT35, etc.) can be broken down into two other non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminal symbols: t35 t4 t29 t4 t31 t6 t24 t36 t35 t6 t24 t36 t18 t31 t36 t33 t17 t24 t33.\n\nTo see if this string is generated by the grammar, I'll need to see if there's a derivation path from the start symbol S that can produce this string exactly. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive approach or try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo the first step is to choose one of these productions. The string starts with t35 t4... Therefore, the first symbols must come from either NT73 or NT95. Let's check what NT73 and NT95 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, but I'm not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, NT73 has several productions. Wait, actually, looking at the given grammar, I notice that NT73 is written twice with the same productions. Let me check:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT73 -> NT73 NT63 (Wait, no, looking again, the grammar seems to have other entries like NT73 -> NT12 NT47, etc. But wait, in the given grammar, under NT73, it's written twice, which might be a typo, but I think it's just a mistake in the formatting. Looking more carefully, the NT73 entries are:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\nNT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n\nWait, actually, the way the grammar is written, it's not entirely clear how many entries each NT has. But in the provided grammar, I see for NT73 two productions:\n1. NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n2. NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n\nSimilarly, NT35 appears multiple times with different productions. So each NT can have multiple productions.\n\nSo, starting with S, the first step is to choose between S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nLet's first assume S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nThen, the start string is t35 t4. So, the first terminal symbol is t35, which means that after the first step, the current production must derive t35. So, let's see what NT73 can produce. From the grammar, NT73 can be:\n\n1. NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n2. NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n\nLooking at the first production, NT62 and NT27 would need to produce t35 and t4. But NT62 isn't directly a terminal. Let's check the productions for NT62. Looking through, there's NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36, and NT62 \u2192 't24'. Wait, yes, under NT62, there's a production NT62 \u2192 't24'.\n\nSo, if NT62 is to produce 't24', then NT27 would need to produce 't35'. Let's check NT27. NT27 has a production \u2192 t33. Wait, no, under NT27, there are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT27 \u2192 't33'. So, NT27 cannot produce 't35'. So that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way. Alternatively, maybe NT73's other production is NT12 and NT47.\n\nWait, so NT73 has two options. Let's check if either can produce t35 t4 t... So for the first symbol t35, if we take NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47, then perhaps NT12 can produce t35. Let me check NT12's productions. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT12 having a production that starts with t35. Wait, no: looking at NT12's productions, the only one is NT12 \u2192 't11', which is t11. So that doesn't help. Therefore, this path doesn't seem to work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial choice of S \u2192 NT73 NT20 is incorrect. Maybe I should try S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the first two symbols would have to come from NT95 and NT83. But the string starts with t35 t4, so one of these must produce t35, but I'm not sure. Let's check NT95 and NT83's productions.\n\nNT95: From the grammar, NT95 \u2192 't35'. So if NT95 produces t35, and NT83 can produce t4, then that could work. Let's see: NT83's productions include NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45, among others. Wait, looking at NT83, it has several productions, including:\n\nLooking through, NT83 has:\n\n1. NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n2. NT83 \u2192 NT95 NT37\n3. NT83 \u2192 NT52 NT43 (Wait, but in the given grammar, NT52 has multiple productions, but looking for NT83, I think I might have misread it. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nActually, looking at the given grammar, NT83 is mentioned here:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\nNT83 \u2192 NT52 NT43 (Wait, no, perhaps that was a typo because in the given grammar, I don't see NT83 \u2192 NT52, but looking more carefully, in the list of productions, I see:\n\nFor NT52, there are multiple productions, but for NT83, it's:\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed NT83 in the given productions. Wait, no, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nThe given grammar includes:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\nNT71 -> NT68 NT2\nNT39 -> NT51 NT37\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\nNT88 -> NT38 NT24\nNT52 -> NT80 NT47\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\nNT80 -> NT71 NT99\nNT22 -> NT44 NT63\nNT99 -> NT38 NT62\nNT99 -> NT63 NT2\netc.\n\nSo, yes, NT83 has the production NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45. So, for NT83 to produce the second symbol t4, we'd need to see which of NT22 or NT45 can produce t4.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52 and NT45 \u2192 't4'. So, if NT45 \u2192 't4', then that would be good. So, perhaps the path is S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nThen, NT95 \u2192 t35, and NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45.\n\nNT22's productions: looking through, I see NT22 \u2192 't22' and NT22 \u2192 't14'. Wait, no: in the grammar, under NT22, it's written as:\n\nNT22 -> 't22' and NT22 -> 't14'?

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. CNF is useful for parsing using certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll have to approach it differently.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t18 t4 t29 t31 t31 t24 t29 t18 t31 t24 t2 t17 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t31 t2 t2`.\n\nI notice that this string consists of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is a terminal symbol because they match the right-hand side of the productions. For example, some tokens like 't18', 't4', etc., are in the grammar, so they can be derived directly.\n\nThe grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT52, NT73, etc.) and terminals (like t36, t18, etc.).

The start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the string starts with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Each of these non-terminals will expand into two non-terminals each, and this continues until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string is: t18 t4 t29 t31 t31 t24 t29 t18 t31 t24 t2 t17 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t31 t2 t2\n\nLet me count the tokens: 19 tokens. That means in the parse tree, there are 19 leaves. Since each production in CNF splits into two non-terminals, the number of non-terminals in the parse tree would be related to the number of productions needed. But maybe a better approach is to map the string to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a top-down approach. Starting with S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach terminals. But perhaps more straightforward is to try to map the string step by step.\n\nLet me list the tokens again:\n\n1. t18\n2. t4\n3. t29\n4. t31\n5. t31\n6. t24\n7. t29\n8. t18\n9. t31\n10. t24\n11. t2\n12. t17\n13. t35\n14. t6\n15. t6\n16. t36\n17. t17\n18. t31\n19. t2\n20. t2\n\nWait, the string has 20 tokens, actually.

Yes, 19 tokens.\n\nI think the approach is to work from the start symbol and see if I can derive this string.\n\nFirst, S can produce either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let me see if either of these can lead to the string.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT73 NT20\n\nSo, we have NT73 and NT20.\n\nLooking at NT73: Its productions are NT73 -> NT12 NT47 and NT73 -> NT36 (but wait, in the list above, NT73 has two rules: one is NT73 -> NT12 NT47, and another is NT73 -> NT36? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait the original grammar has:\n\nNT73 -> NT12 NT47\nNT73 -> NT36\n\nWait, yes, so NT73 can expand into NT12 and NT47, or directly to 't36' according to the production rules.\n\nLooking at NT20: Its productions are NT20 -> NT27 NT68 and NT20 -> 't17'.\n\nSo, if we choose S -> NT73 NT20, then we need to expand NT73 and NT20 into their terminals.\n\nBut looking at NT73, it can either produce 't36' or split into NT12 and NT47.\n\nSimilarly, NT20 can produce either 't17' or NT27 NT68.\n\nIf I pick NT73 -> 't36' and NT20 -> 't17', then the first two tokens would be t36 and t17, but the given string starts with t18 and t4. So that doesn't match. Therefore, this path is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should pick a different expansion.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string starts with t18.

{"custom_id":"request-369","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is: `t18 t4 t29 t31 t31 t24 t2 t1 t35 t31 t17 t29 t18 t6 t6 t36 t17 t31 t0 t2`. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step in a derivation replaces a non-terminal with two elements, either terminals or non-terminals. Since the string is all terminals, I need to see if I can derive it step by step from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions: S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So the string starts with either NT73 or NT95, followed by NT20 or NT83, respectively. The string begins with `t18`, so I need to find which non-terminals can lead to t18.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT73 can produce t18 via NT73 -> t18. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT73 -> 't36' but also other branches. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT73 -> t64, and then t64 -> 't4'. Wait, no, in the third level, looking at the productions, I see NT64 -> 't24'? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing. Let's look for t18.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT95 -> t18 because in the list, I see NT95 -> t18. So the start symbol S can produce NT95, which leads to t18. So the first token 't18' would be derived from NT95. Then the next part after that is 't4'.\n\nSo, the first part would be NT95 -> t18, but wait, looking at the grammar, NT95 is derived from S via S->NT95 NT83. But wait, in the grammar, S has two productions, one leading to NT73 and NT20, and another leading to NT95 and NT83. So S -> NT95 NT83. Then, NT95 produces t18, so the first part is S -> NT95 t18 NT83.\n\nWait, no, because S is replaced by NT95 and NT83, which are separate non-terminals. So after S, we have two branches: NT95 and NT83. So the entire string must be generated via that path.\n\nSo, the first token is from NT95, which produces t18. So after that, the second part of S's production is NT83, which produces t4.\n\nWait, let me check NT83 productions. Looking through the grammar, I see NT83 -> NT22 NT45, then NT22 -> NT44 NT63, and NT44 -> 't31', and NT63 -> 't29'. Wait, but that would produce 't31 t29'. Hmm, but in the string, after t18 comes t4, then t29, t31, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, actually, wait: the string is `t18 t4 t29 t31 t31 t24 t2 t1 t35 t31 t17 t29 t18 t6 t6 t36 t17 t31 t0 t2`.\n\nSo, starting with S, which can be NT95 or NT73. Let me first consider S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nNT95 can produce t18 (since NT95 -> t18), so that's the first token. Then, the second non-terminal is NT83. Now, NT83 has productions like NT83 -> NT22 NT45, NT22 -> NT44 NT63, NT44 -> 't31', NT63 -> 't29'. So if NT83 is replaced by NT22 NT45, each of those can be further split.\n\nWait, but let me make this step by step. Since it's a tree, each production reduces the problem size.\n\nSo after S -> NT95 NT83, we have:\n\n1. NT95 -> t18 (this gives the first token)\n2. NT83 -> ? Need to see what's next.\n\nLooking at NT83:\n\n- NT83 -> NT22 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT44 NT63\n- NT44 -> 't31'\n- NT63 -> 't29'\n\nSo NT83 can produce NT22 and NT45, which further split into terminals or more non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe NT83 can produce a terminal directly. Wait, looking again: the productions of NT83 are:\n\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\nNT83 -> NT38 NT24\nNT83 -> NT9 NT53\nWait, did I miss any? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT83 -> NT22 NT45\n- NT83 -> NT9 NT53\n\nWait, no, in the list, I see NT83 -> NT38 NT24, but not NT9 NT53? Or maybe I'm mixing. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT83:\n- NT83 -> NT22 NT45\n- NT83 -> NT38 NT24\n- NT83 -> NT9 NT53\n\nWait, no, looking at the list provided: under NT83, it's:\n\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\nNT83 -> NT38 NT24\nNT83 -> NT9 NT53\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. So for NT83, it can produce three different options:\n\n1. NT22 NT45\n2. NT38 NT24\n3. NT9 NT53\n\nEach of these is a production. So when S -> NT95 NT83, then NT83 can be one of these three options. So we need to see which of these could lead to the rest of the string.\n\nBut let's walk through the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't18', which comes from NT95 -> t18. So that's one token.\n\nThen the next token is 't4'. So after S -> NT95 NT83, the second production is NT83. The next token is 't4', which suggests that NT83 must produce 't4', but looking at the productions, NT83 produces non-terminals or combinations. So 't4' would have to come from a direct terminal production. Looking back, in the grammar, do any NTs directly produce 't4'?

{"custom_id":"request-386","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the grammar, all the rules are indeed two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or terminal on the right. So that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t17 t36 t18 t6 t24 t29 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t31 t27 t17 t36`.\n\nI need to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S and builds up from there.\n\nLooking at the S productions: S can go to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So, any valid derivation from S must start with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Each of these is a pair of non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nNow, the string starts with t35. Let's see what each NT can produce. Checking the grammar:\n\n- NT35: From the rules, NT35 can produce 't3', 't5', or 't13'. Wait, in the given rules, I see NT35 -> NT3 (but let me check: looking through, I don't see NT35 \u2192 anything else but 't3', 't5', 't13' or others. Wait, the provided grammar has NT35 -> 't3', 't5', 't13'. So t35 is a terminal. So in the string, the first t35 must come from NT35.\n\nWait, no, the string is t35 t31 t29..., so the first symbol is t35, which must come from NT35.\n\nBut let me check the grammar rules for NT35:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT35 -> 't5'\n- NT35 -> 't13'\n\nSo, the production for NT35 can lead to terminals t3, t5, or t13.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is t35. But wait, in the grammar, there's no NT35 -> t35. That seems odd. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The user provided the grammar and the string. Let me see the production for NT35:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3' (probably)\nWait, actually, I don't see NT35 in the rules. Let me scan the rules provided:\n\nNT35 -> NT35 is not present. Looking through, I don't see NT35 in any production. The rules start with S, then NT52, NT73, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me list all NT productions to check if NT35 is present.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT45 -> NT44 NT52\n- NT6 -> NT88 NT73\n- NT38 -> NT26 NT20\n- NT99 -> NT22 NT4 etc.\n\nHmm, I don't see NT35 appearing in any production as a left-hand side. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier. So NT35 is not a non-terminal in this grammar. That would mean that t35 can only come from the terminals, but looking at the string, the first symbol is t35.\n\nWait, but in the string, the symbols are t35, t31, t29, etc. But according to the grammar provided, NT35 is not a non-terminal because it doesn't appear on the left-hand side of any production. Instead, the terminals it can produce are 't3', 't5', 't13'... etc. Wait, but the string is giving t35, which is a terminal symbol, but according to the grammar, there's no production for NT35, so t35 can't be derived from any NT. That seems problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NT35. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT35 is only on the right-hand side. For example, in S's productions and other NT rules, but there's no NT35 on the left. So NT35 is not a non-terminal in the grammar; it's only a terminal. But in the string, the first symbol is t35, which would imply that NT35 is a non-terminal, but it's not defined as such. So does that mean the string cannot be generated? Or perhaps I made a mistake in reading the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the NT35 production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT35 being introduced as a non-terminal. Let me see if any production uses NT35 as a non-terminal. I don't see it in the given production list. For example, NT73 -> NT62 NT27, and NT62 is another non-terminal, but NT35 is not present as a non-terminal anywhere. So, in that case, NT35 is actually a terminal in this grammar.\n\nBut then, in the string, we have t35, which would imply NT35 is a terminal. But in the grammar, it doesn't have any production for NT35. So that's a problem because t35 cannot be derived from any non-terminal. So does that mean that the string is invalid?\n\nWait, but that contradicts. Let me think again. So if NT35 is a terminal, then in the string, the first symbol is t35, which must come from NT35. But since there's no production for NT35, that would mean that NT35 can't be a non-terminal, so t35 can't be part of any derivation from the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated, so the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the NT35 as a non-terminal when it's actually a terminal. So perhaps the string starts with t35, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, there's no way to produce it as a result of any non-terminal.\n\nSo that would mean that the string is not part of the language. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-392","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t18 t31 t29 t4 t11 t6 t24 t36 t18 t24 t36 t18 t31 t24 t2 t17 t35 t31 t36 t17 t36`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit CNF because I don't see any productions with more than two non-terminals on the right, and all terminals are leaves.\n\nNext, I think about how the string is constructed. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals. My plan is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S can go to either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Both of these involve two non-terminals, which will then produce the terminals.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, the first 't18' stands out. Let me check which non-terminals produce 't18'. Scanning through the rules, I see that NT95 \u2192 't18' and NT73 \u2192 't36'. So, S \u2192 NT73 NT20 would give the first 't36' and whatever NT20 produces. But the first symbol is 't18', which comes from NT95, not NT73. So that path doesn't fit. Alternatively, if S goes to NT95 NT83, I need to check if NT95 can produce 't18'. Yes, NT95 \u2192 't18', so maybe that's the right starting point.\n\nSo let's break down the string step by step. Starting with 't18', which comes from NT95. Then the next symbol is 't31'. Looking at NT95's production, it's only NT95 \u2192 't18', so after that, we need another NT. Wait, maybe the next symbol is handled by another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string using the grammar. Each symbol must be matched by a terminal, so I can try to match each part step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT95 NT83. \n\n- The first 't18' comes from NT95 \u2192 't18'.\n- Next is 't31', which must come from NT83. Looking at NT83's productions: NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45, NT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24, etc. None of these produce 't31' directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed by multiple splits of S into NT95 and NT83. Let me try to map this out.\n\nThe entire string is 21 symbols long. Let me list them:\n\n1. t18\n2. t31\n3. t29\n4. t4\n5. t11\n6. t6\n7. t24\n8. t36\n9. t18\n10. t24\n11. t36\n12. t18\n13. t31\n14. t24\n15. t2\n16. t17\n17. t35\n18. t31\n19. t36\n20. t17\n21. t36\n\nLooking at this, it might help to split the string into the two parts produced by S. The first production is S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which would split the string into two substrings. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT95 NT83, which would split into two other substrings.\n\nLet me first try S \u2192 NT95 NT83. NT95 produces 't18', so that matches the first 't18'. Then what does NT83 produce? NT83 can go to NT38 NT24 or NT22 NT45, etc. Now, the second symbol is 't31', which needs to come from NT83's expansion. Looking at the productions of NT83, none directly produce 't31'. So perhaps this path isn't correct, or maybe NT83 breaks down into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each NT symbol is replaced by two NTs, and this continues until we get to terminals. Maybe it's a binary tree of productions leading to terminals. So each step splits a non-terminal into two, and we have to see if each terminal matches at each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to find a leftmost derivation path through the grammar. Starting with S, and replacing the leftmost non-terminal each time until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me attempt a leftmost derivation.\n\nStep 0: S\n\nLooking at the leftmost symbol, which is S. The leftmost production is S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, rewrite as NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, the leftmost symbol is NT95. We can replace NT95 using its productions. The first production is NT95 \u2192 't18'. So, after replacing NT95, the string becomes 't18' NT83.\n\nWait, but NT83 is now the new leftmost. Let's continue.\n\nStep 1: 't18' NT83\n\nNow, replace NT83. Let's look at NT83's productions. NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45, NT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24, etc. The second symbol is 't31', but none of NT83's immediate productions produce 't31'. So perhaps NT83 splits into two non-terminals, each of which is replaced further.\n\nSo, let's pick the first production for NT83: \u2192 NT22 NT45.\n\nNow, the string becomes 't18' NT22 NT45.\n\nNext, the leftmost non-terminal is NT22. Let's replace NT22. NT22's production is NT44 NT63.\n\nSo, replace NT22 with NT44 NT63. Now the string is 't18' NT44 NT63 NT45.\n\nNow, leftmost non-terminal is NT44. Replace NT44 with NT44 NT52. So, string becomes 't18' NT44 NT52 NT63 NT45.\n\nLeftmost is NT44 again. Replace it again: NT44 \u2192 NT44 NT52. Now the string is 't18' NT44 NT52 NT52 NT63 NT45.\n\nThis seems to be getting complicated. Maybe this isn't the right approach. Let me try a different strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts where each part is matched by the leftmost non-terminal expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent the string as a series of steps where each step consumes a part of the string according to the grammar. Let me try that.\n\nStart: S \u2192 NT95 NT83 (since S has two productions, but 't18' comes from NT95's first production, so S \u2192 NT95 NT83).\n\nSo, NT95 \u2192 't18' (consumes first symbol). Now, remaining symbols: t31 t29 t4 t11 t6 t24 t36 t18 t24 t36 t18 t31 t24 t2 t17 t35 t31 t36 t17 t36.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't31', which must come from NT83. So, NT83 \u2192 ... which production produces 't31'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, none of the immediate productions of NT83 produce 't31'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way I split S was wrong. Maybe S \u2192 NT73 NT20 isn't used here. Let me check if S \u2192 NT73 can produce 't18' somehow, but NT73 \u2192 't36' or 't27'. So that's not possible. Hence, S must be S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nBut then, NT83 can't directly produce 't31'. So perhaps NT83 is split further. Let's think about NT83 again.\n\nNT83 can go to NT38 NT24, or others. So, maybe after 't18' from NT95, NT83 splits into NT38 NT24, which would then produce the next two symbols: 't31' and 't24'.\n\nWait, that could work.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule starts with a single non-terminal symbol and the right-hand side has two non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n`t35 t4 t29 t31 t31 t6 t24 t36 t35 t24 t36 t18 t31 t24 t36 t18 t31 t11 t27 t17 t24 t27`\n\nFirst, I should list all the non-terminal symbols and terminals. From the grammar, the non-terminals include S, NT52, NT71, NT39, NT83, etc., up to NT99 and others. The terminals seem to be words like 't35', 't4', 't29', etc. Also, some non-terminals seem to directly correspond to terminals like 't12', 't17', etc.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I know that each step in a derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals into terminals through a series of steps.\n\nI'll approach this by building a parse tree in a bottom-up manner, trying to match the string from the terminals at the bottom. I'll start by looking for production rules where the right-hand side matches the beginning of the string or can be split into parts that match.\n\nThe first step is to see if the start symbol S can produce the first few symbols. Looking at the start symbol S, it has two productions:\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo I can start with either. Let's try NT73 and NT20 first.\n\nLooking at NT73's productions:\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT62 -> NT24 NT36\nNT24 -> NT68\nNT36 -> NT82\nNT82 -> NT51 NT84\nNT51 -> NT64 NT90\nNT90 -> NT38 NT95\nNT38 -> 't31' (and other rules)\nWait, but NT84 has a production NT84 -> 't25', so let's see the path.\n\nWait, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, from S -> NT73 NT20.

{"custom_id":"request-412","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has a specific structure where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs or terminals. That makes sense. The start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens and numbers, like t18, t31, etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t17 t29 t35 t31 t17 t36 t35 t6 t17 t36 t18 t31 t24 t33 t17 t36 t27`.\n\nOkay, so each of these is a terminal symbol. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals according to the production rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. The string length is 22, meaning there must be a derivation that starts from S and produces a string of 22 terminals. Let's think about the number of steps required. Each step increases the string length by 1, starting from 1 (S) up to n, where n is the number of terminals. The number of steps needed would be n-1 = 21. But wait, in CNF, each production replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols. So the maximum length after k steps is 2^k. Hmm, but the string length is 22, which is not a power of two. Wait, that can't be right, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the derivation starts with S, which is a single non-terminal. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so each step can increase the total number of symbols. However, the maximum possible length after k steps is 2^k. So for the string of length m, the number of steps needed would be log2(m). But 22 isn't a power of two, so maybe it's a wrong approach. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nPerhaps instead of thinking about the steps, I should try to parse the string from the start symbol S, applying the productions to see if it can generate the string.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, I might need a smarter way. Maybe I can look for the start of the string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nThe start symbol S has two production rules:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo the initial expansion from S would produce two non-terminals, which would then each expand further. The first thing is that the string must start with symbols that can be derived from either NT73 or NT95 followed by NT20.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are 't18', 't31', 't29', etc. So I need to see if these can be matched by the productions of NT73 and NT20.\n\nWait, NT73 has a production: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. Let's see, what does NT62 produce? Looking at the rules, NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT24. Then NT53 \u2192 NT96 NT24 or NT53 \u2192 other rules? Wait, looking at the NT53 productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT55 -> t17\nNT53 -> NT96 NT24\nSo NT53 \u2192 NT96 NT24.\n\nThen NT96 produces t27, as per:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT82 NT83\nNT82 \u2192 NT51 NT84\nNT84 \u2192 NT44 NT25\nWait, but looking at the rules, there's also NT96 \u2192 NT82 NT83, but I need to check if there's a production for NT96 that leads to terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the list again:\n\nLooking for NT96: \n\nThe production for NT96 is NT96 \u2192 NT83 NT20.\n\nBut wait, no, let's check:\n\nWait, the given list starts with:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, it's written as S -> NT73 NT20,\nS -> NT95 NT83.\n\nLooking further down, under 'NT's:\n\nNT96 appears in:\n\nNT99 -> NT22 NT4\nNT99 -> NT63 NT2\nNT90 -> NT38 NT95\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\nNT51 -> NT64 NT90\nNT47 -> NT49 NT26\nNT88 -> NT9 NT53\nNT74 -> NT39 NT39\nNT96 -> NT82 NT83\nNT82 -> NT51 NT84\nNT37 -> NT85 NT55\nNT45 -> NT2 NT95\nNT73 -> NT12 NT47\nNT85 -> NT74 NT73\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\nNT38 -> 't36' [Wait, there's a rule where NT38 -> 't36'?\n\nWait, looking at the list, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\nNT38 -> 't36' [Wait, that's a terminal production.]\n\nSo NT38 \u2192 t36. So in that case, if somewhere I have NT38, it can replace into 't36'.\n\nBut let's go back: the string starts with 't18', 't31', 't29', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to model a parse tree for the string.\n\nBut given the string is length 22, the parse tree would need to have 21 productions, which could result in up to 2^21 leaves, but our string is only 22, which is much smaller.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too short for S's expansion, but let me check: the initial expansion from S gives two NTs. Then each of those can expand into two more, so after two steps, four symbols, and so on. The maximum possible length after n steps is 2^n. So to reach 22, 2^k >=22, which would be k=5 (32), but 22 is less than 32, so it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by starting from the left and applying productions step by step.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated. Perhaps I can try to find the start and see if the string can be broken down.\n\nWait, looking at the first few symbols: t18, t31, t29, t31, t31, t17,...\n\nFrom S, the expansions start with NT73 or NT95. Let's see what NT73 and NT95 produce.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT73 has production NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT53 NT24.\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT96 NT24.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT82 NT83.\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT51 NT84.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to look for the first symbol, 't18', and see if it's reachable from S through a series of productions.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, the non-terminals can only produce other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are things like t18, t31, etc. So for the string to start with 't18', that 't18' must be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT20 has a production to 't17' and 't68', as:\n\nWait, let me check the rules again for each position.\n\nLooking through the list, I see that some NTs can produce terminals directly.

{"custom_id":"request-430","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it belongs to the language generated by this grammar. Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all productions are either generating two non-terminals or a single terminal. This structure makes parsing easier, but for this problem, maybe we can directly use it to derive the string.\n\nNow, looking at the given grammar, I notice a lot of productions. Let me list them to see the structure better.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S produces NT73 NT20, or NT95 NT83. So S is replaced by two non-terminals. The string we need to check starts with t18, t4, etc., which are terminals, so at some point, we'll need these productions to generate t's.\n\nEach non-terminal (like NT73, NT20, etc.) has productions that either break them down into other non-terminals or eventually into terminals. For example, NT73 can be NT62 NT27 or directly 't36'. Similarly, ND73 might break down further.\n\nThe process is to start from S and see if we can apply productions step by step to reach the given string.\n\nBut this might take a lot of steps, especially since the string is 20 terminals long. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's see: since each production except those ending in terminals splits a non-terminal into exactly two others, the length of the string generated should correspond to the number of leaves in the derivation tree. For each application of a two-nonterminal production, the number of symbols increases by one. Starting from S, which produces two symbols, each additional step adds one more symbol. So if the string is length 20, starting from S, we'd need 20 symbols. Wait, but S starts as two symbols, so the number of symbols increases by one each time. Wait, no: starting with S, each production replaces one symbol with two, so the length increases by one. So starting from S (which is a single symbol), after one step, two, then three, etc.\n\nThe given string has 20 symbols. So the number of steps needed would be 19. But that's a lot to handle manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a path in the derivation that leads to the string. Each t in the string must come from a production that terminates. So we need to see if the string can be built by replacing non-terminals with their possible productions, eventually reaching the string.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string from the start, using the grammar. Since it's CNF, perhaps we can use the Earley algorithm or the recursive descent parser, but manual parsing would be tedious.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe it's better to try to find a possible derivation. Let's start from the string's beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t18, t4, t29, t4, etc. Let's look at the grammar for t18, which is NT99 -> 't10'. Wait, that's not it. Let me check each terminal to see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- t18: NT99 \u2192 t10? Wait, no. Wait the productions show NT96 \u2192 't20' and other t's.\n\nWait, the terminal t18 is produced by NT96 (I think, because NT96 \u2192 't20' and NT97 is not in the grammar; wait, looking back at the productions:\n\nWait, let me check the provided grammar again carefully.\n\nHmm, the non-terminals are:\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\nNT99 \u2192 't10', NT80 \u2192 't7', NT62 \u2192 't24', etc.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up. Let me list which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\n\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT93 \u2192 't5'\n\n- Others: let's make a list.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each terminal and which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT71 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't88'?\n\nWait no, NT6 \u2192 't88'? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, for example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73\n\nWait, no, looking at one line: NT47 \u2192 NT8 NT44\n\nAnother line: NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73 \u2192 which is two non-terminals, so NT6 can be split further until it produces a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to build a parse tree, but perhaps I should start from the top and see if I can generate the string step by step. Alternatively, perhaps we can trace the string back through the productions.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for the structure of the string and see how it can be split.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt18 t4 t29 t4 t11 t17 t29 t35 t17 t20 t17 t18 t31 t24 t20 t17 t18 t31 t24 t27 t17 t6 t36\n\nWait, wait, actually, the string is: \n\nLet me count the number of t's: t18, t4, t29, t4, t11, t17, t29, t35, t17, t20, t17, t18, t31, t24, t20, t17, t18, t31, t24, t27, t17, t6, t36.\n\nWait, that's 23 t's? Or am I miscounting? Wait, let me count again:\n\n1. t18\n\n2. t4\n\n3. t29\n\n4. t4\n\n5. t11\n\n6. t17\n\n7. t29\n\n8. t35\n\n9. t17\n\n10. t20\n\n11. t17\n\n12. t18\n\n13. t31\n\n14. t24\n\n15. t20\n\n16. t17\n\n17. t18\n\n18. t31\n\n19. t24\n\n20. t27\n\n21. t17\n\n22. t6\n\n23. t36\n\nWait, the user wrote the string as: \n\n`t18 t4 t29 t4 t11 t17 t29 t35 t17 t20 t17 t18 t31 t24 t20 t17 t18 t31 t24 t27 t17 t6 t36`\n\nSo that's 23 t's. Hmm, but the grammar's S starts with two non-terminals, each generating some t's. Since S is NTS73 and NTS95 or other, but in any case, the number of t's should correspond to the number of leaves in the derivation tree, which for S would be a certain number depending on the productions.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S generates two non-terminals, say A and B. Each of A and B can generate t's or more non-terminals. The total number of t's is equal to the number of production steps that terminate in terminals. Since S is a binary tree, the number of t's should be equal to the number of leaves in the tree, which for each production step increases the total count by one.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, each application of a rule replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of symbols (including both non-terminals and terminals) increases. Alternatively, perhaps each non-terminal is replaced by two others eventually leading to terminals.\n\nBut let's get back to the structure.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the string's first few t's and try to see if they match the grammar's potential productions.\n\nStarting with t18, which must come from a non-terminal that can produce t18. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see NT99 \u2192 't10', but that's not t18. Let me check which line has 't18':\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see NT88 \u2192 't30' not it.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me scan through all entries.\n\nLooking for 't18':\n\nLine: NT27 \u2192 't33'\n\nNo.\n\nLooking for 't18', it's not directly listed. Hmm. So perhaps wait, in the productions, 't18's may come from NT96:\n\nWait, NT99 \u2192 't10"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-433","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: `t18 t4 t29 t4 t11 t6 t17 t29 t35 t17 t29 t35 t6 t6 t24 t27 t17 t6 t36 t17 t31 t0 t2`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see the production rules. The top-level rules seem to start with S, which can split into NT and NT followed by specific numbers, like S -> NT73 NT20, etc. These non-terminals (NTs) are the starting points.\n\nThe target string seems to be a sequence of t followed by numbers. Each 't' followed by a number must correspond to an NT production that terminates into that 't' symbol. For example, if there's an NT rule that leads to a 't36', that would produce a 't36' token.\n\nI'll list all the NT production rules and see what terminal symbols (t and numbers) they generate:\n\n- NT52 -> NT35 NT96: So NT52 can produce two non-terminals, which would eventually lead to 't3' and 't20' via NT35 -> 't3' and NT96 -> 't20'.\n\nWait, let's parse each NT:\n\n1. NT52 can go to NT35 (t3) and NT96 (t20) or other combinations via other rules. But looking at the rules, I see NT52 has multiple branches, like NT52->NT80 NT47, which leads to t7 (from NT80) and t4 (from NT47? Wait, looking at NT47: NT47->NT8 NT44, then NT8->t38, NT44->t4. So NT47 eventually produces 't4'. So yes, NT52 can produce t3, t20 from one branch, and other t combinations from others.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see each token in the string and see which NT can produce it.\n\nThe string is: t18, t4, t29, t4, t11, t6, t17, t29, t35, t17, t29, t35, t6, t6, t24, t27, t17, t6, t36, t17, t31, t0, t2.\n\nSo starting from the beginning:\n\nt18: Looking for NT production that leads to 't18'. Looking at the productions, I see NT99->'t18' because one of the entries mentions NT99->NT38 NT62, but no, wait. Wait, I see a production: NT99 -> 't10', but also NT99 -> 't10' in another place. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the NT production rules:\n\nI see NT99 -> NT38 NT62 and also NT99->'t10'. Wait, that can't be. Wait, looking again, under NT99: It has a rule NT99->NT38 NT62, which would mean it produces two non-terminals, but also there's NT99->'t10' as another rule. Wait, that's conflicting. So does that mean NT99 can't produce t10? Or is that a typo?\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, under NT99, there are two productions:\n\nNT99 -> NT38 NT62\n\nand\n\nNT99 -> 't10'\n\nSo that means NT99 can directly produce 't10' or also produce two non-terminals leading to possibly another path. So t18 must come from some NT.\n\nLooking for NT whose production includes 't18'. Let me scan through all NT rules to find any that produce t18.\n\nLooking at NT73: NT73 -> NT12 NT47 and other rules. But I see a production NT73->'t36' which might not be relevant here. Wait, wait, in the rules, I see NT73->'t36', but that's when it's reduced directly. So, perhaps t18 is produced by another NT.\n\nWait, let me check if any NT has a production that includes 't18'.\n\nLooking carefully, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't18' except perhaps in the case of NT99. But earlier, I thought NT99 can produce 't10' or 't38' and 't62' via NT38 and NT62. Wait, NT38 has two rules: NT38->'t29' and NT38->'t26 NT20'. So if NT38 is used, it can produce t29 or more tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's methodically check each token in the string.\n\n1. t18: I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t18. Looking through all NT rules, none seem to have 't18' as a terminal. So unless t18 is produced by a combination of NT rules leading to it, which seems impossible, this might be a problem.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine all NT rules.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see NT90->NT38 NT95, which would produce 't29' and 't18' since NT95->'t18'. Wait, no: looking at NT95 rules, I don't see NT95->t18. Wait, in the NT95 rules, I see NT95->'t18'? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the NT95 rules: I see NT95->'t18' as one of the productions. Yes, under NT95: NT95->'t18'. So how do we get t18? The string starts with t18, so that must come from NT95->'t18'. But where does NT95 come from?\n\nLooking at the main grammar, the top-level NT rules are:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\n\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo the initial S can split into either NT73, NT20 or NT95, NT83. Then, each of those NTs must generate sequences that lead to the string.\n\nSo, for the first token t18, it must come from NT95->'t18'. So the start would be S->NT95 NT83, and then NT95 produces t18, and NT83 must produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut wait, the string is t18 followed by t4, etc. So after the initial NT95->t18, the NT83 must generate the rest of the tokens: t4, t29, t4, t11, t6, etc.\n\nBut let's see. NT83's productions:\n\nLooking through NT83 rules, I see:\n\nNT83->NT22 NT45,\n\nNT83->NT38 NT24,\n\nNT83->'t28',\n\nand others. None of these show NT83 producing t4. So t4 must come from another NT.\n\nWait, t4 comes after t18. So let's see if any NT can produce t4.\n\nLooking at NT rules:\n\nNT44->'t4'. So yes, NT44 can produce t4. So t4 must come from NT44.\n\nSo, after NT95->t18, the next token is t4, which must come from NT83->something else, but looking at NT83's rules, the possible terminal outputs are t28, t38, etc., but not t4. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misassigned. Let's reconsider.\n\nWait, maybe the first S rule is S->NT73 NT20, and NT73 produces t18. Let me check NT73's rules.\n\nLooking at NT73: NT73-> NT62 NT27, and other rules. But do any of these produce t18? Yes, I see NT73->'t36' and another rule. Wait, perhaps t18 is a detour, or maybe another path.\n\nWait, I might be getting this wrong because I'm not tracking the entire path. Alternatively, perhaps the string doesn't start with t18 as a NT95 production. Maybe the first NT is NT73, but how would that lead to t18?\n\nWait, looking at NT73's rules: I see NT73->'t36', but that's a direct production. So unless the grammar allows for more steps, t18 can't come from NT73 directly. So then, the first t18 must come from NT95.\n\nBut then, NT95->'t18' is a direct rule, so that's fine.

{"custom_id":"request-449","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Chomsky Normal Form is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm.\n\nThe grammar provided here is a bit long, with a series of rules from S down to various non-terminals and some terminals. The string to evaluate is: `t35 t31 t29 t4 t11 t24 t20 t1 t35 t6 t24 t29 t18 t31 t36 t17 t17 t36 t18 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar can derive this string. Each production rule leads to either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string consists entirely of terminals (all the tokens are something like t35, t31, etc.), it means that each part of the string must come directly from a terminal production or be broken down into terminal symbols through a series of production steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the rules have non-terminals on both sides, except for a few that directly produce terminals. For example, NT38 can produce 't36' and others can produce 't17', 't11', etc. So, the string is made up of a sequence of these terminals, and the challenge is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I might consider using the CYK algorithm, which takes a string and determines whether it can be generated by a given grammar in CNF. However, writing out the CYK table for such a long string (25 tokens) manually would be time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, I could try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar's terminal productions.\n\nLet me list out all the terminals in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar's rules:\n\nThe string is: t35, t31, t29, t4, t11, t24, t20, t1, t35, t6, t24, t29, t18, t31, t36, t17, t17, t36, t18, t6, t6, t36, t17, t36.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal is assigned to a specific non-terminal. For example, t35 is produced by NT35, t31 is produced by NT49, t29 by NT22 or NT63, t4 by NT4, t11 by NT38, etc.\n\nI can start by trying to see if the entire string can be derived step by step, perhaps by identifying possible subtrees or breaking it down into parts.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. The first token is t35. Looking at the grammar, t35 is produced by NT35. So, NT35 must be expanded. Looking at the grammar, NT35 has the rule NT35 -> NT59 NT50, but wait, in the provided grammar, I see that there's a rule NT35 -> NT59? No, let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals are repeated, like NT55, NT73, etc. I need to make sure I don't make a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar provided has a lot of entries. Let me scan for t35's production.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT35 -> NT59 NT50. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me check again. Hmm, actually, in the provided grammar, it's possible that NT35 has a production, for example, NT35 -> NT59 NT50 isn't listed. Wait, perhaps I missed that.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking carefully, in the provided rules, I don't see any direct production for NT35. Hmm, that might be an issue. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT38 -> 't36'\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT68 -> 't14'\nNT11 -> 't12'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT64 -> 't17'\nNT99 -> 't10'\nNT35 -> 't5'\nNT63 -> 't29'\nNT96 -> 't20'\nNT4 -> 't11'\nNT49 -> 't23'\nNT82 -> 't5'\nNT83 -> 't28'\nNT37 -> 't31'\nNT95 -> 't35'\nNT8 -> 't30'\nNT64 -> 't24'\nNT26 -> 't20'\nNT49 -> 't9'\nNT88 -> 't28'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT84 -> 't1'\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nNT96 -> 't27'\nNT88 -> 't27'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT62 -> 't24'\nNT53 -> 't11'\nNT96 -> 't37'\nNT20 -> 't1'\nNT53 -> 't23'\nNT27 -> 't33'\nNT62 -> 't36'\nNT26 -> 't2'\nNT49 -> 't0'\nNT99 -> 't16'\nNT27 -> 't27'\nNT49 -> 't2'\nNT24 -> 't25'\nNT47 -> 't27'\nNT12 -> 't31'\n\nWait a minute, so for NT35, there are two rules: NT35 -> 't3' and NT35 -> 't5'. So, either 't3' or 't5' can be derived from NT35.\n\nBut in our string, the first token is 't35', which isn't a terminal but a non-terminal. Wait, wait, in the grammar, S is the start symbol, which is non-terminal, and the string is composed of terminals. So, in the expansion, S must be expanded into a sequence of non-terminals, which in turn are expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't35', which is a terminal. So, that must mean that somewhere in the derivation, a non-terminal is expanded directly into 't35'. But looking at the grammar, is there a rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't35'?\n\nYes, looking through, I see that NT95 -> 't35', and also NT39 -> 't36', which isn't '35'. So, in the grammar, 't35' is produced by NT95.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have 't35' as the first symbol. So, in the derivation, the initial symbol S must derive a string that starts with NT95 -> 't35'.\n\nSo, the first token is 't35', which means that in the parse tree, the root (S) must have a production that eventually leads to a rule that produces 't35' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo, S can derive either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nIf the first symbol is 't35', that would come from NT95 -> 't35'. So, the first part of S's expansion would be NT95. But S is NT95 followed by NT83.\n\nSo, S would generate something starting with NT95, which produces 't35'. Therefore, the first symbol of the string is 't35'.\n\nSo, that matches. So, 't35' is produced by NT95.\n\nNow, the next token is 't31'. Looking at the grammar, 't31' is produced by NT49.\n\nSo, the second symbol is 't31', which must be produced by NT49. So, to get 't31' after 't35', we'd need a production that after 't35', we have another NT49, which produces 't31'.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's try to map this step by step.\n\nLet me try to write the string as a sequence and see how it can be divided.\n\nThe string is: t35, t31, t29, t4, t11, t24, t20, t1, t35, t6, t24, t29, t18, t31, t36, t17, t17"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-447","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t18 t31 t29 t31 t11 t6 t17 t29 t35 t6 t17 t20 t33 t14 t35 t6 t6 t11 t30 t31 t17 t36 t17 t36`. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, each starting with S and then a series of NT followed by numbers or some terminals ('t' followed by numbers).\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the rules that lead directly to terminals, like NT2 -> 't22' or NT4 -> 't16'. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, it seems that the right-hand side of each rule is either two non-terminals or sometimes a non-terminal and a terminal, but in many cases, it's just two non-terminals. For example, S -> NT73 NT20, so S produces two non-terminals.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because some rules seem to mix non-terminals and terminals, like NT38 -> 't36'. So maybe the grammar has a mix of rules that expand to two non-terminals and some that expand to terminals. But for the purpose of generating a string, the process starts from S and applies production rules until only terminals remain.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, each like 't18', 't31', etc. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it using the grammar rules.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, and for terminals, it's A \u2192 a. So the given grammar should have rules either merging non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some rules produce two non-terminals, while others produce a terminal. For example, NT38 can produce 't36' which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-464","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this task where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left side or a terminal. The string to check is `t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t17 t36 t18 t17 t36 t35 t6 t6 t11 t27 t17 t6 t24 t27 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36`, and I have to see if it's part of the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It starts with S \u2192 NT52 NT20, so the string should start with a derivation from NT52 and NT20. The production rules then have NT symbols leading to other NT symbols or terminals.\n\nI notice that each rule in the grammar is of the form NT\u2192NTNT or NT\u2192 terminal. This forms a tree structure where each NT symbol can split into two others until they reach terminals, which then form the string.\n\nI need to check each step of the derivation tree to see if it can produce the given string. Let me try to map out the possible sequence of NT productions that would result in the t's in the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT52 NT20. So the string is initialized as [t...] when NT52 and NT20 produce t's. Let's look at their productions.\n\nNT52 has several options:\n- NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47\n- NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85\n- NT52 \u2192 NT15 NT39\nWait, I see in the grammar S, the initial options for S are NT52 and NT20, so I need to see the production rules for NT52 and NT20.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, the NT52 has multiple rules, but let me list all the possible productions for each NT symbol.\n\nBut wait, in the initial grammar, I see S \u2192 NT52 NT20. So the string starts with S, which splits into NT52 and NT20. Each of these NTs will generate parts of the string.\n\nLooking more closely, I need to see how each NT can derive into a string ending with terminals.\n\nFor example, let's take NT20: its productions are:\n- NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68\n- NT20 \u2192 't22'\nWait, but in the given grammar, I see in NT20 rules: \nLooking back, the grammar for NT20 has:\n- S \u2192 NT20 (as part of the rule)\n- NT20 is also directly producing 't22' in some rules, but perhaps I should look through all the provided NT rules.\n\nWait, looking through the provided NT rules, I see both NT20 and NT26 have productions that can reach terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the given string can be broken down into sequences derived from the NTs.\n\nThe string is: t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t17 t36 t18 t17 t36 t35 t6 t6 t11 t27 t17 t6 t24 t27 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36.\n\nThat's a long string with various t's interspersed. Let me see if these t's correspond to the terminal productions from various NTs.\n\nI need to go step by step, perhaps building the parse tree.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT52 and NT20. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT52's rules:\n- NT52 \u2192 NT80 NT47\n- NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT85\n- NT52 \u2192 NT15 NT39 (Wait, in the provided rules, I don't see NT15. Let me check again. Oh, the user might have included all relevant rules. Let me list all NT rules.\n\nWait, let's list all NT rules in the grammar provided. Each line starts with an NT and shows what it can be replaced with.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- S \u2192 NT52 NT20\n- NT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- (and so on, but perhaps it's more efficient to list all NTs and their rules.)\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backward from the string. Each terminal in the string must be generated by an NT directly, so I can check which NTs have terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NTs that have terminal productions are those with rules ending in 'tXXX'.\n\nFor example:\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT73 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT22 \u2192 't27'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\n- NT49 \u2192 't9'\n- NT88 \u2192 't28'\n- NT37 \u2192 't31'\n- NT99 \u2192 't16'\n- NT47 \u2192 't27'\n- NT27 \u2192 't33'\n- NT62 \u2192 't24'\n- NT53 \u2192 't11'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT49 \u2192 't2'\n- etc.\n\nSo, the string is a series of t's. Each t must come from one of these terminal-ending NT rules.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's 27 tokens. So the full derivation would be 27 steps, each producing a t.\n\nBut the parse tree starts with S, which splits into NT52 and NT20. Each of these will then split into more NTs until the leaves are terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is 27 tokens, the parse tree must have depth 3, because at each split, you get two symbols. So the initial split is depth 1, then each of those splits adds depth 2, and so on until depth 3, giving 2^3 = 8, but wait that's the number of leaves. But the string is longer than 8, so maybe the grammar allows for more splits. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is in the form of a leftmost derivation. Each production can be applied from left to right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct the parse tree top-down.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the earliest possible way to split the string into the terminals coming from each NT's terminal rules.\n\nLet's see.\n\nThe string starts with t35. Looking for which NTs can produce t35.\n\nHmm, in the grammar, which NTs have t35 as a terminal?\n\nLooking at NT55 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, in the terminal rules, looking through:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36', but nope.\n\nWait, let's go through each terminal and see which NT they come from.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t35\n2. t31\n3. t29\n4. t4\n5. t31\n6. t17\n7. t36\n8. t18\n9. t17\n10. t36\n11. t35\n12. t6\n13. t6\n14. t11\n15. t27\n16. t17\n17. t6\n18. t24\n19. t27\n20. t17\n21. t24\n22. t29\n23. t35\n24. t31\n25. t36\n\nSo I have 25 t's in the string. Wait, no, let's count again. The string was written as:\n\nt35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t17 t36 t18 t17 t36 t35 t6 t6 t11 t27 t17 t6 t24 t27 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36\n\nSo that's 27 tokens.\n\nNow, looking for which NTs can produce which t.\n\nFirst, t35:\n\nLooking through the terminal rules:\n\nLet me scan each terminal rule to see if any NT ends with 't35'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, it's in the grammar: NT35 can produce 't3' or 't13' or 't5'.\n\nSo maybe t35 is generated by a different NT. Wait, perhaps I misread.\n\nLooking back through the terminal rules provided in the grammar:\n\nWait, looking for 't35':\n\n- There's NT73 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That might be easier. \n\nSince the string is a sequence of t's, each of which corresponds to a production. The start symbol is S, which can be NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's see what those produce.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t35, t31, t29, etc. So perhaps the tree starts with NT73 -> something leading to t35, and NT20 -> something leading to t31.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, so S produces NT73 and NT20. So to get the string, we'd need to expand each of those non-terminals into terminal sequences.\n\nLooking at NT73: Rule is NT73 -> NT62 NT27. Then each of those must expand. NT62 -> NT36, which then can expand as per NT36's rules. But wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT12 NT47, and NT47 \u2192 NT8 NT44, and NT8 \u2192 't30'? Wait, no, NT8's rules include NT88 \u2192 't30' but that's a different NT88. Wait, looking through, I don't see a direct 't' for NT62. Alternatively, maybe I need to proceed step by step.\n\nLet me list out the string and see possible paths:\n\nThe string is:\nt35 t31 t29 t4 t11 t6 t24 t36 t35 t17 t36 t18 t17 t29 t35 t31 t6 t11 t27 t17 t6 t36 t33 t17 t36\n\nFirst token: t35. Let's see what NT35 can produce. NT35 -> NT49 NT55. NT49 can produce NT85 and NT37. NT85 is NT74 and NT73. NT74 is NT39 and NT39. NT39 is NT51 and NT37. NT51 is NT64 and NT90. NT64 is NT24. NT24 is 't25' - wait, but I'm looking for 't's, but according to the rules, some non-terminals directly produce t's. For example:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT24 NT9, but looking through, one rule is NT64\u2192't24'? Wait, no: looking at NT64, the rule is NT64->NT24, but I think I might be mixing up. Wait, in the rules provided, I see NT68 \u2192 't14', NT22 \u2192 't22'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT24 NT9? No, looking line by line, I see:\n\nLine: NT64 \u2192 NT24 NT9? No, wait, the rules are listed as:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68  \nNT38 \u2192 NT26 NT20  \nNT62 \u2192 NT36  \nWait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73  \n- NT38 \u2192 NT26 NT20  \n- NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62  \n- NT38 \u2192 't26'  \n- NT99 \u2192 't22'  \n- NT35 -> NT49 NT55  \n- NT49 -> NT85 NT37  \n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for all production rules that produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the rules, here are some where a non-terminal directly becomes a t:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'  \n- NT22 \u2192 't22'  \n- NT44 \u2192 't4'  \n- NT99 \u2192 't10'  \n- NT35 \u2192 't35'? Wait, no, looking at the rules, I don't see a direct production from any NT to 't35'. The rule for NT35 is NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT55.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be split into parts where each part corresponds to the non-terminals in the grammar. Maybe a better approach is to attempt a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nSo we have NT73 and NT20 as two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let's expand NT73: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nNow, both NT62 and NT27 need to be expanded.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT12 NT47.\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT8 NT44.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't30'? Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT8 producing t's directly. Wait, looking back:\n\nNo, I see that NT85 \u2192 NT74 NT73, and NT74\u2192NT39 NT39, etc. Hmm, getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the entire string and see if it can be covered by the productions.\n\nBut this might take too long. Alternatively, I can note that the string starts with multiple t35 and t31, which might correspond to certain non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more efficiently checked by using the CYK algorithm for this specific grammar and string. The CYK algorithm can parse the string and determine if it's generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, CYK is applicable. However, I'm not sure I can perform the CYK algorithm step by step here, but I can try to make educated guesses.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT44 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-484","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem to solve where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string I need to check is: `t35 t4 t29 t4 t11 t17 t29 t18 t17 t29 t35 t31 t6 t24 t33 t17 t17 t20 t1 t18 t6 t6 t24 t27 t17 t36`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It seems that the grammar starts with S, and the productions go from S to NT followed by numbers, like S -> NT73 NT20, S -> NT95 NT83, and so on. Then there are a series of NT productions, each splitting into two NTs or nt followed by a number. Some of these nt productions are actually terminal symbols because they produce strings of 't's followed by numbers, like NT38 -> 't36'.\n\nWait, actually in the given grammar, some NTs have productions with numbers, like \"NT52 -> NT35 NT96\" and then further down, \"NT49 -> t17\". So, some NTs expand further until they reach a terminal symbol.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I'll need to see if there's a derivation path from S to this string using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me write down the string steps: t35 t4 t29 t4 t11 t17 t29 t18 t17 t29 t35 t31 t6 t24 t33 t17 t17 t20 t1 t18 t6 t6 t24 t27 t17 t36.\n\nThat's quite a long string, 28 't' entries. I need to see how these could have been derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level productions of S. S can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So the string starts with a combination of two NTs. Each of these NTs will expand into more symbols until they hit terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string starting with t35. Let's see where t35 comes from. In the grammar, some NTs have t35. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT55 -> t17\n- NT49 -> t3\n- NT39 -> t6\n- NT99 -> t10\n- NT35 -> t3\n- NT35 -> t13\n- NT95 -> t35\n- NT85 -> t28\n- NT25 -> t25 (wait, that's not relevant here)\n- NT73 -> 't36'\n- NT39 -> t5\n- NT63 -> t29\n- NT96 -> t20\n- NT27 -> t33\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT38 -> 't36'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT64 -> 't24'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT49 -> 't9'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT35 -> 't13'\n- NT95 -> 't35'\n- NT88 -> 't28'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT62 -> 't24'\n- NT53 -> 't11'\n- NT27 -> 't27'\n- NT49 -> 't2'\n- NT24 -> 't25'\n- NT47 -> 't27'\n- NT12 -> 't31'\n- NT84 -> 't1'\n- NT47 -> 't0'\n- NT99 -> 't17'\n\nLooking through these, I notice that T35 can come from NT95 -> t35. So that's a possibility. So the first NT could be NT95, leading to t35, and the second NT is NT83? Wait, S has to be NT95 NT83 or another option.\n\nWait S's first production is NT73 NT20, and the second is NT95 NT83. The string starts with t35, which is from NT95. So the S must have taken the NT95 NT83 production. So the first part of the string comes from NT95, which gives t35, and the second from NT83.\n\nLet's see NT95: Looking through the grammar, NT95 can be broken down. Let's check NT95's productions. From the given rules, I don't see NT95 producing anything directly. Wait, do I have any NT rules that produce NT95? Or does it derive from other NTs?\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules, I don't see NT95 producing anything except via other NTs. For example, NT95 is mentioned in a few productions, but I don't see a rule like NT95 -> something. Wait, looking back: in the given grammar, I see NT74 is split into NT39 NT39, NT96 is split into NT82 NT83, etc. Wait, maybe I missed NT95 in the rules. Wait, looking at the rules: I don't see any NT95 directly producing anything except as part of other productions.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So if S starts with NT95, but NT95 doesn't have a direct production, it must derive into other NTs. So maybe NT95 itself is built from other NTs, but based on the provided rules, none of the NTs have a production that directly yields t35, except for one of the rules: looking at the '->' rules, I see NT49 -> t9, NT95 -> 't35'\u2014no, wait, actually no, the '->' rules are of the form NT... -> NT... or NT... -> 't'...\n\nWait, in the given grammar, T35 appears on the right-hand side of some terminal productions. For instance, NT35 has productions like -> t3, t13, etc. Also NT95 has 't35' as a terminal, but looking at the rules, I don't see NT95 having a production. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the '->' rules, I see NT47 -> t27, but no NT95. So the only NT that directly produces a 't35' is none. Wait, no\u2014I think perhaps I made a mistake. Looking through the rules again:\n\nWait, looking at NT95: the rules are:\n\nLooking through the given rules, for example, NT99 has NT99 -> t10, t17, etc. I don't see NT95 having a direct production. Wait, but earlier, I thought there was a production for NT95. Let me check:\n\nLooking back at the initial grammar rules, let's see:\n\n- NT73 -> t36\n- NT44 -> t4\n- NT6 -> t88\n- NT38 -> 't36'\n\nWait, not seeing NT95 in the '->' list, except maybe I missed it. Wait, in the list, the last entry is NT85 -> 't11', so I don't see any NT95 -> something. Wait, so perhaps I made an error in my initial analysis. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, the given grammar: starting at the beginning, I have:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\n\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nNT71 -> NT68 NT2\n\nNT39 -> NT51 NT37\n\nThen NT83 -> NT22 NT45, etc. I don't see NT95 directly except as in S.\n\nSo perhaps NT95 is only present in the S production. So, in the grammar provided, the only NTs that can directly produce terminals are those in their own rules, such as NT49 -> t9, etc. \n\nSo, if S is NT95 NT83, then both NT95 and NT83 must have productions that generate the string.\n\nBut the problem is, in the given grammar rules, are NT95 or NT83 capable of generating anything? From the given, NT95 is not present in any production on the RHS; likewise, NT83: let's see if any rule has NT83 on the LHS.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see NT83 -> NT22 NT45, which is in the list, so NT83 exists but cannot produce a terminal. So, NT83 must further split into NT22 and NT45.\n\nSimilarly, NT95 is only present in S's production, but it cannot produce any terminals itself.

{"custom_id":"request-492","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. So, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either two terminals or a non-terminal producing two non-terminals. The string to check is long, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the grammar productions to see all possible ways non-terminals can expand. The start symbol is S, which has two productions: S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So, the initial expansions will come from these.\n\nLooking at the string: `t18 t31 t29 t4 t11 t6 t17 t20 t17 t18 t17 t29 t35 t6 t17 t36 t18 t31 t11 t27 t17 t6 t36 t17 t36 t33`\n\nI notice that the string starts with t18. Looking at the grammar, t18 is the result of NT95 -> t18. So, maybe the first part comes from S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, let's start with S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, NT95 can produce t18, so the first symbol t18 is taken care of. Next, I need to see what NT83 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT83 -> NT22 NT45. So, after t18, we'd get symbols from NT22 and NT45.\n\nNT22 -> NT44 NT63, so after t18, next will be t22's symbols. Wait, no, let me clarify. NT83 expands to NT22 NT45, so the symbols are whatever NT22 and NT45 produce.\n\nBut in the given string, after t18, the next symbols are t31, t29, etc. This might get complicated. Maybe it's better to construct a parse tree or see if each 't' in the string can be matched by some derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse engineer the possible derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to look for sequences of 't's that have corresponding NT productions.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t18 t31. t18 is from NT95, and t31 is from NT49. So, looking at the grammar, NT95 is only in the production from NT73, which is part of S. Wait, actually, NT95 is a non-terminal in the grammar, but in the initial productions of S, we have S -> NT95 NT83. So, NT95 comes directly under S.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the first symbol is t18, which is NT95 -> t18. So, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, after t18, the next symbols are t31 t29. Looking at the grammar, perhaps these are from another NT.\n\nt31 is from NT49, and t29 is from NT63. Or maybe not. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT49, it can produce t3, t4, t9, t16, t23, t9, t11, t26, t0, t1, t16, t4, t6, t9, t16, etc. Specifically, NT49 has a production NT49 -> t3, NT64 -> 't17', but wait, in the provided grammar, I see a few NT49 productions, including NT49 -> t23 and NT49 -> t9, and others like NT49 -> t3, and others that lead to terminals.\n\nWait, I think I need a better way to map each non-terminal to its possible terminals.\n\nLet me list the production rules where the left side is a non-terminal and the right side produces a terminal:\n\n- NT73 -> t36\n- NT52 -> t24\n- NT71 -> t2\n- NT39 -> t6\n- NT83 -> t28\n- NT88 -> t28\n- NT52 -> t80, etc. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, some entries are lines like \"NT73 -> NT62 NT27\", which are production rules for non-terminals. Then, later lines have entries like NT38 -> 't29', which means NT38 can produce t29.\n\nWait, so it's a list of pairs where the first part is a production rule, possibly consisting of two non-terminals, and the second part is the string it can generate (either two non-terminals or a terminal). But in the grammar provided, each line is a production rule, and if the rule has two non-terminals as its right side, it's written as LHS -> RHS, and the RHS can be further expanded.\n\nWait, actually, each line is a production rule, where each line is either a two-symbol non-terminal or a terminal. So, for example, the line NT73 -> NT62 NT27 means that NT73 can produce the two non-terminals NT62 and NT27. Similarly, NT38 -> 't36' means NT38 can produce the terminal 't36'.\n\nSo, the grammar is a list of production rules, each rule is in the form of NTx -> either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo, let's list all the production rules:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-513","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies things a bit, as we can apply algorithms like the CYK parser without too much trouble, but since I'm manually checking, I can look for structure.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t2 t17 t18 t31 t24 t29 t18 t17 t36 t35 t31 t17 t29 t18 t31 t31 t30 t4 t17 t31 t27.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S can produce NT73 and NT20. So the first step is to see if the string starts with one of these. Wait, no, because in the grammar, S is at the top level, and in the string, the first token is t35. But in the grammar, the non-terminals are split into NT and t, so maybe I need to figure out what the actual terminals are.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT44 -> 't31', so 't31' is a terminal. Similarly, NT52 -> 't12' and other 't's. The NT symbols are the non-terminals, and the 't's are terminals.\n\nSo the string is composed of terminals, so I need to see if the derivation can produce this sequence.\n\nNow, let me list all the productions that produce each terminal in the string to see what paths are possible.\n\nt35 appears multiple times. Looking for productions that result in 't35' as a terminal. Checking the grammar:\n\n- NT35 -> t3 (but wait, that's 't3', not 't35'). Hmm, looking through the grammar, I see NT35 -> t3 and NT35 -> t13. So 't35' isn't directly a production from NT35. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, are there any productions that generate 't35' as a terminal? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT39 -> t6, NT38 -> t36 and t29 (but that's from NT38), NT35 -> t3, t13. So no 't35' as a terminal directly. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar again:\n\nLooking at NT35: it has two productions: NT35 -> t3 and NT35 -> t13. So no 't35' direct production. Hmm, that's strange. Let me check if any other NTs produce 't35'. Maybe I'm missing one.\n\nWait, looking at NT35: no, according to the given grammar, NT35 only produces 't3' or 't13'. So perhaps there's a mistake in the initial assumption. Wait, maybe I missed a production. Let me go through the entire list again.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe I misread a production. Let me check each NT:\n\nLooking for t35. Wait, in the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT55 -> t17\n- NT64 -> t17\n- NT49 -> t3 (but also NT49 has other productions)\n- NT47 -> t27\n- NT51 -> t64 (but that's NT51, so in the string, we might see 't64' if it's a terminal. Wait, no, in the string, I see 't64' is 't64'? Let me check the string:\n\nLooking at the string: ... t29 t18 t31 t24 t29 t18 t17 t36 t35 t31 ... So the string has t35. Let's see if any NT produces t35.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look through all the NT productions:\n\n- NT37 -> t85 and t55. Oh wait, no, NT37's productions are NT37 -> t85 and t55. No, that's 't85' and 't55'.\n\nWait, looking for 't35', I don't see any NT directly producing it. That suggests that maybe I'm misreading the grammar, or perhaps the grammar is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps in the string, there's a 't35' which isn't directly a terminal, but maybe it's part of a non-terminal production. No, no, 't's are terminals, so each token in the string must directly correspond to a production of an NT to a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing with the NTs and 't's. Let me list all 't's in the string:\n\nLooking at the string: t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t2 t17 t18 t31 t24 t29 t18 t17 t36 t35 t31 t17 t29 t18 t31 t31 t30 t4 t17 t31 t27.\n\nSo 't35' appears multiple times, as do others. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should start by seeing if the string can be parsed by the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to start from the string and see if each terminal corresponds to a production.\n\nAlternatively, let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe string has 28 tokens. Let me list them in order:\n\nt35, t31, t29, t31, t11, t17, t2, t17, t18, t31, t24, t29, t18, t17, t36, t35, t31, t17, t29, t18, t31, t31, t30, t4, t17, t31, t27.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated step by step, starting from S.\n\nFirst, S can produce either NT73 or NT20.\n\nSo the first step is to choose one of these, but since the string starts with t35, maybe either path can lead there, but let's check if t35 is a terminal, but no, wait: in the grammar, the 't's are terminals, so each production either produces a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, for example, S->NT73 NT20, which would produce two non-terminals. Wait, no: S is the top-level, and NT73 is a non-terminal, so to produce a string, we need to expand each NT until we reach all terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string starts with t35, which must be directly produced by some NT. But in the grammar, I don't see any NT that produces t35. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NTs. Maybe I made a mistake in reading the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, the first production is S->NT73 NT20. So S can produce NT73 NT20. Now, each of these NTs have their own productions. Let's see how that could lead to the string.\n\nWait, but the first token is t35, which must be produced by some NT. So maybe the first step is to see if any NT can produce t35 as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some NT that can produce t35. Let me check all NTs again:\n\nLooking through all NTs, I see:\n\n- NT35 has productions to t3 and t13, not t35.\n- NT44 -> 't31'\n- NT68 -> 't14'\n- NT22 -> 't27'\n- NT49 -> 't3', 't9'\n- NT88 -> 't28', 't24'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT35 -> 't3', 't13'\n- NT52: several productions, including 't12', 't85', etc., but none leading to 't35' as a terminal.\n- NT73 has productions to 't36' and 't27' (from NT73 -> NT62 NT27 and others).\n- NT39 has 't5' and others.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I can't find any NT that produces 't35' as a terminal, which would mean that 't3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-508","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that since all the rules are two non-terminals on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right, except maybe some.\n\nLet me look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and it has two productions: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So, S is two NTs. Each NT can have production rules further down.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t17 t29 t35 t24 t2 t33 t0 t18 t6 t6 t24 t27 t17 t17 t36 t35 t31 t36 t27 t17 t36. That's a long string, 27 tokens. Each token starts with a 't', probably representing a terminal symbol.\n\nI think the standard approach is to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But given the grammar, maybe I can figure out the parse tree or at least see if the string can be broken down into the rules.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me try to map the terminals to the non-terminals in the grammar and see if they can fit. Each 't' is a terminal, and each number is a non-terminal (NT). So each token in the string is either a 't' followed by a number or just a 't' number.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides are combinations of NTs and terminals. For example, one rule is NT38 \u2192 't36'. So, 't36' is a terminal corresponding to the non-terminal NT38.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but wait no\u2014only terminals. Because in the string, each token is 't' followed by a number, which we can interpret as the terminal symbols. So each 'tX' is a terminal, like 't35' is a terminal symbol, not a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the right-hand sides of the production rules have both NTs and terminals. So, for example, NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63; and NT62 \u2192 NT53 't24'; so in the string, when 't24' appears, that corresponds to NT62 \u2192 NT53 't24', meaning that in the parse tree, NT53 must produce a node that can generate 't24' as one of its terminals.\n\nWait, but 't24' is a terminal, so that would mean that in the grammar, we have a rule that allows NT62 to produce NT53 and a terminal 't24'. So, in the parse tree, that would mean NT62 has as children NT53 and t24.\n\nSimilarly, looking back, the string starts with t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t17 t29 t35 t24 t2 t33 t0 t18 t6 t6 t24 t27 t17 t17 t36 t35 t31 t36 t27 t17 t36. That's 27 tokens. So, the string is a sequence of t followed by numbers.\n\nI think the first step is to map each tX token in the string to the corresponding non-terminal in the grammar. So, for each 'tX', find if there's a rule NTX \u2192 tY or something similar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36' (so when we have 't36' in the string, it's from NT38)\n- NT44 \u2192 't4' but in the string, I don't see 't4'? Wait, let me check. The string has various 't's with numbers: t35, t31, t29, etc.\nWait, so each 'tX' in the string corresponds to NTX \u2192 tX. So, for instance, any occurrence of 't36' in the string corresponds to NT36 in the grammar, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, the rules have both NTs and terminals. So, for example, NT2 \u2192 t22. So when the string has 't22', it's because of that rule.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to build a mapping from each terminal in the string to a non-terminal in the grammar. Alternatively, for each 'tN' in the string, check if there's a rule where some NT produces tN as a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some rules produce t as a terminal. For example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63 \u2192 but wait, more precisely, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT62 \u2192 't24'\n- NT53 \u2192 't11' (Wait, no: looking at the rules, NT53 is followed by t11.

The only direct terminals appear in specific productions like S \u2192 NT95 NT83 and others, but most productions go through non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate consists of 30 \"t\" followed by numbers, like `t18`, `t31`, etc. These look like terminal symbols. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the structure of the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which eventually must resolve to terminals. Therefore, the string's length and structure must align with the derivation steps.\n\nThe string has 30 symbols. In a typical leftmost derivation for a CNF grammar, the number of symbols doubles at each step until it matches the length of the string. However, since the grammar might be more complex, it's possible the string's length is achieved through a more intricate derivation.\n\nI'll attempt to parse the string from left to right, trying to match each symbol to a production. Starting with the first symbol, `t18`. Looking at the grammar, I see that S can produce NT95 and NT83. Also, NT95 can produce 't18' as per the rules. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, NT95 can directly produce `t18`, so that matches. The next symbol is `t31`. I need to find a production where the first non-terminal in a chain leads to `t31`. Looking at the productions, NT31 is in the rules as NT13 \u2192 t31, but that's not directly a non-terminal I see here. Wait, in the grammar, looking for NT that can produce `t31`:\n\nFrom the list, I see NT44 \u2192 t4, NT64 \u2192 t17, etc. Wait, looking for any NT that can directly produce t31. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the rule NT44 \u2192 t4 is present. Wait, I'm more interested in which NT can produce t31. Looking through the productions, I see that NT64 \u2192 't17', and NT99 \u2192 't16'. Also, looking at the rules, for example, NT27 \u2192 't33', NT52 \u2192 't24', etc. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look for rules where NT can produce t31.\n\nWait, in the list provided:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT99 \u2192 't10', NT44 \u2192 't4', NT6 \u2192 't88', etc. Wait, looking for where a non-terminal can directly produce `t31`. Looking at the end productions, I see NT73 \u2192 't36', NT38 \u2192 't36', etc.\n\nWait, actually, the productions that end with a single 't' are for terminals. So, for example:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't33'\nNT62 \u2192 't24'\nNT49 \u2192 't23'\nNT22 \u2192 't26'\nAnd so on.\n\nBut in the grammar, looking for an NT that can produce 't31'.

So, when NT37 is derived, it produces `t31`. So, the next symbol is `t31`, which must be the result of NT37.\n\nSo, after S \u2192 NT95 NT83, the next step is to look at NT83. NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45. So, we have to substitute NT83 with NT22 NT45, which are both non-terminals. So, NT83 will produce the symbols from the derivation of NT22 and NT45.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second symbol is `t31`, which comes from NT95, and the third is `t29` from NT38, etc. Maybe I should approach this more systematically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree step by step. The first symbol is `t18`, which comes from NT95. So, we have S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Now, NT95 produces `t18`, and NT83 must produce the rest of the string starting from the second symbol. The rest is `t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t17 t35 t17 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t36 t35 t31 t24 t33 t17 t6 t31 t0 t20`.\n\nWait, no. The initial S \u2192 NT95 NT83, and NT95 produces `t18`, so the second non-terminal of S is NT83. So, the string after `t18` is the derivation of NT83.\n\nSo, the string after `t18` is `t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t17 t35 t17 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t36 t35 t31 t24 t33 t17 t6 t31 t0 t20`. The length of this part is 29 symbols, making the total string 30. Now, the second part comes from NT83.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45. So, NT83 is replaced by NT22 NT45.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and one non-terminal or terminal symbol on the right. \n\nFirst, I should parse the string into individual tokens to see how they can be derived from the grammar. The string consists of a sequence of t-ids like t18, t31, etc. The grammar includes several productions where non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals. Some non-terminals directly produce t-ids, others require combining with others.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into tokens:\n\nt18, t31, t29, t31, t31, t6, t24, t2, t1, t35, t17, t29, t35, t6, t6, t24, t33, t17, t17, t29, t18, t31, t31, t30, t31, t17, t36, t33.\n\nNext, I'll look at the grammar to see which non-terminals and their corresponding productions can produce these t-ids. For example, NT99 can produce t10, t22, t44, etc., depending on the production it uses. \n\nI think the best approach is to try to build a parse tree. Starting from the start symbol S, which can produce either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Each of these NT symbols must then produce the necessary terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t18, t31, t29, t31, t31, t6... Let's see if S can generate t18. From S -> NT95 NT83, NT95 can produce t18, so maybe we take the path S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nNT95 can produce t18 directly, so that's good. Now, the next symbols should be derived from NT83. NT83 can produce t28, t83, or via other productions like production 8: NT83 -> NT22 NT45. Wait, looking back at the grammar, production 8 is NT83 -> NT22 NT45. Alternatively, production 19 is NT83 -> t28, and production 8 is another way.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT83 -> NT22 NT45 (production 8) and NT83 -> t28 (probably production 19? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, yes, production 19: NT83 -> t28. So, alternatively, NT83 can produce t28 directly, which is not matching the second token in the string, which is t31. So perhaps we need to take the path where NT83 produces via NT22 NT45.\n\nSo, if I take S -> NT95 NT83, then NT95 gives t18, and NT83 gives NT22 NT45. Then, we need to produce t31, t29, etc., from NT22 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT22: in the grammar, NT22 -> NT44 NT63 (production 12), and NT22 can also produce t20 (production 21: NT22 -> t20). So if we try NT22 -> NT44 NT63, that's two non-terminals, but the string has t31 next, which is a terminal. So perhaps taking NT22 -> t20 is better, but then we go back to needing more tokens. Wait, the first few tokens are t18, then t31, so maybe we should explore another path.\n\nWait, after S->NT95 NT83 (t18), then NT83 must produce the next symbols. The second token is t31, which is a terminal. So perhaps NT83 can produce t31 directly. Looking at the grammar, does NT83 have a production that leads to t31? Let me scan through the productions.\n\nLooking for any NT where a production results in t31.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT47 has production 47: NT47 -> NT8 NT44 (production 16), NT47 -> t27 (maybe production 18?), NT47 -> NT49 NT26 ( production 14), NT10: not relevant. Wait, wait, the grammar entries are as follows:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t31:\n\nLooking at NT88: production 7: NT88->t38 t24\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, looking for \"NTxxx -> t31\". I think I might have missed this. Let me scan:\n\nThe grammar includes multiple entries. For example:\n\n- NT44 -> t4 (at production 17)\n- NT68 -> t14 (production I think it's at 14 or 17, maybe not)\nWait, perhaps I should look for NTs that can produce t31.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nProduction 37: NT37 -> t3 (producing 't3'), production 33: NT33->t6, etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed one. Maybe some NT has production NTxxx -> t31.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT productions that result in 't31'. Perhaps none, so maybe we need to derive 't31' through intermediate NTs.\n\nWait, but according to the given grammar, is there any production that can produce 't31'? Let me check each production again.\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see any NT productions directly producing 't31' as a terminal. So each 't31' must come from a production that has 't31' as one of the results. Or, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the start symbol S generating NT95 NT83 as t18 t31... Hmm, but NT95 produces t18, and then NT83 needs to produce t31 next. But from the grammar, NT83 can produce t28 or other combinations. So maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first symbol t18 comes from a different production of S. The start symbol S can produce either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nIf I take S->NT73 NT20, then NT73 can produce t18? Let me check the productions for NT73.\n\nLooking at NT73, we have production 13: NT73 -> t36 (from line 17: NT73 -> 't36'), production 43: wait, in the grammar, production 17: NT73 -> 't36', and production 7? Wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, each entry is a rule, so:\n\nLooking for NT73: in the grammar, I see in production 17: NT73 -> 't36', but does it have other productions? Let's check:\n\nThe grammar's productions for NT73 are line 17: NT73 -> 't36' and line 24: NT73 -> 't36'? No, probably more.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. The lines are entries for each production. So, for example, looking for NT73 in the production list:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- Line 17: NT73 -> 't36' (twice, maybe a typo)\n- Line 24: NT73 -> 't36'\n\nWait, that can't be. Each production for a non-terminal should be unique. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here, but let's proceed.\n\nAssuming that NT73 can produce t36, then starting with S->NT73 NT20, that would produce t36 and then whatever NT20 produces. So if S->NT73 NT20, then NT73 -> t36, and NT20->... Looking at NT20, the first productions include NT20 -> NT27 NT68 and NT20 -> 't17' (from production 24 maybe?), and NT20->'t1' (not sure).

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar and see what each non-terminal can derive into. The start symbol is S, and according to the rules, S can produce either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. So the initial step is to expand S, which can be either of these combinations.\n\nLooking at the string: `t35 t4 t29 t31 t3 t5 t4 t29 t31 t11 t6 t24 t36 t35 t17 t2 t33 t14 t35 t31 t17 t20 t1 t35 t31 t36 t17 t24 t27`.\n\nI notice that the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, specifically 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if this entire sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar has a lot of non-terminals, I might need to simulate the derivation. However, this could get complicated because the string is 27 tokens long, and each production could split into multiple parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string using the grammar. Parsing involves starting from the start symbol and trying to match the string. If I can break down the string into the productions, then yes, it's generated.\n\nLooking at the first part, the first token is 't35'. Let me see which productions lead to 't35'. In the grammar, NT35 has several productions:\n\n- NT35 -> NT51 NT37\n- NT35 -> NT95 NT36\n- NT35 -> NT63 NT2\n- NT35 -> NT49 NT3\n\nWait, but some of these might not directly lead to 't35'. Let me check the productions where a non-terminal directly expands to 't35'. Looking at the given grammar, I don't see any NT directly expanding to 't35', except in some cases:\n\nNT35 -> NT95 NT36 (but NT95 and NT36 may expand further)\nNT35 -> NT49 NT3 (but NT49 may expand)\nNT35 -> NT12 NT85 (but leads to other non-terminals)\nNT35 -> NT64 NT90 (which also expand)\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check if any non-terminal produces a 't35' directly. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly goes to 't35'. So perhaps the 't35's in the string must be part of a larger derivation. Maybe from NT35, which then is part of a bigger non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, let me list out all the 't's and their values in the string:\n\nThe string is: t35, t4, t29, t31, t3, t5, t4, t29, t31, t11, t6, t24, t36, t35, t17, t2, t33, t14, t35, t31, t17, t20, t1, t35, t31, t36, t17, t24, t27.\n\nI need to see if each of these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals can produce each 't'.\n\nLooking at the bottom of the grammar, terminal symbols are:\n\nt35, t4, t29, t31, t3, t5, t4, t29, t31, t11, t6, t24, t36, t17, t2, t33, t14, t1, t35, t31, t17, t20, t1, t35, t31, t36, t17, t24, t27.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The terminal symbols are the ones that do not appear on the left-hand side of the productions. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through the grammar, each line starts with something like S -> NT..., or NT... -> NT..., and then on the right side, sometimes it's a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like 't35' 't4', etc.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is written as S -> NT73 NT20, etc. Each production's RHS is a sequence of NTs and possibly a terminal. For example, NT38 -> 't36' means that NT38 can produce the terminal 't36'. Similarly, NT51 -> 't17' means NT51 can produce 't17'.\n\nSo, to find where each 't' comes from, I need to look for which non-terminal can produce that 't' directly.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking for t35 in the RHS of any production:\n\nLooking through the RHS, I see NT35 -> NT62 NT24 (not a terminal), NT53 -> 't11', NT47 -> 't27', etc. Wait, actually, none of the productions seem to have 't35' directly as a terminal. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT35 appears in:\n  - NT35 -> NT51 NT37\n  - NT35 -> NT95 NT36\n  - NT35 -> NT63 NT2\n  - NT35 -> NT49 NT3\n\nSo, none of NT35's productions are terminals. So 't35' must be generated by a non-terminal that can derive to NT35 eventually.\n\nWait, looking at another part, I see:\n\nNT35's productions are all to other NTs. So perhaps there's an NT that can produce 't35'. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for 't35' in any production on the RHS, I see:\n\nNT62 -> 't24'\nNT63 -> 't29'\nNT6 -> 't4'\nNT22 -> 't44'\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nWait, but none produce 't35'.\n\nHmm, this could be a problem. Because 't35' is a terminal in the string, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any production that directly generates 't35'. So that might mean that 't35' cannot be generated, making the entire string invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Is there any production that has 't35' on the RHS? For example, looking at each line:\n\nLooking for any line where RHS ends with or contains 't35':\n\n- S -> NT73 NT20 (Nts only)\n- S -> NT95 NT83 (Nts only)\n- NT52 -> ... etc. All are Nts.\n- NT38 -> 't36' (a terminal, but not 35)\n- NT45 -> 't44' (44, not 35)\n- NT6 -> 't4' (4)\n- NT99 -> 't10' (10)\n- NT35 -> various Nts\n- Wait, looking through, I don't see any 't35' as a terminal. So perhaps the 't35's are not part of the grammar, meaning the string cannot be generated. But that might not be the case. Perhaps there's a way to generate 't35' via multiple steps, but looking at the RHS, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't35'. So in that case, the string might not be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine all the productions for any NT that can derive into 't35'.\n\nLooking through all productions where RHS is terminals:\n\n- NT38 -> 't36'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NS other Nts: like NT27, NT62, etc.\n\nI don't see any NT that produces 't35'. So the string has 't35' as a terminal, but the grammar doesn't have any rule that allows an NT to produce 't35', meaning that the string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me make sure. Is there a production where an NT can derive into 't35' via multiple steps? For example, maybe through a chain of productions. But given the structure of the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces 't35' as a terminal. So the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains several 't35' tokens, but looking at the grammar, there's no rule that directly or indirectly generates 't35' as a terminal.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t18 t31 t31 t31 t24 t2 t17 t35 t6 t17 t36 t35 t24 t2 t1 t35 t31 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36 t33 t17 t36 t17 t6 t36`. \n\nThis string is a sequence of t-terms, which are terminals in the grammar. To determine if it's in the language, I need to see if the grammar can derive this string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by examining the start symbol S. From the grammar, S can go to S->NT73 NT20 or S->NT95 NT83. Hmm, but looking at the productions, S is on the left side, but in the string, the terminals start with t18, t31, etc. So the string must be a derivation path from S.\n\nWait, but S produces two non-terminals. So the string must result from expanding S into two parts, each of which are derived from NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. \n\nLet me break down the string into pairs. Each non-terminal in the grammar seems to produce pairs of terminals. For example, S can expand into NT73 and NT20, which then must each produce some terminals. But the given string has 33 tokens. 33 is an odd number, which might be problematic because S is replacing with two non-terminals, and each of those might replace into, say, one or more terminals. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, no\u2014in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the number of terminals in the derived string must be one more than the number of non-terminals if you have multiple productions, but I might need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a single terminal or a pair. Let me think recursively.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with t18, which is a terminal. Looking into the grammar, which terminals are in NT? For example, t13, t18, t24, t3, t5, t6, etc. \n\nWait, the first symbol is t18. Looking at the grammar, is t18 a production of any NT?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT95 -> t18. So if an NT95 non-terminal can produce t18, but wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, non-terminals can only produce two non-terminals each. So t18 must be a direct production from NT95 as NT95 -> t18. \n\nBut then, going back to S, S -> NT95 NT83. So if S starts with NT95 and NT83, with NT95 producing t18, and NT83 producing something else, let's see.\n\nBut let me see what comes next. The string after t18 is t31, t31, t31, t24, etc. So the first production from NT95 is t18, and the next is... t31. Wait, but NT95 can't produce t31 directly because in the productions of NT95, I don't see t31. Wait, looking back: NT95's productions include -> t18, and perhaps other options.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, NT95 is on the right side of the production for S: S -> NT95 NT83. But in the given grammar, NT95 seems to have productions like -> t18, -> t35 NT31. So maybe NT95 can produce t18 or t35 followed by NT31.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t18, so that uses the production NT95 -> t18. Then the next symbol is t31, which would have to come from the other part of S's production, which is NT83. So the string now would look like t18 (from NT95) followed by whatever comes from NT83.\n\nBut the next symbol is t31, which suggests that NT83 must produce something that starts with t31. Let me look at NT83's productions. In the grammar, NT83 can produce NT22 NT45 or NT38 NT24. So NT83's options are producing two non-terminals each time.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t18 (from NT95), the next is t31, which is part of NT83. But t31 is also a terminal in the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's a production for NT44 -> t4, but that's not t31. Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see entries like NT6 -> NT88 NT73, and NT68 -> t14. So some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT38 has a production to t26 or t29, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking through all the productions, some non-terminals produce single terms. Wait, no, the grammar is in CNF, so all productions are either A->BC or A->a. So I need to find for each 't' in the string whether it's from a direct production.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see for example, NT64 -> 't24', NT68 -> 't14', NT4 -> 't16', and so on. So some non-terminals can produce single terminal symbols. \n\nBut I'm seeing a lot of t's being generated as terminals. For instance, NT64 -> 't14', which is a direct production.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the string derivation as a series of expansions, but it's quite complex. Perhaps there's a better way. Let me see if I can parse the string by trying to split it into the possible derivations from S.\n\nLet me consider that S can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. I'll need to see which of these could lead to the given string.\n\nFirst, let's check the start with NT73 NT20.\n\nIf S -> NT73 NT20, then NT73 must produce a certain sequence, and NT20 produces another.\n\nLooking at NT73's productions: NT73 -> NT62 NT27 or NT35 NT4. So NT73 can be expanded into two non-terminals each time.\n\nWait, but let's look at the string. The string starts with t18, which would come from NT95 in S -> NT95 NT83. So maybe S must expand as NT95 NT83.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let's see:\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nThen, NT95 can produce t18 or t35 followed by NT31. So the first symbol is t18, so NT95 must have used the production t18.\n\nNow, the next symbols after t18 would come from NT83, which can produce NT22 NT45 or NT38 NT24.\n\nBut the next token after t18 is t31. So let's see if t31 can come from any of NT83's expansions.\n\nWait, in the string, after t18 is t31. So that would mean that NT83 must, in its expansion, produce something that starts with t31, but NT83's productions are either two non-terminals or possibly... Wait, but NT83 only produces two non-terminals in this grammar. So how can it produce a single terminal like t31?\n\nWait, that's not possible because in CNF, N terminals can only expand into two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, NT83's productions: -> NT22 NT45 and -> NT38 NT24. So they don't produce terminals directly. So the only way to get a terminal is if some non-terminal expands into a terminal, but in this case, the production of NT83 doesn't have any terminals.\n\nWait, that's confusing because in the string, after t18 (OT18), the next is t31 (OT31), but OT31 can only come from a direct production, which isn't present in the grammar. Let me check: are there any NT in the grammar that produce t31 directly? Looking through the grammar, I don't see OT31. Then perhaps I made a wrong initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S expands as NT73 NT20, which would have different possible derivations. Let me explore that path.\n\nSo S -> NT73 NT20. Then, NT73 can be expanded into two options: NT62 NT27 or NT35 NT4.

{"custom_id":"request-571","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means that every production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol. Here, the start symbol seems to be S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t29 t18 t17 t2 t17 t18 t24 t2 t33 t0 t35 t31 t6 t31 t0 t2 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t6 t24 t27`\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that the terminals (the t... parts) correspond to these \"t\" tokens, like t35, t31, etc. Each terminal is the result of a production chain that replaces a non-terminal with that terminal.\n\nFirst, I recall that an efficient way to determine this is through a method called the CYK algorithm or by trying to parse the string using the grammar. However, since I don't remember the exact steps of CYK, maybe I can approach this by working backwards, checking if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nEach occurrence of a terminal in the string must correspond to some production. For example, t27 can be derived from NT27->t27, which is in the grammar. Similarly, t35 can be derived from NT35->t35, etc.\n\nI think the strategy is to check if each token in the string can be linked back through the grammar, possibly building some kind of tree. But since the grammar is fairly complex, maybe I can write down the possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal.\n\nLet me make a list of each terminal and see which non-terminals can produce them:\n\nt35: NT35 -> t35\nt31: NT31 -> t31\nt29: NT29-> t29\nt4: NT4-> t4\nt18: NT18-> t18\nt17: NT17-> t17\nt2: NT2-> t2\nt0: NT0-> t0\nt24: NT24->t24\nt6: NT6->t6\nt33: NT33->t33\nt11: Wait, I don't see a direct t11. But in the grammar, I see NT11->t12, but that's for NT11, which produces t12, but the string has t11. Is there a non-terminal that produces t11? Looking through, I don't see any NT with t11 as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because the string contains t11, but if no non-terminal directly produces it, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar rules. I see NT11->t12, so t11 isn't a terminal. So if the string has a t11, that's not possible because no non-terminal produces t11. Therefore, the string contains a token that's not present in the grammar, which would mean the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me confirm. In the grammar, all terminals are listed as t followed by some number, but in the rules, some non-terminals (like NT52) produce terminals like t36, t29, etc. But I don't see any rule that has t11 as a terminal. Instead, NT11->t12, so t11 isn't a terminal at all.\n\nTherefore, any occurrence of t11 in the string is impossible because there's no production rule that produces t11. So, looking at the string:\n\nThe string has: `t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t29 t18 t17 t2 t17 t18 t24 t2 t33 t0 t35 t31 t6 t31 t0 t2 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t6 t24 t27`\n\nI notice that after t33, it goes to t17, then t6, etc. But checking each token:\n\nLooking through the string, I notice a t11? No, actually, I'm looking at the string again and suddenly realize that I might have made a mistake in parsing. Let me re-read the string carefully: `t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t29 t18 t17 t2 t17 t18 t24 t2 t33 t0 t35 t31 t6 t31 t0 t2 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t6 t24 t27`\n\nWait, no, I don't see a t11. Maybe I was getting confused. So perhaps I need to check each token again.\n\nWait, looking at the string, perhaps the problem is that there's a t6, but the string has t6 somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I need to check if all the terminals can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Let's start from the first token and see if I can find a derivation.\n\nThe first token is t35. From the grammar, NT35->t35. So to produce t35, we need to have NT35.\n\nWhat's the origin of NT35? Looking at the grammar, I see NT35->t35. So NT35 is a terminal itself, meaning it cannot be derived further. So in the string, every occurrence of a terminal must be considered a leaf node in the parse tree.\n\nSo if the first token is NT35, then that's the start symbol.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S. So the entire string must be derived from S, which starts with S->NT73 NT20, or S->NT95 NT83.\n\nSo to produce the string, some combination of these derivations must result in the string. But each terminal in the string must be derived from a non-terminal, and so on until we reach the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the string as a concatenation of symbols, and each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal, which can be split into smaller parts until all are terminals.\n\nBut since the string is entirely made up of t's and numbers, each token is a single terminal, so each must correspond to a single non-terminal production.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because in the grammar, some non-terminals produce two terminals, like S->NT73 NT20. So each non-terminal in the string must be paired with another, forming pairs.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe length of the string is 40 tokens because I count each \"t...\" as a token. So 40 tokens.\n\nNow, each production in the grammar except the start symbol generates at most two terminals. So every pair of tokens in the string should correspond to a production of a non-terminal into two terminals.\n\nBut the start symbol S can only produce two non-terminals at each step. So the entire string must be constructed by a leftmost derivation or something similar, but it's a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in reverse. Using the string, try to split it into pairs and see if each pair can be matched by some non-terminal's production.\n\nBut let's start by considering the entire string and seeing if it can be reduced to S.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a sequence of terminals, each of which must be a result of a production. Since the string has 40 terminals, the derivation must go through several levels where each non-terminal expands into two terminals until eventually reaching S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nSo the string will be a sequence of expansions starting from S, either through NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, starting with NT73 -> ... and NT20->...\n\nLooking at NT73: its production is NT73-> NT62 NT27.\n\nSo after S->NT73 NT20, NT73 becomes NT62 NT27, and NT20 becomes NT27 NT68.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals (NT62 and NT27, NT27 and NT68) can be expanded further.\n\nBut this can get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can check the string for any occurrence of non-terminals that cannot be derived.\n\nWait, but in the string, all tokens are terminals, so any occurrence of a token that corresponds to a non-terminal would have to be the result of a production. So each token in the string is a terminal that must be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking again, the problem I initially thought was that the string has t11, which might be an issue.

{"custom_id":"request-567","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what I have to work with.\n\nFirst, the grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all the S's and NTs are defined with right-hand sides that are either two non-terminals or one terminal, which is consistent with CNF.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: `t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t6 t17 t29 t35 t24 t29 t35 t6 t17 t20 t1 t18 t6 t6 t31 t9 t20 t17 t36 t17 t6 t36 t27 t17 t36`.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My goal is to parse this string using the grammar and see if it can be entirely consumed by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nI think the best approach here is to use a top-down parsing method, starting from the start symbol S and trying to replace the non-terminals with terminals until the entire string is processed. Alternatively, I could use the CYK algorithm, but with a long string, that might get complicated. Since the string is provided, perhaps a memoization approach or even a recursive descent parser could work, but maybe that's overkill.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is small, I can try to see if each step of the string corresponds to the productions.\n\nLet me list out all the terminal symbols in the string for clarity:\n\nt35, t31, t29, t4, t31, t6, t17, t29, t35, t24, t29, t35, t6, t17, t20, t1, t18, t6, t6, t31, t9, t20, t17, t36, t17, t6, t36, t27, t17, t36.\n\nThat's 30 terminals. I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo S can be derived into either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first option: S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Then, the string starts with 't35' and ends with 't36'. So, this might get too complicated, but let's try to see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second option: S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So after S, we would have NT95, which then would have a production. Let's see what NT95 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT95 has a production: NT95 \u2192 t18. So if NT95 is replaced by t18, then S would become t18 followed by NT83, and the string would now start with t18. But our string starts with t35, so that can't be the case. Hence, the second option is not the right path because the first symbol would have to be t18, but the string starts with t35. So that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, the only possible first step is S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Let's explore that.\n\nSo NT73 \u2192 either ... Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t36 (from the rule NT73 -> 't36')\n- Or NT73 can be broken down further via other productions.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions for NT73. Looking back, the production rules for NT73 include:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 (also) \u2192 t36\n\nSo, NT73 can be a terminal 't36' or can split into NT62 and NT27.\n\nGiven that the first symbol in the string is 't35', which doesn't match t36, perhaps NT73 is split into NT62 NT27. But wait, 't35' is the first terminal, so unless the first production is NT73 \u2192 t35, which it isn't, or if it's part of a longer path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when we split S into NT73 NT20, the first step is S \u2192 NT73 NT20. The NT73 and NT20 are non-terminals which can be expanded into sequences of terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo, after S expands to NT73 NT20, we need to see how each part can contribute to the string.\n\nLet me model this step by step.\n\nString starts with 't35'.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part of the expansion is NT73 \u2192 t35, and the second part is NT20 \u2192 't3...'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT20 has the production NT20 \u2192 t17.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT20, one of the productions is NT20 \u2192 t17. So in the case of NT20, it's a terminal 't17'.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't35'. So if NT20 is 't17', that would need to match, but it's not matching. Hmm, so perhaps NT73 doesn't directly produce 't35'.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, let me list all the rules for NTs that are non-terminals:\n\nFrom the rules:\nNT73 has:\n- NT73 \u2192 t36\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nSo it can be either 't36' or split into two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, for NT20:\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- So it can only produce 't17' as a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see that NT20 has two productions? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, indeed, for NT20, the only production is NT20 \u2192 t17? Let me check again:\n\nWait no, looking through the rules I see:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nLine 28: S->NT73 NT20\n\nLine 29: S -> NT95 NT83\n\nThen looking for NT20: Scanning through, I see:\n\nLine [x] probably where NT20 is defined\u2014I must find all the lines.\n\nWait, I notice that in the given rules, most are for non-terminals, so perhaps NT20 is defined directly as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT20, the line is:\n\nNT20: 't17'\u2014Wait, no. Wait, let me go through each rule.\n\nLooking for NT20:\n\n- Line for NT20: \"NT20 -> t17\"\n\nSo NT20 can produce 't17'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSo if S expands to NT73 NT20, then to produce t35, which is the first symbol of the string, the NT73 should expand to t35, but looking at NT73's rules, it can produce 't36' or split into NT62 NT27. So since 't35' is the first symbol, NT73 can't produce 't35' directly. That suggests that maybe the initial expansion is different.\n\nWait, then perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 nt95 nt83. Wait, but I thought that nt95 would produce 't18' because one of its productions is NT95 \u2192 t18.\n\nYes: Looking back, for NT95, the rule is NT95 \u2192 t18. So S \u2192 nt95 nt83 would start with 't18', then nt83, but the string starts with t35, which doesn't match. Hence, the only way the string can start with t35 is if the first expansion is from nt73, and nt73 must produce t35. But looking at the rules for nt73, they don't have a production that results in t35.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a chain of expansions where nt73 is split into smaller non-terminals, and those can produce the required terminals.\n\nSo, for example, nt73 can expand to nt62 nt27. Then, nt62 can potentially produce 't35', but looking at nt62's rules:\n\nLooking here: \"NT62 \u2192 NT35 NT27\"\n\nSo nt62 can produce nt35 nt27 or other... Wait, but if nt62 is a non-terminal, it can only produce other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-587","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the initial string which might produce terminals. So, the grammar starts with S, and S is being transformed into a combination of NT terms. My goal is to see if the provided string can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the given string: `t35 t4 t29 t4 t11 t17 t36 t35 t24 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t29 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36 t33`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the numbers might correspond to other non-terminals. I need to map each 't' and the numbers to see how they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, most of the non-terminals (like NT52, NT71, etc.) can produce pairs of other non-terminals and\/or terminal symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So, the initial expansion of S would produce two NTs, each of which then needs to expand further until we get to a point where they produce terminals.\n\nThe string has a lot of 't's, so I think we'll need to look for the productions that directly map to the 't's. For instance, in the grammar, NT55 \u2192 't17', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT37 \u2192 't31', and so on. So, the approach should be to decompose the string into components that match the grammar's productions.\n\nI think a good strategy is to parse the string step by step, starting from the first 't' and seeing which non-terminals can produce that sequence. Then move to the next part and see if the grammar allows such a derivation.\n\nLet's start. The first part is 't35 t4 ...'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT35 has rules like NT35 \u2192 T3 (which is 't3'), NT49 \u2192 't3', etc. I need to find which non-terminals can derive to start with 't35'.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT59 is not listed, but wait, maybe I should look again. Wait, the initial string has t35, so what does NT35 produce? Let me check the grammar. Oh, wait, in the user's message, the grammar has lines like \"NT35 -> T3\", which is 't3'. But the string has 't35', so that doesn't directly match. Maybe I need to see if any non-terminal can produce t35.\n\nLooking deeper: In the grammar, NT35 has a production to T3, which is 't3', but there's also NT36 which might produce t something. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see lines like NT36 \u2192 T35 (which is 't35') and NT36 \u2192 T28 (which is 't28'). So, NT36 can produce t35 or t28.\n\nSince the string starts with t35, we can assume that the initial part of the string comes from a NT36 -> t35 production.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, so the first symbols would be from NT73. Maybe NT73 can produce NT36 NT31, because in the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT36 NT31. But wait, in the string, we have t35 first. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the initial non-terminals expand differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the leftmost symbol is produced by a different rule. Let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is better analyzed by breaking it down into chunks that correspond to pairs of NTs. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of two non-terminals. So each 'step' in the parse would involve two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a series of 't's which correspond to the terminal symbols produced by NT productions. So, each pair of NTs would produce a string of 't's and possibly other NTs that need expansion.\n\nLet me try to map the string by grouping in a way that makes sense with the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt35 t4 t29 t4 t11 t17 t36 t35 t24 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t29 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36 t33.\n\nThat's 33 elements. Since the grammar produces two non-terminals per step, the number of NTs in a fully expanded string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. But without knowing the exact derivation, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for matches in the grammar's terminal symbols. So, looking at the grammar, NT35 produces 't3', which is not present in the string as t35. So that can't be it.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT35 \u2192 T3, which is 't3'. Similarly, NT36 \u2192 T35 (t35). So, 't35' is produced by NT36. So, in the string, the first 't35' must come from NT36.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is 't35', which comes from NT36. So, that would mean that in the initial expansion, one of the NTs is NT36.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does any production of S produce NT36? Let me check the S rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\n\nSo, S expands to two non-terminals, which could be NT73 and NT20. So, the first part of the string might come from either nt73 or nt20.\n\nSince the first part is t35, which is nt36, but nt73 or nt20 don't directly produce nt36. So perhaps the nt73 or nt20 expand further.\n\nWait, another approach: since the string starts with t35, which comes from nt36, perhaps the initial S \u2192 NT73 NT20 needs to be part of a longer expansion.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider that the entire string is generated by expanding S all the way down, and each NT in the string must be expanded into terminal symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree. Let's attempt to break down the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nStart with the entire string:\n\nt35 t4 t29 t4 t11 t17 t36 t35 t24 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t29 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36 t33\n\nLet's group them into pairs as per the two-step production.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string can be split into parts that match NT productions.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, so each production produces two non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nGiven that, each step in the parse will replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until leaves are terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is to go from the entire string, finding a pair that matches a production, splitting into two parts, and then recursively checking each part.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, this could take many steps. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a table-driven approach or a recursive descent parser. But given the time constraints, perhaps a better way is to look for the presence of certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can list all the possible NTs that can produce t35, then for each, see if they can be part of the string.\n\nFrom the grammar, the NTs that can produce 't35' are those with a rule ending in T35. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 T35\n\n- NT40? Wait, I think I see NT36 \u2192 T35 (t35)\n\n- Also, NT30 \u2192 T30 (t30), etc.\n\nWait, let me check. The user provided a long list, so let me scan for NTs that have rules ending in t35.\n\nI see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 T35\n\nNT56? Wait, in the table, it's a bit lengthy. Let me look carefully. For example, the line \"NT44 -> 't31'\", etc.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar lines:\n\nLooking for which NTs have T35"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That should make parsing easier, but I need to be careful because even though it's in CNUF, a string in the language must be derived through a series of these productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t20 t17 t35 t6 t17 t2 t33 t0 t18 t31 t11 t30 t31 t17 t17 t2 t1 t18 t31 t31 t12 t10 t11 t36 t20.\n\nLet me note that the entire string must derive from the start symbol S.

Let's consider NT73 and NT20.\n\nLooking at NT73: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. So, expanding NT73, we need to produce t35 and t6 something because the string starts with t35.\n\nWait, NT73 produces NT62 and NT27.\n\nLooking at NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT6, which then might produce more non-terminals. But the string starts with t35, which is a terminal. So maybe it's more efficient to try the other production of S: S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nWait, if we take S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then NT95 and NT83 need to produce the string.\n\nLooking at NT95: NT95 can be 't18' or look at the rules. Wait, NT95's rules: let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, NT95 \u2192 t18? Wait, no. Looking through the rules, I see NT95 appears in some rules, like S \u2192 NT95 NT83, and also rules like NT49 \u2192 t9, etc. Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, looking for NT95's direct productions: None. All the NT95 appear in other rules as part of the left-hand side (LHS) of the productions. So NT95 can only be derived by expanding into other non-terminals.\n\nSo, if the first part of the string is t35, maybe that comes from NT35 or NT39?

So, maybe NT35 \u2192 t35.\n\nWait, but looking at the production list, NT35's rules are: NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT37, NT35 \u2192 t3, and also NT35 \u2192 t13.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, let's list all the terminals:\n\nLooking at each NT rule to see which produce a t symbol:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT20 \u2192 't17'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3' or 't13'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't5', etc.\n- NT96 \u2192 't20'\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\n- NT49 \u2192 't9', 't26'\n- NT83 \u2192 't28'\n- NT74 \u2192 't18'\n- Other rules don't have terminals directly.\n\nSo, terminals are t36, t4, t0, t17, t12, t3, t5, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the string: starts with t35, t31, t29, t4, t31, t24, t20...\n\nWait, but t35 isn't a terminal\u2014it's a non-terminal. So, how can we get a t35 in the string? It must come from an NT that expands into t35.\n\nBut looking at the provided NT rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't35'. So that's a problem. Because the only NT that can produce 't35' is NT35, but NT35 doesn't expand into 't35' directly\u2014it only does so if it's part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar to see if any NTs can derive t35.\n\nLooking through the list of terminal rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t36\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT68 \u2192 t0\n- NT20 \u2192 t17\n- NT11 \u2192 t12\n- NT35 \u2192 t3 or t13\n- NT49 \u2192 t3, t5, etc.\n- NT96 \u2192 t20\n- NT26 \u2192 t20\n- NT49 \u2192 t9, t26\n- NT83 \u2192 t28\n- NT74 \u2192 t18\n- NT55 \u2192 t17\n- NT27 \u2192 t27\n- NT53 \u2192 t11\n- NT99 \u2192 multiple t's\n- NT2 \u2192 t22\n- And others.\n\nSo, no NT directly produces 't35'.

{"custom_id":"request-607","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like 't35 t4 t29...', and the grammar has various production rules. My goal is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly. Oh, wait, no\u2014actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So any production that has more than two non-terminals on the right is not in CNF. Looking at the given grammar, each rule seems to have two non-terminals on the right, except for some that produce terminals. Wait, in the grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which are both non-terminals. NT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96, again two non-terminals. Then, for example, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, etc. Also, there are some rules where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal, like NT38 \u2192 't36'. So some rules have a terminal on one side. That seems okay because in CNF, a non-terminal can produce a terminal. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, such as 't35 t4 t29 t4...', and I'm to check if this string is in the language generated by the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal symbol, so each 'tX' is a single character in the string. So the string is a series of these terminals.\n\nThe approach I think I should take is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules, trying to match each terminal with the appropriate productions.\n\nBut first, perhaps I can look for any patterns or repeated non-terminals that might help. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a list of terminals and try to match them in order using the production rules.\n\nWait, the string is: `t35 t4 t29 t4 t11 t17 t29 t35 t17 t36 t35 t31 t17 t29 t18 t24 t36 t18 t31 t17 t36 t35 t31 t36 t33 t17 t36 t17 t6 t11 t9 t20`.\n\nBreaking this down, it's a list of 37 elements, each being a string like 't17', 't29', etc. Each of these is a single terminal in the grammar.\n\nI think a way to approach this is to start from the start symbol S and try to match the first part of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar's production rules, S can be rewritten as NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So from S, the next two symbols in the string should come from NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens of the string: t35 and t4. Wait, but in the grammar, the non-terminals NT73 and NT95 produce t35 or t other values? Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT73 can produce NT62 NT27 or NT38 NT62 or NT12 NT47, etc., or it can produce t35 or t36. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I see several NT73\u2192... where the RHS includes terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\nNT73 \u2192 NT38 NT62\nNT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\nNT73 \u2192 t36\nAlso, NT73 \u2192 t35 (I think earlier in the list?)\n\nWait, let me go line by line through the rules to find NT73's productions. \n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\n... etc., so NT73 can be used to derive the first part of the string.\n\nLooking for NT73's productions:\n\nLooking for NT73 \u2192 ... where the RHS has a terminal.\n\nScanning the rules:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT73 \u2192 NT38 NT62\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- Then, later:\n- NT73 \u2192 t36\n- Another line:\n- NT73 \u2192 t35\n\nWait, no, the user provided the rules in a long list.

{"custom_id":"request-604","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a string generated by a grammar means that starting from the start symbol (which is S here), using the production rules, we can derive the entire string through a series of steps. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol S can produce two options: S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83. Both of these are non-terminals, so the string probably starts with one of these, but we'll break it down further.\n\nThe string given is: t18 t4 t29 t31 t31 t24 t2 t27 t14 t35 t24 t29 t18 t31 t6 t36 t17 t17 t2 t33 t14 t18 t17 t36 t18 t31 t6 t24 t33 t17 t31 t27\n\nWait, each t followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So the entire string is a sequence of terminals, but our grammar might have non-terminals that need to be expanded to these.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules to match each symbol. Since the grammar is CNG, each step either takes a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal. But in our case, we need to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nLet me note that the string has 35 symbols, but since each production can generate two symbols (or more, but in CNG, each production is two), the number of steps might be manageable.\n\nWait, actually, it's tricky because the grammar can have multiple paths, and we have to find at least one path that generates the string.\n\nMaybe I should start by looking for any direct matches to the string symbols as possible right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT73 can produce t36 or other non-terminals.\n- NT95 can produce t18 or other non-terminals.\n- Other non-terminals have productions that include terminals like t4, t31, etc.\n\nWait, let's list all the productions and see if any of them directly match the terminals in the string.\n\nFor example, NT73 -> t36, so if we have t36 in the string, that could be a step. Similarly, NT95 -> t18, so t18 is a terminal from NT95.\n\nBut our string starts with t18, which could come from NT95 or maybe a production that's part of a larger chain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at S's productions: S can be NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Since each symbol of S is connected, perhaps we can think of S as expanding to each pair, and then each pair further expands.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to model this as a parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNG, each production is non-terminals splitting into two, so the parse tree is binary.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe we can use a recursive descent parser or similar technique, but that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is given, we can try to walk through the string and see if each terminal can be produced by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me map the string into a list: [t18, t4, t29, t31, t31, t24, t2, t27, t14, t35, t24, t29, t18, t31, t6, t36, t17, t17, t2, t33, t14, t18, t17, t36, t18, t31, t6, t24, t33, t17, t31, t27]\n\nThat's quite a long string. Let me start from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is t18. Looking at the productions, who can produce t18? Looking through the productions, I see NT95 -> t18, so NT95 can produce t18. So let's consider S -> NT95 NT83. That means S would expand to NT95 followed by NT83.\n\nSo the string would start with NT95 and NT83. Then, each of those would need to expand into sequences that produce the remaining string.\n\nWait, but NT95 is the start of that production. So after expanding S -> NT95 NT83, the next step is to expand NT95 and NT83.\n\nBut the first t18 comes from NT95, so the string starts with NT95 producing t18, and then NT83 must produce the rest of the string starting after t18.\n\nSo let's see: after t18, the string is t4, t29, t31, t31, t24, t2, t27, t14, t35, t24, t29, t18, t31, t6, t36, t17, t17, t2, t33, t14, t18, t17, t36, t18, t31, t6, t24, t33, t17, t31, t27.\n\nNow, we need to see if NT83 can produce this remaining string.\n\nLooking at NT83's productions: from the given grammar, NT83 -> NT22 NT45, and NT45 -> NT44 NT52, etc. But I think I need to check each step.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see all the possible paths. But this could get lengthy.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for known paths:\n\nFrom the start, S can go to NT95 NT83. NT95 can produce t18 directly, so that's the first symbol.\n\nNow, after t18, the next symbols are t4, t29, etc. So we need to check if NT83 can generate the rest of the string, which starts with t4.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, let's see what NT83 can produce.\n\nNT83's productions:\n- NT22 NT45\n- NT44 NT52\n\nWait, looking through the given productions, I see NT83 -> NT22 NT45, which is two non-terminals. So t4 in the string is the second symbol. If NT83 produces two symbols, then maybe t4 comes from NT22 or NT45.\n\nWait, but after NT83's expansion, the next symbols might come from both NT22 and NT45.\n\nWait, no, each production in the grammar is replacing a non-terminal with two symbols. So when expanding NT83, we get something like A B, where A and B are replaced as per their rules. So each of them can produce more symbols.\n\nBut to map it to the string, let's think step by step.\n\nThe string after the first t18 is: t4, t29, t31, t31, ...\n\nLet me see what NT83 can expand into. Perhaps I should look at all non-terminals that can produce t4.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT22 -> t22 or NT44 etc. Wait, let's check each non-terminal for terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> NT44 NT63\n- NT49 -> t11, t12, etc.\n\nWait, NT22's productions are not terminal, but NT44 has a production to 't34'. Wait, no, looking again, NT68 -> 't14', NT11 -> 't12', etc.\n\nWait, let me find which non-terminals have terminal production.\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT38 -> various, including t29, etc.\n- NT44 -> 't4' (from NT44 -> t4)\n- NT68 -> t14\n- NT26 -> t20\n- NT12 -> t11\n- NT37 -> t31\n- NT73 -> t36\n- NT95 -> t18\n- NT73 also has other productions to non-terminals.\n- And others have terminals as well.\n\nSo many non-terminals have terminals as part of their production.\n\nSo perhaps we can look for a path where each step replaces a non-terminal with terminals or non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, let me try to outline possible replacements.\n\nSince the first symbol is t18 (from NT95), then after that, we have t4 as the second symbol.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nThe given string is: `t18 t31 t31 t31 t17 t29 t18 t31 t24 t2 t33 t0 t18 t6 t17 t29 t35 t6 t17 t20 t17 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t17 t36 t17 t11 t27`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, it seems that each non-terminal eventually produces a terminal symbol. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, and NT73 \u2192 t36. So each NT rule either leads directly to a terminal or to another NT that does so.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated, I can try to parse it step by step, starting from the top of the grammar and working my way down. Alternatively, since the grammar only has right-associative productions, maybe I can reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nLet me list all the NT rules and their terminal productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t36\n- NT95 \u2192 t28\n- NT39 \u2192 t6\n- NT52 \u2192 t80, 71, 85, 12, 62, 47\n- NT71 \u2192 t68, 62\n- NT22 \u2192 t44, 63\n- NT99 \u2192 t38, 22, 4, 63, etc.\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe I can map each NT to the terminal it produces.\n\nWait, no, each NT can have multiple productions, each leading to different terminals. It's a non-deterministic grammar, so the string can be generated in multiple ways. But since the string is quite long, this could be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse the process: starting from the string, see if I can reduce it using the grammar rules, working backwards to see if I can reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe string is: `t18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t17 t29 t18 t31 t24 t2 t33 t0 t18 t6 t17 t29 t35 t6 t17 t20 t17 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t17 t36 t17 t11 t27`.\n\nI know that each production rule for NT... (like NT73) can only go directly to a terminal. So each non-terminal symbol corresponds to a single terminal. So, if I can group the string's tokens into sequences that match the rules, that would work.\n\nLet me start from the beginning and see if the first few terminals correspond to any production.\n\nLooking at the first t18: Which NT rule produces t18? Looking through the list:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 t35, t22, t4, t64, t37, t63, etc. Hmm, not seeing t18.\n\nWait, in the list of NT rules, some have t18. Let me check. Oh, here: NT88 \u2192 t9, t53, t27. Wait, no, looking through the list:\n\nWait, I think I might have missed that. Let me go through each NT:\n\n- Looking through all the NT rules, do any of them produce t18? Hmm, no, seems not.\n\nWait, wait, I think I remember the rules: NT73 \u2192 t36, but that's not t18.\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see t18 being produced by any NT rule. So if the first token is t18, then there's no NT production that leads directly to t18. That would mean the string cannot be generated, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any NT rule that directly produces t18?\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t36\n- NT95 \u2192 t28\n- NT39 \u2192 t6\n- NT52 \u2192 t80, 71, 85, 12, 62, 47\n- NT71 \u2192 t68, 62\n- NT22 \u2192 t44, 63\n- NT99 \u2192 t38, 22, 4, 63, etc.\nLooking further, I don't see t18. Hmm. So if the first token is t18, which doesn't correspond to any NT rule, then the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in listing the NT rules. Let me re-examine:\n\nWait, looking at the list, the NT73 \u2192 t36, but then NT99 \u2192 t38, t64, etc. Wait, is there an NT55 \u2192 t17, NT45 \u2192 t2 or t4, but that's not t18.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing any. For example, NT22 \u2192 t44, t63; no t18. NT26 \u2192 t20, etc. Hmm. I don't see t18 being a terminal in any production.\n\nTherefore, if the string starts with t18, it's impossible, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-628","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string to check is: `t35 t31 t29 t4 t11 t24 t20 t1 t18 t24 t36 t18 t31 t17 t36 t35 t31 t11 t27 t17 t24 t2 t33 t0 t35 t6 t6 t11 t30 t31 t17 t24 t27`\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of tokens (which are the terminal symbols) in the string. Each token is separated by a space, so that's easy to count. Let me count them:\n\nt35, t31, t29, t4, t11, t24, t20, t1, t18, t24, t36, t18, t31, t17, t36, t35, t31, t11, t27, t17, t24, t2, t33, t0, t35, t6, t6, t11, t30, t31, t17, t24, t27. That's 35 tokens, so the string has a length of 35.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each application of a production rule in the leftmost derivation will increase the number of symbols by one (if it's a non-terminal production) because each non-terminal on the RHS adds one (if it's a terminal, it stays the same). So the key is that the number of symbols in the string should be (n+1), where n is the number of steps in the derivation, because we start with one symbol (the start symbol S) and each step adds one until we get the string.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each production can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S:\n\n- The start S can be expanded into two non-terminals, say NTx and NTy. Then each of those can further expand. The total number of steps would depend on how many non-terminals get broken down.\n\nAlternatively, the number of symbols in the string should correspond to the number of production steps. Since each step replaces a non-terminal with two or one terminal. Wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either produces two non-terminals or one terminal. So each production application increases the count by one if it's two non-terminals, because replacing one non-terminal with two adds one symbol.\n\nBut the initial string is a sequence of terminals, so it's built up by replacing non-terminals step by step. The length of the string is 35, which is an odd number. Let me think about how the number of symbols grows during derivation.\n\nStarting with S (1 symbol). Each production of a non-terminal either produces two symbols or one terminal. So each step can increase the number of symbols by one. Therefore, if we start with 1, after 1 step, 2 symbols, after 2 steps, 3 symbols, etc. So after n steps, the number of symbols is n+1. So for the string to have 35 symbols, the number of steps must be 34, making the total number of symbols 35.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the string has 35 symbols, meaning that the derivation must have taken 34 steps. Is that possible? It is, but I need to check if the structure of the string allows it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the structure of the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar using specific productions.\n\nLet's see the string structure:\n\nThe given string is t35 t31 t29 t4 t11 t24 t20 t1 t18 t24 t36 t18 t31 t17 t36 t35 t31 t11 t27 t17 t24 t2 t33 t0 t35 t6 t6 t11 t30 t31 t17 t24 t27.\n\nLooking for 't' symbols, which are terminals. Let's list the sequence step by step:\n\n1: t35\n2: t31\n3: t29\n4: t4\n5: t11\n6: t24\n7: t20\n8: t1\n9: t18\n10: t24\n11: t36\n12: t18\n13: t31\n14: t17\n15: t36\n16: t35\n17: t31\n18: t11\n19: t27\n20: t17\n21: t24\n22: t2\n23: t33\n24: t0\n25: t35\n26: t6\n27: t6\n28: t11\n29: t30\n30: t31\n31: t17\n32: t24\n33: t27\n\nLooking at the sequence, I can try to reconstruct the leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S.\n\nThe first symbol is t35, which suggests the first production must be one that ends in t35. Looking at the grammar, let's see where t35 appears.\n\nLooking back to the production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n- S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nThen NT... productions. I need to see when 't35' appears. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t3\nWait, no, looking further:\n\nLooking at the productions where a terminal is:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT35 \u2192 t13\n- NT49 \u2192 t3\n- NT49 \u2192 t23\n- NT37 \u2192 t3\n- NT37 \u2192 t6\n- NT51 \u2192 t34? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar rules, the terminals are 't' followed by a number, like t3, t4, etc. For example, looking at NT52 productions:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nWait, but some of the terminals are listed as NT52 -> t35? No, looking again:\n\nIn the productions, for example:\n\nNT49 -> t3\nNT49 -> t23\nNT35 -> t3\nNT35 -> t13\nNT37 -> t6\nAnd others like NT44 -> t4, NT68 -> t14, etc.\n\nSo looking through all the productions, the terminals are t3, t4, t5, t6, t11, t13, t14, t17, t18, t20, t24, t27, t29, t31, etc.\n\nSo t35 appears in the terminals in NT49 \u2192 t3?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking for 't35' in the RHS:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I don't see any production where the RHS is t35. Instead, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t88\n- NT99 \u2192 t10\n- NT11 \u2192 t12\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT51 \u2192 t64\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- etc.\n\nWait, so where does t35 appear in the RHS? Let me scan all the productions:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is a terminal and the token is t35.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 t10\n- NT62 \u2192 t24\n- NT53 \u2192 t11\n- NT50 \u2192 t12 (wait, NT50 is not listed; maybe I'm looking at the wrong ones)\n\nWait, in the given grammar rules, I don't see any production where a terminal is t35. Oh, that could be a problem because the first token in the string is t35. So if the first symbol is t35, then there must be a production that directly produces t35, since in the first step, S would produce something, but t35 is a terminal and cannot be broken down further.\n\nWait, in the grammar given, is there a production that directly produces t35?\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT35 \u2192 t3 and NT35 \u2192 t13. So t35 is not directly produced. Instead, NT35 can produce t3 or t13, but the terminal t35 itself is not directly an option.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly one non-terminal or terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The top-level non-terminals are S, which branches into NT73 and NT20 (from S -> NT73 NT20). Each NT... is a non-terminal that ultimately expands into terminals like 't' followed by numbers. \n\nThe string starts with `t18`, which I need to see how that could be generated. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT95 can produce `t18` because NT95 -> `t18`. So that's one possibility: S -> NT95 NT20. \n\nNext, I need to see if NT20 can generate the next part of the string, which is `t31`. Looking at NT20's productions: one of them is NT20 -> `t17`, so that might not fit. Wait, but let me check. Wait, no, the string after t18 is t31. Oh, wait, looking at the string, after t18 comes t31. So perhaps I need to backtrack. Alternatively, maybe I need to see which NT can produce t31.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see NT68 -> `t14`, NT64 -> `t17`, NT44 -> `t4`, NT68 -> `t14`, and so on. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check NT20's production. Oh, I see NT20 -> `t24` and other rules, but not directly to t31. Wait, perhaps I should check where t31 comes from.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I find NT31: Wait, no, the rules don't have NT31 as a terminal, but NT24 is `t25`, and NT44 is `t4`, etc. Alternatively, perhaps t31 comes from an NT that I'm not seeing directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string is a sequence of t's with numbers, each corresponding to a terminal produced by a non-terminal. So, the string is a concatenation of these terminals, meaning that each terminal is generated by some production.\n\nStarting from S, which can split into NT95 and NT20 (since S has two options: NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83). Let's try the NT95 path because S's first production is NT95 -> t18.\n\nSo, the string starts with t18, which is generated by NT95. Now, after that, we need to generate t31 t29 t4 ... etc.\n\nNext, after NT95, which produces t18, what comes next? The next part is t31, which must be produced by NT20 because S splits into NT95 and NT20. So, NT20 must produce t31. Wait, looking at NT20's rules: NT20 -> `t17` or `t1`. But in the string, after t18 comes t31, meaning NT20 must produce t31. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT20 production that leads to t31. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the NT20 rules. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> `t17`\n- NT20 -> `t68`\n- Wait, no, looking again: the NT20 rules are:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar rules, I see under NT20:\n\n- NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n- NT20 -> `t17`\n- NT53 -> NT96 NT27 (Wait, no, that's under NT53)\nWait, let me check again properly.\n\nLooking for NT20.\n\nHere are the rules for NT20:\n\nLooking through the list, I spot:\n- NT20 -> `t17`\n- NT20 -> `t68`\nBut wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nThe rules are listed as:\n\nNT53 -> NT96 NT27\nWait, no, my eyes might have skipped some. Let me find NT20.\n\nLooking through the list, I find several entries, including:\n\n- NT20 -> `t17`\n- NT20 -> `t68`\nWait, no, actually, in the detailed grammar provided, under NT20, it's:\n\nNT20: `t17`, `t68`?\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar, it's:\n\nFrom looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> `t17`\n- NT20 -> `t68`\n- NT20: `t68`?\n\nWait, no, let me recheck:\n\nLooking for NT20: \n\nIn the grammar, under NT20, there are two rules:\n\n1. NT20 -> `t17`\n2. NT20 -> `t68`\n\nSo, NT20 can produce either `t17` or `t68`. But in the string, after t18 comes t31. That's a problem because NT20 can't produce t31 directly. So perhaps the initial assumption that we took the NT95 branch is incorrect, and instead, we should try the other S production, which is NT73 NT20.\n\nSo let's try that path. So S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nNT73's production: looking in the grammar, NT73 -> `t36`.\n\nSo the string starts with t18. Wait, no. Wait, the first part is t18, but if we take S \u2192 NT73 NT20, then NT73 -> `t36`. That would mean the first token is t36, but the string starts with t18. Therefore, this path is incorrect. So the initial production from S must be NT95.\n\nWait, so S must produce NT95 and NT20, leading to t18, but then NT20 can't produce t31, as it only produces t17 or t68. So perhaps this is a dead end, and the string cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed some rules where NT20 can produce t31. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT20, I only see:\n\n- NT20 -> `t17`\n- NT20 -> `t68`\n\nNo other rules for NT20. So NT20 cannot produce t31. Therefore, the initial assumption is invalid, and the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's a way for NT20 to expand into a non-terminal sequence that can eventually produce t31. So, let's try to see if there's a path from NT20 to t31 through other NTs.\n\nStarting from NT20, according to the grammar, NT20 can go to:\n\n1. `t17` (which is a terminal, so that's done)\n2. `t68` (another terminal)\n\nSo if NT20 only has these two terminal options, it cannot produce t31. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but in the string, after NT95 produces t18, the next token is t31, which comes from NT20, but NT20 can't do that. So that seems like a dead end.\n\nTherefore, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-652","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of markers like `t18`, `t31`, etc. The grammar starts with `S` and has a bunch of production rules, mostly splitting non-terminals into two other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll try to figure out the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is `S`, which has two production rules: `S -> NT73 NT20` and `S -> NT95 NT83`. So any string generated by this grammar will have exactly two parts, each part derived from one of these initial rules.\n\nThe string provided is: `t18 t31 t29 t4 t11 t17 t36 t35 t24 t2 t27 t0 t18 t6 t6 t24 t33 t17 t6 t31 t12 t28 t11 t9 t20 t2 t17 t17 t36 t18 t31 t31 t30 t4`. That's 31 tokens. Since each production from `S` leads to two parts, an even-length string would be expected. But here the string has 31 tokens, which is odd. Wait, that can't be right because each production splits into two, so the entire string should be two parts concatenated. So 31 tokens would mean each part is around 15 or so. Hmm, that doesn't immediately flag it as impossible, but I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, I'll look at the production rules. Each non-terminal on the left splits into two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two terminals. It seems like each step can produce more symbols, but eventually, the non-terminals must derive into terminals.\n\nI notice that most of the non-terminals have rules that split into two other non-terminals, except for some that directly go to terminals like `t18`, `t31`, etc. So the derivation would involve replacing each non-terminal step by step until all are terminals.\n\nI should probably try to see if the entire string can be split into two parts, each of which can be generated by one of the initial productions (NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83), and each of those parts can be derived from one non-terminal.\n\nWait, but NT73 and NT95 are the start of two different paths. So each part of the string (after splitting `S`) must be generated by either NT73 followed by NT20 or NT95 followed by NT83, respectively.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string into two parts, each part should be a sequence of terminals, and each should be generated by either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 31 tokens. Let me try to split it roughly in the middle, but let's see if the counts make sense. Since each initial rule has two non-terminals, and each of those can have more expansions, the string would have twice the number of symbols, but the exact number depends on the depth of derivation.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to reconstruct the possible path. Let's consider that the string starts with `t18`, which appears in multiple places. Looking at the production rules, NT99 can produce `t18` and `t35`. For example, NT99 -> `t10` but I also see NT35 -> `t35`-> `t3` and others. Hmm, but in the string, `t18` appears first, so maybe the first part starts with something leading to `t18`.\n\nWait, looking at the non-terminals: NT73 has a rule that ends with `t36` and another that ends with `t27`. NT38 can produce `t29` directly. Let me see, perhaps the initial NT73 leads down to `t36` and then another part.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Maybe a better approach is to try to map each token to a sequence that can be generated. For example, looking at the string, the first token is `t18`. Looking at the production rules, which NT can derive `t18`? Looking at the list, I see NT9 is `t10`, but that's not `t18`. Wait, checking the production rules:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't88' and other rules. Wait, maybe I need to look for NT's that can generate `t18`.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see `S -> NT73 NT20` and `S -> NT95 NT83`. So the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT73 NT20, and the second part the expansion of NT95 NT83, or vice versa.\n\nSo, first part is from NT73 and then NT20. Second part is from NT95 and then NT83.\n\nLet me first check the first part: what can NT73 derive into? Looking at the rules, NT73 has:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT12 NT47 (but there's another rule for NT73 that might be different.

{"custom_id":"request-668","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: \n\n`t35 t4 t29 t31 t11 t17 t20 t33 t0 t35 t6 t24 t29 t18 t24 t20 t27 t14 t35 t31 t6 t11 t27 t17 t31 t27 t17 t24 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36`\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side has either one non-terminal and one terminal, or two non-terminals. All productions start with a single non-terminal. Since this grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation breaks down a non-terminal into exactly two symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and all the productions are either from S down to two NTs or NTs breaking down into other NTs and terminals. The productions end when a terminal is reached, as each production rule can have a terminal like t36, t4, etc.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I think I should construct a parse tree or try to derive the string step by step. But since the string is quite long, that might take too long manually. Maybe I can look for a pattern or see if each symbol in the string can be matched by some production rule.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the possible sequences that can lead to the string. Since every production in CNF has exactly two symbols on the right, the string must have an even length? Wait, no, actually, each step increases the number of symbols by 1. Starting from S -> two NTs, each step might expand a NT into two symbols, so the length increases, but the final string should be a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, the string is: 35 terms, which is odd, so perhaps that's odd? Hmm, actually, no. Because each production adds either 0 or 1 symbols. Wait, no, each step in CNF production may add one symbol if a non-terminal is split into two others, or a terminal. It's complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the better way is to model the possible words. Each terminal t followed by a number is a terminal in the grammar. So the string is composed of these ts with numbers. Each time a production uses a rule that replaces a non-terminal with two terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nSo, for example, looking at the production rules, each NT can produce certain combinations of terminals or other NTs. So, to see if the string is generated, I need to see if each t can be derived from a non-terminal, and the sequence of t's can come from the start symbol.\n\nPerhaps I can process the string from the end, using a stack-based approach to parse the string, considering all possible rules. Alternatively, I can assign non-terminals to each part.\n\nLet me see: The string starts with t35, followed by t4, t29, etc.\n\nI need to check if each of these t's can be generated correctly.\n\nI think it's better to use a recursive descent parser approach, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can check each part.\n\nLet me think about each t in the string and see which N terminals can generate them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT32 -> NT1 NT6 (since rule is NT6 -> NT88 NT73, but wait, no, the NT numbering is such that each NT is defined by a rule. For example, looking for NTs that produce t35:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT73 -> NT62 NT27 and also NT73 -> 't36'. Similarly, NT27 -> 't33'. Wait, maybe I should look for each t in the string and see if it can be generated by a rule.\n\nWait, but each NT can produce a terminal as well. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is: t35, t4, t29, t31, t11, t17, t20, t33, t0, t35, t6, t24, t29, t18, t24, t20, t27, t14, t35, t31, t6, t11, t27, t17, t31, t27, t17, t24, t36, t35, t6, t6, t36, t17, t36.\n\nSo each symbol in the string is either t followed by a number or a combination of two symbols.\n\nNow, for a string to be generated by a grammar in CNF, each symbol must be the result of a derivation starting from the start symbol and applying the rules.\n\nI think the number of symbols must be a power of 2 minus 1. Wait, no, in CNF, each production replaces one symbol with two, so the initial S is 1 symbol. After one step, 2 symbols. Then each step can replace each symbol with two, so after k steps, total symbols are 2^k. So the length must be 2^k.\n\nThe string given has 35 symbols, which is not a power of 2 plus one, as 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So 32+1=33, 64+1=65. 35 is not 33 or 65, so it's impossible for a string generated by a CNF grammar to have length 35. Because each step of the production increases the number of symbols by 1? Wait, no. Because each production replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, the total length increases by one each time. Wait, no. In each step, the entire string's length increases by how much?\n\nWait, no. Let's think about it: If you have a string of length n, and you apply a production where one symbol becomes two symbols, then the new length is n +1. So starting from 1, each application of a production increases the length by 1. So the possible lengths are 1, 2, 3, etc. So any positive integer is possible, but the structure must allow it.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because in each step, you choose to expand one of the symbols. Each production expands exactly one symbol to two, so each step increases the total length by 1. So the possible lengths are all n \u22651. So 35 is possible.\n\nWait, so my initial thought that it's impossible because the length is not a power of 2 plus one is wrong. CNF allows any length, as each step can expand one symbol, increasing the length by 1 each time.\n\nSo the length doesn't restrict us. Therefore, the first thing to note is that 35 is acceptable in terms of length.\n\nHmm, so maybe that approach was incorrect. So length alone isn't the issue. Next, perhaps each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal that can be generated by some NT.\n\nLooking back, for example, the first symbol is t35. I need to see if there's a production that can produce t35.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT35 has several productions. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see:\n\nNT35 -> NT51 NT37\nNT35 -> NT36, but wait no, look through the full list.\n\nWait, the rules are a big list, so I need to scan for t35.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT35 -> t5, t3.\n\nAlso, NT99 -> t35. So if NT99 can produce t35, then that's possible. Or, if another NT can produce t35.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see:\n\nNT99 -> 't10' (so that's a terminal)\nNT99 -> 't35' (another terminal)\n\nSimilarly, NT35 has productions, but I think the other way. So I need to see if 't35' is produced directly or through other non-terminals.\n\nSame for the other ts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help, but manually, it's tedious.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent each symbol as a leaf in a derivation tree and ensure that each can be generated from some NT.\n\nBut perhaps the number of rules and the complexity is too much without a more structured approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each production is such that each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assign variables to each t and see if the structure can be built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would help, but that requires building a table, which is time-consuming.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe focusing on the structure.\n\nEach t must come from a direct production of some NT.\n\nAlternatively, each t must be a terminal symbol that appears as the result of a rule for some NT.\n\nSo I can check each t in the string: t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-671","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and so is the string to evaluate. My task is to figure out whether the string is a possible output of this grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. A CFG in CNF has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals, except for the case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal symbol directly. Since the grammar here follows CNF, all productions are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each start symbol S and NT (non-terminals) have productions. The RHS of each production is either two non-terminals or sometimes a terminal, like 't35' appearing in some productions. So, for example, NT35 \u2192 t3, which is a terminal, and also NT35 \u2192 t35, which is another terminal. Wait, no, looking closely, the productions show that some NT entries have terminals, like NT85 \u2192 NT74 NT73, but at the bottom, there are productions where NT55 \u2192 t17, so each non-terminal can have a mix of terminals and non-terminals in its productions.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood. The way it's presented, for example, NT35 has two productions: one that produces 't3' and another that produces another non-terminal pair. So each NT can produce a string of non-terminals or a terminal. So it's allowed to have a mix, but in CNF, typically, each production should be two non-terminals. So having a terminal in the RHS complicates things, but since the grammar allows that, I guess it's fine.\n\nBut more importantly, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t35 t31 t29 t4 t31 t6 t17 t36 t35 t17 t29 t35 t24 t29 t35 t31 t6 t36 t17 t17 t36 t35 t6 t24 t36 t18 t31 t31 t30 t4 t17 t36 t33 t17 t36.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nTo approach this, I should parse the string using the CFG. Parsing strategies often involve bottom-up or top-down methods, but since I'm more familiar with top-down, maybe I can simulate that.\n\nAlternatively, a method to check if a string is in the language is to see if it can be split into production steps, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until I get the string.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or one terminal. So, the string must be a sequence of terminals obtained by expanding non-terminals, with each step replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, since the grammar is in CNF, every left-hand side (LHS) production is a single non-terminal, and the RHS is either two non-terminals or a terminal. That means that the entire expansion of the start symbol S must produce a string where each symbol in the string is either a terminal directly from a production or part of a sequence built by expanding further.\n\nBut looking at the string, every character is a terminal (like 't35' etc.), so we need to see if the entire string can be derived by expanding non-terminals to these terminals, using the given productions.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the structure of the string. Each step in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals, except when it's a terminal. So the process of expansion is binary, and the length of the string increases by one each time a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals. Thus, starting from S, each expansion doubles the number of symbols, but in this case, since the string is a single sequence, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build a derivation tree for the string. Let's see.\n\nThe string is 42 characters long, but the start symbol S likely generates a tree whose leaves are the terminals of the string. So, each step from a non-terminal to two non-terminals, until all are terminals.\n\nBut that's a lot to handle. Maybe I can look for patterns in the productions and see if the string can be built by chaining these productions.\n\nI can also note that the string must have a certain structure based on the grammar's productions. Each time a non-terminal is used, it must expand correctly.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is given in terms of NTX productions, perhaps I can create a mapping from each non-terminal to the possible symbols it can produce, and then see if each symbol in the string can be matched by expanding the non-terminals appropriately.\n\nFor example, looking at the string, the first symbol is t35. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT85 \u2192 t35. So the first symbol t35 comes from NT85. So in the derivation, somewhere in the leftmost part, there must be an NT85 that directly produces t35.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is t35, which is produced by NT85. So in the expansion tree, the start symbol S would have to expand to NT... leading to NT85, which then directly produces t35.\n\nWait, but the entire string starts with t35, so the first symbol is from NT85, which is part of the start symbol S's expansion.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. S's productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n- S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo S expands into two non-terminals, either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t35, which comes from NT85 (since NT85 \u2192 t35). But in the S's first production, the first symbol is NT73. So if the string starts with t35, perhaps it's using the second production of S, which is NT95 and NT83.\n\nWait, but in the second production, S \u2192 NT95 NT83, so the first non-terminal is NT95, which can produce t35. Because in the grammar, NT95 has a production to t35.\n\nWait, checking the grammar: looking for NT95 \u2192 something with a terminal. Yes, in the grammar:\n\nNT95 \u2192 t35\n\nSo, if S uses the second production S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the first symbol is from NT95, which directly is t35.\n\nSo that's possible. So perhaps the start symbol S expands as follows:\n\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nThen the first symbol t35 comes from NT95.\n\nNow, the second symbol in the string is t31. Looking at NT83's productions, the RHS can be NT22 NT45 or t38 (from NT83 \u2192 t38). Wait, no, in the grammar, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking up NT83, I see:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT83 \u2192 t38\n\nWait, but the second symbol is t31, not t38. So perhaps the NT83 in the second position isn't directly producing t31.\n\nHmm, maybe I got this wrong. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nLooking for NT83:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT83 \u2192 t38\n\nSo, from NT83, we can either get t38 or split into NT22 and NT45. So in the second symbol, we have 't31', which isn't produced by NT83.

{"custom_id":"request-689","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure is useful because it allows for certain optimizations in parsing algorithms, but I'm not sure if that directly helps here.\n\nThe grammar provided is quite extensive, with multiple non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) and terminals (t followed by numbers). Each production either breaks a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal. For example, the start symbol S branches into NT73 and NT20, each of which further breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n\nt35 t4 t29 t4 t11 t6 t17 t29 t18 t17 t20 t33 t0 t35 t24 t36 t35 t31 t6 t36 t33 t17 t17 t36 t35 t6 t6 t11 t30 t4 t17 t31 t9 t2 t17 t36.\n\nI'm going to assume the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each representing a part of the derivation. The approach is to try to build a parse tree from the string and see if the root symbol S can derive this entire string.\n\nLet me look for the start symbol S in the grammar. S can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So each S production consists of two parts, each of which can be a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t35. I wonder if t35 can be produced by something in the grammar. Checking the productions, I see NT35 \u2192 t3, t5, t13, t14, t15, t16, t33, etc., maybe? Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, in the given productions, for NT35, there are several rules like NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT37, NT35 \u2192 NT39 NT55, etc. There are also direct terminals for NT35: t3, t5, t13, t14, t15, t16, t33. So t35 can be produced directly by certain NT35 productions.\n\nBut the first symbol is t35. So to produce t35, one of the NT35's rules must be used. Wait, but looking at the grammar, all NT35 rules may lead to non-terminals except for some that produce terminals? Wait, I need to check if there are any NT35 \u2192 a where a is t35. Looking through the grammar:\n\nYes, I see NT35 \u2192 t3, t5, t13, t14, t15, t16, t33. So t35 can be produced by NT35 directly. But in the first step, S would produce NT73 and NT20, or NT95 and NT83. So perhaps t35 comes from the left-hand side or right-hand side of one of those productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the structure of the string. The first symbol is t35, which could come from either NT73 or NT20, depending on which part of the S production is used. Let me think: S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So the first NT73 could produce t35, and NT20 could produce some other symbol. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT95 NT83, so NT95 could produce t35, etc.\n\nLet me try assuming that the first t35 is from NT35. But wait, S branches into NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. So perhaps t35 is generated by NT73 or NT20. Let me check what NT73 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT73 can produce NT62 NT27, or NT44 NT27, or NT36. So one rule for NT73 is NT73 \u2192 t36. Wait, let me check: Yes, there's a production NT73 \u2192 t36. So S can produce NT73, which can directly produce t36, or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with t35. So if S produces NT73 NT20, and NT73 is t36, then the first symbol would be t36, but in the string, it's t35. That doesn't match. Alternatively, if S produces NT95 NT83, and NT95 produces t35, that could be possible.\n\nLooking at NT95, the productions are NT95 \u2192 NT49 NT39, NT95 \u2192 t18, etc. Wait, does NT95 have a production that directly gives t35? I don't see NT95 \u2192 t35 in the list. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for 't35' in NT95's productions. I see NT95 can produce terminals like t18, t10, t1, etc., but I don't see t35. So maybe the first t35 comes from NT73 \u2192 t35? Wait, does NT73 have a production that gives t35 directly? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions for NT35, there are several NT35 \u2192 a rules, like NT35 \u2192 t3, t5, etc., but I don't see NT73 having a production that gives t35 directly. Only NT35 can do that.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with t35, which must come from NT35. Therefore, S must be producing either NT95 NT83 or NT73 NT20, but in either case, one of the non-terminals in the S production must produce t35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is part of a chain where a non-terminal in S produces a non-terminal that eventually produces t35.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Let me try to model this more systematically. Maybe I should look for possible paths from the string to the start symbol.\n\nAnother approach is to look for sequences of symbols and see if they match any production rules. Since it's a leftmost or rightmost derivation, perhaps I can start from the beginning and try to find a matching step.\n\nThe string starts with t35. So perhaps t35 is from a direct production of some NT.\n\nLooking through the NT35 productions, which include t3, t5, t13, t14, etc. So t35 cannot be directly produced by NT35. So perhaps it's going through longer chains.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first NT73 can produce t35 by some chain. Let me look at NT73's productions:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT35 NT36\n\nWait, so if NT62 produces NT35 and NT36, then from NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, and NT62 \u2192 NT35 NT36, then NT73 can produce something like NT35 NT36 NT27, which through further derivations could lead to t35 if NT35 is the first in the chain.\n\nWait, but that would make the string start with t35 as the first symbol. But that would require that the derivation is such that the leftmost non-terminal expands first. Let me try that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Then, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. Now, NT62 can \u2192 NT35 NT36. So part of the string could start with t35 if NT35 is the first to expand. So let me see.\n\nIf I have NT35 \u2192 t35, then that would give the first symbol as t35. Then, after NT35, we have NT36 from NT62's expansion. Wait, NT62 \u2192 NT35 NT36, so after NT35 is t35, next would be NT36, which produces t36, as per the production NT36 \u2192 t36.\n\nWait, let me test this path. So S \u2192 NT73 NT20. NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. NT62 \u2192 NT35 NT36. Now, NT35 \u2192 t35, and NT36 \u2192 t36. So so far, the string would be t35 t36... But the given string starts with t35 t4 t29... So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second part of NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, which is NT27, produces the next symbols. Let me check what NT27 can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT27 \u2192 t33 directly.

The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: `t18 t31 t29 t4 t11 t24 t2 t1 t35 t24 t2 t33 t14 t18 t17 t36 t35 t31 t17 t36 t18 t31 t11 t30 t31 t17 t24 t20 t17 t35 t31 t36 t17 t6 t36 t33`.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the productions, S directly produces two non-terminals: NT73 and NT20. So the production is S -> NT73 NT20. So the string we produce must start with whatever NT73 and NT20 generate. Therefore, the initial step is to check what NT73 and NT20 produce.\n\nNT73 has two productions:\n1. NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n2. NT73 -> NT12 NT47\n\nSimilarly, NT20 has:\n1. NT20 -> NT27 NT68\n2. NT20 -> NT68 NT73\n\nSo, each of these non-terminals can split into two. This could get complex, but maybe I can find a way to trace back the tokens to see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to parse the string from the end. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm could be used, but I'm not sure how to apply that here without code. Maybe I can look for possible sequences that correspond to the given string.\n\nAnother approach is to look for rules that map to the terminals in the string. Let's list all the string tokens and see if they correspond to any non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the token sequence: t18, t31, t29, t4, t11, t24, t2, t1, t35, t24, t2, t33, t14, t18, t17, t36, t35, t31, t17, t36, t18, t31, t11, t30, t31, t17, t24, t20, t17, t35, t31, t36, t17, t6, t36, t33.\n\nI notice that some tokens like t18, t31, t29, etc., are present. Looking for which non-terminals these are the end of a production.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, each rule has a start with a non-terminal and ends with two other non-terminals. For example, NT38 can produce 't36' and NT55 becomes 't17', etc.\n\nSo, I should see if each token in the string is the result of a production rule. If each token is either a terminal or the result of two other terminals, then it could be part of the derivation.\n\nStarting with the first token, t18. In the grammar, which non-terminals produce t18 as their terminal? Looking through the rules, I see NT99 -> 't10', but also NT38 -> 't36' (no t18), NT4 -> 't11', etc. Hmm, actually looking deeper, in the grammar, NT19 etc., but I don't see t18 as a terminal in the provided rules. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT18 is not present, but I see NT35 -> 't3', NT28 is in production, but wait, the initial string starts with t18.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, is there any rule where a non-terminal produces t18? Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at each production where a non-terminal results in a terminal:\n- NT99 -> 't38'? Wait no. Let me scan all the rules.\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT96 -> 't27'\n- NT83 -> 't28'\n- NT52 -> 't12'... Wait, all the rules ending with 't' seem to be specific:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT55 -> 't17'\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT85 -> 't28'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT65 isn't there, wait, looking for 't' terminals:\n\n- NT38 can produce 't29' in some rule: looking, yes, NT38 -> 't29' (I think). Let me check the rule: NT28 is not a non-terminal, wait. Wait the rules provided include several where a non-terminal becomes 'tX' like:\n\n- NT38 -> 't29'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT96 -> 't27'\n- NT83 -> 't28'\n- etc.\n\nWait, t18 is not listed as a terminal in any of the production rules. Hmmm. So any token in the string that is 't18' would have to come from a non-terminal production that eventually reduces to 't18'. But looking through all the productions, none of the non-terminals directly produce t18 as a terminal. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me scan the given grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking through each production, are there any where a non-terminal maps directly to 't18'? Let's check each line:\n\nYes! Here's a line:\n\nNT18 -> t10\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, is there an NT18? Let me check the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT96 -> 't27'\n- NT83 -> 't28'\n- NT52 -> 't12'\n- NT71 -> 't6'\n- NT39 -> 't5'\n- NT63 -> 't29'\n- NT99 -> 't10' (another rule)\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT49 -> 't3' (another rule)\n- NT64 -> 't17'\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT49 -> 't2' (another rule)\n- NT88 -> 't28' (another rule)\n- NT12 -> ... wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Looking at the provided rules, is there any non-terminal that can produce 't18'? Let me go through each production where a non-terminal is mapped to a terminal:\n\nLooking through the productions, the only terminals are:\n\n- t3 (NT35)\n- t4 (NT44)\n- t5 (NT39)\n- t6 (NT73)\n- t11 (NT11)\n- t12 (NT12)\n- t17 (NT44)\n- t2 (NT26)\n- t35 (NT65?) Wait, NT65 isn't in the provided rules.\n\nWait, in the list, for example:\n\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n- NT96 -> 't27'\n- NT83 -> 't28'\n- etc.\n\nLooking, I don't see any 't18' as a terminal. So the first token in the string is 't18', which can't be a production unless some non-terminal eventually reduces to it. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, but the grammar might not be able to produce the string because 't18' isn't present as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a production where a non-terminal produces 't18'. Let me check each production line again.\n\nLooking through the provided rules line by line:\n\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n3. NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n4. NT71 -> NT68 NT2\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-708","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let's start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, with starting symbol S. The production rules are all of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the terminals which are on the right side. The string we're checking is a sequence of t followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the production rules to understand the structure. The terminals are t followed by numbers from 0 to 99 (since they have t0, t1, ..., t99). The non-terminals are the NT symbols, like S, NT52, NT73, etc.\n\nThe string is:\nt18 t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t1 t35 t24 t36 t35 t24 t29 t18 t6 t24 t36 t35 t31 t24 t27 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t20 t17 t35 t31 t11 t27.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Let me try to parse it from the beginning. Each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers are their indices. I need to see if the string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. In the grammar, S can produce two NTs: either NT52 or NT95. So the first non-terminal to expand would be either NT52 or NT95.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is t18. Let me see if any of the NTs can immediately produce t18.\n\nFrom the production rules, NT95 \u2192 t18. So if the first step is S \u2192 NT95 NT83 (from the initial rules), right? Wait, the initial rules for S are S \u2192 NT52 NT73 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So if the first production is S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the first symbol would be the terminal from NT95, which is t18. That matches the first terminal.\n\nSo the first production is S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, the string starts with t18, which is the terminal from NT95. So now, we need to expand NT83. Let's look at NT83's production rules.\n\nNT83 can be derived from NT22 NT45. So we can split this into NT22 and NT45. We'll need to parse the next part of the string corresponding to these.\n\nThe next part of the string after t18 is t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t1 t35 t24 t36 t35 t24 t29 t18 t6 t24 t36 t35 t31 t24 t27 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t20 t17 t35 t31 t11 t27.\n\nWait, no, actually, the first production is S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So once NT95 produces t18, we move to NT83. So the next part of the string is the expansion of NT83.\n\nLet's look at NT83. The only production is NT22 NT45. So we need to split the string starting from the next terminal, which is t31, to match t31 t29 t4... Wait, not sure. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, starting from S and expanding according to the grammar.\n\n1. Start with S.\n2. S can expand into NT52 NT73 or NT95 NT83. The first symbol is t18, which comes from NT95, so we'll take the production S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n3. Now, the next symbols to be generated are from NT95 and NT83. NT95 generates t18, so the first symbol t18 is consumed, and we're left with the expansion of NT83.\n4. Looking at NT83, its only production is NT22 NT45. So now we have to expand NT22 and NT45.\n\nSo let's look at the string after the first t18, which is t31 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t1 t35 t24 t36 t35 t24 t29 t18 t6 t24 t36 t35 t31 t24 t27 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t20 t17 t35 t31 t11 t27.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the string step by step:\n\nThe string starts with t18. From the grammar, that comes from NT95. So now, after t18, we need to expand NT83.\n\nNT83's production is NT22 NT45. So we need to generate t31 t29 t4 t31... No, wait, perhaps I should look at the production steps in more detail.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree. Let's try to see which non-terminals can generate sequences of terminals starting with t18 and the next symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the possible sequences.\n\nBut perhaps I can take another approach. Let's consider that each NT has a production tree that can generate certain terminals. Let's see if the string can be split into these.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t18, t31, t29, t4, t31, t24, t2, t1, t35, t24, t36, t35, t24, t29, t18, t6, t24, t36, t35, t31, t24, t27, t17, t6, t36, t17, t6, t36, t27, t17, t17, t20, t17, t35, t31, t11, t27.\n\nIt's a long string, but perhaps I can break it down into sections that correspond to the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nLet me think about the first part: t18. As we saw, that's from NT95, which also produces t83. But wait, no, NT95 only produces t18, or is it that NT95 is part of a production? Wait, no, in the grammar, N terminals are like NT52, etc. So NT95 is a non-terminal, and in the initial productions, S can be NT95 NT83. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT52 NT73 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So S is composed of two non-terminals, each of which must be expanded into their productions.\n\nSo S can produce NT95 NT83. So the first two symbols (from NT95 and NT83) would be the terminals they produce.\n\nNT95 produces t18, so that's the first symbol. Now we need to expand NT83. NT83's only production is NT22 NT45, so the second symbol is the result of NT22 and NT45.\n\nWait, no, the second symbol is actually from NT83's expansion, which is NT22 NT45. So after the first symbol t18, the second symbol would come from NT22, and the third symbol from NT45.\n\nSo the string after t18 is t31. Let's see if that can be generated by NT22.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT22 is defined as NT44 NT63. So NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63.\n\nSo when expanding NT22, it will produce NT44 and NT63. Which are both non-terminals. NT44 \u2192 t4, so perhaps that's where t31 comes into play.\n\nWait, no. Let's see, the second symbol in the string after t18 is t31, which is the first symbol of NT44 or NT63.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me re-examine.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT95 NT83, NT95 produces t18, then NT83 produces NT22 NT45. So the next symbols would be generated by NT22 and NT45. So NT22's expansion is NT44 NT63, so the next symbols would be the terminals generated by NT44 and NT63.\n\nNT44 \u2192 t4, so the next symbol is t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is a bit complex, and the string is quite long. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are listed out.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string `t18 t31 t29 t31 t11 t24 t29 t18 t17 t36 t35 t24 t20 t33 t0 t18 t6 t6 t31 t27 t17 t17 t36 t18 t31 t11 t3 t20 t17 t6 t11 t30 t31 t17 t6 t24 t27` can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI remember that one efficient way to check if a string is generated by a CFG is to construct a parse tree or use the CYK algorithm. However, CYK might be a bit abstract here, but maybe I can approach it by working backwards, seeing which parts of the string can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. From the given grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, any string generated by S must start with the result of either NT73 \u2192 ... or NT95 \u2192 .... Then the rest of the string must match the corresponding part.\n\nLooking at the first production, let's see what possibilities we have.\n\nFirst production path:\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\n\nI need to find if there's a way for NT73 to generate a part of the string starting with 't18', 't31', etc. Similarly for NT20.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nStarting with S, the first step is to expand either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't18'. Let me check the grammar for possible non-terminals that can produce 't18'.\n\nFrom the production list, NT9 has a production: NT9 \u2192 't10'. But that's a 't10' token, not 't18'.\n\nLooking through other rules:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT24 (but wait, that's still a non-terminal. Let me keep going.\n\nNT99 \u2192 't10', 't16', 't31', 't6', etc. Looking for 't18'.\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces 't18'. Let's see the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I can scan for any NT with a production to 't18'.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT36 (but 't36' is terminal)\n- NT27 \u2192 't27' (terminal)\n- NT24 \u2192 't25'\n- NT47 \u2192 't27'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT80 \u2192 't7'\n- NT73 \u2192 't36' and 't36' again?\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking through all the '\u2192' rules and seeing which produce a terminal 't18' directly. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, I can spot some rules where a NT directly produces a 'tX' token:\n\nLooking for any rule where a NT's production is directly 't18'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't30'\nNT10? No, I don't see NT10. Wait, looking for NT producing 't18':\n\nLooking through all the rules, perhaps:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't27'\n- NT95 \u2192 't35'\n- NT74 \u2192 't39t39'?\n- NT53 \u2192 't11'\n- NT27 \u2192 't27'\n- NT24 \u2192 't25'\n- NT39 \u2192 't6,t5'\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\n- NT84 \u2192 't1'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\nWait, I see none directly produce 't18'. Hmm, maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol 't18' is produced by a non-terminal that can derive 't18' through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can work backward from the terminal tokens to see which non-terminals can derive them.\n\nLet's consider that 't18' is the first symbol. So, we need a non-terminal that can produce 't18' through its productions. If none of the non-terminals produce 't18' directly, perhaps a longer derivation is needed.\n\nWait, looking back at the list of production rules, I don't immediately see a production that results in 't18' as a terminal. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminals (strings where the production is A \u2192 a) are:\n\n'nt9' \u2192 't9' (Wait, no, I think it's NT99 \u2192 't9').

Let me look up each rule carefully.)\n\nLooking again:\n\nHere's the list of rules with their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't88'\nWait, perhaps this is getting too confusing.

I need to determine if the given string `t18 t4 t29 t31 t31 t24 t29 t35 t31 t24 t36 t18 t24 t29 t18 t31 t17 t29 t18 t17 t20 t17 t35 t31 t6 t24 t27 t17 t36 t33 t17 t11 t12 t10 t23 t24 t33 t2` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar in CNF consists of production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except when the symbols are terminals. The string starts with `t18`, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I need to find where `t18` appears. Scanning through, I see `t18` is in the production rule for NT95: NT95 -> t18. So, the string starts with t18, so the starting non-terminal S must derive to something that starts with NT95 in its production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S branches into two production rules: S -> NTNT73 and S -> NT95. Let me evaluate both options.\n\nStarting with S -> NT95, which according to the grammar is NT95 -> t18. So the string starts with t18, which matches. Now, I need to continue deriving the remaining part. Moving to the next token in the string, which is t4. So after t18, we have t4. The NT95 production only gives us t18, so the next part must come from the other alternative S -> NTNT95, which is NT95 again, but it's the same as before. Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled. Let me try more carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I should break the string into tokens and see each step. The string is:\n\nt18, t4, t29, t31, t31, t24, t29, t35, t31, t24, t36, t18, t24, t29, t18, t31, t17, t29, t18, t17, t20, t17, t35, t31, t6, t24, t27, t17, t36, t33, t17, t11, t12, t10, t23, t24, t33, t2.\n\nSo the first token is t18. In the grammar, the only place t18 comes from is NT95. Therefore, the first part of the derivation must be NT95 -> t18. So, the first two non-terminals in the initial S production (which is S -> NT95) must expand to give t18. But in our case, the production S -> NT95 is a single non-terminal NT95, which directly produces t18. So the initial step is S -> NT95, and then NT95 produces t18. So the string starts with t18, which matches. \n\nNow, after t18, the next token is t4. So the next part of the derivation must produce t4 after t18. Let's see how t4 is derived. Looking at the grammar, the only occurrence of terminal t4 is in NT44: NT44 -> t4. So to produce t4, the non-terminal NT44 must be expanded. But where does NT44 appear? In the grammar, I see NT44 appears in the production NT44 -> t4. Also, in other productions: NT49 -> t3, and so on. So, to produce t4, it must come directly from NT44.\n\nBut in the current string after t18, we have t4 as the next token. Therefore, between t18 and t4, there must be a NT that produces t4. Let's think about how the string \"t18 t4\" would be produced.\n\nThe first NT95 gives t18, and then the remaining part must come from NT95 and another non-terminal expanding. Wait, perhaps the initial S is S -> NT95, so the first expansion is NT95. But after NT95 gives t18, where does the next NT come in? Because t4 is the next token. Unless the S production is S -> NTNT73 or S -> NT95, but S -> NT95 gives a single terminal. Wait, maybe the initial S is the one that can produce two NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because S in CNF is a start symbol, it can only produce two NTs. But in the given grammar, S has two productions: S -> NTNT73 and S -> NT95. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, it's written as S -> NT73 NT20, which is two NTs. Similarly, S -> NT95 NT83. So, in both cases, S expands to two NTs. Wait, I think I might have misread before.\n\nWait no, the grammar is given as S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83, but in the list, each NT has a rule, so in fact, the initial S can expand into two NTs, each of which can further expand.\n\nWait no, wait: in the grammar, S has two productions: S -> NT73 NT20 and S -> NT95 NT83. So each time you apply an S rule, you get two NTs in the string. So, for example, if you take S -> NT73 NT20, that would produce two NTs, which would then have to expand further.\n\nBut in our case, the string starts with t18, which comes directly from NT95. So perhaps the initial step is S -> NT95 NT83 (from the second production). But in that case, the first NT would expand to t18, and the second would expand to another symbol. But that would make the string after t18 followed by another symbol. However, in our case, after t18, the next is t4, which is another terminal. That suggests that both initial NTs must expand to terminals. Wait, but NT95 only expands to t18, right?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\n1. The given string is a sequence of terminals. We need to see if there's a derivation starting from S which, after expanding all non-terminals, results in this string.\n\n2. The grammar is in CNF, so each production step expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals, but each terminal production is a single terminal.\n\n3. Starting with S, which can expand into either NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\n4. Let's consider the starting production: Let's take S -> NT95 NT83. Then both NT95 and NT83 will produce the first two terminals.\n\nLooking at NT95 and NT83: NT95 -> t18, and NT83 has a production NT83 -> NT22 NT45. Then NT22, NT45, etc., so the expansion would be more steps.\n\nBut wait, our string starts with t18 followed by t4. So let me think: after NT95 is t18, what comes next? The NT83 would expand into two more non-terminals, but the next token is t4, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, t4 only comes from NT44.\n\nSo if S -> NT95 NT83, then after t18 from NT95, NT83 would expand into maybe another NT that produces t4. But NT83 -> NT22 NT45, each of which may then expand into more non-terminals. So perhaps this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is S -> NT95 NT83, and one of the NTs in that expansion is NT44 which produces t4. But how? Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the entire string and see if it can be generated by a series of left or right derivations.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string starting from S and see if it can be reconstructed using the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to list the entire string and see if each terminal can be mapped to a terminal in the grammar, proceeding backward.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model this as a top-down parsing. Let me try to build the parse tree.\n\nThe string is: t18, t4, t29, t31, t31, t24, t29, t35, t31, t24, t36, t18, t24, t29, t18, t31, t17, t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t35 t4 t29 t31 t31 t17 t20 t27 t0 t35 t24 t36 t35 t31 t17 t29 t18 t31 t36 t17 t24 t29 t18 t24 t20 t1 t35 t31 t17 t2 t17 t18 t31 t36 t33 t17 t36 t27`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is useful for certain parsing algorithms, and we can apply the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm here.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by parsing the string in a table-based manner, checking for each substring whether it can be derived from the grammar. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the table:** The table will have dimensions n x n for an n-length string. Each cell will contain the set of non-terminals that can generate the substring corresponding to that cell.\n\n2. **Fill the table:** For each position, expand based on the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by listing all the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive. I'll need to list all the left-hand sides (LHS) and right-hand sides (RHS) of each production rule.\n\nFirst, non-terminals and terminals:\n\n- Non-terminals: S, NT35, NT4, NT29, NT31, NT20, NT27, NT62, NT53, NT96, NT83, NT88, NT52, NT12, NT71, NT39, NT83, NT88, NT52, NT49, NT45, NT6, NT38, NT99, NT22, NT99, NT63, NT90, NT47, NT51, NT45, NT88, NT74, NT96, NT82, NT37, NT45, NT73, NT85, NT20, NT38, NT44, NT55, NT80, NT73, NT85, NT24, NT49, NT27, NT99, NT12, NT84, NT44, NT26, NT49, NT99, NT27, NT49, NT24, NT27, NT47, NT12, NT84, NT24, NT47, NT12.\n\nTerminals are those that end with 't' followed by a number, like t35, t4, t29, etc.\n\nWait, looking again, the terminals might be more varied. For example, 't37' is a terminal.\n\nBut wait, I notice there are multiple entries for some symbols. For example, NT82 is mentioned multiple times with rules. Let me see: I might have made a mistake in listing all rules correctly because of the way the question was given.\n\nActually, the rules are structured as S \u2192 NT1 NT2, etc. So, for example, the production S \u2192 NT73 NT20 is rule 1, and another S \u2192 NT95 NT83 is rule 2, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, NT35 has multiple productions:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3, NT49 \u2192 NT23 NT95, NT49 \u2192 NT2 NT3, etc.\n\nWait, this is going to take a while because there are many non-terminals and rules. Maybe I can create a list of all possible non-terminals and see which ones can produce each part of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t35, which is a terminal. So, I need to find a production rule that starts with NT35 and has 't35' as its terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT35:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3\n- NT35 \u2192 NT99 NT24\n- NT35 \u2192 NT63 NT2\n- NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n- And others, but these are the ones that produce 't35'.\n\nSo, NT35 can produce 't35' via: NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3 \u2192 terminal parts.\n\nLooking at NT49 productions: NT49 \u2192 NT23 NT95, NT49 \u2192 NT2 NT3, etc. So, perhaps we can trace a path where NT35 generates t35 as the first symbol.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or terminals. So, the leftmost non-terminal must derive into two symbols (another non-terminal or terminal). But in our case, the string starts with t35, so the first part must be a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT35's productions, some have 't35' as one of the two terminals.\n\nWait, in NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3, that would produce two symbols, not terminals. NT35 \u2192 NT99 NT24 also produces two non-terminals. NT35 \u2192 NT63 NT2: NT63 is non-terminal, but NT2 is a terminal (t2).\n\nWait, looking back, does NT2 exist? Checking the rules, I see a production NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68, NT44 \u2192 t4, but I don't see NT2 being a production. Wait, actually, in the initial list, I see NT24, but not NT2. Maybe I misread.\n\nWait, scanning through the rules, looking for NT2. I don't see any NT2 in the productions. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with t35, t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's find if 't4' is a terminal (the second symbol in the string). 't4' is a terminal. So, we need to find a production where a non-terminal directly expands to 't4'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, for NT24: NT24 \u2192 t25 t... Hmm, no, wait. Let me find all rules for each symbol.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to make a list of all non-terminals and their productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this with the CYK algorithm.\n\nLet me index the string: it's 39 symbols long.\n\nSo, the string s is:\n\nt35 t4 t29 t31 t31 t17 t20 t27 t0 t35 t24 t36 t35 t31 t17 t29 t18 t31 t36 t17 t24 t29 t18 t24 t20 t1 t35 t31 t17 t2 t17 t18 t31 t36 t33 t17 t36 t27\n\nNow, each token is a terminal. So, the first step is to fill the CYK table starting with n=1, then up to n=39.\n\nEach cell (i,j) represents the substring s[i..j).\n\nFor each length l from 1 to 39, we create a table of size (40- l+1)x(40 - l+1), and fill in the cells.\n\nFor l=1: (i,i). Each symbol can only be produced by a non-terminal that has a production to that symbol.\n\nFor each symbol in s:\n\n- t35: found in NT35's production as NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3 (but this leads to more non-terminals) or others. Wait, looking for a production of a non-terminal that directly produces t35. Let's check which non-terminals can produce t35.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT35: does it have any production that ends with t35? Yes, NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37 (which is 't37'), but that's not helpful. Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the production rules, for NT35:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT3\n- NT35 \u2192 NT99 NT24\n- NT35 \u2192 NT63 NT2\n- NT35 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n\nBut none of these produce a terminal. Or do they? Let me check the rules for NT35. No, NT35 only expands into non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something because in the problem statement, all non-terminals only produce other non-terminals or terminals, but in the provided rules, perhaps some non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, for example, NT49 \u2192 t3?

So, the grammar here seems to follow that structure because all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, which produces NT73 and NT20. The string starts with `t35`, so I need to see if there's a way to derive `t35` starting from S. \n\nLooking at the productions, for NT35, I see two productions: `NT35 -> NT13 NT3` and `NT35 -> NT3 NT13` but wait, actually, in the provided grammar, NT35 has a production.

Specifically, I see that NT35 can produce `t3` or `t13`. But in the string, the first `t35` is at the beginning. Wait, that doesn't make sense because `t35` isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal. So, perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait no, looking again, in the very end of the grammar, under NT44, it's 't4', and NT35 has some 't's. Let me check: I don't see NT35 producing 't35' directly. Wait, in the initial grammar provided, under NT35, the productions are shown as NT35 -> NT3 NT13 and vice versa. Also, in the later part, I see NT35->'t3' and NT35->'t5', etc. So perhaps, in the grammar, after some derivations, NT35 goes to a terminal.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The grammar uses NT (NonTerminals) and terminals (t followed by a number or ending as 'tX' or 'tXy'). So the string provided starts with `t35`, but the initial NTs are on the left-hand side, but how do they produce terminals?\n\nI think I might be getting confused. Let's start over.\n\nThe string is all t followed by numbers or something, like t35, t4, t29, etc. So these are terminals. The non-terminals are the NTs, and the grammar consists of productions where each non-terminal is replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, S can produce NT73 and NT20, which are non-terminals. Then, each of those NTs can produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nThe string to check starts with t35, which is a terminal. So, in the derivation, there must be a step where a non-terminal produces t35. Let's look at the grammar to see if any NT goes directly to t35.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find NT35 has the following productions:\n\n- NT35 -> NT3 NT13\n- NT35 -> NT13 NT3\n- also, looking again, I see NT35 -> t5\nWait, actually, in the early part, under NT35, I see:\n\nWait, in the initial list, I have NT35's productions. Let me check:\n\n- NT35 -> NT3 NT13\n- Then, also, looking later, I see under NT35:\n\nWait no, wait, in the initial list, the only NT35 productions are:\n\nNT35 -> NT3 NT13\nNT35 -> NT13 NT3\n\nBut then, under other NTs like NT95 and NT8, sometimes 't' is produced. Wait, I might have missed NT35's terminal productions. Looking again, I see:\n\nUnder NT52, there's a production NT52->t7, etc. So let me go through the entire grammar to find all terminal productions involving NT35.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I don't see any NT35->t*. Let me check again:\n\nWait, at the very end of the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT35 -> 't5'\n- Also, looking for others, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, wait, in the grammar provided, after the last line, it ends with NT99 -> 't16' and then it's followed by '...'.

{"custom_id":"request-751","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty extensive, with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific rules: all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every production has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to follow CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20; that's two non-terminals. Then, NT38 \u2192 't36'; that's a terminal.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is a list of t's followed by numbers. The string is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t17 t29 t18 t24 t29 t18 t6 t24 t29 t18 t6 t24 t36 t18 t17 t36 t18 t31 t6 t31 t30 t31 t17 t36 t17 t36 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t24 t33.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the given grammar, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's suitable for a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to find a way to break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. According to the given grammar, S can produce two options: NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, the string must start with the expansion of either NT73 or NT95 followed by NT20 or NT83, and then continue recursively until the entire string is processed.\n\nFirst, let me check if the string starts with either 't35' or 't31' since those are the first terminals after S.\n\nWait, no. Actually, S \u2192 NT73 NT20 would mean the first two tokens would be whatever NT73 and NT20 produce. Similarly, S \u2192 NT95 NT83 would mean the first two tokens are from NT95 and NT83.\n\nSo looking at the first part of the string, the first token is t35, then t31. Let's see if either option starts with that.\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT73 NT20: What does NT73 produce? Looking through the grammar, I see NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. So NT73 is a non-terminal that can be further expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68. So each of these non-terminals splits into two more non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to trace the expansion for the first few tokens.\n\nS would first expand to NT73 NT20, so the first part of the string is t35 and t31.\n\nLooking at NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. So the next step would be to expand NT62 and NT27.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT53 NT18: So NT62 splits into NT53 and NT18.\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT47 NT53? Wait, looking at the grammar: NT53 \u2192 't11' NT24? Or wait, looking again: Let me check all the productions for NT53.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see several lines starting with NT53, but looking, I don't see NT53 as a left-hand side except in one place. Wait, I need to actually look through the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT53 as a left-hand side except in one place: Maybe I'm confusing with NT52 or NT53? Wait, perhaps I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, looking again at the provided grammar, the lines are in pairs, but perhaps it's more organized in a different way. Maybe to see the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to check for each non-terminal what their productions are.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map out the entire structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Maybe I can look for the beginning of the string in the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t6 t17...\n\nI need to see if this aligns with any of the production paths from S.\n\nGiven that S can go either to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83, let's check both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nThen, NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT53 NT18.\n\nNow, NT53... Wait, checking the grammar, I don't see a production for NT53 as a left-hand side except in lines starting with NT52 or NT53.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, for NT52, there are multiple expansions, but I don't see NT53 as a left-hand side. Wait, actually, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S, S, then NT52, NT71, etc. Wait, I might have misread the grammar. Let me make sure.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\n\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nNT71 -> NT68 NT2\n\nNT39 -> NT51 NT37\n\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\n\nNT88 -> NT38 NT24\n\nNT52 -> NT80 NT47\n\nNT49 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT80 -> NT71 NT99\n\nNT22 -> NT44 NT63\n\nNT99 -> NT38 NT62\n\nNT99 -> NT63 NT2\n\nNT90 -> NT38 NT95\n\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44\n\nNT51 -> NT64 NT90\n\nNT47 -> NT49 NT26\n\nNT88 -> NT9 NT53\n\nNT74 -> NT39 NT39\n\nNT96 -> NT82 NT83\n\nNT82 -> NT51 NT84\n\nNT37 -> NT85 NT55\n\nNT45 -> NT44 NT52\n\nNT73 -> NT12 NT47\n\nNT85 -> NT74 NT73\n\nNT20 -> NT27 NT68\n\nNT38 -> 't36'\n\nNT44 -> 't31'\n\nNT6 -> 't8' \u2013 wait no, looking back, in the list, some are like NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\n\"NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73\"\n\nSo NT6 expands into NT88 and NT73.\n\nSimilarly, several other NT rules expand into two NTs or a terminal.\n\nBut more importantly, for the given string, I need to see if each step can lead to matching the tokens.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach.\n\nFirst, note that the string contains several 't' followed by numbers, indicating that some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nFor example, if a non-terminal X produces a terminal 't35', then in the string, when X is being expanded, it would produce 't35'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's collect all the productions that produce terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT38 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't8'? Wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't88' \u2013 no, wait.\n\nWait in the provided grammar, lines start with 'NT6 \u2192 NT88 NT73' which is a non-terminal expansion.

{"custom_id":"request-772","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token represents a terminal. My task is to analyze whether this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all rules either produce two non-terminals or directly a terminal, except for the start symbol S which is defined with two non-terminals, so that's consistent.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t18 t31 t29 t4 t11 t24 t36 t35 t6 t24 t36 t18 t24 t2 t33 t0 t35 t17 t36 t18 t31 t24 t29 t18 t31 t31 t30 t31 t17 t6 t11 t30 t4 t17 t31 t27 t17 t6 t36 t27`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. This means that the string must be a sequence of productions where each non-terminal eventually produces a terminal. So, the process will involve trying to parse the string from the start symbol S, breaking it down into the rules until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Both produce two non-terminals each. So, the string needs to start with one of these. Looking at the string, the first token is t18. Let me see if either of these non-terminals can produce t18.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT39 has a rule NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37, and a production NT39 \u2192 t6. So, perhaps NT39 can produce a terminal. Similarly, looking at NT99, which has several rules, including NT99 \u2192 t10, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a tree starting from S. Since all non-terminals either split into two non-terminals or a terminal, each level of the tree would have tokens either as terminals or non-terminals waiting to be split further.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing process. Let me take the string token by token and see if I can recursively match the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t18. Let's check if any non-terminal directly produces t18. Looking at the productions, NT24 has a rule NT24 \u2192 t25, which isn't t18. NT12 is t11. NT88 \u2192 t28, not t18. NT64 \u2192 t24. NT53 \u2192 t11. NT27 \u2192 t33. NT49 \u2192 t3. NT99 \u2192 t10 or t16 or t27. NT62 \u2192 t24 or t36. NT26 \u2192 t2. NT47 \u2192 t27. NT20 \u2192 t17 or t1. NT96 \u2192 t20. NT82 \u2192 t5. NT37 \u2192 t31 or t36 or t29. NT95 \u2192 t35 or t18 or t39. HTM: Oh, wait, I might be mixing up the NT and t tokens. Each production ends with a terminal, except when it's another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, all the production rules end with a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which means that NT73 and NT20 are non-terminals. Each non-terminal on the right-hand side also have rules producing either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for the string, each part must form a valid derivation from the grammar.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step, starting from the entire string and trying to apply the productions recursively.\n\nTotal tokens: Let's count them.\n\nt18 t31 t29 t4 t11 t24 t36 t35 t6 t24 t36 t18 t24 t2 t33 t0 t35 t17 t36 t18 t31 t24 t29 t18 t31 t31 t30 t31 t17 t6 t11 t30 t4 t17 t31 t27 t17 t6 t36 t27.\n\nThat's 41 tokens. The grammar starts with S, which splits into two non-terminals, each of which may split further, so the total number of tokens should be a number that's one less than a power of two, but perhaps this is a very long string, so it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a recursive descent parser approach. Starting with S, we can try to match either rule. Let's see.\n\nLet me think of each non-terminal and see which rules can be applied.\n\nLooking at the first token t18. Let's see which non-terminals can derive to t18.\n\nLooking through the rules: \n\n- NT12 \u2192 t11\n- NT39 \u2192 t6\n- NT99 \u2192 t10, t16, t27\n- NT35 \u2192 t3, t5, t13, t17, t36\n- NT64 \u2192 t24\n- NT24 \u2192 t25\n- NT62 \u2192 t24, t36\n- NT49 \u2192 t3, t4, t9, t23\n- NT82 \u2192 t5\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT68 \u2192 t14\n- NT11 -> t12\n- NT35 -> t3, t5, ... etc.\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT with a rule that directly produces t18.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT with a direct production of t18. So that means to get t18, the preceding non-terminals must split into multiple parts, eventually yielding t18.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Let me see what NT73 and NT20 produce.\n\nNTh: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. So let's split that.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. Then each of these breaks down further.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT36 NT24. NT27 \u2192 NT27.\n\nWait, wait, let me be careful.\n\nWait, the initial breakdown:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT36 NT24.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT27?\n\nWait, but NT27 has a rule? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT49 and Nt27 is on the left as well as in the production.\n\nWait, NT27 \u2192 NT62 NT36 and NT62 is another production? Wait, perhaps I should have a more systematic approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the entire string and see if it can be generated by S.\n\nBut this might take a while given the number of tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to look for a rule that starts with T18. Let me check all non-terminals and their first rules.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps I can check if T18 can be generated from the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, does any non-terminal have a production ending with T18?\n\nLooking through NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT68 NT14. So, no.\n\nWait, looking through each non-terminal:\n\nLooking for NT where one of the production rules ends with T18.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT12 -> NT68 NT14: no T18.\n- NT39: multiple rules: one is T6, others don't have T18.\n- NT95: production rules include t35, t3, etc. No T18.\n- NT73: production rules are NT62 NT27, and in the rules of NT62 and NT27, perhaps T18 can be reached.\nWait, NT27 has a production to T36, and NT62 has production NT36 NT24, etc.\n\nWait, T18 appears here: Looking through the productions, I need to see if any non-terminal can derive to T18.\n\nLooking through NT35: some rules produce T18?

The grammar has production rules, and the string provided is a sequence of tokens that I need to validate.\n\nFirst, I'll recap what CNF means. CNF is a set of production rules where each production left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. However, in this case, I notice that some of the rules have terminals, but the general structure seems to fit CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t4 t29 t4 t31 t24 t29 t35 t31 t24 t29 t18 t24 t29 t18 t6 t24 t2 t1 t35 t31 t24 t33 t17 t17 t36 t18 t6 t24 t2 t17 t18 t31 t36 t17 t11 t27 t17 t31 t27`.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar rules provided. Each rule has a non-terminal on the LHS and a combination of terminals or non-terminals on the RHS. For example, S -> NT73 NT20, which means S can be replaced by two non-terminals NT73 and NT20.\n\nMy approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two symbols on the RHS, which simplifies parsing because each step reduces the stack by one symbol.\n\nI'll consider the string as the input and try to derive it back into the start symbol S. Starting from the left, the first symbol is t35. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT35 -> t3 (from the rules, NT39 -> NT51 NT37, but maybe I'm mixing up some rules.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-785","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form (CNF), and I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols starting with 't' and then some numbers, ending with a 't'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol when the right-hand side has a single non-terminal. Also, no terminals appear directly in the body since the productions are in CNF.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the ones that produce terminals directly. The non-terminals that produce terminals are those that have productions ending with 't' and a number, like S->something with t35, t36, etc.\n\nI'll need to parse the input string from the start to the end, breaking it down into the rules. The input string is:\n\nt18 t4 t29 t4 t31 t24 t29 t35 t6 t24 t2 t1 t35 t6 t6 t11 t27 t17 t24 t27 t17 t17 t20 t17 t35 t24 t29 t18 t31 t24 t36 t18 t6 t6 t24 t27 t17 t36 t17 t36 t27\n\nI should think of each token as being part of the derivation. Each non-terminal will correspond to certain sequences of these 't' tokens.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which according to the grammar has two options:\n\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo the first step is to split the string into possible sequences that fit either of these options.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string, the first tokens are t18, t4, t29, t4, t31... Hmm. Wait, but the productions for S are NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So when S is expanded, it produces a sequence of two non-terminals, which then produce the terminal symbols.\n\nSo each step of the derivation must replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals, eventually leading down to terminals.\n\nI think a good approach is to represent the string as a parse tree, starting from S and trying to break down the string into the structure the grammar expects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a top-down parsing approach, starting at S and trying to match the string from the start.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe I should break it down step by step.\n\nLet's consider the two possible expansions of S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n   Then, the string needs to start with \"t18 t4 t29 ...\", but wait, looking at the productions, NT73 can be broken down. Looking up the productions:\n\n   NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n   NT62 -> NT24 NT53\n   NT53 -> NT11 NT23\n   Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the productions of each NT and see how they can generate the t symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each non-terminal and its possible terminal sequences.\n\nLooking through the productions, each production either is a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So each non-terminal that produces a terminal corresponds to a specific sequence of 't' tokens.\n\nI think I need to map each non-terminal to the possible sequences of 't's that it can generate.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT55 -> 't17'\nNT38 -> 't36' or 't29' or 't31'?\nWait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the productions, many NTs produce t's with various numbers:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't29' or other t's?\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't29' is one option, but looking further, I see NT38 \u2192 't36' as well? Or am I misinterpreting?\n\nWait no, looking back at the productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, for NT38:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't29' is one option, and another production might be NT38 \u2192 't36'?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't36' is not directly given.

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token seems to correspond to a terminal symbol. Let me try to break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of a start symbol S and several non-terminal symbols (NTx, etc.), each of which can expand into other symbols. All productions are in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t24 t2 t1 t18 t6 t24 t20 t33 t0 t35 t24 t2 t33 t14 t18 t31 t17 t36 t18 t31 t11 t27 t17 t36 t27 t17 t17 t36 t35 t6 t6 t36 t27 t17 t31 t0 t2`.\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI'll start by trying to reconstruct the derivation steps. The string is quite long, so I'll need a systematic approach.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S, which has two productions:\n1. S -> NT73 NT20\n2. S -> NT95 NT83\n\nEach of these productions has two non-terminals, which will need to be expanded into the given string. So the string must be derived from one of these paths.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t35. So maybe nt73 starts with t35? Let me see what NT73 expands to.\n\nLooking at NT73 in the grammar: The productions are:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n- NT73 -> NT12 NT47\n- NT73 -> NT27 NT27\n\nWait, no, actually in the grammar, I see:\n\nLine 17: NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n\nLine 1: I think the first line is S -> NT73 NT20.\n\nThen in the NT73 rule, line 17: NT73 -> NT62 NT27, line 73 (but I think it's more about the NT73 rule). Wait, looking through the grammar, the lines are numbered, so let me see:\n\nLooking at the NT73 rule: Line 17: NT73 -> NT62 NT27. Is that correct? Or is there another NT73 rule?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, looking for NT73:\n\nLine 73 (assuming indexing from 1) or wherever, but the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the lines, I see line 17: NT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nBut also, in line 1: NT73 could be other rules? Or maybe no other rule for NT73. Hmm, perhaps I need to check all productions for each NTx.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the NT73 productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLine 17: NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n\nIs there another production for NT73? Let me check further. Hmm, looking through all the lines, the last line I see is NT55 -> 't17', but elsewhere, perhaps.\n\nWait, another line towards the end: Line 73: NT55 \u2192 't17'. Hmm, no. Wait, I might have to reorganize.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each NTx and their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a hierarchical breakdown.\n\nLet me try to find out which NTs derive into the given 't' tokens.\n\nStarting with the first token: t35.\n\nWhat do NTs expand into t35?\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NT35 rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT35 -> NT51 NT37 (line 63)\n\nNT35 -> NT51 NT37 again. Hmm, wait, let me check all the NT35 productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all NT35 productions. Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT35:\n\n- Line 13: NT35 -> NT51 NT37\n- Line 39: NT35 -> NT39 NT6 (line numbers might be off, assuming line starts at 1)\nWait, perhaps I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to trace the possible expansion from S.\n\nSince S can split into two non-terminals, perhaps the first token comes from one of them.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t35. So let's see which of the non-terminals, when expanded, start with t35.\n\nLooking into NT73 productions:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27 (line 17)\nNT73 -> NT12 NT47 (line 73, perhaps)\nNT73 -> NT27 NT27 (line, say, 27? Maybe not clearly, perhaps I need a more detailed list.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT rules.\n\nLet me start by listing all NTx and their productions:\n\nNT52:\n1. NT52 -> NT35 NT96\n2. NT52 -> NT80 NT47\n3. NT52 -> NT12 NT85\n\nNT73:\n1. NT73 -> NT62 NT27 (line 17)\n2. NT73 -> NT12 NT47 (line, let's see, perhaps another line like line 73)\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, I see NT73 on line 17 as NT73 -> NT62 NT27. Is there another production for NT73?\n\nLooking back, perhaps there are more. Wait, the grammar was:\n\nLine 17: NT73 -> NT62 NT27\nLine 73: ?\n\nWait, perhaps the numbering isn't sequential, but for the sake of this, let me try to identify all NT73 productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT73 only has one production: NT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nWait, no, looking further, in the grammar provided, after NT52's entries, I see NT73, but let me check all the lines to see if any other NT73 rules exist.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any other NT73 rules. So NT73 has only one production: NT73 -> NT62 NT27.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 from S can lead to NT62 NT27.\n\nThen, from NT73, it's NT62 and NT27.\n\nLooking at NT62 productions:\n\nNT62 -> NT35 NT96 (line, perhaps somewhere else)\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLine 26: NT62 -> NT35 NT96\nLine 15: NT26 -> NT95 NT96 (no, 26 is for NT26?)\nWait, perhaps I should look at NT62.\n\nNT62's productions:\n- Line 26: NT62 -> NT35 NT96\n- Line 44: NT62 -> NT... Wait, perhaps I need to scan for NT62.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT62 is on line 26: NT62 -> NT35 NT96.\n\nNT62 also appears on line 15? No, line 15 is NT26. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each NT and their productions properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can start reconstructing the string from the end.\n\nBut given the string is long, maybe a different approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the occurrence of certain tokens that can only be derived from specific NTs.\n\nFor example, some 't's only appear in specific rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, each 't' is in the terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nLine 27: NT55 -> 't17'\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal 't's and their corresponding NTs:\n\n- t10: NT99 and NT38\n- t11: NT11, NT49\n- t13: NT39, NT11, NT59 (no NT59?)\n- t14: NT68\n- t15: NT24\n- t16: NT44, NT99\n- t17: NT64, NT26, NT55, NT68, NT73, NT74\n- t18: NT73, NT95\n- t19: NT68\n- t20: NT4, NT20, NT27, NT36, NT68\n- t22: NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-807","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Alright, let's start by trying to understand what each part entails.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with a series of production rules. Each rule has a non-terminal on the left side and a combination of non-terminals and strings on the right side. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t18 t4 t29 t31 t31 t17 t36 t18 t31 t24 t29 t35 t24 t29 t35 t31 t24 t2 t33 t14 t18 t24 t29 t35 t6 t24 t20 t1 t18 t31 t36 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t11 t30 t31 t17 t31 t27`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules. \n\nLet me start by looking at the initial production rules for S:\n- S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n- S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the string starts with NT73 and NT20. Let's see if the string begins with t18, which could be derived from NT73 or NT20.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of NT73 and NT20, I see:\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT68\n\nNow, let's look at the string. The first token is t18. Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly gives t18 as a terminal. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, actually, I see that NT62 and NT26 can produce t33 and t2 respectively. There's a NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT96, and NT53 \u2192 NT12 NT85, but I don't see t33 or t2 appearing. Alternatively, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps it's better to break down the entire string and see if each step can be matched by the grammar's productions. Since the string is quite long, this might take some time.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each production in the grammar either replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string must be built up by replacing non-terminals step by step until we get all terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t18, which must come from some non-terminal production. Let's look at the possible rules that produce t18.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only t18 is under NT95 \u2192 t35, which doesn't help. Wait, no, under NT95, the rule is NT95 \u2192 t18, yes! So NT95 can produce t18.\n\nWait no, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT95, I see:\n\nNT95 -> t18\n\nYes, so NT95 \u2192 t18. So perhaps the first symbol t18 is from NT95.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, S can produce NT95 NT83. So S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the first symbols would be whatever NT95 produces and NT83 produces. Since NT95 can produce t18, let's see what NT83 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45.\n\nThen, NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63, and NT44 \u2192 t4. So NT22 \u2192 t4 NT63.\n\nWait, but NT63 is another non-terminal. Let's see what NT63 produces. From the rules, NT63 \u2192 t31 and NT29 NT2.\n\nWait, no, let me look:\n\nWait, NT63 is in multiple rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT63 \u2192 NT29 NT24. Then NT29 \u2192 t31, and NT24 \u2192 t24. So NT63 \u2192 t31 t24.\n\nSo, putting it together, starting from NT83:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45 \u2192 (NT44 NT63) NT45.\n\nWait, no, actually, NT83's rule is NT22 NT45, so each step is a production. So let's see:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63\n\nNT44 \u2192 t4\n\nNT63 \u2192 t31 t24\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52\n\nWait, wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should parse the string step by step, using the grammar rules to see if each part can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to create a parsing tree based on the string and the grammar. Since the string is long, I need to make sure each part is accounted for.\n\nThe string starts with t18, which is from NT95. So, the first part is NT95 producing t18, and the second part is NT83. Now, NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45. Then, NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63, and so on.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should count the number of symbols and see how they align with the productions.\n\nWait, each production in the grammar either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the number of terminals in a derived string must be one more than the number of terminals introduced by the productions. Hmm, not sure if that's directly useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that each correspond to a production step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83.\n\nIf we take S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the string starts with NT95 \u2192 t18, followed by NT83.\n\nNow, NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45. Let's see NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63, and NT44 \u2192 t4. So NT22 \u2192 t4 NT63.\n\nNT63 \u2192 t31 t24, so combining these, NT83 \u2192 t4 t31 t24 NT45.\n\nNow, NT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52 \u2192 t4 NT52.\n\nNT52 \u2192 various options, like NT35 NT96. Let's see NT35 \u2192 t3 or other options, but wait, NT35 can produce t3, t5, or t13, etc. Maybe not the right path.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that NT35 \u2192 t3, t5, etc., but perhaps the correct path is through other rules.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a way to traverse the entire string using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check each token against possible origins.\n\nLet me make a list of all the possible production rules that start with each terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nHere's a list of non-terminals and their possible terminal productions:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 t18\n- NT83 \u2192 t28 (if I remember correctly, but wait, from the rules: NT83 can produce t28? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, I see NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45, and in the rules, NT45 can produce NT44 NT52, which can produce t4 or other things. Wait, actually, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, another approach: in the rules, I see specific rules that have terminals on the right side. Let me list all of them.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n- NT62 \u2192 NT53 NT96\n- NT53 \u2192 NT12 NT85\n- NT12 \u2192 NT31 NT86 (Wait, no, looking back, I don't see NT12 producing terminals directly.

{"custom_id":"request-832","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have rules where each non-terminal (left-hand side) expands into two terminals or non-terminals on the right-hand side. The given grammar has a start symbol S which branches into two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the initial step is for S to produce either of these two combinations. Then, each of these NTs (numbered terminals?) need to be expanded further based on the rules provided.\n\nLooking at the NT symbols, some of them expand into other NTs, while others expand into strings starting with 't'. For example:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96\n- NT73 \u2192 NT12 NT47\n- NT95 \u2192 t18\n\nWait, so some NTs are terminal symbols ending with 't' followed by a number. Others are other NTs. So, the string we need to evaluate consists of these 't' followed by numbers, like 't18', 't31', etc.\n\nThe target string is: \n\n`t18 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t20 t1 t18 t24 t29 t35 t6 t6 t36 t17 t17 t2 t33 t0 t35 t17 t29 t18 t17 t20 t17 t18 t31 t6 t36 t27 t17 t6 t31 t30 t31 t17 t36 t17 t6 t24 t33`\n\nIt's a series of 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbols S starting with S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nLet me think about how the string is built. Each 't' is a terminal symbol. So, I need to reverse-engineer the derivation by seeing how the string can be split according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the top-level symbols: S can split into two parts. So each 'S' derivation would produce two parts, each of which is an NT.\n\nIn the target string, it's a single sequence, so it's possible that the entire string is the concatenation of two parts, each derived from S's two options.\n\nLet me first check the initial symbols 't18 t31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t20 ...' but wait, looking at the grammar, 't18' corresponds to NT95. So, if S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the first part would be NT95, which expands into 't18', and the second part is NT83, which then needs to expand into the remaining part of the string.\n\nSo, let's consider S \u2192 NT95 NT83. Then, NT95 \u2192 t18, so the first symbol is 't18'. Then, the next part comes from NT83. Looking at the grammar, NT83 can be expanded into NT22 NT45.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, after 't18', the next part is 't31 t29 t31 t11 t17 t20 ...'. Let's see what NT83 can produce. NT83 is 't28' according to the rules (from the given, NT83 \u2192 t28). But in the string, after 't18', the next symbols are 't31', which is 't29' in the next part. Hmm, this might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's list all the terminals:\n\nThe string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, each corresponding to a terminal symbol. Each such terminal must come from either a terminal rule or a non-terminal split.\n\nI think a better approach is to model the string as a series of steps where each step uses a grammar rule. Let's try to parse the string backward, using the CYK algorithm, but considering the grammar.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, it's Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is two symbols. The CYK algorithm is efficient for CNF, but given the string is long (64 symbols), it's a bit cumbersome. Alternatively, I can model this as a recursive descent parser or memoization.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to see how the string can split into subparts that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce two NTs. So the string should split into two parts, each generated by NT rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbol of the string: t18. According to the grammar, 't18' comes from NT95. So if the entire string is produced by S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the first part is 't18' and the second part is 't29 t29 t11 t17 t20 ...' which should come from NT83.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT83 can only be expanded into a terminal t28. So if the string after 't18' is 't29 ...', that can't be matching NT83, which only gives a single terminal symbol. So that suggests that the initial assumption that S is NT95 NT83 is incorrect, or that the entire string can't be derived this way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the other option: S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nSo, the first part comes from NT73 \u2192 t18, and the second part from NT20. Looking at the first symbol of the string: 't18' is from NT73, which is correct. Then the second part needs to come from NT20, which as per the rules, has a terminal 't17'.\n\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar rules, NT73 \u2192 t18 according to the last lines: NT73 \u2192 't36' in some cases, but I think I saw earlier that NT73 can also produce t18. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't36' was at one point, but later on, it's also \u2192 NT47 NT12, but wait, I think earlier entries for NT73 are:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- 'NT73 -> NT62 NT27'\n\nWait, but in one of the rules, it's written as 'NT73 \u2192 t36'?\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Looking at the rules again:\n\nLooking for NT73: yes, in the provided rules, there's 'NT73 -> NT62 NT27' and 'NT73 -> 't36'' perhaps? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nYes, in the grammar, 'NT73 -> 't36''. Wait, the rules are written with some mixing between '\u2192' and '\u2192 't''. For example, 'NT73 -> 't36'.\n\nSo, NT73 \u2192 't36' as a terminal, according to the rule: \n\nLooking the provided rules:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> 't18'\n- NT73 -> 't36'\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> NT62 NT27\n\nThen, towards the end:\n\n- NT73 -> 't36'\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Because earlier, NT73 can also produce two NTs.\n\nWait, the rules for NT73 are:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27\n\nAnd also, looking elsewhere:\n\n- Near the bottom, I see NT73 -> 't36'\n\nIs that a mistake? Or perhaps, NT73 can either produce two NTs or a terminal.\n\nIf that's the case, it's a bit confusing. Similarly, other NTs have both multi-symbol rules and terminal rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go step by step.\n\nLet me compile a list of each NT's production rules:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27, also (later) \u2192 t18, t36? Or perhaps 't36' is a typo, and it's a different NT.\n\nWait, in the given rules, looking at each line:\n\n- First line: S -> NT73 NT20\n\nSecond line: S -> NT95 NT83\n\nThen a series of lines:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96\n\nNT71 -> NT68 NT2\n\nNT39 -> NT51 NT37\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThen, some NTs expand into a single 't' followed by a number, like:\n\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n\n- NT38 -> 't29'\n\n- NT20 -> 't17'\n\n- NT44 -> 't4'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-826","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has several production rules, and the string in question is a sequence of symbols that might be generated by it. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar better. The start symbol is S, and it can produce two different options, each starting with NT followed by another number. So, S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83. That means whatever string we get must eventually be built from these two starting points.\n\nLooking at the first option, NT73 and NT20 are both non-terminals. NT73 has a production rule that leads to t36 and t35. Wait, no, let me check again. NT73 -> NT12 NT47, and NT47 can produce t27 or go further if there's another rule. Hmm, maybe I should trace down the productions step by step.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, I see that many of the NT symbols eventually produce terminal characters 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT55 -> 't17', NT64 -> 't17', etc. So each of these non-terminals eventually resolve to a terminal.\n\nThe string we're checking is a sequence like t35 t31 t29 t31 t11 t24... and so on, all the way to t17. The idea is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through some series of productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So each step in the derivation generates one non-terminal and replaces it with two others until the non-terminals can be replaced by terminals.\n\nBut the string is long: 41 symbols, each is a t followed by two digits, which might mean it's about 41\/2 = 20.5 steps deep if every step reduces the number of symbols by one. Actually, wait, no: in Chomsky normal form, each production can only expand a non-terminal into two others, so to reach a terminal string, each non-terminal must eventually produce terminals only.\n\nSo the first thing I'll do is check if the given string can be broken down into a series of non-terminals that produce two symbols each, recursively, until all that's left are terminals.\n\nBut this might be tedious given the length. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if certain symbols can only come from certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t35. Looking at the grammar, t35 is a terminal, and it's produced by some non-terminals. Checking, I see that:\n- NT35 -> t3 (rule 29)\n- NT39 -> t6 (rule 33)\n- NT8 -> t30\n- NT95 -> t35 (rule 22)\nSo t35 can come from NT35, NT95, or maybe others I'm missing. Wait, checking the provided grammar rules for NT35:\nLooking through the list, I see:\n- NT35 -> t3 (rule 29)\n- NT35 -> t5 (rule 33)\n- NT35 -> t13 (rule 39)\nSo t35 is produced by NT35, NT95, maybe others.\n\nThe first occurrence is t35. So maybe that's from NT35, which then splits into t3 and t13 or t5, but since the string starts with t35, it would have to produce it as a terminal, not as a combination.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the first split is S -> NT73 NT20. Let me see what NT73 and NT20 can produce.\n\nNT73 -> NT12 NT47 (rule 4)\nNT47 can either produce t27 or break down further: NT47 -> NT8 NT44\nWait, NT47 has another rule: NT47 -> NT49 NT26 (rule 16), and NT8 is 't30' (rule 17), and NT44 is 't4' (rule 26).\n\nWait no, looking back, the grammar rules provided are many, and I need to see which ones apply.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT47's productions:\nLooking through the rules, I find:\nNT47 -> NT8 NT44 (rule 14)\nand NT47 -> NT49 NT26 (rule 28)\nSo NT47 can split into two options. One is t30 (since NT8->'t30') and NT44->'t4' (rule 26). Alternatively, NT49 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, rule 47's production is: NT47 -> NT8 NT44 (rule 14) and NT47 -> NT49 NT26 (rule 28). So NT47 can be replaced by either t30 t4, or NT49 and NT26.\n\nBut I'm getting lost. Maybe it's better to draw out a parse tree or figure out the steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the entire string and see if each non-terminal can be found in the grammar and see if the entire string can be reduced step by step.\n\nBut that's a lot. Instead, perhaps I can look for any obvious inconsistencies. For example, if the string has a symbol that no non-terminal can produce, then it's impossible.\n\nLooking at the string: t35, t31, t29, t31, t11, etc. Let's check each symbol if it's a terminal or not.\n\nWait, all symbols in the string start with 't' followed by two digits. So they are all terminals because no NT symbol in the grammar directly produces a 't' except these that have rules ending with 't'. So each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal production.\n\nSo, the string is made by substituting non-terminals with terminals following the grammar rules.\n\nSo, each txxx in the string must be produced by some NT symbol. Now, checking if each of these t terms is directly produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, a lot of NT symbols directly produce ts:\n\n- NT55 -> t17 (rule 29)\n- NT64 -> t17 (rule ?? Wait, looking at the rules: \n\nActually, let me list all NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT38 -> 't36' (rule 85), 't26' (rule 19)\nNT22 -> 't14' (rule 22), etc. Wait, the user provided a lot of rules, I need to find which NTs directly produce txxx.\n\nLet me look through all the rules to see which ones are of the form NTx -> 't' something.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96 (rule 5)\nWait, no, that's a production to two non-terminals. Similarly, NT99 -> 't10' (rule ??): looking through the list, I find NT99 -> 't10' (rule 47), among others.\n\nWait, let me find all the NTs that have a production to 't' followed by two digits.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT55 -> 't17' (rule 29)\n- NT64 -> 't17' (rule 31)\n- NT26 -> 't20' (rule 10)\n- NT44 -> 't4' (rule 26)\n- NT68 -> 't0' (rule 25)\n- NT11 -> 't12' (rule 37)\n- NT35 -> 't3' (rule 29)\n- NT35 -> 't5' (rule 33)\n- NT35 -> 't13' (rule 39)\n- NT47 -> 't27' (rule 14)\n- NT83 -> 't28' (rule 46)\n- NT62 -> 't24' (rule 18)\n- NT53 -> 't11' (rule 15)\n- NT89 -> 't36' (rule 37)\n- NT6 -> 't88' via other rules...

{"custom_id":"request-848","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t18 t4 t29 t31 t11 t24 t2 t27 t0 t35 t24 t20 t33 t14 t35 t17 t20 t27 t14 t35 t31 t17 t20 t1 t18 t17 t36 t35 t31 t24 t29 t18 t31 t36 t17 t36 t33 t17 t6 t31 t27 t17 t6 t36`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. So the grammar here consists of only two types of productions: non-terminals deriving pairs of non-terminals or single terminals.\n\nThe starting symbol is S. Looking at the production rules, S can go to NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So the initial expansion must begin with either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83.\n\nSince the string starts with `t18`, I need to see which productions can result in 't18'. Looking through the rule for NT95, I see that NT95 \u2192 t18. Also, NT95 might be derived from other symbols. Wait, let me check: In the grammar, NT95 appears in NT99 \u2192 NT38 NT62, but NT95 is also a terminal. So NT95 can directly produce 't18'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT95 is a non-terminal, so to produce 't18', there must be a rule where NT95 \u2192 a. Checking the rules, yes, NT99 \u2192 't18'? Wait no: looking at the rules, I see:\n\nWait, the rules are a bit tricky. Let me list out the rules relevant to NT95:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't18' (I think I missed this earlier). Yes, in the very end, I see:\n\nNT95 -> 't18' is present. So there's a rule where NT95 directly produces 't18'.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't18'. So we can hypothesize that the first expansion is from NT95 \u2192 't18', meaning the first step is S \u2192 NT95 NT83, and then NT95 is expanded to 't18'.\n\nNow, after 't18', the next token is 't4'. So after the initial 't18', what comes next? Let's see.\n\nThe string is: 't18' 't4' 't29' ... So following 't18', the next is 't4'. Since 't4' is a terminal, which non-terminals can produce 't4'? Looking at the rules, I see NT49 \u2192 't23', NT44 \u2192 't4', NT49 \u2192 't3' and 't9', but also in other positions.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't11' (I see a rule: NT44 -> 't4', so NT44 \u2192 't4' as a terminal.\n\nSo perhaps after NT95 produces 't18', the next NT83 needs to produce 't4'. Let's check NT83's productions.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT83:\n\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\nNT83 -> NT24 NT20\n\nWait, but NT22 and NT24, etc. Since NT83 is a non-terminal, it must expand into other non-terminals until it reaches terminals.\n\nWait no, the production for NT83 is either:\n\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\nor\nNT83 -> NT24 NT20.\n\nSo to produce 't4', which is a terminal, we need a production step where in some expansion, a non-terminal becomes 't4'.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT44 \u2192 't4'. So perhaps NT83 must expand into NT44, which then produces 't4'.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nSuppose NT83 \u2192 NT44 NT20. Wait, no. Wait, according to the rules:\n\nIn the given grammar, the production for NT83 is:\n\nNT83 -> NT22 NT45\nand\nNT83 -> NT24 NT20.\n\nWait, but wait, in the provided rules, does NT83 have any direct terminal production? No. So to produce NT83 as a string, it must expand into two non-terminals, say A and B, which then further produce terminals and non-terminals until we get all terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't18' comes 't4', then 't29', etc. So perhaps after NT95 produces 't18', the next step is from NT83 \u2192 NT24 NT20.\n\nThen NT83 would expand into NT24 and NT20.\n\nNow, let's see NT24's expansion. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT24's production is:\n\nNT24 -> 't25' ?\n\nWait, no. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT24 directly tied to a terminal, except in the rule NT24 -> 't25'? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT24: I don't see NT24 in any rule. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, I think I might have misread some rules.

Looking at the grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all the non-terminals on the left have productions to other non-terminals or terminals on the right. \n\nThe string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, which I think are terminals. So each token in the string must correspond to a production that expands to exactly that terminal. To check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if each terminal can be derived from the start symbol S through the productions.\n\nStarting from S, which can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So the start string should begin with either NT73 or NT95 or combinations from their productions. \n\nWait, the string starts with t18 t31... Let me see how to break this down. Each pair of NT's should expand to two terminals, but looking at the first production S \u2192 NT73 NT20, which would mean the string should start with whatever NT73 and NT20 produce. Similarly for S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT73 has productions like NT62 NT27. So if S \u2192 NT73, then the first part would be the expansion of NT73. Let me try to see what NT73 can generate. From the rules, NT73 can go to NT62 NT27, then NT62 can go to NT49 NT6, and so on. Each step would produce a string of terminals, but it's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the entire string and see if it's a combination of expansions. Since each step in the grammar's derivation would involve splitting non-terminals into two parts, the string should be a sequence of terminals that can be split into pairs (or single terminals if there's any, but in this grammar, all non-terminals expand into two terminals except maybe some. Wait, looking at the grammar, most non-terminals have productions to two other non-terminals, but some have one terminal. For example, NT49 can produce 't3' or others. So each step would either produce two non-terminals or one terminal. But the string given is entirely terminals. That suggests that in the derivation, all the non-terminals would have to expand directly to terminals, without any splitting steps that leave non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of 42 tokens, which is 42 terminals. Since each step in the grammar can produce two non-terminals or one terminal, the number of terminals in the string would be equal to the number of steps where a non-terminal becomes a terminal, plus the number of steps where two non-terminals become two terminals. So the total number of terminals is the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is equal to the number of steps where non-terminals produce terminals, but that might not directly give me the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, ensuring each token can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the first token: t18. Which non-terminal can produce t18? Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 't10'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3', 't5', 't6', 't13'\n- NT89 \u2192 Not seeing it. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, checking the productions:\n\nLooking for NT->t18. Checking all rules:\n\nYes, I see NT99 \u2192 't10' not t18. Wait, let me go through each production to see if any gives t18.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 't28' (twice: to NT38 and others), so no.\n- NT35 \u2192 't3', 't5', 't13'\n- NT99 \u2192 't10', 't16', 't23', 't27', 't37', 't36', etc.\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't9', 't12', 't22'\n- NT64 \u2192 't17', which is t17, but not 18.\n\nHmm, where does t18 come from? Wait, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t18. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules provided, the ones that produce 't' are:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 't10', 't16', 't23', 't27', 't36', etc. I don't see t18 here.\n- NT38 \u2192 't29', 't31', 't35', 't24', 't28', 't20', 't17', etc.\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't9', 't12', 't22'\n- NT83 \u2192 't28' only once.\n- NT37 \u2192 't31', 't55', etc.\n- NT82 \u2192 't5'\n- NT47 \u2192 't27'\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\n- NT84 \u2192 't1'\n- NT35 \u2192 several 't' options, but no 't18'.\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT2 \u2192 't22'\n- NT4 \u2192 't11'\n- NT26 \u2192 't20'\n- NT24 \u2192 't25'\n- NT17 \u2192 't17'\n- NT31 \u2192 't31'\n- NT0 \u2192 't0' but probably not relevant here.\n\nWait, there's no production of any non-terminal that directly produces 't18'.

{"custom_id":"request-864","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that most rules are in the form of two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except some are terminals. For example, `NT38 -> 't36'` is a terminal production. This means the leaves of the derivation tree will be these terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: `t35 t4 t29 t31 t31 t17 t36 t35 t17 t29 t35 t24 t20 t17 t35 t6 t24 t29 t18 t31 t36 t17 t24 t29 t35 t24 t29 t35 t31 t6 t11 t27 t17 t36 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t17 t2 t17 t18 t31 t36`.\n\nMy goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step splits a non-terminal into two others, and each terminal is a leaf. This suggests that the string's length can help in some way, but more importantly, since CNF grammars are easy to parse, perhaps I can parse the string using a method suitable for CNF, like the CYK algorithm, or check if it's a leftmost derivation.\n\nBut given the string is quite long (let's count the tokens: 56 tokens), processing it via a full parser might take some time, but since I'm just evaluating, maybe I can find a way to split the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be constructed by the non-terminals step by step. Let me first list all the productions and terminals to see if I can find a way to build the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, non-terminals on the left include S, NT35, NT52, NT71, NT68, etc., and terminals include 't35', 't4', 't29', etc. I need to see how the string can be formed from S.\n\nThe string starts with `t35`. Looking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals can produce 't35'. For example:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3' (but not 't35', so that's not it)\nWait, looking again:\n\nWait, the productions showing 't35' are:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT38 -> 't36' (multiple times)\n- NT49 -> 't9'\n- NT99 -> 't10'\n- etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the productions, I don't see any production for 't35' directly. Let me check:\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see `NT38 -> 't36'` multiple times, `NT49 -> 't3'` etc., but `t35` is not a terminal. Instead, the non-terminals that can produce 't35' are:\n\nWait, no, the productions only produce 't's with two-digit numbers, like 't35' as in NT35 -> 't3', but that's single digits. Wait, that can't be. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Looking carefully, the productions do not have any terminal 't35'. Instead, the terminals are things like 't3', 't4', etc. Wait, the string given has a lot of these, but no 't35'. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is 't35', but looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't35' as a terminal. All the terminals are like 't3', 't4', 't29', etc. So this seems contradictory. If the string has 't35' but the grammar doesn't have a production that generates it, then the string can't be derived from the grammar. So is that the case?\n\nLet me double-check. The string starts with 't35', but in the grammar, looking at all the productions, the terminals are things like 't3', 't4', 't29', 't31', 't17', etc., but there's no 't35' defined as a terminal.\n\nWait, this is important. If the grammar doesn't have a rule that generates 't35', then any occurrence of 't35' in the string would immediately make it impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar. So in this case, the string starts with 't35', which would mean that to generate this string, the grammar must have a production for a non-terminal that can produce 't35', but looking through all the productions, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't35' as a terminal. Instead, all the terminal symbols are single characters with small numbers.\n\nTherefore, 't35' cannot be generated by this grammar, making the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps 't35' is a production from a non-terminal, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't35' directly or as part of a chain.\n\nFor example, let's look at the rules starting with NT35:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3' and 't35' \u2192 Wait, no, looking back at the grammar provided:\n\nLooking closely, the last line of the grammar is:\n\nNT85 -> 't36' , etc. So checking all the rules, the only terminals are single-digit or two-digit like 't17', 't24', etc., but I don't see 't35' as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar rules, I see lines like:\n\nNT55 -> 't17'\nNT38 -> 't36'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT38 -> 't29'\nNT2 -> 't17'\nAnd so on. But nowhere do I see a rule that says NT35 -> 't35' or any NT that directly produces 't35' as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string 't35' cannot be part of any derivation from this grammar, making the answer 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-867","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the productions, making it easier to apply certain parsing techniques. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. The start symbol is S, which can produce various combinations of non-terminals (NT). The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols (t) and non-terminals (like NT, t). \n\nI notice that each production in the grammar is a single non-terminal expanding into exactly two other symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. This matches the structure required for a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, with B and C being non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe given string is: t18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t24 t29 t35 t6 t17 t2 t17 t35 t24 t2 t17 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t36 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t36 t17 t31 t23 t20 t17 t6 t11 t27.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can apply the CYK algorithm, but maybe a simpler approach is possible given the structure.\n\nFirst, I'll check the overall structure. The start symbol S can produce two NTs, each of which might eventually produce sequences of terminals. From the grammar, S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nI'll need to see if the string can be derived from either of these. To do this, I can try to break the string into parts that correspond to each production.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t18, which is a terminal. I'll check which rules produce 't18'. Scanning the grammar, I see NT95 -> 't18' from the rule NT95 -> t18. So, 't18' can only come from NT95. \n\nWait, no, looking again, the rules:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n- NT95 -> 't18'\n\nSo, if 't18' is the first symbol, it must come from NT95. So, the first step is to have the first NT being NT95.\n\nSo, the first symbol 't18' comes from NT95. Therefore, the first part of the derivation is S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, I need to split the string. Since S is NT95 followed by NT83, the string is split into two parts: the substring before NT83 and NT83 itself.\n\nWait, but NT95 can produce 't18' and possibly more symbols if it's part of a larger production. Wait, in this case, since a production for NT95 is 't18', it can only produce that single terminal. So, if the first symbol is 't18', it must be from NT95, and thus the entire production NT95 -> 't18' must be used. Therefore, the entire production for S would have to include NT95 producing 't18' and NT83 producing a sequence that should follow.\n\nWait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Instead of trying to parse forward, perhaps I can work backwards from the start symbol and see if I can match the string.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to manually construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nGiven the starting non-terminal S, which can be NT95 or NT73 NT83 or other possibilities, but given the first symbol is 't18', which is from NT95 -> t18. So S must produce NT95 and NT83.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with 't18' from NT95, and the rest of the string after 't18' should be produced by NT83.\n\nWait, but wait, the production for S is S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83. So if S is NT95 followed by NT83, then the entire string must be a combination of NT95's expansion and NT83's expansion.\n\nBut NT95's expansion is just 't18', so the first part is 't18' and the remaining string after 't18' should come from NT83's expansion.\n\nSo, the remaining string is: t31 t29 t31 t31 t24 t29 t35 t6 t17 t2 t17 t35 t24 t2 t17 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t36 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t36 t17 t31 t23 t20 t17 t6 t11 t27. Wait, actually, that's not correct, because the original string is after 't18', so we need to see if the rest can be generated by NT83.\n\nWait, let me start over. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it's possible to derive this sequence from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven S can expand into two NTs. Since the first symbol is 't18', which is a terminal, it must come from a non-terminal that can derive that symbol. Looking at the grammar, NT95 -> 't18' is the only production for a non-terminal that starts with 't18'. So, the first NT must be NT95.\n\nThus, the string is 't18' followed by the rest, which should be derived by NT83, because S is NT95 followed by NT83.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT95 NT83.\n\nNow, the string becomes: 't18' + [remaining string after 't18'].\n\nThe remaining string is: t31 t29 t31 t31 t24 t29 t35 t6 t17 t2 t17 t35 t24 t2 t17 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t36 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t36 t17 t31 t23 t20 t17 t6 t11 t27.\n\nWait, but this is getting too long. Maybe I should find where 't18' occurs again in the remaining string. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the remaining string, I see 't18' occurs at position ... Let me count.\n\nThe entire string after 't18' is: t31 t29 t31 t31 t24 t29 t35 t6 t17 t2 t17 t35 t24 t2 t17 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t36 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t36 t17 t31 t23 t20 t17 t6 t11 t27.\n\nWait, no, the initial string is: t18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t24 t29 t35 t6 t17 t2 t17 t35 t24 t2 t17 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t36 t18 t31 t31 t27 t17 t6 t24 t33 t17 t36 t17 t31 t23 t20 t17 t6 t11 t27.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing myself.

This means that each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nThe starting symbol is S. So, any valid string derivation starting from S must follow the production rules in such a way that the entire string can be broken down into terminals, and non-terminals can be recursively replaced.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT73 NT20\n2. S \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo the first step is to choose one of these two productions and derive the string from there. \n\nI notice that the string starts with `t18`, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I check which non-terminals directly produce terminals. \n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n- NT73 can produce 't36' or other non-terminals.\n- NT95 can produce 't18' directly (NT95 -> 't18').\n\nWait, let me confirm. The production NT95 \u2192 't18' is present in the grammar. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, if I choose the second production S \u2192 NT95 NT83, then the first symbol in the string must be the result of deriving NT95 and NT83. Since NT95 can directly produce 't18', that's a good start.\n\nNow, the next symbols are `t4 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t1 ...`. I need to see how these can be produced by the RHS of the grammar rules.\n\nBreaking down the problem, I should consider how each 't' is generated by the grammar. Maybe building a parse tree would help, but it's quite large. Alternatively, I can check if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the RHS of some productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to look for the lengths. The string has 54 symbols. Each production either expands to two symbols (non-terminals) or directly to a terminal. Since each production step replaces a non-terminal with two, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n - 1 for some n, but the given string has 54 symbols, which is even. So, maybe it's possible if there are some terminals in the string.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So, the string starts with NT95 and NT83.\n\nNT95 can produce 't18' directly, so we have 't18' as the first symbol. Now, the remaining string after 't18' is `t4 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t1 ...` (43 symbols left). The next part comes from NT83.\n\nLooking at NT83's productions:\n- NT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT83 \u2192 NT38 NT24\n\nI need to see which of these can generate the next symbols `t4 t29 t4 t31 ...`.\n\nWait, let's check NT83's possible RHS:\n\nFirst, NT83 can be split into NT22 and NT45, or NT38 and NT24.\n\nIf I choose NT22 and NT45, let's see:\n\nNT22 can produce 't20' or other non-terminals? Wait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63 or NT26 NT63. Neither directly produce 't4' or 't29'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT83's production NT38 NT24:\n\nNT38 can produce 't29' (from NT38 \u2192 't29').\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT26 NT20, which can further split into terminals and non-terminals. But if I have NT38 producing 't29' directly, maybe that's possible.\n\nWait, no: According to the grammar under NT38, one of the productions is NT38 \u2192 't29'. Yes, that exists.\n\nSo, if NT83 uses the production NT38 NT24, then NT38 can produce 't29' and NT24 can produce something else.\n\nBut wait, the next symbol after 't18' is 't4', which would have to come from NT24.\n\nLooking at NT24's productions: the grammar doesn't have any production for NT24 except maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, it seems that NT24 doesn't have any production where it's on the LHS. Instead, perhaps NT24 is on the RHS of some other productions.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me look at the RHS symbols and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with 't18' from NT95, then followed by 't4', 't29', 't4', 't31', etc.\n\nWait, after 't18', the next part is 't4 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t1 ...'. So, the string after 't18' is:\n\nt4 t29 t4 t31 t24 t2 t1 t18 t17 t29 t18 t24 t36 t35 t6 t6 t11 t27 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36 t17 t17 t29 t35 t17 t29 t18 t31 t6 t31 t27 t17 t31 t3 t2 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t36\n\nSo, the first symbol after 't18' is 't4', which would have to come from some production.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, perhaps NT45 can produce 't4' directly?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT45 has a production NT44 NT52. But I don't see NT45 directly producing 't4'. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT52 \u2192 various options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a NT44 production.\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, the term for NT45 is:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52\n\nAnd NT44 \u2192 't4'. So, if NT45 can produce 't4' when combined with another symbol, but in the string, after 't18' comes 't4', which would have to come from the first symbol of the RHS of a production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT44 can produce 't4' directly. But according to the provided grammar, NT44 \u2192 't4' is a terminal. So perhaps NT44 is a production that can produce 't4' directly. But in the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 't4' is one of the productions under NT44.\n\nWait, but looking at the provided grammar, under NT52 we have 't7' as one of the productions. But under NT44, we have NT44 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, looking for NT44:\n\n- NT44 is part of several productions, for example: NT68 \u2192 NT44 NT6, and NT44 \u2192 't4', and NT64 \u2192 't17', etc. So yes, NT44 can produce 't4' directly.\n\nSo, if I take NT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63, then in the string after 't18', 't4' could come from NT44 \u2192 't4'. That would mean we have 't18' \u2192 NT95 producing 't18', then NT83 using the production NT22 NT45 or NT38 NT24.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline this properly.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT95 NT83, which gives us 't18' (from NT95 \u2192 't18'), then NT83 must derive the rest of the string after 't'. So after 't18', the next symbols are '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-892","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, I think.\n\nAlright, let's look at the grammar first. It has a start symbol S, and from what I can see, S is rewritten into two non-terminals: NT73 and NT20. So S \u2192 NT73 NT20. Then each of those NTs is further rewritten into other NTs or terminals. The string we need to evaluate is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. I wonder if the grammar uses numbers as part of the rules, but in the given string, they seem to be terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar has rules like NT52 \u2192 NT35 NT96, but some of the rules have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, looking through the rules, I see lines like NT38 \u2192 't36', NT44 \u2192 't31', etc. So some of the non-terminals directly produce these 't' followed by a number. That's going to be important.\n\nThe string to check is: \n\nt18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t24 t36 t35 t17 t2 t33 t14 t35 t17 t20 t33 t14 t35 t6 t17 t36 t35 t6 t6 t31 t27 t17 t36 t17 t17 t29 t18 t6 t6 t36 t33 t17 t24 t33 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t36 t27.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S \u2192 NT73 NT20. So the derivation must start with NT73 and NT20. Each of these must produce a substring that when combined forms the given string. \n\nLet me see what NT73 and NT20 can produce. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27 (rule 7)\nWait, I think I might have misnumbered. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nLooking for NT73: In the list, the relevant one is line 77, but when I look more closely, I see:\n\nNT73 is defined in line 76: NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nSo NT73 can only produce NT62 and NT27. Then, what do those non-terminals produce?\n\nLooking at NT62: there are multiple rules. Let me scan through the grammar for NT62. \n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT62 appears in line 101: NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36\n- Line 107: NT62 \u2192 NT26 NT24\n- Line 110: NT62 \u2192 NT27 NT43 (Wait, I don't see NT43 in the given rules. Maybe I miscounted.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules to find where NT62 appears. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking for NT62:\n\n- Line 44: NT44 \u2192 't31' (Not relevant)\n- Line 101: NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36\n- Line 107: NT62 \u2192 NT26 NT24\n- Line 108: NT24 \u2192 't25' (So NT24 is a terminal now)\nWait, no, line 101 is NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36. Then, NT24 is further rewritten? Wait, looking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT47 (line 44)\nBut then line 101 says NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36, which would then become NT24 and NT36.\n\nWait, let me try to map it out.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT73 NT20.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nThen NT62 can go to NT24 NT36, or NT26 NT24, or other rules if any. Wait, in the given rules, line 101 is NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36, line 107 is NT62 \u2192 NT26 NT24, and line 108 says NT24 \u2192 NT47. But looking further, line 101 is NT62 \u2192 NT24 NT36, which is one step.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have all the rules correctly. I think it's better to list all the NTs and their productions to see possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the given string step by step, checking if each token can be matched by the grammar.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps looking for the structure of the string and seeing if it can be split into parts that fit the productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nIt starts with t18. Let's look at the rules for t18. From the list, I see:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 't35' (line 99: t35)\n- NT9 \u2192 't10' (line 89: t10)\n- NT10 \u2192 't10' (possibly, line 22: NT44 \u2192 t31, not relevant. Wait, I think I need to check where 't18' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the lines that produce 't*' are:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t36 (line38: t36)\n- NT44 \u2192 t31 (line44: t31)\n- NT68 \u2192 t14 (line68:t14)\n- NT26 \u2192 t20 (line26:t20)\n- NT49 \u2192 t3 (line49:t3)\n- NT64 \u2192 t17 (line64:t17)\n- NT99 \u2192 t10 (line99:t10)\n- NT38 \u2192 t29 (line38:t29)\n- NT22 \u2192 t11 (line22:t11)\n- NT47 \u2192 t27 (line47:t27)\n- NT82 \u2192 t5 (line82:t5)\n- NT38 \u2192 t31 (line38:t31)\nWait, I'm likely misindexing the lines, but the key is that each rule can produce a terminal 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, t18 must be produced by some NT. Looking through the list, I don't see an NT directly producing 't18'. Wait, that's a problem. Because the given string starts with 't18', but in the grammar, none of the production rules directly produce 't18' as a terminal. So unless I'm missing something, that's a deal-breaker.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the rules again. Let me scan the list for any 't18'.\n\nIn the rules provided:\n\n- Line 44: NT44 \u2192 't31' (t31)\n- Line 82: NT82 \u2192 't5' (t5)\n- Line 109: NT88 \u2192 't28' (t28)\n- Line29: NT26 \u2192 't20' (t20)\nWait, so 't18' is not directly produced by any rule. So how can the string start with 't18'?\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach is correct, and the answer is 'No' because the grammar doesn't produce 't18'. But I'm not sure, maybe I misread.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the non-terminals produces 't18' indirectly. But looking at the rules, none of the NTs directly produce 't18'. So, the string cannot be derived from the grammar because it starts with a 't18' that's not produced by any rule.\n\nWait, but I have to be careful. Maybe I'm misnumbering the lines. Let me go through the grammar more systematically.\n\nLet me list all the NTs and their productions, focusing on the terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules for each NT:\n\n- NT52: several productions, none are terminals except line 52: NT52 \u2192 't17' (line55: NT55\u2192t17)\nWait, no: looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at lines in the grammar, each line defines an NT and its right-hand side. So for each NT, I have to see if any of its rules produce a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. Wait, no terminals here. So NT73 can only produce more NTs, not terminal symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-904","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it's structured in a way that makes it easier to apply algorithms like the CYK parsing algorithm. However, since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S. The rules for S are:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo, S generates two NT terms, each of which is another non-terminal. I'll need to break these down further until I reach terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers. Each terminal corresponds to a specific production rule, so I'll need to map them.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t35 t31 t29 t31 t31 t24 t20 t33 t0 t18 t24 t29 t18 t24 t36 t18 t24 t29 t18 t31 t17 t2 t17 t35 t24 t36 t35 t31 t24 t36 t35 t31 t11 t30 t4 t17 t36 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t36 t33.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the possible derivations from S. Since S splits into NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83, the string must be divided into two main parts, each corresponding to one of these splits.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it can be split into two parts that each match the respective parts of S. The first part would be from the beginning up to the split point, and the second part would be from the split point to the end.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, this might take a while. Alternatively, I can think about the structure of the grammar and the possible sequences that can lead to the terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to build the parse tree from the terminals upwards. Let's consider each terminal as part of the tree. Since the grammar has CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nI'll list out all the grammar rules and their corresponding terminals to see possible matches:\n\n- NT73 -> t36 (from S's first rule)\n- NT95 -> t18\n- NT83 -> t28\n\nSo, the first part of S can lead to t36 t28, but the string starts with t35... so maybe this isn't the case. Let's see the other branch:\n\nS can also split into NT95 (t18) and NT83 (t28), so S can generate t18 t28, but the string starts with t35, which doesn't match. Therefore, perhaps the string comes from a different combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should map every NT to its possible terminals to see where they can fit.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each NT can lead to multiple terminals. For example:\n\nNT52 -> NT35 NT96, which can lead to t3 (NT35) and t20 (NT96), so NT52 can produce t3 t20.\n\nSimilarly, NT39 -> NT51 NT37, which can lead to t9 (NT51) and t13 (NT37), so t9 t13.\n\nWait, but this might take a lot of time. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be split into chunks that match the possible productions.\n\nAnother thought: the grammar is quite extensive, and the string is long, so perhaps the string corresponds to multiple splits and merges. Maybe the CYK algorithm is the way to go, but doing it manually.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be broken down into the components that the grammar can produce. For instance, looking at the start symbol S -> NT73 NT20 or S -> NT95 NT83.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT73 can produce several possibilities, like t36 or t3 t21 (I need to check all rules for each NT). Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT73 -> NT62 NT27\nNT62 -> NT36 NT53\nNT36 -> NT24 NT20\nNT24 -> t25\nNT53 -> t11\nSo NT62 becomes t24 t20, and NT27 -> t33 or something else? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, NT27's production... actually, I think I need to go step by step for each NT. Let me make a list of all NTs and their possible productions:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-908","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is all tokens separated by spaces, and each token is a literal. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and a single non-terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, the only way a terminal can appear is through a production that directly emits a terminal (like S \u2192 a), but looking at the given grammar, I see that most non-terminals produce other non-terminals. However, some have productions that end with terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are these rules where NT... produces a terminal followed by another NT or sometimes just a terminal by itself? Wait, no. All the productions seem to have two non-terminals except for some like S \u2192 NT... followed by something. Wait, the S productions are S \u2192 NT73 NT20 and S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So S expands to two non-terminals, each of which may expand further into two non-terminals or eventually into terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals: t35, t4, t29, etc. So each token in the string must be generated directly by a production rule.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But in the given grammar, do any non-terminals produce terminals directly? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, some have terminals:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't31'\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT80 \u2192 't7'\n- NT73 \u2192 't36'\n- NT38 \u2192 't29' (wait, this is conflicting, NT38 has two rules, one produces 't36' and another 't29')\n- NT2 \u2192 't22'\n- NT4 \u2192 't16'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3' and 't13'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3' and 't9'\n- NT46 \u2192 't24'? Wait, looking back, some other parts. Wait, there's NT99 \u2192 't10', etc.\n\nWait, so some non-terminals produce a terminal followed by another terminal? Or is it directly a terminal?\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So if a non-terminal A has a production A\u2192a, that's fine. If it has A\u2192aB, that's not CNF. So in this grammar, all productions must have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see some rules like NT38 \u2192 't36', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT44 \u2192 't31' etc. But other rules, like NT38 \u2192 NT26 NT20, are non-terminals. So some non-terminals produce terminals, and others produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the presence of NT38 having two rules complicates things. For example, NT38 can produce 't36' or NT26 NT20. That might mean that there are multiple ways to produce the same terminal. But for the given string, I need to trace a derivation that exactly matches the sequence.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if these can be derived from the grammar. To do this, I can attempt to parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that each step expands non-terminals correctly.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for repeated patterns or see if the string fits any known derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each element in the string must be produced directly by the grammar, either through a terminal production or through a production that can be followed by others to reach that terminal.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string:\n\nt35 t4 t29 t4 t31 t24 t20 t17 t18 t31 t24 t29 t35 t6 t24 t29 t18 t6 t17 t29 t18 t6 t17 t20 t33 t14 t35 t6 t17 t29 t35 t6 t6 t24 t33 t17 t36 t17 t36 t17 t24 t33 t17 t36 t33.\n\nSo the string has 36 tokens. Each token must be derived via the grammar.\n\nLet's see which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\n- t35: Looking at the grammar, NT35 can produce 't3', 't13', etc. So I'm not sure how to get t35 from a single NT35. Wait, looking for where t35 appears. Wait, in the string, it's the first token. So I need a production that leads to t35. Looking through the rules, none of the NT35 produce 't35' directly. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong thing.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT35's rules produce terminals that match 't35' in the string. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NT35 rules are:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT37\n- NT35 \u2192 NT39 NT55\n\nWait, so NT35 can only expand into other non-terminals, not terminals. But the string has 't35' as the first token, which is a terminal. So that's a problem because according to the grammar, there's no production for NT35 that ends with 't35'. Therefore, it's impossible for the grammar to produce 't35' as the first symbol because NT35 can't directly produce 't35'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Did I make a mistake in looking for rules? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see any rule where NT35 directly produces 't35'. The NT35 rules are NT35 \u2192 NT49 NT37 and NT35 \u2192 NT39 NT55. So both of these are non-terminals, meaning NT35 can't directly produce 't35'. Therefore, 't35' can't be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a longer path where NT35 expands into something else. Wait, no, because 't35' is a terminal, and the production would need to terminate at that point. But since all rules for NT35 produce non-terminals, there's no way to get to 't35' unless one of those non-terminals can produce 't35'.\n\nSo, for example, if NT49 can produce 't35' somehow. Looking at the rules for NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT11 NT6, NT49 \u2192 NT23 NT26, NT49 \u2192 NT64 NT90, etc. None of these are 't35'. Or maybe through more expansions. But then, to reach 't35', it would have to go through multiple steps, but each NT49 step doesn't have a 't35' terminal. So it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the first token 't35' cannot be produced by this grammar because NT35 can't directly produce it, and there's no way for the grammar to terminate at 't35' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules. Perhaps there's a direct rule for some NT producing 't35'? Looking again:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, the only ones with terminals are:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't36'\n- NT44 \u2192 't31'\n- NT55 \u2192 't17'\n- NT80 \u2192 't7'\n- NT73 \u2192 't36'\n- NT38 \u2192 't29'\n- NT2 \u2192 't22'\n- NT4 \u2192 't16'\n- NT68 \u2192 't14'\n- NT11 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT46 \u2192 't24'?

{"custom_id":"request-930","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Let's list out the production rules:\n\n- S -> NT73 NT20\n- S -> NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the start symbol S generates either NT73 and NT20 or NT95 and NT83. Each of these NT symbols, like NT73, NT95, etc., are non-terminals that eventually resolve to some combination of terminals or other NTs. \n\nLooking at the list of NT rules, each seems to break down into two NTs until we get down to some NTs that have terminal tokens. For example, NT73 -> NT62 NT27, and so on. But eventually, some of these NTs produce terminal strings like 't18', 't31', etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t17 t29 t18 t17 t36 t35 t17 t20 t17 t35 t17 t20 t1 t35 t31 t24 t29 t35 t17 t36 t35 t31 t6 t36 t33 t17 t36 t27 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t11 t30 t4 t17 t24 t2 t17 t35 t31 t36`.\n\nThat's a long string! Let me try to parse this by seeing if each 't' token can be traced back through the grammar. Starting from the beginning, the first token is 't18'. Looking at the grammar, I need to see if any NT production rule ends with t18. Scanning the rules, I find:\n\n- NT95 -> t18\n\nSo, 't18' comes directly from NT95. That's a good sign.\n\nNext token is 't31'. Looking through the rules, I see that some NTs produce t31. For example:\n\n- NT24 -> t25? Wait, no. Looking back, I think I might have gone wrong there. Let me check the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, 't31' comes from NT44: NT44 -> t4? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, NT44 -> t31 because in the rules I see:\n\nWait, no, let me look at the list again. I notice that NT4 -> 't11', NT64 -> 't17', NT26 -> 't20', etc. Hmm, actually, 't31' occurs in multiple NT productions:\n\n- NT88 -> 't31'\n- NT27 -> 't33'\n- NT44 -> 't4' and 't11' and 't24'? Wait, looking back, the rules for NT99, NT49, etc., produce various 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let's analyze each token one by one, starting with 't18':\n\n1. 't18' comes from NT95 as specified.\n2. Next, 't31': Looking for NT that produces 't31'. Let's see, NT88 -> 't31' and NT55 -> 't17', etc. Hmm, perhaps NT55 is involved here. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's better to build a parsing tree or see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to check if each 't' in the string can be generated by some NT rules. But perhaps a more efficient way is to see if the entire string can be generated by expanding S.\n\nGiven that S can generate either (NT73, NT20) or (NT95, NT83). Let's try to see if the given string can be produced by either of these.\n\nThe string starts with 't18', which is produced by NT95. Then, the second token is 't31'. Looking for the right NT for 't31':\n\nLooking through the grammar, 't31' appears in NT52 where NT52 -> NT80 NT47, and in the production for NT64? Wait, I think I need to list all the NTs that generate 't31'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT26 -> 't20'\n- NT44 -> 't4' and 't11', etc. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for 't31' in the given substitution rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look through each rule in the grammar to see which NTs produce 't31':\n\nLooking at the rules, let me check:\n\n- NT52 -> NT80 NT47\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6 but NT11 produces 't12', not 't31'.\n- NT80 -> NT71 NT99, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to look at the list provided:\n\nLooking at the grammar productions, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> t36\n- NT44 -> t4, t11, t24\n- NT68 -> t14\n- NT11 -> t12\n- NT35 -> t3, t13\n- NT49 -> t3, t9\n- NT64 -> t17\n- NT99 -> t10, t29, etc.\n- NT26 -> t20\n- NT44 -> 't4', 't11', 't24'\n- Wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at each token in the string and see if it can be generated by any NT.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nGiven the string:\n\nt18 t31 t29 t31 t31 t17 t29 t18 t17 t36 t35 t17 t20 t17 t35 t17 t20 t1 t35 t31 t24 t29 t35 t17 t36 t35 t31 t6 t36 t33 t17 t36 t27 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t11 t30 t4 t17 t24 t2 t17 t35 t31 t36\n\nLet's start by mapping each 't' to possible NTs.\n\n1. t18 -> NT95 (from NT95 -> t18)\n2. t31 -> Let's see which NTs produce t31.

Let me recheck the rules:\n\nScanning through the rules again:\n\n- NT24 -> 't25'? No.\n- NT44 has several rules, like NT44 -> NT53 NT2, NT44 -> 't4', NT44 -> 't11'.\n- NT88 -> NT38 NT24, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs that directly produce 't' values:\n\n- NT95 -> t18\n- NT44 -> t31? Let me check: NT44 has a production that leads to 't31'? Hmm, looking at the rules: I don't see 't31' as a direct result of NT44. Wait, the production for NT44 includes:\n\nWait, no. Looking at the rules, I don't see 't31' for NT44. Let's look elsewhere:\n\nLooking through, I find:\n\n- NT52 -> NT80 NT47\n- NT49 -> NT11 NT6 (t12), etc.\n- NT80 -> NT71 NT99\n- NT48? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-932","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string to check whether it belongs to the language generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, every production either yields two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems to be in CNF. All the rules are either production of two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT73 NT20, where NT73 is a non-terminal, and 't7' or similar seem to be terminals. Wait, actually, I notice that some rules have a mix where one side is a non-terminal and the other is a terminal, like NT88 \u2192 't28' or NT26 \u2192 't20'. Hmm, that might complicate things because in CNF, you can't have mixed productions unless the terminals are single characters.\n\nBut maybe I should treat terminals as single symbols, so each terminal is a single 't' followed by a number. So, 't7' is a terminal, and NT99 is a non-terminal. So, each rule either has two non-terminals or one terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a series of terminals separated by spaces. Let me write it out as a sequence:\n\nt18, t4, t29, t31, t31, t17, t36, t35, t24, t29, t18, t17, t29, t18, t24, t20, t17, t35, t31, t6, t11, t27, t17, t6, t36, t17, t6, t36, t17, t17, t36, t35, t6, t17, t2, t1, t18, t6, t6, t36, t17, t36, t17, t31, t12, t27, t36, t2.\n\nFirst, I need to parse this string to see if it can be generated by the given grammar. Parsing in CNF usually involves using a top-down approach, where we apply the productions starting from the start symbol and see if we can derive the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't18', so we can look for a production that has 't18' on the right-hand side. Let's check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT95 \u2192 't18'. So, 't18' is the expansion of NT95.\n\nSo, the first symbol comes from NT95.\n\nNow, looking at the production for NT95: In the given grammar, I see NT95 \u2192 NT39 NT39. So, NT95 can be replaced by two NT39s.\n\nSo, the next step is to expand NT39.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT39 \u2192 NT51 NT37.\n\nSo, NT39 becomes NT51 and NT37.\n\nNow, looking at NT51 and NT37.\n\nFirst, NT51: From the grammar, NT51 \u2192 NT64 NT90.\n\nThen, NT64 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT64: The production is NT64 \u2192 NT24 NT95.\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Let's see if I can map each symbol step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all the symbols and see if each can be derived from the grammar, step by step, ensuring that each step only uses productions in CNF.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a stack-based approach or recursive descent parsed, though that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a parse tree.\n\nStarting with the string: t18 t4 t29 t31 t31 t17 t36 t35 t24 t29 t18 t17 t29 t18 t24 t20 t17 t35 t31 t6 t11 t27 t17 t6 t36 t17 t6 t36 t17 t17 t36 t35 t6 t17 t2 t1 t18 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t17 t31 t12 t27 t36 t2.\n\nLet me look for the start symbol S. S can be derived from NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. Let's see which one can generate the string.\n\nBut given the string's length, I wonder if it's too long to parse manually. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if any symbol isn't covered.\n\nWait, let's look for symbols that don't have a production to a terminal. For example, if any symbol in the string is a non-terminal, but in this case, all symbols on the string are terminals, as they start with 't'.\n\nIn the grammar, some non-terminals expand to two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every terminal in the string must be the result of some non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, let's see which terminal correspond to which non-terminals:\n\n- 't18' comes from NT95.\n- 't4' is in the rules? Let me look: Ah, NT49 \u2192 't3', but where's 't4'?

Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT53 \u2192 't23', but where is 't29' coming from?\n\nWait, checking:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't24' (from NT52 \u2192 't24'), and 't29' is not directly a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

The string I need to evaluate is `t35 t4 t29 t31 t11 t17 t20 t1 t18 t31 t24 t29 t18 t17 t29 t18 t17 t36 t35 t6 t17 t36 t18 t6 t24 t36 t18 t31 t11 t3 t20 t17 t36 t17 t6 t36 t27 t17 t17 t29 t18 t6 t6 t36 t17 t36 t17 t31 t27`.\n\nFirst, I should remind myself that a grammar in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar has a mix of non-terminals on the left side and terminals (like 't35', 't4', etc.) on the right side. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce NT73 NT20 or NT95 NT83. So, S starts the generation. Then each of these NTs can have their own productions. For example, NT73 can produce NT62 NT27, and so on, until the non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is recursive descent parsing. For each NT, I can look up its productions and see if I can build the string step by step. But since the string is quite long, it might take a while, especially since I don't know the exact derivation path.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts and see if they match any possible expansions in the grammar.\n\nThe string begins with 't35 t4 t29 ...' Let's see what could generate 't35'. Looking at the grammar, I see that T35 (if that's what it is) has a few productions. Oh wait, in the grammar, NT35 has some rules: NT35 -> NT13 NT3 (from the given production rules), but I'm not sure if that's 't3' or something else. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT35 -> ... t3? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT35 -> NT13 NT3 (or something with t3?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, the list of rules is quite long. Let me scan for any NT that produce 't35' directly. Looking through the productions:\n\nYes, there is NT45 -> NT2 NT95, and NT45 -> NT44 NT52, but I don't see any NT going directly to t35. Wait, but looking more carefully, under NT35, the productions are:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT35 -> NT13 NT3\n\nBut does this produce t35? No, because that's a non-terminal.

Alternatively, maybe some other NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check for each 'tX' in the string: each 't' is a terminal, so for each t in the string, I need to see if any non-terminal can produce it in one step.\n\nLooking at the string: the first t is t35. So which NT can produce t35? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT13: Let me see if it has any rule producing t35. Looking through the rules, perhaps NT13 is being used in a production of another NT. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, I can write down all possible NTs and the terminals they can produce.\n\nBut that's a lot. Alternatively, let me check each t in the string and see if any NT can produce it.\n\nFor example, the first t is t35.

Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT35: its productions are NT13 NT3. So NT35 is a non-terminal that can only produce more non-terminals, so that can't produce t35 directly.\n\nWait, then perhaps t35 comes from some other NT.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, there's only a few that produce terminal:\n\nLooking back:\n\nWait, in the given rules:\n\nNT55 -> 't17'\n\nNT44 -> 't4'\n\nNT67 (Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-949","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token seems to be something like 't18', 't31', etc. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That might help because parsing algorithms for CNF grammars can be more efficient, but I'm not sure if I need to use those here since I'm just assessing a single string.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that the start symbol is S, and it has two productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT73 NT20\nS \u2192 NT95 NT83\n\nSo, the entire string can be viewed as starting from either NT73 followed by NT20 or NT95 followed by NT83.\n\nNext, I need to see how these non-terminals expand into the terminals. Each NT... token seems to have its own production that breaks down into other NTs or terminals. For example, NT73 can produce NT62 and NT27, which then can further break down until we get to a terminal like 't36'.\n\nBut looking at the string provided, it starts with 't18 t31 t29 t31 t11 t6 t17 t2 t17 t18 ...'. I think each of these tokens corresponds to the result of applying the productions step by step.\n\nI realize that this might involve building a parse tree where the root is S, and the leaves are the terminals. The challenge is to trace the string back up to S using the productions.\n\nStarting with the first few tokens:\n\n- 't18' might come from NT73 \u2192 ... \u2192 't18'? Looking at the productions, NT73 can produce NT62 NT27, which then can further expand. Wait, looking at the end of the productions, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't36'. Is that correct? Or maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the provided productions, for example, NT73 is present in multiple rules, but towards the end, there are NT73 \u2192 't36' and another rule for NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27.\n\nSo, for NT73, it can either produce a terminal or break down further. The terminal 't36' is one possibility, but it's also part of a larger chain.\n\nWait a second, the string starts with 't18 t31 t29 t31 t11 t6 t17 t2 t17 t18 ...'. So perhaps each token corresponds to a step in the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a series of expansions and reductions. Perhaps we can work recursively, checking if each part of the string can be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The string starts with 't18', which might come from some non-terminal. Looking at the productions, NT35 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't3', but not sure if that's relevant.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to parse the string step by step. Let's take the string and see if it can be constructed by applying the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t18 t31 t29 t31 t11 t6 t17 t2 t17 t18 t24 t36 t35 t24 t2 t17 t18 t24 t2 t1 t18 t31 t17 t20 t1 t18 t31 t36 t17 t6 t36 t33 t17 t17 t36 t18 t6 t17 t20 t27 t14 t18 t31 t36 t17 t36 t33 t17 t36.\n\nThis is a long string, but maybe I can take the first few tokens and see.\n\nThe first token is 't18'. Where does 't18' come from? Looking through the productions, I see several where a non-terminal equals 't18', like NT73 \u2192 't36' (wait, no) or looking again, perhaps I need to check if any non-terminal expansions result in 't18'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nI see NT73 \u2192 't36' (once) and also NT73 \u2192 NT62 NT27. NT62 is another non-terminal, and looking at the productions, NT62 \u2192 NT36 and also NT62 \u2192 't24'. Hmm, so NT62 can produce 't24' or break down further.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the initial symbols are S \u2192 NT73 NT20 or S \u2192 NT95 NT83. So, let's see:\n\nFirst option: NT73 and NT20.\n\nNT73 can produce 't36' or break down into NT62 and NT27.\n\nIf NT73 produces 't36', then NT20 must produce the rest of the string. But the first token is 't18', so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, NT73 could produce NT62 and NT27. Then, NT62 can produce 't24' or break down further, and NT27 could produce 't36' or break down.\n\nBut the first token is 't18', which isn't matching 't24' or 't36'. So maybe the first production is not NT73.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial production is NT95 and NT83.\n\nLooking for 't18' in the string, let's check if any production leads to 't18'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT22 NT45.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT44 NT63.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT44 NT52.\n\nNT52 appears multiple times. Let's follow that.\n\nNT52 \u2192 options include 't80', 't71', 't12', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since this is time-consuming, maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, most non-terminals seem to expand into two other non-terminals, except some that expand into terminals like 't18', 't31', 't29', etc.\n\nSo each step, a non-terminal can either be a terminal or split into two non-terminals. Since the string length is long, maybe I can check if the string can be built by combining the possible expansions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to check if all the terminal tokens in the string are covered by the productions.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\nFirst, 't18' must come from some non-terminal. Looking for 't18' in the productions:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nNT99 \u2192 't10', 't22', 't29', etc.\n\nLooking for 't18' production:\n\nI see NT90 \u2192 NT38 NT95.\n\nNT38 \u2192 't28', 't6', etc.\n\nBut I don't see any direct 't18' production, except perhaps through a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all the possible terminals and see which ones are allowed.\n\nLooking for 't18', looking at the productions, perhaps NT62 \u2192 't24' and NT62 \u2192 NT36.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake because it's possible that a non-terminal can produce two terminals, but in the provided productions, most non-terminals end in either a terminal or another split.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if every token in the string is covered by some production. For example, looking at the first token 't18', does any production produce 't18'?

{"custom_id":"request-973","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar rules and the string.\n\nThe grammar rules are all starting from S and have various productions. My string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, like `t18 t31 t29 ... t24 t33`. Each symbol is either a number or a two-letter abbreviation like NTxx.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the grammar to see how it generates the string step by step. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. So, every step in generating the string should replace a non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals), reducing the number of symbols by one each time.\n\nLet me note that the string is 57 symbols long. Starting with S, each production replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. Therefore, the length of the string must be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of productions needed. For example, n=6 would give 63 symbols, n=5 gives 31, etc. Wait, 2^6 -1 is 63, but our string is 57. Hmm, that suggests it might not be possible because 63 is the maximum length with 6 productions. However, perhaps there's a different path with fewer steps. Alternatively, maybe some steps produce terminals without increasing the length. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each production is non-terminal -> two symbols, which can either be non-terminals or terminals. So each production step increases the string length by 1.\n\nThe initial string length is 57, which is 2^6 -1 = 63 is not matching. 2^6 is 64, 64-1=63. So perhaps the string is longer than that, but maybe I've miscounted.\n\nWait, let's count the string correctly. The string is:\n\nt18 t31 t29 t4 t11 t6 t24 t29 t35 t17 t20 t17 t18 t17 t2 t27 t0 t18 t6 t17 t36 t35 t31 t36 t17 t17 t29 t35 t6 t17 t29 t35 t31 t24 t33 t17 t24 t33 t17 t24 t29 t35 t31 t11 t30 t31 t17 t11 t30 t31.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens here. It's a bit tedious, but I'll do it step by step:\n\nStart from the beginning:\n\n1. t18\n2. t31\n3. t29\n4. t4\n5. t11\n6. t6\n7. t24\n8. t29\n9. t35\n10. t17\n11. t20\n12. t17\n13. t18\n14. t17\n15. t2\n16. t27\n17. t0\n18. t18\n19. t6\n20. t17\n21. t36\n22. t35\n23. t31\n24. t36\n25. t17\n26. t17\n27. t29\n28. t35\n29. t6\n30. t17\n31. t29\n32. t35\n33. t31\n34. t24\n35. t33\n36. t17\n37. t24\n38. t33\n39. t17\n40. t24\n41. t29\n42. t35\n43. t31\n44. t36\n45. t17\n46. t17\n47. t29\n48. t35\n49. t6\n50. t17\n51. t29\n52. t35\n53. t31\n54. t24\n55. t33\n56. t17\n57. t24\n58. t33\n59. t17\n60. t24\n61. t29\n62. t35\n63. t31\n64. t11\n65. t30\n66. t31\n67. t17\n68. t11\n69. t30\n70. t31.\n\nWait, that's 70 tokens. Hmm, that's a problem because 2^n -1 for n steps needs to be at least 70. 2^7 =128, so 127. So 7 steps. But perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has variables, but that doesn't make sense since it's all terminals. So I think it's 70 tokens, but the length can't be 70 because each production step can increase the string by 1. Starting with S: 1 symbol. Each step adds 1. So for 70 tokens, we need 70-1=69 steps. But if each step can produce two symbols from one, the minimum length would be 2^n. So 2^n \u224870, which is 2^6=64, 2^7=128. So 70 is between 64 and 128, which would require 6 to 7 steps, but the exact number would require a different approach.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the initial string isn't correctly aligned with the grammar. Maybe the structure is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to build the string step by step, using the productions to expand S until I reach the string.\n\nBut that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can reverse the process: take the given string and see if it can be reduced to S using the grammar rules, working backwards.\n\nEach rule is of the form A->BC, so in reverse, each terminal pair BC can be replaced by A. Alternatively, each symbol can be part of a BC that can be replaced.\n\nLooking at the string, I need to find possible BC pairs that match any production, then reduce them, and see if I can get down to S.\n\nBut considering the string is 70 tokens long, this approach could take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a pattern or a part that repeats which can be identified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for certain terminals that appear frequently and see if they can be part of the same non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that 't18' appears several times. Let's look at where t18 occurs:\n\nt18 appears at positions 1, 13, 18, 44, 60, 66. So that's 6 times. Since each production splits a symbol into two, the number of times a non-terminal is present in the string should be log2(length). Hmm, but this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering that t18 is produced by certain rules. For example, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking up the rules where 't' symbols are produced:\n\nFrom the grammar rules, I see:\n\nS -> NT73 NT20\nS -> NT95 NT83\n\nAnd in the terminal replacements:\n\nNT99 -> 't10'\n\nNT62 -> 't24'\nNT53 -> 't11'\nNT96 -> 't20'\nNT64 -> 't17'\nNT68 -> 't14'\nNT11 -> 't12'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT63 -> 't29'\nNT99 -> 't10'\nNT35 -> 't5'\nNT11 -> 't37'\nNT95 -> 't35'\nNT82 -> 't5'\nNT83 -> 't28'\nNT37 -> 't31'\nNT95 -> 't35'\nNT8 -> 't30'\nNT64 -> 't24'\nNT26 -> 't20'\nNT49 -> 't9'\nNT88 -> 't28'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT84 -> 't1'\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT20 -> 't17'\nNT96 -> 't27'\nNT88 -> 't27'\nNT9 -> 't10'\n\nWait, maybe I should make a list of all the 't' terms and see which NT they come from:\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' is a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a specific form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and either a terminal or a non-terminal on the right, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a start symbol S and several non-terminal symbols (NTs) and terminals (t followed by numbers). Each non-terminal can be expanded into two other symbols, which could be other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with 't18', 't4', 't29', etc., and ends a bit later. The string is quite long, so I need to see how it can be broken down into the grammar's rules.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parse reduces two non-terminals into the next. The string has 47 tokens, which is an odd number, but the number of steps required to parse would be log2(n) where n is the number of terminals. However, 47 is 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 +1, which might complicate things, but maybe it's manageable.\n\nI should start by mapping the string's tokens to the possible non-terminals.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Alternatively, perhaps 't18' is a result of some non-terminal. Let me check the production rules for each NT leading to terminals.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I see that some produce terminals like 't3', 't5', etc. Wait, perhaps I missed 't18'. Let me go through each production:\n\nYes, looking at NT73: two rules, one is NT73 -> 't36' and another NT73 -> 't36', but I don't see 't18' there either.
