{"custom_id":"request-3","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the given string 't3' is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a series of productions, and I have to check if 't3' can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. The string to be checked is 't3', which is a single terminal symbol, so I need to see if any production directly introduces 't3' or if it can be reached through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are several productions where terminals appear on the right-hand side. Each of these terminals might be part of the derivation chain. The goal is to trace a path from S to 't3' using these productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the productions from S are:\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\nI'll need to see if either of these can lead to 't3'. Let's explore both options.\n\nFirst, take S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded. I'll check if either NT68 or NT63 can produce 't3' or lead to that.\n\nLooking at NT68's productions:\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT62\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18 (though this seems unrelated)\nWait, actually, NT68 is a non-terminal that can be broken down further. Let's track each step.\n\nBut maybe it's more efficient to look for immediate productions that lead to 't3'. Alternatively, I can check if any of the non-terminals directly produce 't3' or have a production that eventually produces it.\n\nLooking through the list of non-terminals, I notice several that directly produce 't3':\n- NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13\n- NT81 \u2192 NT78 NT97\n- NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me go back.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals end with 't' followed by a number. For example:\nNT75 \u2192 't1'\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT38 \u2192 't3'\nNT26 \u2192 't2' (but that's 't2')\nNT33 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT38 \u2192 't3'\nNT62 \u2192 't5' (no, NT62 is actually broken down into NT66 NT62 elsewhere; I think that was a mistake in my initial search.)\n\nWait, let's look for all the terminals in the productions.\n\nI see the following direct productions (terminals on RHS):\n- NT67 \u2192 't2'\n- NT94 \u2192 't1'\n- NT22 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\nWait, no, some of these are actually productions where non-terminals are on the RHS, except in some cases.

Let me check. Hmm, line 24: NT75 \u2192 't1', line 39: NT47 \u2192 't5', line 59: NT84 \u2192 't4', etc. Actually, I see that NT94 \u2192 't2' which is in line 22).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some.

{"custom_id":"request-4","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string in question is \"t0\". Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form means. It's a way to structure context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for certain algorithms, like the CYK parsing algorithm, but I don't know if I need to use that here.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it starts with S and has several production rules leading down to terminals (like 't*0', 't*3', etc.) and non-terminals. My task is to see if \"t0\" can be derived from S through some series of production steps.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. The first rule for S is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So S produces two non-terminals, NT68 and NT63. To derive \"t0\", which is a terminal string, both of these must eventually produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT68, in the grammar, I see that NT68 \u2192 't3'. So NT68 can directly produce 't3'. Now, NT63 is the other part. Let's see what NT63 produces. Checking the rules, I see NT63 \u2192 NT0.\n\nSo now I need to see what NT0 produces. From the grammar, NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. Both of these are non-terminals. Let's check NT48 and NT47.\n\nNT48 \u2192 't3', so that's a terminal. NT47 has several production rules. Looking at it: NT47 can produce NT85 NT13, NT28 NT22, NT0 NT52, or NT63. But wait, NT47 is the one from NT63, so I'm a bit confused here. Let me trace back.\n\nWait, okay, so starting from S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3' (terminal). NT63 \u2192 NT0.\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. NT48 \u2192 't3'. NT47 can have several options. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT47's options: NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13, NT28 NT22, NT0 NT52, or NT63. But I have to see if any of these lead to a terminal.\n\nLooking deeper, for example, NT85 \u2192 NT18 NT8. Wait, let's check NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38. Or NT66 (since NT66 is also a rule, but I don't see NT66 being terminal. Wait, let me check all the terminals listed.\n\nWait, from the list provided, NT66 is written as NT66 \u2192 't3', so NT66 is terminal. Oh wait, in the production rules, I see NT66 \u2192 't3'. So NT66 is a terminal. So where does NT47 go?\n\nWait, NT47 has a production NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13. Let me check NT85's production: NT85 \u2192 NT18 NT8. Then NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38, and so on. This seems complicated, but maybe I can look for a path where NT47 can produce a terminal string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should trace the entire path from S to see if \"t0\" can emerge.\n\nWait, starting over: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 't3' NT63.\n\nSo we have 't3' followed by NT63. From NT63, the production is NT0, so now it's 't3' followed by NT0.\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47 \u2192 't3' followed by NT47.\n\nNT47 can be split into options:\n1. NT85 NT13\n2. NT28 NT22\n3. NT0 NT52\n4. NT63\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Maybe I should look for a path that leads to a terminal quickly. Let's try one path.\n\nOption 1: NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13.\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT18 NT8.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT1 NT50 \u2192 wait, NT50 has a production? Let me check the list: NT50 is mentioned in a rule: NT50 \u2192 't3'. So NT50 is terminal.\n\nWait, looking back: Yes, in the terminal list, NT50 \u2192 't4', wait no. Wait in the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see NT50 directly. Wait, the terminal list at the end includes NT50 \u2192 't3', but wait, let me check the actual rules.\n\nWait, the list provided includes:\n\nNT50 \u2192 't3' (assuming that's the case). So NT50 is terminal.\n\nSo let's see: NT50 \u2192 't3', so that's a terminal.\n\nBut going back to NT47's first option:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13.\n\nThen NT85 \u2192 NT18 NT8.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38.\n\nBut NT38 can be split into NT12 NT44 or other options. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the options from NT47 can lead directly to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the fourth option: NT47 \u2192 NT63. But NT63 \u2192 NT0, which leads back to NT0, which seems like a loop, so that's probably not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second option: NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT60 NT69.\n\nNT60 can produce NT68 NT18. Let's see NT68 as before.\n\nBut wait, this is getting too deep. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see if \"t0\" can be derived directly from S.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So S begins with NT68, which produces 't3', so the string would start with 't3'. Therefore, the string \"t0\" can't be \"t3\" followed by something else. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S is the start symbol, and we're trying to derive the string \"t0\". Let's see if any of S's productions can lead to \"t0\".\n\nLooking at S's first production: NT68 produces 't3', so that would give us a string starting with 't3'. Then NT63 \u2192 NT0. So the string would be 't3' followed by whatever NT0 produces. NT0 \u2192 't3' (from NT48) and NT47. So 't3' followed by NT47. If NT47 could produce something that leads to \"t0\", but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the second production of S is NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't3' (since NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14 \u2192 NT60 \u2192 't5', but wait I'm getting lost here. Let me check NT64: From the rules, NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. NT60 \u2192 't5', NT14 \u2192 't2'. So NT64 produces 't5' followed by 't2', which is 't5t2'. But that doesn't help because the string is \"t0\".\n\nSo from S's productions, both options (NT68 NT63 and NT64 NT78) lead to starting with 't3' and 't5t2', respectively. Neither of these directly help to get \"t0\".\n\nWait, this might suggest that \"t0\" can't be derived from S. But I should make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from NT63, after producing 't3' via S\u2192 NT68 NT63, and then NT63 \u2192 NT0, and then NT0 \u2192 't3' and 't47'. If 't47' can produce 't0', then \"t3t0\" would be the string. But that's \"t3t0\", not \"t0\".\n\nWait, but the question is about \"t0\", not \"t3t0\". So unless \"t0\" is a terminal and can be reached in another way, perhaps via S's production, which it doesn't seem so.\n\nWait another thought: If S can produce \"t0\" directly, but looking at the grammar, S starts with NT68 or NT64, so I don't see S directly producing a terminal string. So unless there's a way to derive S into \"t0\" through multiple steps, which I don't see.\n\nAnother approach might be to look if there's a path from the start symbol S to \"t0\" through the grammar.

Each production is of the form A -> BC, except for the start symbol S, which only appears on the left side, but in the grammar it's defined in terms of other non-terminals, so I think S is the start symbol and all others are non-terminals until they produce terminal symbols, which are 't's and numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string `t5 t4` and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The string has two tokens: t5 and t4. Since t5 and t4 are terminals, I need to find a sequence of productions that result in these tokens.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are S -> NT68 NT63 and S -> NT64 NT78. So S splits into two non-terminals, either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nNow, let me look for rules that produce t5 and t4. Scanning the productions, I notice that NT34 -> NT1 NT78, and NT38 -> NT12 NT44, etc. Wait, but that's not t5 or t4. Looking more carefully, I see NT9 -> t5, NT24 -> t0, etc. Wait, no, the actual rules are like NT3 -> t4, NT9 -> t5, NT8 -> t5, etc. Wait, let me list the productions for NT that produce t's:\n\nFrom the given productions:\nNT3 -> 't4'\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT24 -> 't0' (But I'm looking for t5 and t4)\nWait, let me check each:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t5:\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT90 -> NT2 NT60, which eventually leads to t's, but in the final rules, NT90 produces NT2 and NT60. Wait, but in the given detailed productions, NT9 -> 't5', right.\n\nSimilarly, for t4:\nNT3 -> 't4'\nNT19 -> 't3' etc., wait no.\n\nWait, in the detailed list, I see NT3 -> 't4' and NT39 -> 't0', but looking for t4:\n\nNT3 -> 't4'\nNT58 -> 't3'\nWait, no. Let's check each rule:\n\nLooking for NT -> 't5':\nNT9 -> 't5'\n\nLooking for NT -> 't4':\nNT3 -> 't4'\n\nSo, in the string `t5 t4`, we have t5 followed by t4. That suggests that the derivation ends with NT9 (producing t5) followed by NT3 (producing t4). But how do we get to NT9 and NT3?\n\nLet me see how the non-terminals can produce those. So, to get t5 and t4, we likely have NT9 -> t5 and NT3 -> t4. But how do these NTs get generated?\n\nLooking at NT9, its production is: Looking through the list, I see NT99 -> NT72 NT55, NT85 -> NT58 NT28, etc. Wait, let me find NT9's production. Hmm, wait in the given productions, is there a rule for NT9? Let me scan:\n\nAh, I see NT9 -> 't5' directly. So NT9 is a rule that directly produces t5. Similarly, NT3 -> 't4'. So to get `t5 t4`, we need a production where NT9 and NT3 are children of some parent NT, but looking at the grammar, all productions are terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, every production is of the form A -> BC unless it's the start symbol. So to get t5 and t4, we must have a production where a non-terminal A splits into B and C, which eventually produce t5 and t4 when all non-terminals are expanded.\n\nSo, let me think about this. The entire string is `t5 t4`, which is two terminals. So we need a derivation that starts from S, through a series of productions, to produce these two terminals.\n\nWait, no. Because S is S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78. So S produces two non-terminals, which each may produce more, ultimately leading to a string of terminals.\n\nWait, let me see what each of those produces. Let's take S -> NT68 NT63. Let's see what NT68 and NT63 produce.\n\nLooking at NT68: I don't see a direct production for NT68 in the given list. Wait, in the list, let me check:\n\nAh, there's NT68 -> t3, right. Because I see NT66 -> t3, NT65 -> t5, etc. Wait, here's a relevant part:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT68 is derived from other rules? Wait, no. Wait, in the detailed productions, I see something like NT60 -> NT68 NT18. Wait, but that's a production from NT60.\n\nWait, the NT68 production isn't directly listed except in some cases. Let's check:\n\nLooking for NT68, I see in the list:NT60 -> NT68 NT18. But that's a production, so NT68 is part of that rule. Wait, no: NT60 is replaced by NT68 and NT18, but NT68 itself is not replaced directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NT productions:\n\nLooking through the given list:\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\n\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14\n\nNT68: Not directly replaced, but appears in NT60.\n\nWait, NT60 is replaced by NT68 and NT18, but NT68 and NT18 haven't been replaced yet. So perhaps we can chain through these to find if t5 and t4 can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S -> NT64 NT78, NT64 is replaced by NT60 NT14, and NT78 is replaced by NT33 NT66.\n\nWait, let's try to build the derivation step by step.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT68 NT63. Let's see what NT68 and NT63 produce.\n\nNT63: Looking through the rules, I don't see a direct production for NT63. Wait, in the detailed list, I see NT33 and others, but not NT63. Wait, maybe NT33? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, I see NT63 -> NT84 NT62 from the list. Yes, so NT63 is replaced by NT84 and NT62.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT68 NT63 leads to NT68, NT84, NT62.\n\nNow, NT68: Is there a production for NT68? Looking through the list, I see NT60 -> NT68 NT18. So NT68 is part of NT60, which is not directly replaced. Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT64 NT78. Let's explore this.\n\nNT64: production is NT60 NT14.\n\nNT78: production is NT33 NT66.\n\nSo S becomes NT60 NT18 (from NT64's replacement) and NT33 NT66 (from NT78).\n\nNow, NT60 -> NT68 NT18, so NT60 is replaced by NT68 and NT18.\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Let me map it out step by step.\n\nStarting with S (start symbol):\n\nS -> NT64 NT78 (Rule 2)\n\nSo, S becomes NT64 and NT78.\n\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14 (Rule in the list: NT64 -> NT60 NT14)\n\nSo NT64 is replaced by NT60 and NT14.\n\nSimilarly, NT78 -> NT33 NT66 (Rule: NT78 -> NT33 NT66)\n\nSo now, S becomes NT60 NT14 NT33 NT66.\n\nNext, we process NT60, NT14, NT33, NT66.\n\nNT60 -> NT68 NT18 (Rule: NT60 -> NT68 NT18)\n\nSo NT60 becomes NT68 and NT18.\n\nNow, NT68 is a non-terminal; let's see what it becomes.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT68, except in the list where NT68 is involved in another production, but not as a head.\n\nWait, the detailed productions show that NT60 -> NT68 NT18, but not NT68 -> something.\n\nHmm, that's a problem because if NT68 isn't replaced, it will never produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-9","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the string \"t2 t1\" is generated by the given context-free grammar, which is in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's see. Chomsky normal form means all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string has two terminal symbols, \"t2\" and \"t1\". \n\nFirst, I should probably try to figure out how to reach \"t2 t1\". Each \"t\" corresponds to certain productions. Let me look through the productions to see which NTs lead directly to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So S starts by generating two non-terminals. If both of these can derive the required terminals, maybe \"t2 t1\" can be generated.\n\nLet's take the first path: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Now, NT68 can derive \"t2\" and NT63 can derive \"t1\"? Let me check.\n\nFrom the production list, NT68 \u2192 NT83 NT56. Wait, no \"t\" symbols here. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I look correctly? Wait, let me check NT68 again. No, in the list, NT68 is S -> NT68 NT63, but looking for NT68's productions, I don't see it in the list. Wait, maybe I missed something? Oh, wait, in the list, the NT68 isn't explicitly listed except as a source in S. Wait, looking through all the NTs, NT68 isn't listed except maybe as a target. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, the non-terminals (NTs) listed are NT68, NT63, NT62, NT48, NT0, etc. So NT68 is one of the non-terminals. Now, looking for NT68's productions, I don't see an explicit one in the list. Wait, the user listed all the productions, so perhaps NT68 isn't a terminal, it's a non-terminal. So maybe NT68 produces other things. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT68 isn't listed except as a target in S. Wait, maybe I need to check if NT68 has any productions. Hmm, in the list provided, I only see NT68 in S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but looking through all the other NTs, I don't see any NT68 being produced by other NTs. So maybe NT68 can only produce itself, but since it's a non-terminal, it must have a production. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the list, NT68 is only present in S and the production S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Are there any further productions from NT68? Let me scan the entire list. Oh, I see NT84 \u2192 NT62 NT69, but that's different. Similarly, NT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93, but again, not NT68. It seems that NT68 doesn't have any other productions except appearing in S. So perhaps this is a problem because NT68 isn't defined further\u2014it can only produce itself, but that leads to an infinite loop, which isn't useful. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NTs. Are all the NTs listed as separate entries? For example, the list starts with S first, but then all the NTs are listed. I can see NT68 being used in S, but it's not further defined. That suggests that NT68 doesn't have a production rule, which is a problem because in Chomsky normal form, every non-terminal must have a production. So perhaps it's a typo, but I have to proceed assuming that NT68 isn't further defined, which might mean that S \u2192 NT68 NT63 can't proceed because NT68 can't be replaced, making it impossible to derive terminals from S. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would stuck because NT68 can't be expanded.\n\nSo let's check the other initial production for S: S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Now, NT64 and NT78. I need to see if these can derive \"t1\" and \"t2\" respectively, or vice versa. Because the string is \"t2 t1\".\n\nLet's look at NT64. I don't see NT64 in the list except as a source in S. Wait, let me scan the list. NT64 \u2192 something? No, in the list provided, there's NT64 produced by NT64 is not listed except as part of S. Unless I'm reading it wrong. Wait, the list is:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT64: does it appear as a target? Let me see: no, the list doesn't have NT64 except in S. So NT64 can only produce itself, but that's a problem for the same reason as NT68.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the list, the NTs are: NT68, NT63, NT62, NT48, NT0, etc. So S is the start symbol, and the other NTs are being used. But NT64 is part of the production S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So to expand S, we need NT64 and NT78. If NT64 and NT78 are non-terminals, they need to have productions.\n\nLooking at NT64: Is there a production for NT64? Scanning through the list, I don't see any line where NT64 is on the left side. So that means NT64 only has the production in S, which is S \u2192 NT64 NT78. That's a problem because NT64 and NT78 are non-terminals but don't have other productions. So if the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each non-terminal should have exactly two productions, but in this case, S is using NT64 and NT78 as non-terminals without providing other productions. That's not standard CNF, which usually requires all non-terminals to have exactly two productions. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the non-terminals are only the ones on the left-hand side of the productions. Let me list all the unique non-terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions, the non-terminals are:\n\nNT68, NT63, NT62, NT48, NT0, NT81, NT47, NT38, NT12, NT19, NT52, NT78, NT22, NT74, NT33, NT18, NT98, NT1, NT90, NT88, NT45, NT62, NT97, NT33, NT94, NT74, NT94, NT18, NT58, NT81, NT34, NT94, NT72, NT17, NT81, NT18, NT49, NT15, NT1, NT27, NT47, NT89, NT24, NT39, NT42, NT60, NT99, NT24, etc.\n\nWait, some are repeated. So all unique non-terminals are:\n\nNT68, NT63, NT62, NT48, NT0, NT81, NT47, NT38, NT12, NT19, NT52, NT78, NT22, NT74, NT33, NT18, NT98, NT1, NT90, NT88, NT45, NT97, NT72, NT17, NT34, NT94, NT89, NT42, NT60, NT99, NT27, NT47, NT85, NT26, NT77, NT39, NT44, NT34, NT47, etc. Hmm, getting a bit messy.\n\nSo, for each non-terminal, I need to find where they appear on the left side of a production.\n\nLooking back, the production S \u2192 NT64 NT78 was the second option for S. But looking for NT64 and NT78 in the list. Did they have any productions? Let's see.\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nLooking for NT64 as a leading NT: I don't see any line starting with NT64. Similarly, looking for NT78 on the left: there's NT22 \u2192 NT62 NT74, NT74 \u2192 NT34 NT85, NT22 \u2192 NT62 NT74... Wait, I don't see NT78 on the left.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and how it works.\n\nFirst, I see that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left and has two non-terminals or terminals on the right. Each rule produces exactly one element, either a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's `S`. The rules for `S` are `S -> NT68 NT63` and `S -> NT64 NT78`. So, from `S`, we can derive two possible combinations. Let me write out these two possibilities:\n\n1. `S \u2192 NT68 NT63`\n2. `S \u2192 NT64 NT78`\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT68, NT63, NT64, NT78) will have their own production rules. I'll need to see how these non-terminals can produce the desired string parts: `t2`, `t4`, and `t4`.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the grammar, some of the symbols end with `t`. For example, `NT69 -> 't2'`, `NT38 -> 't3'`, etc. So each production that ends with a symbol like 't0', 't1', etc., indicates that this non-terminal derivation will contribute a terminal to the string. The others are non-terminals that need to be further expanded.\n\nI need to find a derivation path from S to the string `t2 t4 t4` by expanding the non-terminals step by step.

I'll expand NT68 and NT63 to see if they can generate `t2` and something that can lead to `t4 t4`.\n\nFirst, expanding NT68:\nLooking at the rules for NT68, I see `NT68 -> 't3'`. So, `NT68` produces `t3`. That's a terminal, so that part would be `t3`. But our desired string starts with `t2`, not `t3`. So this path might not be correct. Unless there's another rule for NT68 that produces something more complex, but I don't see any other rules besides `-> 't3'`.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at another starting rule: `S \u2192 NT64 NT78`. Now expand NT64 and NT78.\n\nExpanding NT64: Looking for NT64's production, I see `NT64 -> 't2'`. So that gives `t2`. Good, the first terminal is `t2`. Now, let's expand NT78.\n\nLooking for NT78's rules: I see multiple productions. Let me check them one by one.\n\n1. `NT78 -> NT77 NT66`\n2. `NT78 -> NT33 NT66`\n3. `NT38 -> 't3'` (but that's for NT38, not NT78)\nWait, actually, I need to look at NT78's rules. Let me check the list provided.\n\nThe rules for NT78 are:\n- `NT78 -> NT77 NT66`\n- `NT78 -> NT33 NT66`\n\nSo, both of these are non-terminals. So, we need to expand NT77 and NT33, which themselves have production rules.\n\nStarting with NT77: I need to check its rules. Let me search for NT77 in the production list.\n\nLooking through the provided productions, I see:\n\n`NT75 -> 't1'`\n`NT69 -> 't2'`\n`NT38 -> 't3'`\n`NT81 -> 't3'`\n`NT26 -> 't2'`\n`NT77 -> 't3'`\n\nAh! `NT77 -> 't3'`. So NT77 produces `t3`.\n\nNow, looking at the first rule for NT78: `NT78 -> NT77 NT66`. Expanding both:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 `t3`\n- NT66: Let's check NT66's rules. Looking through, I don't see NT66 directly listed, but let me see if any other non-terminals have rules involving NT66. Alternatively, maybe NT66 can produce something else, but checking the list, I don't see NT66 as a left-hand side of any rule except perhaps in another form. Wait, looking through again, I see NT68's rule is `-> 't3'`, and NT66 is not directly in the rules except as part of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules for NT66. Looking through the provided productions:\n\nI don't see any rule where NT66 is on the left side except in the last part, for example, some lines towards the end, like `NT93 -> NT39 NT66`, but that's for NT93, not NT66. So perhaps NT66 is a non-terminal that can produce another thing. Or maybe it's a terminal? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I don't see NT66 on the left-hand side of any production except in the line `NT93 -> NT39 NT66`, but that's for NT93. So perhaps NT66 is a non-terminal that can only be expanded further, but since there's no rule for it, that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted and there is a rule for NT66.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in CNF, every rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 terminal. Since NT77 -> 't3' and NT66 isn't in the list, I must assume that NT66 might be a terminal. Let me see if any of the NT66's left-hand sides have a rule producing a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT66 being the left-hand side of any production other than in a previous line, but perhaps NT66 is a non-terminal that can only produce more non-terminals. So perhaps I'm stuck here, but maybe I've made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the second rule for NT78: `NT78 -> NT33 NT66`. So if we take this, then NT33 is on the left and NT66.\n\nLooking for NT33's rules: from the list, I see `NT33 -> 't5'` and `NT33 -> NT13 NT94`. So NT33 can either be `t5` or expand into two non-terminals.\n\nIf we choose NT33 -> 't5', then we have:\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66 \u2192 t5 NT66.\n\nBut NT66's rules are unknown because there's no production for NT66. So that might not be helpful, unless NT66 can produce something else.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe starting with the first rule for S isn't the right path. Let's try the other starting rule: S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nWe already saw that S \u2192 NT64 \u2192 t2. Now, for NT78, perhaps a different expansion.\n\nLooking back at NT78's productions, maybe another rule can help. Wait, earlier I considered NT78\u2192NT77 NT66 and NT78\u2192NT33 NT66. Since NT77 \u2192 t3 and NT33 can be t5 or further, perhaps another path is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another production for NT78 was missed. Let me re-examine the list.\n\nWait, I'm looking through the provided productions, and there's this line: `NT74 -> 't2'` and another: `NT33 -> 't5'`. Also, NT77 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo, for the second rule: NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66. Let's say NT33 \u2192 t5 and NT66 needs to produce something. If NT66 is a terminal, but I don't see that in the list. Alternatively, perhaps NT66 is a non-terminal, but there's no production rule for it, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider different rules for NT78. Wait, in the list, the first rule for NT78 is `-> NT77 NT66`, and the second is `-> NT33 NT66`. So, perhaps I can't find a path through NT78 to get to t4 t4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some other rules. Let me check the list again for NT78.\n\nLooking through, I only see the two rules: 1. NT78 \u2192 NT77 NT66 and 2. NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66.\n\nSo, both times, we get to a non-terminal. But both NT77 and NT33 can produce terminals, but maybe they can also produce other things. For example, NT77"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine whether the string \"t0 t1 t3\" is generated by the given context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of a set of production rules and a start symbol. In this case, the start symbol is S. Each production rule either replaces a non-terminal symbol with other non-terminals or terminals. The provided grammar has various production rules, some of which directly map non-terminals to terminal symbols (like t0, t1, t2, etc.) and others that continue the breakdown.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t0 t1 t3\", which consists of three terminal tokens. So, the string has three parts, each corresponding to a terminal. My goal is to see if there's a way for the grammar to generate exactly these three terminals in sequence.\n\nLet me look at the grammar more closely. The start symbol is S, and S has two production rules:\n1. S -> NT68 NT63\n2. S -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo, S can produce two possible combinations: NT68 followed by NT63, or NT64 followed by NT78. Each of these non-terminals can then be further broken down according to other production rules.\n\nLet's analyze each possible route.\n\nFirst, let's consider S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nBreaking down NT68 and NT63:\nLooking at NT63's productions, I see NT63 can produce NT68 NT62. So the string would be getting longer, but that's not good because we have only three terminals. Let's see if that's the case.\n\nWait, but maybe NT68 and NT63 have other productions. Let me check.\n\nNT68 has a production NT68 -> 't3'. So that's a terminal. Same for NT63: NT63 -> NT68 NT62. Hmm, that's a combination of NT68 and NT62, which are both non-terminals. So this route might not be helpful because it introduces more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the other production rule of S: S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, let's break down NT64 and NT78.\n\nNT64: production is NT64 -> 't3'.\nNT78: production is NT78 -> 't2'.\n\nWait, no, looking again, NT78 has multiple productions. Specifically, NT78 can also go to NT65 NT49. So if NT78 is followed by NT65 NT49, that's more non-terminals. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, actually, looking at NT78's productions, there's NT78 -> 't2'. So if NT78 is directly 't2', then that might be useful. But wait, does NT78 have that production? Let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT78 -> NT65 NT49 and NT78 -> 't2'. Okay, so NT78 can be 't2' or another non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT64 is a terminal, so NT64 is 't3'.\n\nSo, let's try to construct the string \"t0 t1 t3\" starting from S.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT68 NT63\nThen NT68 is 't3', so the first part is 't3'. Then NT63 can be either NT68 NT62 or further productions, but if we choose NT63 -> 'something else', it might not fit our string.\n\nAlternatively, let's explore Case 2: S -> NT64 NT78\n\nHere, NT64 is 't3', and NT78 can be 't2' or other non-terminals. If NT78 is 't2', then we have 't3' 't2', but our target string starts with 't0', so this route might not work. Alternatively, let's see if there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe there's a production I'm missing. Let me check all NT78 productions again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, NT78 has:\n- NT78 -> 't2'\n- NT78 -> NT65 NT49\n- NT78 -> NT97 NT62\n- NT78 could also be broken down further, for example, if NT65 is producing things, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, perhaps taking S -> NT64 NT78, and if NT64 is 't3', but our string starts with 't0', so that's a problem. Maybe I took S -> NT64 but should consider S -> NT68 NT63 for 't0'...\n\nWait, but when S is S -> NT68 NT63, the first part is NT68 which is 't3', so the first token is 't3', not 't0'. So that's not helpful for 't0' as the first token.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the production rules. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two rules: S -> NT68 NT63 and S-> NT64 NT78.\n\nSo if S is NT68 NT63, then the first part is NT68 which can be 't3' (if we take S -> NT68 't3'). But our string starts with 't0', so that's not matching. So perhaps that production rule doesn't directly give us 't0' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The string is \"t0 t1 t3\". So the tokens are in the order t0, t1, t3.\n\nWait, so maybe the first symbol we need is 't0'. So perhaps we can trace the derivation such that the first symbol is 't0'.\n\nBut looking at the S productions, neither S directly starts with 't0'. They both start with combinations of NTs or terminals.\n\nWait a minute, that's a problem. Because S can't directly produce 't0' because both S's productions involve combinations of NTs, which may produce terminals, but perhaps the first symbol can be a terminal only if one of the NTs in the production is a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, S -> NT68 NT63. NT68 can produce 't3' and NT63 can produce more NTs or something else. Alternatively, is there a way that NT68 or NT63 can be a terminal that is 't0'?\n\nHmm. Let me check the NTx production rules to see which NTx can produce 't0'.\n\nLooking through the list of NTx, I see several NT rules that end with t0.\n\nSpecifically, looking for any NTx -> 't0':\n\n- NT62-> NT39 NT81\nNo, wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let's check each NTx:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT96 -> 't5'\n- NT69 -> 't0'\n- NT29? No, let's scan more carefully.\n\nWait, here's a list of production rules where a NTx is mapped directly to a terminal 't0':\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any NTx where the production is -> 't0':\n\n- NT26 -> 't0' (yes, in the provided rules)\n- NT96 -> 't5'\n- Wait, let's check every line:\n\nLooking for production rules where the right-hand side is a single 't0'.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT26 -> 't0'\n\nYes, that's one. So, NT26 can produce t0.

Wait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking through all the lines, I realize:\n\n- NT26 appears in several other production rules, but in the end, one of them is NT26 -> 't0'. Similarly, NT96 is 't5', so not 't0'.

The given grammar starts with S and has a series of productions leading to terminals (like t0, t1, etc.) and some non-terminals.\n\nThe string `t1 t1 t4 t0` consists of four terminal symbols. To be generated by the grammar, there must be a way to expand S using the productions until I end up with exactly this sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice the start symbol S has two productions:\n1.

It must be one of the terminal symbols. But in the given grammar, the only terminal symbols are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', etc. Each of these corresponds to some production on the left-hand side leading to them.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see that for example, NT38 -> 't3', NT39 -> 't0', etc. So each of these NTs produces a specific terminal.\n\nWait, the NT66 doesn't have a production in the given grammar, which means it's a terminal that's not defined. But in the given string, the only terminals are the 't' symbols, so this is problematic. Because if NT66 is not part of any production, it can't be a terminal. Therefore, this path doesn't work, implying that perhaps NT68 is not the right path to take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, the productions for NT68 are:\nNT68 -> NT33 NT66.\n\nBut in the provided productions, NT66 isn't listed. Did I miss it? Let me scan again. After NT63, next is NT65, NT82, etc. I don't see NT66 being defined anywhere. That means NT66 is a non-terminal that doesn't have a production, which is impossible. So, the only way this can be a terminal is if it's mapped to a 't' symbol, but looking through the given productions for terminals, I don't see an NT66 -> 'tXXX' rule. So, this suggests that NT66 can't be a terminal. Therefore, this path leads to a problem, so the initial path S -> NT68 NT63 is invalid.\n\nLet me try the other production of S: S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, NT64 and NT78:\n\nLooking at NT64:\n- NT64 -> NT60 NT14\n\nNT14: NT14 -> NT1 NT98\n\nWait, this is getting complicated, but let's see:\n\nNT64 expands to NT60 NT14.\n\nNT60: NT60 -> NT68 NT18\n\nNT14: NT14 -> NT1 NT98\n\nNT98: NT98 -> NT58 NT65.\n\nSo, NT98 is a non-terminal that goes to NT58 and NT65.\n\nPutting this together, the expansion would be [NT60 NT14] -> [NT68 NT18 NT1 NT98 NT58 NT65].\n\nThis is getting too long, but perhaps there's a way to get 't's from these.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to find if the target string can be divided into parts that match the grammar's terminal rules.\n\nThe target string is `t1 t1 t4 t0`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each 't' is produced by certain NTs:\n\n- 't0' is produced by various NTs like NT99, NT75, etc.\n- 't1' can be produced by NT8, NT2, etc.\n- 't4' is from NT12, NT44, etc.\n- 't3' is from NT3, NT23, etc.\n\nSince the string is four symbols, each derived from a binary expansion (each NT can split into two NTs until we reach terminals), the string length must correspond to a binary tree of height 3 (since 2^3 = 8 nodes, but not necessarily exactly because of possible short-circuiting early terminals). However, let's check if each 't' can be obtained and if the initial split of S can reach four terminals.\n\nStarting from S, each application of a production increases the count by 1 (since S -> NTa NTb, each is non-terminal, assuming each is split into two non-terminals). Wait, actually, each production of S leads to two non-terminals. To get four terminals, the derivations must generate exactly four non-terminals, which would mean that each of them eventually resolves to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to simulate a possible derivation.\n\nLet me try S -> NT64 NT78 (since S -> NT68 NT63 seems problematic).\n\nNT64 is NT64 -> NT60 NT14\n\nNT60 -> NT68 NT18\n\nNT14 -> NT1 NT98\n\nSo, NT64 expands to NT60 and NT14.\n\nThen NT60 -> NT68 (which is another non-terminal) and NT18.\n\nSo NT60 expands to NT68 and NT18.\n\nNT68 -> NT33 NT66\n\nWait, NT68 now goes to NT33 and NT66, but NT66 is problematic as before since it's not defined. Alternatively, perhaps S -> NT64 NT78 is the correct path, but getting into the right sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider another approach. Let's search for how to derive t1 t1 t4 t0.\n\nEach 't' must come from a specific NT. Let's list the possible NTs for each 't':\n\n- t1: NT2 (produces 't3'), NT14 (\u2192 t5?), wait, no, earlier I saw that NT24 -> t0, wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a mapping from NT to terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each NT production leads to a specific terminal or splits into more NTs.\n\nHere's the list of NTs and their productions, with the terminal they produce where applicable:\n\n- NT38 -> t3\n- NT47 (multiple rules) \u2192 t3, t5, t5, etc.\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n- NT75 \u2192 t3\n- NT48 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT45 \u2192 t5\n- NT18 \u2192 t5\n- NT60 \u2192 t5\n- NT20 \u2192 t5\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT33 \u2192 t0\n- NT84 \u2192 t3\n- NT97 \u2192 t5\n- NT39 \u2192 t0\n- NT99 \u2192 t5\n- NT85 \u2192 t2\n- NT26 \u2192 t0 (Wait, in the initial grammar list: NT26 -> 't0'?

{"custom_id":"request-37","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the string \"t3 t4 t0 t4\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see non-terminals on the left and some terminals on the right. So each production either combines two non-terminals or replaces them with two terminals.\n\nThe string to check is \"t3 t4 t0 t4\". Each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal symbol. Since the string has four symbols, I need a derivation that produces exactly these four terminals in order.\n\nI'll begin by looking for starting symbols and possible productions that can expand to the string. The start symbol is S, so I need S to eventually produce the string. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nOther productions for NT68, NT63, NT64, NT78.\n\nLooking at NT68: NT68 \u2192 NT68 might be a loop, but likely it's a different production. Wait, NT68's production: Oh, wait, looking through the productions, most lines start with NT followed by numbers. But looking through the list, I realize many non-terminals are defined with multiple productions.\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce a 't' symbol. Because the string starts with t3, which could be from NT68 or another NT.\n\nWait, actually, no. Wait, the terminals in the grammar are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5'. So each tX is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions for each NT to see if they can produce t3.\n\nLooking at NT68: Let me check. In the grammar, does NT68 produce any terminal? Looking through the list: There's NT68 \u2192 NT68 (loop?), no. Wait, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, looking closely, NT68's production isn't in the initial list as a terminal. Wait, actually, in the grammar, each production for NT has on the left NTxx, and on the right a combination or some terminals.\n\nWait, some lines might not show the productions for all NTs. Wait, no. Each NT is defined by the productions listed for it. For example, NT68 has a production NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT68 (which seems recursive), but looking again, I need to check the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the grammar structure wrong. The first line is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then S \u2192 NT64 NT78, etc. Then each subsequent line defines a production for a particular NT. So for example, NT62 has a production NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0.\n\nSo, for each NT, we have multiple productions. For example, NT67 might have multiple options. So to determine which production to use, perhaps I should look for which NT can directly produce 't3' or the parts leading to 't3'.\n\nThe string is t3 t4 t0 t4. So let's model the derivation.\n\nLet me see. Start with S. S can go to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, we need NT68 and NT63 to produce t3 t4 t0 t4 in some way. Wait, no. Because S is decomposed into two parts, NT68 and NT63, each must produce a sequence of terminals. So since the string has four terminals, NT68 must produce two and NT63 the other two. Alternatively, each could produce two, so NT68 might be t3 followed by something, and NT63 t4 t0 t4, but wait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Since each NT production can be only two symbols, perhaps the entire derivation is binary, so each step doubles the number of symbols or reduces via terminals.\n\nWait, actually, since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC, and to reach a terminal string, each path must reduce to a terminal.\n\nSo, the string \"t3 t4 t0 t4\" has four terminals, so the parse tree must have exactly three internal nodes (since a parse tree for a string of k terminals has k-1 internal nodes). Each internal node corresponds to a production.\n\nSince the start symbol S is a non-terminal, and the string is four terminals, the process would involve expanding S into two non-terminals, then each of those may expand until we have four terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and then NT68 and NT63 each expand to sequences that combine to form the four terminals.\n\nSo let me try to see what NT68 and NT63 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT68's productions, do any of them produce terminals? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 is produced by S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and then NT68's possible productions are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT68, I don't see any production where NT68 \u2192 a terminal. Wait, perhaps NT68 has a production that produces a terminal. Let's check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a list starting from S, then each NT has its own productions. So NT68 is defined by its own productions. Wait, maybe I missed it. Looking through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT68 in the productions. I see:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nThen NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65\n\nWait, but for NT68, perhaps I should look through all the non-terminals. Oh, wait, I notice that in the provided structure, after S, each line defines a different NT. So for example, the first line after S is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then the next line is S \u2192 NT64 NT78, and then starting from NT62:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reorganize the grammar to list all NTs and their productions accurately. It's a bit confusing as it's given inline. Maybe that's why the initial analysis is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the NTs can directly produce a 't3' terminal.\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't3':\n\nIn the grammar, there are several NTs with terminal symbols like t0, t1, etc.\n\nLooking through the provided productions:\n\nNT75 \u2192 't3' (twice, in two places)\nNT38 \u2192 't3'\nNT47 \u2192 't5' (no)\nNT18 \u2192 't1'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo NT38 \u2192 't3', NT47 \u2192 't3' (three times).\n\nSo if any NT in the derivation path is NT38, it can produce a 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, NT75 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with 't3', which could come from NT38 or NT75.\n\nLet me consider starting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nI need to find what NT68 and NT63 can produce.\n\nBut looking at NT68's productions, in the provided grammar, I don't see any that produce terminals. NT68's possible productions seem to always involve other non-terminals. So:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT62 NT74 (line from NT62)\nWait, but no, looking through all lines, it's better to note that NT68 might be expanding into NT62 and NT74, which further expand into more NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I can track the possible expansions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe let's try to think of the string in reverse.\n\nThe string is t3 t4 t0 t4.\n\nIn a CFG in CNF, the parse is done by matching the entire string as a tree of productions. The leaves are the terminals.\n\nEach internal node has exactly two children because each production is of the form A \u2192 BC.\n\nSo the string of four terminals can be represented as a binary tree with three internal nodes.\n\nEach internal node corresponds to a production, and the leaves to the terminals.\n\nLet's consider the structure:\n\nThe entire string is built from a root S, which splits into two parts. Each part then further splits until we reach the terminals.\n\nGiven the string t3 t4 t0 t4, which is four terminals, so the root S would produce two parts, say X and Y, such that X and Y together produce the string. So X must produce the first two terminals, or the first one and the remaining three, but wait, no\u2014each production must split into exactly two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, the initial production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So X would be NT68, and Y would be NT63.\n\nEach NT68 and NT63 need to produce a sequence of terminals.

Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding the grammar and then how it generates strings.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is provided with production rules for a start symbol S, which branches out into combinations of NT symbols and terminals. The terminals are 't' followed by a number, like 't0', 't1', up to 't97'. So, the grammar is likely generating strings composed of these terminals. \n\nLooking at the production rules, S can go to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Each of these NT symbols leads to other NT symbols until some of them produce terminal strings. For example, NT75 produces 't3', NT69 produces 't2', and so on. So, the grammar seems to be a recursive one where NT symbols are non-terminals that expand further until they hit a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is \"t0 t4 t5 t4 t1\". Let me break it down: t0, t4, t5, t4, t1. I need to see if this can be derived from S through some sequence of productions.\n\nStarting from S, which can expand to S->NT68 NT63 or S->NT64 NT78. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT68 NT63\nNow, check what NT68 and NT63 produce. Looking at the rules:\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT63 -> ?\nLooking back, NT63 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, NT63 is a non-terminal. Let me check the productions: NT63's productions aren't in the given list. Hmm, wait, was that included? Let me check again.\n\nOh, the list does include NT63, but looking at the top, I see NT62, NT65, etc. Wait, yes, in the initial list under NT symbols, I see NT63 as a production: NT63 -> NT84 NT62. So, NT63 is not a terminal; it has to be further expanded.\n\nSo, for S->NT68 NT63, NT63 expands to NT84 NT62. Then, NT84 -> 't4', and NT62 expands to NT3 NT93. NT3 is a terminal? Let me check: looking through the terminal productions, no, NT3 isn't listed as a terminal. Wait, in the terminal list, are there any NT3 symbols?\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see NT74->t3, but NT3 isn't a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because if NT3 isn't a terminal, how does that fit into our string. Wait, no\u2014maybe I'm mixing symbols. Wait, in the list of production rules, 'terminals' are the ones with 't' followed by a number. So, the productions with NT3 must expand to something else.\n\nWait, let me double-check the productions again. I might have misread. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either a symbol -> two other symbols or a symbol -> a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given rules, for example:\n- NT65 -> NT96 NT65\n- NT38 -> nt89 nt38\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, the productions are written as NT65->NT96 NT65, which means NT65 is a non-terminal, as it's on the left, and on the right, there are other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, looking at the string \"t0 t4 t5 t4 t1\", each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So, in order for the string to be generated, the expansion must result in exactly these terminals in that order without any non-terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S->NT68 NT63. NT68->t3, so the first element is 't3'. But our string starts with 't0', so that doesn't match. Therefore, the first production leads us to 't3', but our target is 't0', so that branch is invalid. So, S->NT68 NT63 is out.\n\nNow, check S->NT64 NT78. NT64->t4. So, the first terminal is 't4'. That's the second symbol in our string, which is 't4', but the first is 't0'. So, that doesn't match either. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014wait, the string starts with 't0', so if S expands to NT64 NT78, giving 't4' followed by something else. But our string starts with 't0', which doesn't match. So, perhaps the initial assumption is that the first part would produce 't0'... But according to the productions, NT64->t4, and NT78 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me double-check. S can go to NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. If NT68 produces 't3' and NT64 produces 't4', then neither starts with 't0'. Wait, but in the string, the first terminal is 't0', so perhaps I need another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me check the NT65 and other productions again.\n\nWait, in the production rules, there's NT69->t2, and NT79 isn't in the list\u2014no, wait, looking again, I don't see NT75 as S->NT68 NT63. Wait, earlier I thought S had S->NT68 NT63 and S->NT64 NT78, which are the only two productions for S.\n\nWait, but in the string, first symbol is 't0', so perhaps the initial NT symbol must produce 't0' when expanded. Let me see if any non-terminals produce 't0'. Looking through the given rules:\n\nIn the terminal list, NT62->'t2', NT65->'t5', NT69->'t0', NT38->'t3', etc. Wait, looking at the given list:\n\nNT69 is defined as NT26 NT42. What's NT26's production? Checking the list: NT26-> NT60 NT9. NT60 is 't5', and NT9 is 't5'? No, wait, NT60 in the rules says NT60-> NT68 NT18. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me look for any NT symbol that directly produces 't0', because the string starts with t0. Looking through the production rules:\n\nLooking at the given NT rules, is any NT symbol directly producing t0? Let me scan:\n\nLooking for NT symbols where production ends in 't0'. For example, NT69 is defined as NT26 NT42, which I don't immediately know, but NT62 is defined as NT3 NT93, which might not be 't0'. Wait, are there any NT symbols that directly produce 't0' as a terminal?\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT69 being rewritten as NT26 NT42. But looking further, I don't see any NT symbol in the rules having a production that directly gives 't0'. Wait, look again:\n\nWait, in the terminal list provided, NT62->t2, but what about NT18? NT18's production: NT98 NT38, which might not be 't0'. Wait, I think I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backward from the string. The string is t0 t4 t5 t4 t1. So, this must result from an expansion sequence that starts with a production leading to 't0', followed by 't4', etc.\n\nLet me think of how each terminal could be generated. For example, 't0' must be produced by some NT symbol. Looking at the given rules, none of the NT symbols seem to produce 't0' directly, except maybe NT26 or others, but I don't see a production ending in 't0' immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the production rules again to see if any NT symbol produces 't0':\n\nLooking through all the NT production rules, I see:\n\n- NT26 is defined as NT60 NT9, which may not directly produce 't0'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice that NT65 is defined as NT96 NT65, but both of these are non-terminals, so that won't help. NT97 is defined as NT23 NT38, which are non-terminals. Wait, in the given production rules, I don't see any NT symbol being defined as t0. That's strange because the string starts with t0, so this might mean that either my analysis is incorrect or the grammar doesn't include a production for 't0' as a terminal, which would make the string unparseable"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-52","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine whether the string `t1 t2 t0 t1 t1` can be generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process. The initial step is to understand how the grammar works and how each symbol can be expanded.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, and from S, we can derive either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. These are two branches to explore. Each of these symbols is also non-terminals and can be further expanded.\n\nLet me list out the rules that lead to terminal symbols. It seems that several of the rules expand into 't0', 't1', 't2', etc., which are the terminals. For example, NT68 -> 't3', NT64 -> 't3', NT75 -> 't3', etc. Also, some rules like NT81 -> 't3', NT97 -> 't5', and so on.\n\nThe string I'm given is `t1 t2 t0 t1 t1`, which is a sequence of five terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to generate the string, I need to find a sequence of productions that, when all are resolved, result in exactly these five terminals.\n\nThe string length is five. The start symbol S is the root, but in CNF, the start symbol is derived by two non-terminals, so the initial expansion is S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78. Each of these non-terminals will then produce two more non-terminals, and so on. However, since we're ending up with a string that has five terminals, the number of non-terminals in the derivation will have to reduce down over time.\n\nLet's consider the possible expansions. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so each step could potentially double the number of symbols. But since some symbols are terminals, we need to track how the branching resolves into terminals.\n\nI'll start by trying to see if the string can fit into one of the branches. Let's take the first branch: S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, I need to have NT68 and NT63 produce sequences that eventually resolve to t1, t2, t0, t1, t1. Or alternatively, I can try the second branch: S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, S -> NT68 NT63. Let's see what NT68 and NT63 can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT68 can be NT48 NT0 (from rule 66), but I need to check what NT48 and NT0 produce. Wait, NT48 is another non-terminal that expands to NT26 NT42 (from rule NT48). Then, NT26 can expand to NT60 NT9 (rule NT26), which is another non-terminal. NT60 in rule N66 is NT68 NT18. So this seems to be getting into a loop.\n\nAlternatively, NT68 could go through NT65, but NT65 -> 't5' (rule NT65). Maybe that's a better path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a bottom-up approach, starting from the symbols in the string and seeing if they can be formed by the productions.\n\nThe string is t1 t2 t0 t1 t1.\n\nLooking at each symbol, I need to see if they can be terminal symbols directly or if they can be non-terminals that can expand into those symbols.\n\nLet me note that some non-terminals directly result in terminals:\n\n- NT38 -> 't3'\n- NT48 -> 't3' (from NT48 -> t3)\n- NT90 -> 't2' (from NT90)\n- NT18 -> 't1' (from NT18)\n- NT2 -> 't3' (from NT2)\n- NT97 -> 't5' (from NT97)\n- NT68 -> 't3' (from NT68)\n- NT64 -> 't3' (from NT64)\n- NT19 -> 't3' (from NT19)\n- NT75 -> 't3' (from NT75)\n- NT77 -> 't3' (from NT77)\n- NT3 -> 't4' (from NT3)\n- NT22 -> 't4' (from NT22)\n- NT44 -> 't4' (from NT44)\n- NT12 -> 't5' (from NT12)\n- NT94 -> 't2' (from NT94)\n- NT26 -> 't1' (from NT26)\n- NT87 -> Let me check: NT94 is 't2', but is there a rule for NT94? I see that NT94 -> NT75 NT49, and NT49 -> 't1'. So perhaps NT94 -> t2 t1.\n\nBut in the string, I don't have t94. So perhaps looking at each symbol:\n\nLet me write down the required sequence: t1, t2, t0, t1, t1.\n\nStarting from the left, the first symbol is t1. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t1.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT45 -> 't5' (from rule NT45)\n- NT78 -> 't3' (from NT78)\n- NT18 -> 't1' (from NT18)\n- NT22 -> 't4' (from NT22)\n- NT2 -> 't3' (from NT2)\n- ...

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the grammar provided is in CNF because most of the production rules are of the form NT -> NT NT, except some are terminals followed by non-terminals or other combinations, like S being the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are in the order t4, t3, t5, t2, t0, t2. I notice that each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So, my goal is to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar's start symbol S, which is defined as S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nI think I'll approach this by trying to parse the string from the first terminal to the last, seeing if each step corresponds to a production rule.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string starts with t4. Looking at the grammar, which terminal symbols have t4? Let me check.\n\nFrom the given rules, I see:\n- NT49 -> t1\n- NT25 (Wait, looking at the list more carefully, I see NT89 -> t5\nWait, no.

So, the first token t4 could come from NT3.\n\nNext, looking at the string: t4 t3 t5 t2 t0 t2.\n\nSo, after t4, the next is t3. So, we have t4 followed by t3.\n\nSo, the first part of the parse would be: NT3 (from t4) producing something that leads to t4, but how did we get to NT3? Well, the problem is that in the grammar, NT3 is only a non-terminal that leads to 't4', which is a terminal. So, is there a production that allows NT3 to derive t4? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the NT3 production: Yes, I see a production rule for NT3: NT3 -> 't4'. So that's straightforward. So, t4 is just the terminal.\n\nNext, after t4, the next token is t3. So, we need to see how that follows.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting confusing. Another way is to try to construct a parse tree starting from S.\n\nThe string is t4 t3 t5 t2 t0 t2. Let me count the tokens: six tokens. Each token corresponds to a production step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parse corresponds to a rule that has exactly two non-terminals on the left. But terminals in the string have to come from productions where that non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps I can start from the rightmost symbols and work backwards, but since the string is a left-to-right sequence, maybe a leftmost derivation is better.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to see the number of tokens. Each step in a leftmost derivation would double the number of symbols until we have all the terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in a context-free grammar, the number of symbols in each step can vary, but with CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the leftmost derivation would start from S, and each expansion adds symbols.\n\nBut the string is given as a sequence of terminals, so we need to find a way to derive that exact sequence from S.\n\nLet me map each terminal back to their possible non-terminals.\n\nt4: NT3 -> t4\n\nt3: Possible NTs producing t3 are NT2, NT68: Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar rules:\n\n- S -> NT68 NT63\n\nLooking for 't3', which comes from which NT.

{"custom_id":"request-68","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with determining whether the string \"t4 t0 t2 t1 t5 t3\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. However, looking at the provided grammar, I see that it seems to have two non-terminals on the right side: \"NT62 -> NT3 NT93\" for example. Wait, actually, I notice that the productions in the grammar have \"NT62\" and others, but the terminals are represented with 't' and numbers, like \"t0\", \"t1\", etc. I think that in this context, the NT symbols are non-terminals, and the txx are terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check. The grammar starts with S, which is the start symbol, and the productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which suggests that NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals. Then, for example, NT62 is a non-terminal, producing NT48 NT0. NT0 seems to be another non-terminal, but some of the strings end with t0, t1, etc. So, I think the grammar's non-terminals are everything before the t's. That is, some symbols are non-terminals (like NT62, NT68, etc.), and others are terminals like t0, t1, etc.\n\nWait, but in CNF, productions can't have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side. But in this grammar, for example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0: so two non-terminals, which is fine in CNF. But then, if we have \"NT0\", is that a terminal or a non-terminal? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production for NT0 on the left except in another production: NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. Hmm, no, wait\u2014looking again, the production for NT0 is actually S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and then looking in the list, I see NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. So NT0 is a non-terminal because it has a production. Similarly, NT12 \u2192 NT48 NT1 is a production, so NT1 is another non-terminal. So, all the symbols before 't' in the productions are non-terminals, and the rest are terminals.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. For example, \"t0\" is a terminal, as are \"t1\", \"t2\", etc. The rest, like NT62, NT48, etc., are non-terminals because they have productions.\n\nSo, given the string \"t4 t0 t2 t1 t5 t3\", I need to see if it's a valid derivation starting from S and following the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production on the right-hand side of a non-terminal production can generate either a single terminal or a non-terminal. However, to generate the string, I need to see if the string can be a result of a series of such productions collapsing into terminals.\n\nFirst, let's represent the string as a sequence of terminals: [t4, t0, t2, t1, t5, t3].\n\nIn a typical bottom-up parsing approach, you start from the terminals and work your way up to the start symbol. But since I'm trying to see if the string can be generated from the grammar, perhaps I can consider each terminal and trace back through the productions.\n\nLet me note that in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals, or a single terminal. But wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. However, in this grammar, the productions seem to often produce two non-terminals. For example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0. But wait, are all right-hand sides either two non-terminals or a single terminal? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal, except perhaps those that directly have a terminal as part of their productions.\n\nWait, let me check NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0. So that's two non-terminals. Similarly, NT81 \u2192 NT78 NT97, which are both non-terminals. But looking further into the productions, I see terms like \"t0\", \"t1\", etc., which are terminals. So in the grammar, non-terminals can produce either a terminal or another non-terminal. Or is that not correct?\n\nWait, in Chomsky normal form, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a single terminal. However, in the given grammar, I see productions where a non-terminal generates two non-terminals, like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, or some even go into terminals.\n\nWait, looking at NT48: NT48 \u2192 NT99 NT81. Then NT99 is a production, and so on. But in the end, some symbols are terminals, which would mean that in the derivation, those non-terminals will eventually produce terminals.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to approach this is to find the parse tree for the given string, starting from the start symbol S and expanding it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is relatively short (six terminals), maybe I can use a dynamic programming approach or some method to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me think about the process:\n\n1. The start symbol is S.\n2. S has productions like S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So S expands into two non-terminals. Therefore, the string must be derived from one of those two paths.\n\nBut the string we have is six terminals. Let's check if the string can be broken down into the right number of steps.\n\nIn each step, each non-terminal can be replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but in CNF, non-terminals can produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. But in the given grammar, every production seems to be either A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or has a mix of non-terminals and terminals? Wait, no. Looking back, I see that all productions are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ. For example, NT68 \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, that's two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but this seems odd because in normal CNF, non-terminals can only produce terminals or two non-terminals. But in the given grammar, it looks like every production is producing two non-terminals, with no terminals on the right-hand side. That can't be correct, because then the grammar wouldn't accept any terminals, which conflicts with the provided string that contains t4, etc.\n\nWait, that must be a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the production NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0. So that's two non-terminals. But NT0 is a non-terminal, so it's producing two non-terminals. Similarly, NT68 \u2192 NT64 NT78. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would result in generating four non-terminals in the first expansion step: NT68 and NT63. NT68 would, in the next step, expand into two more non-terminals, etc.\n\nWait, but the string we have is six terminals, which would require that after a certain number of steps, all the non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nEach step would involve replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So to reach six terminals, we'd have to have a structure where the number of nodes corresponds to that.\n\nThe string is of length 6. Let's think about the derivation process. Starting from S, which is a non-terminal. S can derive into two non-terminals, say NT68 and NT63. Then each of these can either produce more non-terminals or terminals. So, the depth of the parse tree would correspond to the number of productions needed to reach the terminals.\n\nBut since all the productions in the grammar are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, with no terminals on the right, except where the non-terminals derive into terminals. Wait, no: looking at some of the productions, for example, NT5 \u2192 t3, which seems incorrect because t3 is a terminal. Or no, wait, some symbols have productions that involve both non-terminals and terminals, like NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13. No, wait, perhaps not. Wait, looking at the list, for example, the production NT38 \u2192 t3. So that's a production where a non-terminal generates a terminal. So, for instance, NT38 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13, which are both non-terminals, so that would not produce a terminal.\n\nWait, in the list, some productions have terminals on the right-hand side.

{"custom_id":"request-90","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t5 t5 t1 t4 t0 t4 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll walk through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar is in Chomsky normal form if every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all productions seem to fit that form: each non-terminal on the left has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So, that's good.\n\nNext, I know that to determine if a string is in the language, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for context-free grammars. But I'm not super familiar with CYK, so maybe I'll try a different approach by trying to parse the string from the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is `t5 t5 t1 t4 t0 t4 t3`. So seven terminals, all of which are t1, t3, t4, t5.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S. Looking at the grammar, S can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. The NT symbols here are part of the grammar's non-terminals, which eventually lead to terminals through a series of productions.\n\nBut parsing manually might be complicated. Another method is to build a parse tree from the string. Let me see if the string can be constructed by combining smaller substrings that fit into the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal leads to two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So S requires the combination of two NTs. Each NT can further split into two more NTs or a terminal.\n\nI need to check if the string can be viewed as a series of splits. Let me break down the string into segments that might fit the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting from the first part of the string: t5 t5. Perhaps this could come from a non-terminal that produces two t5s. Looking through the grammar rules, I notice that NT27 \u2192 t5. Also, NT52 \u2192 t2, NT48 \u2192 t3, etc. Hmm, not immediately seeing a way to get two t5s at the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the top and see if I can form the string by combining the productions.\n\nLet me think recursively. The start symbol S can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let me pick one option and see if it can lead to the string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So, I need to produce NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking at NT68 \u2192 t5 (from the grammar: NT68 \u2192 t5). So NT68 can produce t5.\n\nNow, NT63. Let's see what NT63 produces. Looking it up: NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So, I need to produce NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 t3. So, NT84 can produce t3.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT39 NT33. So, NT62 needs NT39 and NT33.\n\nNT39 \u2192 t0. So, NT39 \u2192 t0.\n\nNT33 \u2192 t3. So, NT33 \u2192 t3.\n\nPutting that together: NT62 \u2192 t0 t3. So NT63 \u2192 t3 t3.\n\nSo, NT68 \u2192 t5 and NT63 \u2192 t3 t3. So, combining these, the first part would give t5 t3 t3.\n\nBut our string starts with t5 t5, not t5 t3. So that's a problem. Maybe I took the wrong split.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Let's see this path.\n\nNT64 \u2192 t3. So, NT64 can produce t3.\n\nNT78 \u2192 t2. So, NT78 can produce t2.\n\nWait, t2 is in the middle of the string, not at the beginning. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a combination. Maybe S can produce a left and right subtree that together produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if each terminal in the string can be matched in some way to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string: positions are 1 to 7, with terms t5, t5, t1, t4, t0, t4, t3.\n\nI need to see if each terminal or a pair can be formed by the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm. Let me see.\n\nThe CYK algorithm involves creating a table where each cell (i, j) represents whether the substring from i to j can be generated by the grammar. For a string of length n, the table has n+1 rows and n+1 columns.\n\nFor our string, it's 7 terms, so n=7.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the table with each single symbol. So, check if each single symbol is a terminal and exists in the grammar as a terminal. The grammar's terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t8, t9, etc. Wait, from the rules, the terminals that appear are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 as per the grammar's definitions.\n\nLooking back: NT68 \u2192 t5, NT64 \u2192 t3, NT67 \u2192 t2, etc. So all our symbols in the string are terminals present: t5, t5, t1, t4, t0, t4, t3. So each single terminal is present.\n\nSo, for i from 1 to 7, cell (i, i) is true since each single symbol is a terminal.\n\nStep 2: Fill the table for substrings of length 2 to 7.\n\nFor substrings of length 2 (i, i+1):\n\nCheck if there's a non-terminal A that can produce these two symbols, i.e., A \u2192 X Y, where X is the i-th symbol and Y is the (i+1)-th symbol.\n\nSo, for each possible split point k from i to i+1 - 1.\n\nLet me go step by step.\n\nWait, this might take time, but let's try.\n\nBut maybe I can find a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps considering that the string is seven symbols long, maybe it can be built from a split early on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the entire string as being derived from S, which is two non-terminals (NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78). Let's take the option S \u2192 NT68 NT63, as before.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t5.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 t3.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT39 NT33.\n\nNT39 \u2192 t0.\n\nNT33 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo, NT62 \u2192 t0 t3.\n\nThen NT63 \u2192 t3 t3.\n\nSo, NT68 NT63 \u2192 t5 t3 t3.\n\nBut our string is t5 t5 t1 t4 t0 t4 t3. Doesn't match the first part.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 \u2192 t3.\n\nNT78 \u2192 t2. So, t3 t2. Doesn't match the first part of the string.\n\nHmm, perhaps a different split.\n\nWait, perhaps after S, the two non-terminals are more complicated. Maybe NT68 can split further.\n\nBut previously, I saw that NT68 \u2192 t5. So it's a leaf node in terms of terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived from a combination of splits in a different way.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the string is built by multiple non-terminals, each contributing parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for patterns in the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce a terminal immediately, others require further splitting.\n\nFor example, NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT33. NT39 \u2192 t0, NT33 \u2192 t3. So NT62 \u2192 t0 t3.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 t3 t0 t3.\n\nWait, so NT63 \u2192 t3 t0 t3. So if S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is t5 t3 t0 t3. But our string starts with t5 t5, which would require that NT63 somehow produces another t5, but according to the productions, NT63 seems to only produce t3 and t0 and t3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT64 and NT78 can be combined in a way that produces more terminals.\n\nWait, NT78 \u2192 t2. That's terminal. So S \u2192 NT64 t2? Wait, no: S \u2192 NT64 NT78, but NT78 is a production. Wait, looking back: NT78's production is NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is a bit lengthy, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF looks like. In CNF, each production rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. In some cases, it can have more than two non-terminals, but I think here all productions have either two non-terminals or maybe some have one terminal. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most rules have S -> NT68 NT63, S -> NT64 NT78, which are both two non-terminals. The other rules seem to follow the same pattern, either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, it's in CNF as required.\n\nNow, the string to check is \"t1 t3 t3 t5 t5 t4 t2\". Since it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, each token is a terminal symbol, implying that they must be directly derived from terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nThe key here is to see if each 'tX' is directly produced by a production rule in the grammar. Let me go through each 'tX' in the string and match them against the terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal symbols are various numbers like t1, t2, t3, up to t97, but the string only has t1, t3, t5, t7, etc. Wait, the given string is \"t1 t3 t3 t5 t5 t4 t2\".\n\nWait, let's list out the productions where each 'tX' appears.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT15 -> NT1 nt77\n- NT9 -> nt15 nt77, wait the grammar is using NT with numbers and some are terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-110","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t2 t3 t1 t1 t1 t1 t4 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form where every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided here indeed seems to follow CNF since each rule on the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right sides are either two non-terminals or terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, etc.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is `t2 t3 t1 t1 t1 t1 t4 t3`. Each token here is a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, the only way to derive a string is by expanding non-terminals step by step until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me think about how the derivation process works. Starting from the start symbol S, which is NT68 and NT63. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to expand into a sequence of terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT68 and NT63, I need to see their productions. From the grammar, NT68 is one of the terminal symbols, as it's listed in the string as 't2'. Similarly, NT63 is another terminal, 't3'. So S expands directly to t2 t3. \n\nNow, the string we have has eight tokens: t2 t3 t1 t1 t1 t1 t4 t3. But right now, after S \u2192 NT68 NT63, we get t2 t3. That's just the first two tokens. But the string continues with t1 four times, then t4, then t3. So the initial expansion only covers the first two tokens. This suggests that the grammar must have a way to produce more tokens beyond the first two.\n\nWait, that can't be right because NT68 and NT63 are terminals, so S can only produce t2 t3. So unless other non-terminals can derive into more tokens, but wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong initial expansion. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to expand S such that more tokens are produced.\n\nLooking at S, which has multiple productions. The initial production was S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which gives t2 t3. But maybe another production of S can lead to more tokens. Let me check other S productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S also has several other productions: S \u2192 NT64 NT78, S \u2192 NT62 NT74, etc. So maybe the initial expansion of S could be, for example, NT64 and NT78. Let's see what those produce.\n\nLooking at NT64: it's a terminal 't4' because in the right-hand side mappings, NT64 \u2192 t4. Similarly, NT78 is a terminal 't2'. So if S were to expand to NT64 NT78, we'd get t4 t2. That's four tokens, but our target string is longer. \n\nAlternatively, other S productions: S \u2192 NT65 NT96. NT65 is t5 and NT96 is t5. So that would be t5 t5. Hmm, not matching yet. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe I should map out the entire derivation step by step, considering each production possibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar has a structure where S can produce t2 t3 followed by more non-terminals, but I know S is divided initially into two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can either be a terminal or another non-terminal. So maybe the initial S \u2192 NT68 NT63 gives t2 t3, but each NT68 and NT63 can derive into other non-terminals. Wait, no, the productions for NT68 and NT63 are terminals. Because looking at the given grammar, NT68 is a terminal 't2' and NT63 is a terminal 't3'. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63 directly translates to t2 t3, ending the derivation. That suggests that the string starting with t2 t3 can be generated, but how to get the rest of the tokens?\n\nWait, no. Let me check more carefully. For example, NT68 is a terminal 't2' because in the mappings, I see NT65 \u2192 t5, NT64 \u2192 t4, NT62 \u2192 t3, etc. And NT68 is directly a terminal, right? Let me check: Looking for NT68 in the mappings, yes, there's a line NT68 -> t2, where the grammar is written as NT68 \u2192 t2. Similarly, NT63 is a terminal, 't3' because looking for NT63: I see that NT63 \u2192 t3, correct? Wait, wait, in the given mappings:\n\nWait, let me look again. The given rules for NT62 to NT99. Hmm, when I see the list:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT65 is mapped to 't5', NT64 to 't4', NT62 to 't3', NT69 to 't0', etc. But then, I need to check each production to see if any NTs are terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake earlier. In CNF, terminals are leaves, and non-terminals are internal nodes. So, are the symbols on the right side terminals or non-terminals? In the given grammar, it's CNF, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So on the right-hand side, if a symbol is followed by a terminal, that's a terminal. So, for example, NT62 is a non-terminal, as it has multiple productions, and each production either splits into two non-terminals or is a terminal. Wait, no\u2014each production must consist of exactly one non-terminal on the left, and on the right, exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify. In Chomsky normal form, the right-hand side can be two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So for example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63: both NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals, because they have further productions. Wait, but NT68 is a terminal, because in the given mappings, NT68 \u2192 t2. No, wait, that's not correct. Because in CNF, the right-hand side must be either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if NT68 has a production that maps to a terminal, it's a terminal symbol. So looking at the given grammar:\n\nFor example, NT68 has a production to 't2', which is a terminal. So in the rule NT68 \u2192 NT89 NT60 is one production, and NT68 \u2192 t2 is another. Wait, this can't be, because in a context-free grammar, a non-terminal has only one production that is applicable for each occurrence in a derivation. But in this case, NT68 has multiple productions, some to terminals and others to non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no\u2014that's allowed because each occurrence of NT68 can choose any of its productions. So NT68 can be either a terminal or a non-terminal, depending on which production is used. So for example, when we have S \u2192 NT68 NT63, each NT68 and NT63 can independently be replaced by their respective symbols. Since NT68 can produce either a terminal or non-terminals, depending on the production, I need to consider each possibility.\n\nBut wait, the way the string is given is that it's a sequence of all terminals. So to produce a string of terminals, all non-terminals in the derivation must eventually be replaced by terminals.\n\nSo for S to derive a string of terminals, its productions must eventually lead to all terminals.\n\nWait, let's consider S's possible derivations. Let's see:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then NT68 can produce t2, and NT63 can produce t3. So the string becomes t2 t3.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT64 NT78. NT64 \u2192 t4, NT78 \u2192 t2. So that would give t4 t2.\n\nOption 3: S \u2192 NT62 NT74. NT62 \u2192 perhaps t3 (if NT62 is t3), and NT74. NT74 \u2192 t3. So that would be t3 t3.\n\nBut the target string is t2 t3 t1 t1 t1 t1 t4 t3, which is 8 tokens. So obviously, we need more productions because none of the initial S productions lead directly to longer strings.\n\nWait, maybe S can derive further, but in this case, since S produces two symbols, each of which could be terminals or non-terminals. If either of them is a non-terminal, it may produce more symbols.\n\nSo, in the initial S \u2192 NT68 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-106","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string `t0 t3 t0 t5 t3 t1 t4 t0` can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means every production has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given string, I see it's a sequence of terminals: t0, t3, t0, t5, t3, t1, t4, t0. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So initially, any valid derivation from S must expand to one of these two.\n\nI'll list out the productions for the NTs that lead to terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t0, NT64 \u2192 t3, NT78 \u2192 t3. Also, NT26 \u2192 t2, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t0. Let's see which NTs produce t0: NT63, NT69, NT9 \u2192 t5, etc. So the first step is to see if the grammar can produce t0 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t0. Let's find which NTs produce t0. Looking through the NT productions, I see NT63 \u2192 t0, NT69 \u2192 t0, NT96 \u2192 t5, but not others. So the first symbol t0 can come from NT63 or NT69.\n\nBut the initial productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So if the first part is NT68, it can't produce t0 directly because NT68 \u2192 t3. Similarly, NT64 \u2192 t3, NT78 \u2192 t3. So S's initial productions can't lead to t0 because the first symbols are t3, t3, etc. Hmm, that's confusing because the string starts with t0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the NT productions again. Oh wait, maybe S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but NT68 could expand into more NTs, and eventually, one of those NTs might produce t0.\n\nWait, but the problem is that S's initial productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT68 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78, etc. No, looking back, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the first step from S will involve these.\n\nBut the string starts with t0. So let me check the NTs that can derive t0.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t0\n- NT69 \u2192 t0\n- NT77 \u2192 t3\n- NT88 \u2192 t4\n- NT93 \u2192 t0? Wait, NT93 in the productions is listed as NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66, and NT39 is a production \u2192 t0. So NT93 can derive t0 via NT39\u2192t0 and NT66\u2192t3. Wait, no, NT66 \u2192 t3 as per NT66 \u2192 t3. So if NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66, and NT39 \u2192 t0, then NT93 \u2192 t0 t3. So NT93 would produce the string t0 t3. But in our case, the string starts with t0, followed by t3, so that's possible.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each production is in the form of A \u2192 BC, which is two symbols. So for example, NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66. So the only way NT93 can produce t0 is if NT39 produces t0 (which it does) and NT66 doesn't produce a terminal, but wait, no. Because NT66 \u2192 t3, so NT93 would produce t0 t3.\n\nSo if a NT93 can produce t0 t3, which matches the first two symbols of the input string: t0 t3. That's a possibility.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm:\n\nThe first production from S is either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3 (since NT68 \u2192 t3)\n- NT63 \u2192 t0 \n\nSo the first two symbols would be t3 t0, which doesn't match our string's t0 t3. So that's not the case.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\n- NT64 \u2192 t3\n- NT78 \u2192 t3\n\nSo the first two symbols would be t3 t3, again not matching.\n\nWait, that's a problem. That suggests that the initial step from S can only produce t3 or t3 or t3 t3, not t0 or t0 followed by anything. So how can our string start with t0? It seems impossible.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the NT68 or NT64 can expand further. Maybe NT68 can derive NTs that eventually lead to t0. But looking at NT68's productions:\n\nLooking up NT68 in the grammar:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT62 NT62\n\nWait, no, the initial NT68 is part of S, but perhaps it's a non-terminal that can expand into more NTs. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the NT68, the rows go like:\n\nLooking for NT68:\n\nWait, the list is a bit long. Let's find where NT68 is.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, find the lines starting with NT68.\n\nLooking, the relevant ones are:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT62 NT69 \u2192 t3 t0 t0?\n\nWait, no, NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT62 NT69.\n\nThen NT66 \u2192 t3.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93, which then?\n\nWait, NT3 is t4.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to model the entire derivation, but perhaps that's too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT64 NT78, each of which produces t3, but that would only give t3 t3 as the first two symbols. Therefore, the given string starting with t0 t3 is not possible, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that only the initial production from S gives the first two symbols. Maybe there's a way for NT68 or NT64 to derive a t0 through more steps.\n\nWait, let's re-examine NT68. NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT62 NT69.\n\nSo NT68 can break down into three parts: NT66, NT62, and NT69. Now, let's see what these produce:\n\nNT66 \u2192 t3 (as per the line NT66 \u2192 t3)\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93 (line NT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93)\n\nNT3 \u2192 t4\n\nWait, NT3 \u2192 t4, so NT62 would produce t4 and then whatever NT93 can produce. Wait, but NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66 (line NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66). NT39 \u2192 t0, and NT66 \u2192 t3. So NT93 \u2192 t0 t3. Therefore, NT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93 \u2192 t4 t0 t3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT62 NT69 \u2192 t3 (from NT66) * (from NT62) * t0 (from NT69). Wait, but this would be t3 (nt66) followed by t4 (nt3) t0 (nt93) t3 (nt3 again?) Or perhaps I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, actually, the production S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would expand NT68 and NT63 as:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT62 NT69\n\n NT63 \u2192 t0\n\nSo the entire production would be NT66 NT62 NT69 t0.\n\nBut let's see what NT66, NT62, and NT69 produce:\n\nNT66 \u2192 t3 \n\nNT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93 \u2192 t4 t0 (since NT93 \u2192 t0 t3? Wait, no: NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66 \u2192 t0 t3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Maybe I should map out the entire possible derivation from S.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to note that S can only produce strings starting with t3 or something else, but in this case, the string starts with t0"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-131","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the string `t0 t4 t3 t2 t0 t1 t1 t3 t0` is generated by the given grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Chomsky Normal Form grammars have rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals which are the base cases. So, the string we're analyzing is a series of terminals, each likely corresponding to the results of the production rules.\n\nGiven the string: t0, t4, t3, t2, t0, t1, t1, t3, t0.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, the grammar's productions are S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78. But when I look at the grammar, the non-terminals like NT68 and NT64 are defined. Wait, no\u2014looking at the provided grammar, it's actually the non-terminals like NT85 that produce t2, t3, etc., and some non-terminals reduce to other non-terminals, like NT65 -> NT97 NT65. Wait, that can't be right because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production should have two non-terminals. But NT65 is on both sides, so that might be a mistake. Wait, looking again, perhaps I misread: the grammar shows something like NT65 -> NT97 NT65. That's a problem because it would create a cycle unless it's a terminal. But in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions should be to non-terminals except terminals. Wait, but in the provided grammar, some rules like NT65 -> 't5' and others reduce to terminals. So, perhaps NT65 is a non-terminal that eventually reduces to 't5'.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to parse the grammar properly.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So each production for S is two non-terminals. Now, each of those non-terminals, like NT68 and NT63, are also non-terminals and have their own productions.\n\nLooking at NT68: it's defined as NT68 -> NT63 NT81. NT63 is also a non-terminal. Then NT63 -> NT84 NT62. NT84 goes to NT89 NT38, which further breaks down. NT89 is 't5', I think. Let me check: NT89 -> 't5'. So NT89 is a terminal that produces 't5'. Similarly, NT38 can produce 't2', for instance, in multiple rules.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting lost. Maybe I should approach this by trying to see if the given string can be generated by following the productions. The string is nine elements long, so it's a sequence of t0, t4, t3, t2, t0, t1, t1, t3, t0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent this as a parse tree. Each non-terminal produces two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals. The string we're given should match a leftmost derivation or something similar.\n\nLet's start from S.\n\nOption 1: S can produce NT68 NT63.\nThen NT68 -> NT63 NT81.\nAnd NT63 -> NT84 NT62.\nWait, but this might get complicated. Maybe I should look for a way to connect the terminals in the string to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by working backwards, using a CYK-like parsing algorithm, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nWait, but I'm not too familiar with the entire parsing process for a general CNF grammar. Maybe I can try to find a production sequence that would lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see which terminals correspond to non-terminals. The string is t0, t4, t3, t2, t0, t1, t1, t3, t0.\n\nSo each t is a terminal, and the rest are part of the non-terminals. Let me see which non-terminals produce t0, t4, etc.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT22 -> NT62 NT74 (which might lead to more non-terminals)\nWait, but looking for t0, t4, t3, etc.\n\nLet me list each terminal and their origin:\n\n- t0: From NT69, NT75, NT26, NT19, NT63 (because NT63 reduces to NT84 NT62, which then reduces to ... Wait, no: NT63 is a non-terminal, so it will break down into more symbols until it reaches a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to map each terminal in the string to a production.\n\nStarting with t0:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT69 -> 't0', NT75 -> 't0', NT26 -> 't0', and NT47 -> 't3' (but that's a different t code). Wait, but t0 is 't3' in some cases. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT69 isn't a non-terminal; it's a production that reduces to 't2'. Wait, looking at the rules, NT69 -> 't2', right? Because in the given grammar, looking at NT69: no, actually, I'm a bit confused. Wait, at the top of the provided grammar, I see that S -> NT68 NT63 and S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nThen, looking at the rules, some are like NT62 -> NT48 NT0.

Here are some key ones:\n\n- NT68 -> NT63 NT81\n- NT63 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT84 -> NT89 NT38\n- NT38 can produce t2, t3, etc.\n- NT69 -> 't2'\n- NT75 -> 't5'\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals reduce directly to the required terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t0, which occurs at position 0. So we need a production that leads to t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals reduce to 't0'?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT69: Looking back, NT69 -> 't2', so no, that's t2. What about NT26: NT26 -> 't2' or NT26 -> NT32 NT17.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT26 appears in several places:\n\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> NT32 NT17\n\nSo if a non-terminal produces NT26, which either is 't2' or further breaks down.\n\nSimilarly, NT0: NT0 -> NT48 NT47, which then break down further, but maybe one of those leads to t3 or something.\n\nLooking for t0 in the string, position 0: so we need a path that produces t0.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t0 as a terminal:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT directly that produce 't0' except perhaps:\n\nWait, let me check all the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT69 -> 't2'\n- NT75 -> 't5'\n- NT26 -> 't2' or NT26 -> NT32 NT17\n- NT70: Not sure, need to check the rules.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT85 -> 't2'\n- NT75 -> 't5'\n- NT26 -> 't2' (at least one rule is 't2')\n- NT19 -> 't3'\n- NT65 -> 't5'\n- NT45 -> 't5'\n- NT18 -> 't5'\n- NT30: Not sure, but looking for terminals, perhaps in the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps looking through the rules, NT26 can produce 't2' directly, but I'm looking for 't0'. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the string is t0, t4, t3, t2, t0, t1, t1, t3, t0. So the first part is t0.\n\nSo I need a path that starts with t0. Maybe S can't directly produce t0 because S's rules produce two non-terminals. So the first two symbols t0 must come from the two non-terminals produced by S.\n\nWait, S can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So t0 must come from one of these.

{"custom_id":"request-128","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is \"t5 t4 t3 t5 t0 t1 t0 t0 t5\". \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Importantly, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to conform to CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of symbols, each of which corresponds to a terminal symbol. In this grammar, many of these terminals are 't' followed by a number, like t0, t1, etc., but not all. Wait, looking back, the grammar does not have rules for other terminals like 't1', 't2', etc. Instead, the given string has only 't3', 't4', 't5', 't0', etc. So perhaps in this context, the grammar only uses these terminals.\n\nI also notice that each production rule in the grammar always results in two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except some are terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 implies that S can be expanded into two non-terminals, NT68 and NT63. Each of these non-terminals likely leads further into other productions.\n\nThe string is t5 t4 t3 t5 t0 t1 t0 t0 t5. Let me think about how the grammar can generate this. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation of the string should correspond to splitting the string into a sequence of two symbols at a time, each of which is a terminal or non-terminal, and then expanding those into the appropriate productions.\n\nBut wait, since all the productions are two non-terminals except some terminate with a single terminal, the parse tree must start from S and expand step by step until only terminals are left.\n\nLet me try building a parse tree for the string. \n\nStarting with S, which expands into NT68 and NT63. Each of those non-terminals will then expand further. But I need to know exactly which non-terminals correspond to each token in the string. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, there are several non-terminals that expand into 't's. For example, NT94 \u2192 't2', NT97 \u2192 't5', NT75 \u2192 't3', NT38 \u2192 't3', NT47 \u2192 't5', and so on. Similarly, NT68, NT63, etc., may eventually expand into 't's.\n\nGiven that, I can create a mapping of each production to their corresponding 't' or another non-terminal. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT75 \u2192 t3, so combining them would give t3 t3. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 t2, and so forth.\n\nWait, perhaps I can create a breakdown:\n\nLooking at the string t5 t4 t3 t5 t0 t1 t0 t0 t5, the length is 9 tokens. Since each production consumes either one or two non-terminals, but in this case, initial productions are to two non-terminals, implying two tokens at each step. However, the string has an odd number, which might require the last step to be an NT that produces a terminal.\n\nBut 9 is odd, which could imply that the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals, each of which then expands into more, until the entire string is built.\n\nAlternatively, the start symbol S, which is the top, may need to expand in such a way that the total number of symbols produced is exactly the length of the input string.\n\nWait, let's think about how the number of symbols increases. Each production rule either keeps the same number of symbols (if two non-terminals) or reduces it by one (if a terminal). So starting from S, the number of symbols is 2 (S \u2192 NT68 NT63). Each production leads to more symbols or not. Since the given string has 9 symbols, the number of steps should correspond to 9 - 2 + 1? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, each step can increase the count by 1 (if two non-terminals expand into two more) or stay the same (if a non-terminal expands into two non-terminals). Wait, no: each production either replaces one non-terminal into two non-terminals, keeping the count the same, or a terminal which doesn't change the count.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this by actually trying to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me start by identifying which non-terminals expand into each token in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many NTs produce 't' followed by a number. Let's note down their expansions:\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't2'\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n- NT18 \u2192 't0'\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT69 \u2192 't2'\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT47 \u2192 't5'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n- NT99 \u2192 't5'\n- NT20 \u2192 't5'\n- NT74 \u2192 't1'\n- NT27 \u2192 't5'\n- NT42 \u2192 't1'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT33 \u2192 't0'\n- NT60 \u2192 't3'\n- NT48 \u2192 't3'\n- NT19 \u2192 't3'\n- NT58 \u2192 't3'\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'\n- NT39 \u2192 't0'\n- NT45 \u2192 't5' (wait, NT45 also appears elsewhere)\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT75 \u2192 't1' (wait, what's NT75?)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT75 is defined as:\n\nNT75 -> 't3'\n\nHmm, another occurrence of NT75 as 't3' earlier.\n\nWait, some non-terminals have multiple rules, but in CNF, each rule is separate. So if NT75 has two rules, one to 't3' and another to 't1', but in the given grammar, checking:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar with multiple rules, and for NT75, it says:\n\nNT75 -> 't3'\n\nNT75 -> 't1'\n\nSo actually, NT75 has two possible expansions: one to 't3' and another to 't1'. That complicates things because the same non-terminal can lead to different terminals.\n\nNow, considering the input string, which includes t5, t4, t3, t5, t0, t1, t0, t0, t5. \n\nI need to find a derivation that matches this string.\n\nThis might be a bit tedious, but let me try to outline the process.\n\nThe initial symbol is S. S expands into NT68 and NT63.\n\nSo:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nNow, NT68 and NT63 each need to expand further. Let's see their productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 \u2192 t68, but wait, looking at the rules, is there a rule for NT68? Checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3', because near the end, 't68' is defined as 't3' (wait, no). Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, looking again, for NT68, does it produce a terminal or non-terminal? Scanning through all the productions, I see:\n\nI notice that there is NT68 \u2192 't3' because one of the rules says:\n\n\"NT68 -> t3\"\n\nSimilarly, NT63 has a rule NT63 \u2192 't3'. Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nYes, towards the end:\n\nNT63 -> 't3'\n\nSo, both NT68 and NT63 produce 't3'. \n\nSo, the initial production gives us 't3' 't3'. But the string we have starts with 't5', not 't3', so that's a problem. Wait, that can't be right. Because if S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and both NT68 and NT63 produce 't3', then S would expand directly to 't3 t3', but the string starts with 't5'.\n\nThat suggests that either the grammar is different, or I'm misunderstanding the grammar rules. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the user-provided grammar, the production for S is:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo, maybe I misunderstood the NT68 and NT64.

First, I should understand how the grammar works and how the string fits into it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals are various symbols like S, NT68, NT63, etc., and the terminals are strings of 't' followed by numbers, like t0, t3, etc., and also some are words like 't2', etc. Wait, actually, in the grammar, there are some entries where the non-terminals are replaced by terminal symbols. For example, NT75 -> 't3', so 't3' is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Similarly, NT69 -> 't0', etc.\n\nThe initial step is to parse the string from left to right, trying to find a derivation path that matches the entire string. The string is a sequence of t0, t1, etc., which are the terminals. So each symbol in the string must be matched by expanding a non-terminal according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list the string sequence again to see the order:\nt3, t4, t1, t0, t3, t0, t2, t3, t1, t0.\n\nI notice that some of these are terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I see some entries where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. For example:\n- NT75 -> 't3'\n- NT69 -> 't0'\n- NT38 -> 't5'\n- NT81 -> 't3'\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT97 -> 't5'\n- And so on.\n\nSo, the terminals are the non-terminals that directly map to a single character. Any other production either breaks down into more non-terminals or other terminals.\n\nTo approach this, maybe I can try to start by identifying which parts of the string can be produced by the start symbol S. The start symbol S can produce two options: S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nLet's break it down. S is the start, so the string must come from either NT68 followed by NT63 or NT64 followed by NT78.\n\nLet me look at the string:\nThe first two symbols are t3 and t4, then t1, t0, t3, t0, t2, t3, t1, t0.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t3.

{"custom_id":"request-145","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the string `t3 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t0 t2 t0 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It seems to have a series of productions where each non-terminal (like S, NT68) breaks down into other non-terminals and eventually into terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number). \n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, the grammar has two main productions: \n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either the expansion of NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. \n\nLet's break down each of these nt's into their components:\n\nFor NT68: It seems to produce t3 directly. So the first symbol in the string must be t3 if it comes from NT68.\n\nFor NT63: From the list, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Then NT84 \u2192 t3 (from NT84 \u2192 t3), and NT62 \u2192 t3 (from NT62 \u2192 t6 which then via NT62 \u2192 t3 via NT62's production). So NT63 would produce t3 t3.\n\nPutting that together, the first two symbols would be t3 t3.\n\nWait, but the input string starts with t3 t0. That means after t3, the next should be t3, but according to the initial production S \u2192 NT68 NT63, the first part is NT68 (t3) and NT63 (which should be t3 t3). So the first four symbols should be t3 t3 t3 t3. But our string starts with t3 t0. So this path doesn't seem to match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial NT68 is followed by something else? Wait, looking back:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65; but that's not directly involved here. Alternatively, let's check all possible NT68 productions.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, does NT68 have any rules beyond the trivial ones? For example, NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT68? Because I see for NT85 it's NT18 NT8, but not seeing NT68's rules.\n\nWait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT85 \u2192 NT18 NT8\n- NT68 seems to be a terminal? Wait, wait. The grammar is in CNF, so any symbol on the left must either be a terminal or a non-terminal introducing two symbols on the right.\n\nWait, let's check the definitions:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, for example:\n\nNT68 is on the left of \u2192. Its production is:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any line where NT68 is on the left. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's recheck the list:\n\nLooking for NT68 \u2192...\n\nScanning through:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65\n- NT69 \u2192 NT26 NT42\n- NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n- NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9\n- NT72 \u2192 NT9 NT85\n- NT52 \u2192 NT17 NT24\n- NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17\n- NT18 \u2192 NT67 NT94\n- NT98 \u2192 NT23 NT38\n- NT39 \u2192 NT27 NT97\n- NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66\n- NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT75 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, so actually, NT68 is never listed on the left-hand side of any production. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nThen, various rules for other NTs, like NT0, NT2, etc., and some are terminals (like NT75 \u2192 't0'). But I'm not seeing NT68 or NT63 as non-terminals except in the initial productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check whether NT68 is only on the left of S. Let me go through all the productions:\n\n- S -> NT68 NT63\n- S -> NT64 NT78\n\nThen, NT68 is not used elsewhere except in S. Similarly, NT63 is not in any other productions.\n\nSo, in the grammar, NT68 and NT63 are only on the left of S. So, their only productions are under S.\n\nWait, but that would mean that NT68 and NT63 are terminals because they don't have any rules. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread, and NT68 is a non-terminal but only appears inside other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the list again. Let me see:\n\nLooking for NT68:\n\n- I see NT85 \u2192 NT18 NT8\n- NT66 is defined as NT66 \u2192 NT33 NT66 (is that correct? Wait, no. Wait, let me check each NT:\n\nWait, let me go through each non-terminal line:\n\n1. NT68 appears on the left? No, only on the right:\nLooking for \"NT68\" in the entire list. I see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63: so NT68 is on the left, production.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, in the given grammar list, it's presented as S -> NT68 NT63, so that's the initial production.\n\nSo, for NT68, there is a production in the initial rule. Are there any other productions for NT68?\n\nLooking through all lines, elsewhere does NT68 appear on the left? For example:\n\nNo, in the given list, the only NT68 is in the S's left-hand side. So does that mean NT68 is a terminal or a non-terminal with other productions?\n\nWait, that can't be. If NT68 is only present on S's production, but no other rules, then NT68 must be a variable with no further rules, which would cause it to be a terminal. Because in Chomsky Normal Form, variables have exactly two non-terminals on the right.\n\nWait, but in our case, S \u2192 NT68 NT63. If NT68 can't be further expanded (as per the given grammar, since all other NTs have their own productions except NT68 and NT63, which are on the left of S), then NT68 would be a terminal, as it's on the left of S but has no further rules.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. In the grammar, S's production is S\u2192NT68 NT63. If NT68 and NT63 have no other productions, they are terminals, and thus S is a terminal symbol? But the problem states that the string contains 't3', which are terminals, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but looking again, I think I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar list. For example, checking S: the initial productions are S\u2192NT68 NT63 and S\u2192NT64 NT78. So, if NT68 and NT63 have no other definitions, they are terminals, meaning that when S is produced, it directly produces those two terminal symbols.\n\nSimilarly, maybe NT64 and NT78 are terminals, but looking in the list, I see:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 NT64 NT18\nWait, that's under NT67: so it produces NT64 and NT18.\n\nBut in S\u2192NT68 NT63, if NT68 and NT63 are terminals, then the string generated by S would consist of two terminal symbols. For example, S could derive a string like t68 t63, but since in our case, we're dealing with 't3' etc., perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misread, and there are more productions for NT68 and NT63.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT68 and NT63 in the production list. Let's search for NT68 in the list, not on the left, but on the right.\n\nLooking through all production rules:\n\nLooking for any line that ends with NT68 or starts with NT68.\n\nWait, S is the only starts with NT, and in the first two lines, it's S starts with NT68 and NT64.\n\nLooking through the rest:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65\n- NT69 \u2192 NT26 NT42\n- NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n- NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9\n- NT72 \u2192 NT9 NT85\n- NT52 \u2192 NT17 NT24\n- NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17\n- NT18"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the structure of the grammar and the possible productions. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Each of these NTs, like NT68, NT63, etc., are non-terminals that produce other NTs or terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nLooking at the productions, each non-terminal seems to either directly produce a terminal or split into two non-terminals which could further split. Chomsky normal form typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, all the non-terminals on the right-hand side are either terminals or non-terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 NT63, which would mean it's producing another non-terminal, but then sometimes those non-terminals lead directly to terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking closely, the grammar seems like each rule only has non-terminals except for some where they produce terminals. For example, NT65 \u2192 NT96 NT65 isn't possible because it can't reduce, so maybe I misread\u2014if the grammar is in CNF, each production should have only two non-terminals or a terminal. So maybe I need to check if all rules are correct, but I'll proceed assuming they are.\n\nNow, the string we have is a sequence of t3, t3, t3, t3, t3, t1, t0, t2, t4, t0, t1. Let's see if this sequence can be derived from S.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So the length of the string produced by S would have to be 2, since each production is two non-terminals, and each of those can be terminals or more non-terminals. Wait no, because each NT can produce a terminal or two non-terminals. So depending on how they expand, the length can vary.\n\nWait, each NT production is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, except some produce terminals. So each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals until some point when a non-terminal actually produces a terminal.\n\nSo the given string has 11 tokens, which is an odd number, but each step in the grammar expansion adds one token, so starting from one, it's possible to get an odd number. Hmm, 11 is possible, but need to check the structure.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be built. Let's look at each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n- NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90\n- NT2 \u2192 NT67 NT20\n- NT3 \u2192 NT8\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT8\n- NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT6 \u2192 NT46 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT18 NT94\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT10 \u2192 ?\nWait, the given string has t0, t1, t2, etc., but the grammar defines certain non-terminals as producing these. Let's list each t_i:\n\n- t0: Looking at the rules, NT66 \u2192 NT26 NT62, and looking through the rules, I don't see any that produce t0 except NT65, which has NT97 NT62, but none seem to go directly to t0. Wait the provided rules for NT0 is NT48 NT47, but also, looking at lower parts, NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18. Let me check the 't0' productions. In the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT97 \u2192 't5'\n- NT33 \u2192 't0'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT96 \u2192 't5'\n- NT33 \u2192 't0'\nLooking further:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62, but 't0' is not among these. Wait, looking at the provided rules, I see NT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94, and NT13 \u2192 't3', but I don't see NT33 \u2192 't0' except in line 93: NT93 -> NT39 NT66 and line 63: NT63 -> NT84 NT62. However, looking further, in the rules, there's a line: NT63 -> 't4'? Wait, no, looking carefully:\n\nIn the given grammar, line 79: NT63 -> NT84 NT62. Line 80: NT75 \u2192 't3'. Line 81: NT26 \u2192 't2'. Line 49: NT38 \u2192 't3'. Line 66: NT33 \u2192 't0'? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT69 -> 't0' on line 109: NT69 \u2192 't0'. So NT69 can produce t0. So perhaps the initial NT96 might have a path to NT69.\n\nWait, in the start rule, S can produce S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Let's see what each can produce. NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, and NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98. So NT14 can produce NT1 and NT98. NT98 \u2192 NT58 NT65, which then would go to NT58 and NT65. NT58: NT58 \u2192 NT28 NT28. Wait, looking at the rules: I don't see NT58, but looking further. Wait, no: NT58 is mentioned as NT58 \u2192 NT28 NT28, but wait, no, looking through, I see line 57: NT12 \u2192 't5', line 67: NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT69, line ... Wait, maybe it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trying to see which t's are generated by which NTs. For example, t0 is produced by NT69, so to get t0 in the string, the derivation must reach NT69.\n\nSimilarly, t1 is produced by NT1, which is nt1 \u2192 nt88 nt90, and then nt88 \u2192 't4', which is line 45: NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90, but then NT88 \u2192 't4' is not directly, looking: line 84: NT82 \u2192 't0' (though not in this case). Wait, in the provided rules, line 44: NT88 \u2192 NT58 NT65. Wait, no, line 44: NT88 is actually not there. Let me check the provided rules:\n\nWait, in the given rules, after line 3 is:\n\nLine 45: NT44 -> NT58 NT28.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the provided rules, NT88 is line 45: NT88 \u2192 NT45 NT47, and that's line 45: NT88 \u2192 't4'. So wait, no: line 45 says NT88 \u2192 NT45 NT47, which are both non-terminals, but then lines 47, 51, etc., have more non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me organize this.\n\nFirst, each production is of the form NTx \u2192 something.\n\nWe need to see which non-terminals can produce each t_i.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, let's note which NTs produce each t_i:\n\n- t0: NT0 (line 1), NT3 (line 16), NT26 (line 113: NT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93 but wait, not t0), NT26 (line 114: NT72 \u2192 't0'? No, line 113: NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66, and NT97 \u2192 't5', NT69 \u2192 't0', NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, etc.\n\nWait, line 93: NT93 \u2192 't3' no, wait line 93 is NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66. Line 94: NT17 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through the provided rules and see which NTs produce which t's. Let me list each t and which NT can produce it:\n\nt0:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't0' (line 109).\n- NT93 \u2192 't0'?

{"custom_id":"request-165","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t2 t4 t0 t2 t1 t4 t5 t1 t1 t2 t1`, and the grammar is quite extensive. \n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF means. CNF is a form where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, and algorithms like the CYK algorithm can be used to check for membership in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to have a few non-terminals (like S, NT62, NT81, etc.) and terminals like t0, t1, t2, etc. The start symbol is S, which has the productions S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the initial step is to see if the entire string can be derived from either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals: t2, t4, t0, t2, t1, t4, t5, t1, t1, t2, t1. Let's break this down. Since S produces two non-terminals, the string must be a combination of the strings derived from these two non-terminals concatenated together.\n\nSo, first, I'll split the string into two parts corresponding to NT68 \u2192 ... and NT63 \u2192 ..., or NT64 \u2192 ... and NT78 \u2192 .... But wait, actually, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78, which means the string is either the concatenation of NT68's derivation and NT63's, or NT64's and NT78's.\n\nLet me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, split the string into two parts. Let's see how long the entire string is: 11 tokens. So, the split could be after the first k tokens for k from 1 to 10. The first part would be derived from NT68, and the second from NT63. Alternatively, the first part from NT64 and second from NT78.\n\nI'll start by considering S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the string should be NT68's derivation followed by NT63's.\n\nLet me look at what each non-terminal can produce. NT68 is mentioned in the grammar, and looking at the productions, NT68 \u2192 't3'. So NT68 directly produces 't3'. So the first token must be 't3' if it comes from NT68. But looking at the string, the first token is 't2'. That doesn't match. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63 might not be the right path since the first token is 't2' and NT68 produces 't3'.\n\nNext, let's consider S \u2192 NT64 NT78. NT64 \u2192 't3' and NT78 \u2192 't3' according to the grammar. So the first token from NT64 would be 't3' and the first token from NT78 would be 't3'. But in the string, the first token is 't2'. So that doesn't fit either. Wait, that can't be right because 't2' is not 't3'. So if S \u2192 NT64 NT78, then the first part would start with 't3' from NT64 and the second part starts with 't3' from NT78. But our string starts with 't2', which doesn't match either 't3' options. Therefore, maybe the string is being generated through a longer path, not directly from the top-level productions.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the grammar more carefully.

This is helpful because it simplifies parsing, and we can use algorithms like CYK or recursive descent with a stack-based approach.\n\nNext, I'll examine the start symbol.

Hmm, maybe NT68's children can produce \"t2\" or maybe NT64.\n\nWait, let me check each of the starting options:\n\nS can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nSo for the string to start with \"t2\", the first NT must produce \"t2\", which could be either NT68 or NT64.\n\nLooking at NT68: NT68 -> NT66 NT26. So NT66 and NT26. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT66 -> NT45 NT47. NT45 -> NT89 NT38, which gives t5 and t5 (since NT89 -> t5, NT38 -> t5). So NT45 gives \"t5\" in the terminal symbol. Then NT47 can produce t5.\n\nSo NT66 would give \"t5 t5\". Wait, no, NT45 -> t5, NT38 -> t5? Wait, no: looking at NT45's production: NT45 -> NT89 NT38, and NT89 -> t5, NT38 -> t3 (wait, no, looking back, NT38 is defined as NT38 -> 't3' as a production. So NT38 is 't3', yes. And NT89 is 't5' as per the rules. So, NT45 is 't5 t3'.\n\nThen, NT66 is NT45 NT47, so 't5 t3' and then NT47, which can have multiple productions. Wait, NT47 has several rules:\n\nNT47 -> NT85 NT13 (which is 't2 t3'), NT47 -> NT28 NT22 (each is 't1 t4'), or other options. Wait, but the string starts with \"t2\", so maybe if NT47 can produce \"t2\", but looking at NT47's rules, none of them directly produce \"t2\" as a terminal symbol. Oh, wait: looking at the given productions, NT47 has rules that lead to terminal symbols when deeper productions are considered.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the levels. Let me track this properly.\n\nLet me try to see if a particular path could lead to \"t2 t4 t1...\" and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for each step in the given string and see if at each step, the correct symbols are produced.\n\nThe given string is: t2, t4, t1, t2, t5, t1, t0, t1, t2, t4, t4, t3.\n\nLet me write it out: t2 t4 t1 t2 t5 t1 t0 t1 t2 t4 t4 t3.\n\nStarting with t2. So the first part must come from either S->NT68 NT63 or S->NT64 NT78.\n\nAssuming the first symbol is t2, then if it's from NT68, NT68 must produce t2 in the first step. Let's see:\n\nNT68 -> NT66 NT26.\n\nSo the first two symbols would be the results of NT66 and NT26. So the string should split into (NT66 symbols) followed by (NT26 symbols).\n\nBut the first symbol is t2, which isn't just from NT68. Since NT68 -> NT66 NT26, which then produce symbols in order. So for NT66, let's see.\n\nNT66 -> NT45 NT47. NT45 -> t5 NT38 (which is t3). Wait, no: actually, NT45 -> NT89 NT38. NT89 -> t5, and NT38 -> t3. So NT45 is t5, and then NT38 is t3. So NT45 is t5 followed by t3, making \"t5 t3\". Then NT47, which can have multiple options.\n\nLooking at NT47's options:\n\n1. NT47 -> NT85 NT13: NT85 -> t2, NT13 -> t3. So this production yields \"t2 t3\".\n\n2. NT47 -> NT28 NT22: NT28 -> t1, NT22 -> t4. Yields \"t1 t4\".\n\n3. Other options for NT47 involve further non-terminals that eventually produce t5, t3, etc.\n\nBut the first symbol is t2. So if NT66 produces \"t5 t3\", and then NT47 produces \"t2 t3\" or \"t1 t4\", but looking for the first symbol to be t2, the only way is if NT47's first symbol is t2. But looking at the NT47 rules, none of them immediately produce a terminal symbol. Instead, they split into two non-terminals, which then produce terminals.\n\nWait, so that suggests that NT47 can never produce a terminal symbol on its own. So if NT68 is pushing NT66 and NT26, and NT66 produces \"t5 t3\", then NT47 must produce something that starts with t2, but that's impossible because all our NT47 rules produce two symbols, which could be something like t2 t3 or t1 t4, but the first symbol is part of the overall string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should consider that each step in the productions leads to terminal symbols, and the entire string must match the sequence of symbols from left to right, branching out as necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string corresponds to multiple splits, and I need to track possible paths.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, keeping track of the possible NTs at each step.\n\nStart with the first symbol, t2. So the start must be from either S->NT68 NT63 or S->NT64 NT78. Let's see:\n\nIf we choose S->NT68 NT63, then the first symbol comes from NT68. So NT68 must produce t2 as its first symbol. Let's see how NT68 can produce t2.\n\nNT68 -> NT66 NT26. So NT66 must produce something that starts with t2. Let's look at NT66's production.\n\nNT66 -> NT45 NT47. So NT66's first symbol is t5 (NT45 -> NT89 NT38, which gives t5 and then t3). So the first symbol is t5, not t2. Therefore, this path doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if we take S->NT64 NT78, then the first symbol comes from NT64. Let's see if NT64 can produce t2.\n\nLooking at NT64, it has a production NT64 -> NT60 NT14.\n\nNT60 -> NT68 NT18. NT18 -> NT50 NT38.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string from the beginning, step by step.\n\nThe given string is: t2 t4 t1 t2 t5 t1 t0 t1 t2 t4 t4 t3.\n\nI'll start with t2.\n\nAssuming the first token comes from NT68, since S can start with NT68. So NT68 -> NT66 NT26.\n\nNT66 produces NT45 NT47. So the first two tokens should be from NT45 and NT47.\n\nNT45 -> NT89 NT38. So first token from NT45 is t5.\n\nSo string starts with t5?\n\nBut the first token is t2, so this can't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is structured with a start symbol S and a bunch of production rules. Each rule takes a non-terminal to two other non-terminals or a terminal. Chomsky Normal Form has all production rules as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so this grammar fits since all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t0 to t5 and t3, t1, etc. These are likely terminals. The non-terminals are the nodes before these t's, like S, NT, and various NT numbers.\n\nThe string is all terminals, so we need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions. Let's break down the string into parts: `t3 t1 t3 t1 t4 t0 t5 t0 t5 t0 t4 t3`.\n\nI notice that the first symbol is t3. Let's see what non-terminals produce t3. Looking at the production rules, NT66 produces t3: NT66 -> t3. Similarly, NT47 can produce t3, like NT47 -> NT85 nt13, and NT13 -> t3, so NT47 via that path also gives t3.\n\nSimilarly, t1 is produced by NT65 via NT65 -> nt97 nt65, but wait, no, looking at the rules: NT65 -> NT97 nt65? Or wait, looking again, NT65 has a rule NT65 -> nt97 nt65? Or maybe I should list all the rules for each NT ending with a terminal.\n\nWait, let me list all the production rules that result in terminals. From the grammar:\n\n- NT66 -> t3\n- NT47 -> t3 (since we saw NT47 -> NT85 NT13, and NT13 -> t3; so the production NT47 can eventually derive t3)\n- NT94 -> t2 (but that's not relevant here)\n- NT50 -> t4\n- NT18 -> t1\n- NT2 -> t3\n- NT88 -> t47 (which then leads to other terminals)\n- NT84 -> t3\n- NT42 -> t1\n- NT96 -> t5\n- NT33 -> t0\n- NT12 -> t5\n- NT27 -> t5\n- NT47 -> t5 via some other rules (e.g., NT47 -> NT94 NT28, and NT94 -> t2, but maybe other paths)\n- NT89 -> t5\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT75 -> t3\n- NT75 -> t1 (NT75 can produce two things)\n- NT62 -> t2\n- NT69 -> t0 or t2\n- NT78 -> t3 or t97\n- NT38 -> t3 or t1\n- NT81 -> t3, t78\n- NT26 -> t2 or t4\n- NT19 -> t1 or t66\n- NT48 -> t3\n- NT13 -> t3\n- NT60 -> t5\n- NT94 -> t3 (via NT47 nt13)\n<\/think>\n\nAlright, after going through the grammar and the string, I can follow the path of non-terminals producing the terminals step by step.\n\n1. Start with S: S \u2192 NT68 NT63  \n2. NT68 \u2192 t3  \n3. NT63 \u2192 NT62 NT42  \n   - NT62 \u2192 t2  \n   - NT42 \u2192 t1  \n4. NT68's part is t3, NT63 becomes t2 t1.  \n5. Combine S's parts: t3 t2 t1  \n6. Now, look at NT62 for more parts. NT62 \u2192 NT0 NT52  \n   - NT0 \u2192 t4  \n   - NT52 \u2192 t2  \n7. Add t4 t2 to the string: t3 t2 t1 t4 t2  \n8. Continue with NT52's NT2: NT2 \u2192 t3  \n   - Add t3: t3 t2 t1 t4 t2 t3  \n9. NT63 was still waiting for more, let's handle that. NT63 \u2192 NT62 NT42  \n   - NT62 \u2192 (now already processed) t2 t1  \n   - NT42 \u2192 t1  \n   - So NT63 becomes t2 t1 t1  \n   - Full string: t3 t2 t1 t4 t2 t3 t2 t1 t1  \n10. Now process the second S \u2192 NT64 NT78  \n    - NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14  \n       - NT60 \u2192 t5  \n       - NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98  \n          - NT1 \u2192 t5  \n          - NT98 \u2192 t3  \n       - So NT14 \u2192 t5 t3  \n       - NT60 \u2192 t5  \n       - NT64 becomes t5 t5 t3  \n    - NT78 \u2192 NT78, which can be broken down:\n       - NT78 \u2192 NT78 or NT97  \n         - Taking NT97 \u2192 NT65 NT49  \n             - NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65 (cycle?) Wait, perhaps looking at specific rules:\n             - NT78 \u2192 NT97 \u2192 NT65 NT49  \n                 - NT65 \u2192 NT97 \u2192 which leads to t5 and t1\n                 - Maybe I'm getting stuck here.\n    Wait, perhaps a better approach is to stick to the given string and see if it can be derived.\n\n11. Going back, the string is `t3 t1 t3 t1 t4 t0 t5 t0 t5 t0 t4 t3`. Let's see if we can generate it step by step.\n\n12. Start with S \u2192 NT68 NT63  \n    - NT68 \u2192 t3  \n    - NT63 \u2192 NT62 NT42 \u2192 t2 t1  \n    So S \u2192 t3 t2 t1  \n\n13. Now, NT62 \u2192 t2 OR more steps:\n    - NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT97  \n       - NT97 \u2192 t3  \n       - NT39 \u2192 NT27 NT97  \n          - NT27 \u2192 t5  \n    So NT62 \u2192 t2 (from earliest) or t5 t3  \n    Using t2: S \u2192 t3 t2 t1  \n\n14. Next part: t2 needs to be derived: NT2 \u2192 t3  \n    - NT2 \u2192 t3  \n    So full string now: t3 t2 t1 t3  \n\n15. Next: t1 is from NT65 \u2192 t2  \n    Wait, NT65 \u2192 t2 directly: NT65 \u2192 t2  \n    So string becomes t3 t2 t1 t3 t2  \n\n16. Next: t4 is from NT50 \u2192 t4  \n    - NT50 \u2192 t4  \n    String: t3 t2 t1 t3 t2 t4  \n\n17. Next: t0 is from NT94 \u2192 t2 OR NT60 \u2192 t5, but need t0. Wait, NT33 \u2192 t0  \n    - NT33 \u2192 t0, so proceed.\n\n18. Now, derive the next t0: From NT33 \u2192 t0. So current string: t3 t2 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0  \n\n19. After t0, we need t5: which can come from NT99 \u2192 t5 or NT74 \u2192 t3? Wait, let's see: \n\n20. NT99 \u2192 t5. So add t5: t3 t2 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t5  \n\n21. Next, t0 again: From NT33 \u2192 t0, so now: t3 t2 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t5 t0  \n\n22. t5: Again, from NT99 \u2192 t5: t3 t2 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t5 t0 t5  \n\n23. Next, t0: Again using NT33 \u2192 t0: string becomes t3 t2 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t5 t0 t5 t0  \n\n24. Finally, t4: From NT50 \u2192 t4. So add t4: t3 t2 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t5 t0 t5 t0 t4  \n\nNow, check if the final t3 is present in the grammar as a terminal. Indeed, NT66 \u2192 t3. So add t3 at the end.\n\nPutting it all together"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Alternatively, I can try to work backwards, starting from the terminals in the string and seeing if I can derive them.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence: t4, t4, t2, t3, t4, t1, t1, t0, t0, t3, t5, t1, t0. The length is 13, so maybe it's easier to work from the end.\n\nLooking at the string, the last symbol is t0. Looking at the grammar rules, which production leads to t0? Scanning the right-hand sides, I see that:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n\nBut wait, t0 is a terminal, not NT0. Looking again, I see:\n\nWait, actually, the terminal t0 is directly produced by the rule NT64 \u2192 NT78 NT62 (no, that's non-terminals). Wait, I need to look for any production where the right-hand side can directly produce t0. Scanning the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\nBut looking through the rules, I find:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n\nWait, no, that's not a terminal. Hmm, wait, looking through the rules, I think I might have missed that. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nWait, in the initial rules, the user listed a bunch of NT rules and some terminal rules. For example, looking at the end:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n\nWait, no, that's not producing a terminal. Wait, wait, actually, in some of the rules, after NT99, there's:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT72 NT55\n\nThen towards the end, I see:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, okay, looking through, I see:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78\n- NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13\n- NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49\n- NT38 \u2192 NT12 NT44 \u2192 't5'\nWait, in the middle, I see rules like:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT62 NT74\n\nAnd at the very end of the rules, I see several rules that produce t's:\n\nLooking through the rules provided, I see towards the end:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT55 \u2192 't4'\n- NT95 \u2192 't3'? Wait, looking again, the last few rules are:\n- NT33 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT65 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't3'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT69 \u2192 't0'\n- NT38 \u2192 't5'\n- NT45 \u2192 't3'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT75 \u2192 't1'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT66 \u2192 't3'\n- NT62 \u2192 't2'\n- NT17 \u2192 't4'\n- NT97 \u2192 't3'\n- NT21 \u2192 't4' [Wait, is there a NT62 rule leading to t0?]\n\nWait, looking carefully:\n\nFrom the provided rules, I see NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47, but that's non-terminals. But then, looking at NT33 \u2192 't0'. So the production NT33 can directly produce t0. So t0 is produced by NT33.\n\nSimilarly, t3 is produced directly by some rules, for example:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'? Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, the terminal productions (where the right-hand side is a single terminal) are:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT94 \u2192 't2'\n- NT18 \u2192 't1'\n- NT49 \u2192 't1'\n- NT72 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't0'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n- NT39 \u2192 't0'\n- NT42 \u2192 't1'\n- NT60 \u2192 't3'\n- NT99 \u2192 't5'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT27 \u2192 't5'\n- NT47 \u2192 't5' [Wait, wait, looking again, I might have misread.]\n\nNo, actually, in the list, looking through each rule:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT94 \u2192 't2'\n- NT18 \u2192 't1'\n- NT49 \u2192 't1'\n- NT72 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't0'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3'\n- NT39 \u2192 't0'\n- NT42 \u2192 't1'\n- NT60 \u2192 't3'\n- NT99 \u2192 't5'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT27 \u2192 't5'\n- NT47 \u2192 't5' [Is this correct?

So perhaps no.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking through, the only terminal productions are those where the right-hand side is a single terminal, not a combination.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making it easier to parse using algorithms like CYK. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which directly expands into two rules: S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78. Each of these rules starts the chain of productions. Next, looking at the non-terminals (NT), most of them produce two more non-terminals until some point where a terminal ('t0', 't1', etc.) is reached. \n\nFor example, NT62 -> NT48 NT0, and NT0 itself is 't4'. So each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal. The string provided has a series of 't's followed by numbers, which match some of these terminals.\n\nLet me list out the rules that produce terminals:\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT75 \u2192 t3\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT62 \u2192 t2 (since NT62 -> NT0 \u2192 t4, wait no, earlier correction: NT62 \u2192 NT68 NT63. Wait, no. Wait, actually, let's check the rules again. Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me see.\n\nLooking back, NT62 has a rule NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, and NT0 \u2192 't4'. So NT62 expands to 't4' followed by whatever NT48 produces. But looking more closely, does NT48 have a terminal? Checking:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT68.\n\nHmm, that's another non-terminal. So NT68 -> NT26 NT42, and NT26 -> NT60 NT9, which is 't5' and so on. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, seeing if each symbol can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t3 t1 t2 t0 t2 t5 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t2 t1.\n\nLet me separate them: t3, t1, t2, t0, t2, t5, t4, t1, t3, t2, t4, t2, t1.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar starting from S.\n\nGiven the grammar's structure, it's likely that the string can only be formed if each symbol in the string corresponds to a chain of productions that eventually derive each symbol in sequence.\n\nLet me start by identifying which terminals correspond to which non-terminals:\n\n- t0: NT96\n- t1: NT75, NT52, NT97, NT74, NT17, NT9, NT45, NT26, NT94, NT58, NT72, NT24, NT34, NT44, NT89, NT39, NT42, NT60, NT99, NT77, NT47, NT50, NT75, NT1, NT3, NT4, NT5, etc. Wait, that's a lot. Each t is associated with multiple non-terminals. So the t's can help trace back the path.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t3. Which non-terminals produce t3?\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT68 \u2192 t3 (since NT68 \u2192 NT26 NT42, and NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9, which leads to t5, but wait, no. Wait, no, actually, NT26's rules: NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9, and NT9 is t15. Hmm, that doesn't directly produce t3. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, let me list the non-terminals that derive t3:\n\nI think looking up each non-terminal that produces t3 is better.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT23 \u2192 t2\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT85 \u2192 t2\n- NT32 \u2192 t4\n- NT26 \u2192 t4 (Wait no, looking again: NT26's production is NT60 NT9 which is t5 and t15, so NT26 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n\nHmm, that seems like it's producing non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals, so maybe I need to go deeper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the inside out using CYK parsing.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm is possible. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. The string is 13 symbols long: t3 t1 t2 t0 t2 t5 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t2 t1.\n\n2. We'll need to see if each symbol can correspond to the start of a production that can generate the entire string.\n\n3. Let me list the length of the string, n =13. So the CYK table will be (13+1)x(13+1).\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can approach this by breaking down the string into possible sequences of non-terminals that generate the symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that the grammar can be broken down into a series of steps where each step produces symbols in a certain order.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either goes to NTXY where both produce terminals, or in the case of S, it starts with two non-terminals. So each step of the derivation will expand by one symbol or two symbols, depending on the production.\n\nBut for a long string, this might not be manageable. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern in the string that matches the productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt3 t1 t2 t0 t2 t5 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t2 t1.\n\nLet me break it down into possible chunks that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nThe starting symbol is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT68 goes to NT26 NT42. Let's see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT26 NT42\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9\n- NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n- NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\n- NT50 \u2192 NT1 NT49\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT49 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let me try to find a path from S to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see if the last part of the string corresponds to a production.\n\nThe last symbol is t1. Which non-terminals produce t1?\n\nLooking through the terminal rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3 (so no)\n- Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the rules that produce terminals are like:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3\n\nNT2 \u2192 t2\n\nNT3 \u2192 t4\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's clarify which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nThe problem statement provides a long list of rules. Let me try to list each rule and see if the right-hand side is a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to note that each rule is of the form NTxy \u2192 A B, where A and B are either non-terminals or terminals. So, for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT26 NT42\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nAnd so on. But each of these productions needs to be evaluated to see if they can derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should perform a backward derivation: start from the string and see if each part can be derived from a production in reverse.\n\nLet me consider the entire string: t3 t1 t2 t0 t2 t5 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t2 t1.\n\nTo reverse engineer, the last symbol is t1, so I need to find a production that ends with t1.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT68 followed by NT63 or NT64 followed by NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t1. Let me check what each NT68, NT64, and so on translate to.\n\nFrom the given mappings:\n- NT81 -> t3\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT64 -> t2\n- NT78 -> t3\n\nWait, let me check that again. The string starts with t1, so that's confusing because S starts with either t3 (if NT68) or t2+something. Let me go step by step.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. The string starts with t1. Let's see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT64 \u2192 t2\n- NT78 \u2192 t3\n\nSo, S can generate sequences starting with t3 (from NT68 NT63) or t2 (from NT64 NT78). But the string starts with t1, so perhaps it's impossible unless there's a non-terminal that directly produces t1, or perhaps I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, maybe I should check what each NT symbol maps to. Let me list the mappings again:\n\nFor example, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT64 \u2192 t2, NT78 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t0, etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t1. Looking through all the mappings, I don't see any NT symbol that directly maps to t1. So if S can only lead to t2 or t3, and the string starts with t1, how is that possible? That would suggest that the string cannot be generated by this grammar, so the answer would be No.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a derivation where one of the non-terminals leads to t1. Let me check all the NT symbols:\n\nLooking through the mappings provided, I don't see any NT that maps to t1. So if the string starts with t1, it can't be generated by this grammar since none of the non-terminals directly produce t1.\n\nAlternatively, is there a possibility that t1 is a result of two or more NTs? Wait, wait\u2014looking through the mappings, perhaps an NT could produce a sequence that includes t1. Let me see.\n\nLooking through the nt productions:\n\nLooking for any production that leads to t1:\n\n- NT11: No mapping except NT12 \u2192 t5, etc. Wait, no NT directly maps to t1 except in the string, but in the given mappings, I don't see any NT symbol that maps to t1. Wait, let me check all again.\n\nLooking through all the nt productions:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't2'\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't3'\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n- NT12 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 (mapping is NT48 \u2192 t3)\nWait, so NT2 is 't5'? Wait, the mappings include NT2 \u2192 't5'? Wait, looking through the nt mappings:\n\nLooking carefully, the mappings provided are:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't2'\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't3'\n- ...\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, is there any NT that maps to t1? Let me scan through all the provided nt mappings.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, which maps to t3 and t6? Wait, no, NT19's mapping isn't given as a terminal but as NT1 NT66.\n\nWait no, looking through the mappings, for example:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66: So, does NT1 or NT66 map to t1? From the list, NT2 maps to t5, but I don't see any NT symbol that directly produces t1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps through multiple steps, but t1 is a terminal in the string, so the production must directly produce it. Therefore, if no NT symbol maps to t1, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, in the provided mappings, looking for t1 as a terminal. Let me check all the lines:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66 (no t1)\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT63 (t3 and t0)\n- NT63 \u2192 t0\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT69 \u2192 t2\n- NT75 \u2192 t3\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT17 \u2192 t4\n- NT24 \u2192 t1? No, looking again.\n\nWait, at the end of the mappings: under NT24, it's mapped to 't1'. Oh, so NT24 \u2192 't1'. So that means one of the non-terminals can produce t1. Then, if in the string there's t1, it can be due to NT24.\n\nSo how is S derived?\n\nWait, but S goes to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's see what those map to.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3 and NT63 \u2192 t0. So S \u2192 t3 t0, which would be [t3, t0], but the string starts with t1. That's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way for the grammar to generate a string starting with t1? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps the string is obtained through multiple steps, but since the string starts with t1, it must derive from a production that directly starts with a terminal t1, so one of the NTs must directly produce t1.\n\nLooking back, NT24 \u2192 't1', so if a derivation ends up with NT24, it can produce t1.\n\nBut in the start symbol S, the initial productions are NT68 NT63 and NT64 NT78.\n\nSo, let's think: starting with S, which can only produce sequences starting with t3 (from NT68 NT63: t3 followed by others) or t2-something (from NT64 NT78: t2 followed by others). But the string starts with t1, which isn't a direct result of S. So unless S can produce t1 via some way, which it can't, it's impossible.\n\nWait, unless one of the NTs can be derived into t1, but given that S only starts with NT68 or NT64, which lead to t3 or t2, and from there, non-terminals are built, but how would t1 get into the string unless it's part of a larger production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is not possible because the starting non-terminals don't produce t1 at all. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with t1, but all NT symbols lead to t2, t3, t5, etc., and no NT directly produces t1.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. So, all the productions here start with non-terminals like S, NT62, NT81, etc., and each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals: t1, t2, t0, t5, t5, t3, t5, t4, t2, t3, t0, t3, t1, t5. So, each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. I need to see if there's a way to derive this string starting from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI know that in CNF, the derivation trees are such that each node has exactly two children if it's a non-terminal, and the terminals are the leaves. So, the string's length should be 2^k, where k is the number of splits. Wait, let me check: the given string has 14 symbols. So, 14 is not a power of two. Hmm, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16. Oh, wait, so maybe the string can't be generated because 14 isn't a power of two. That's a bit of a shortcut, but let me think.\n\nBut before I jump to conclusions, let me remember that in CNF each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the total number of symbols at each step increases exponentially. So, starting with S, which is a single symbol, after one step, you have two symbols, then four, eight, sixteen, etc. So the total number of symbols in the string must be 2^k for some k, or maybe including the initial non-terminals that are expanded into more.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a derivation, each production increases the number of symbols by one (either by replacing one non-terminal with two symbols, so that's effectively adding one symbol each time). Wait, no, each step in the derivation takes a non-terminal and replaces it with two non-terminals, so each step increases the count of symbols by one, because you replace one with two. But in this case, each production can be terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, the productions are either two non-terminals or one terminal. Wait, no, wait: wait, in CNF, each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, each production increases the length by one if it's adding a terminal, or by one if it's replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.\n\nEach time you expand a non-terminal, it can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example, starting from S, in one step, depending on the production, you might get two symbols. If it's a terminal, the string adds one symbol. If it's two non-terminals, each of those would need to expand further. So perhaps the length of the string can vary, but in this case, the string has 14 symbols, which is 14, which is 2*7, but not a power of two.\n\nWait, but in any case, if the length isn't a power of two, perhaps it's impossible because the number of steps would require the string to have a certain structure. Let me check the length: 14 symbols. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible structure. If each non-terminal's expansion is leading to a certain number of symbols, perhaps we can model this as a parse tree with a certain structure. But maybe for a more straightforward approach, I should consider the fact that in CNF, the parse tree must have a binary structure. That means the string can be divided in a certain way that allows for a binary parse. Alternatively, perhaps the string's structure doesn't fit into such a structure.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach: look for the sequence of terminals and see if I can find corresponding productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t1, t2, t0, t5, t5, t3, t5, t4, t2, t3, t0, t3, t1, t5.\n\nEach t is a terminal in the grammar. The problem is to trace back how these could have been generated.\n\nLet me look at the grammar's productions. Each production's right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to get a terminal, the production must have used a rule like NTxX -> tY. But wait, looking back at the grammar, some of the productions have terminals:\n\nFor example:\nS -> NT68 NT63\nBut also some NT productions have terminals:\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\nWait, but looking at the whole grammar, it seems that some NTs directly produce terminals. For example, looking at the productions, NT38 -> t3, and others. Let me correct that because the user provided the entire grammar with each production's right-hand side being two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the last part is:\n\nNT38 -> 't3'\nNT81 -> 't3'\nNT26 -> 't2'\nNT77 -> 't3'\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT85 -> 't2'\nNT34 -> 't5'\nNT38 -> 't5'\nNT19 -> 't5'\nNT12 -> 't5'\nNT48 -> 't3'\nNT75 -> 't3'\nNT12 -> 't2'\nNT67 -> 't2'\nNT45 -> 't5'\nNT1 -> 't3'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT55 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't3'\nNT97 -> 't5'\nNT13 -> 't3'\nNT60 -> 't5'\nNT96 -> 't5'\nNT33 -> 't0'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT65 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't3'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT69 -> 't0'\nNT38 -> 't5'\nNT45 -> 't3'\nNT50 -> 't4'\nNT75 -> 't1'\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT66 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't2'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT81 -> 't2'\nNT97 -> 't3'\nNT33 -> 't3'\nNT94 -> 't2'\nNT74 -> 't3'\nNT94 -> 't1'\nNT18 -> 't1'\nNT58 -> 't3'\nNT81 -> 't4'\nNT34 -> 't1'\nNT94 -> 't4'\nNT72 -> 't0'\nNT18 -> 't4'\nNT49 -> 't1'\nNT15 -> 't3'\nNT1 -> 't5'\nNT27 -> 't5'\nNT47 -> 't5'\nNT89 -> 't5'\nNT24 -> 't1'\nNT39 -> 't0'\nNT34 -> 't5'\nNT42 -> 't1'\nNT60 -> 't3'\nNT99 -> 't5'\nNT20 -> 't5'\nNT74 -> 't1'\nNT9 -> 't1'\nNT8 -> 't3'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT84 -> 't4'\nNT44 -> 't4'\nNT58 -> 't1'\nNT62 -> 't3'\n\nWait, actually, looking at these, it seems that many NTs directly produce a terminal. So, for example:\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\nBut NT48 -> t3, so NT62 -> t3 NT0? Or wait, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of production rules that have two non-terminals on the right, which can themselves be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nFor example, S-> NT68 NT63.

{"custom_id":"request-247","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t3 t4 t5 t5 t4 t1 t3 t2 t0 t4 t3 t2 t2 t2 t3`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The right-hand sides of the grammar consist of non-terminals and terminals, and each production has exactly two symbols on the right.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT68 NT63. So the first two symbols we should expect from the start are 't3' (since NT68 -> 't3') followed by 't3' (from NT63 -> 't3'). Looking at the string, it starts with t3 t4, which doesn't match. That's a problem because the first two tokens should both be t3.\n\nWait, the given string starts with t3, t4. But according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and both NT68 and NT63 produce 't3'. So the first two tokens should be t3 and t3, not t3 and t4. That immediately suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the productions. Checking NT68 and NT63: both indeed produce 't3'. So the initial part of any string derived from S must begin with t3 t3.\n\nThe given string starts with t3, then t4. That doesn't align. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first two tokens are invalid according to the production rules of S.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a different derivation where S doesn't produce NT68 and NT63 first? No, because S only has productions to NT68 NT63, NT64 NT78, etc. Wait, looking back, S \u2192 NT64 NT78 is another option. Let's see what NT64 and NT78 produce.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. Let's check NT60 and NT14. NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18 (from the rules), which produce t3 and t5. NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98. NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90. NT88 \u2192 NT45 NT47, and NT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38. NT89 \u2192 NT24 NT97. NT24 \u2192 NT21 NT24? Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, NT98 \u2192 NT58 NT65. NT58 \u2192 NT49 NT65, but NT58 \u2192 't1' (as per the rules, NT58 is 't1'). Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT58 \u2192 't1' is a direct production. Wait, actually, let me check: in the grammar provided, I see NT48 \u2192 't3', NT75 \u2192 't3', NT12 \u2192 't5', etc. But for NT58, I don't see a production that directly says NT58 \u2192 't1'. Wait, looking back through the rules, I see NT58 \u2192 't1' is not directly there. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT39 NT97 (t3)\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65 \u2192 but wait, this seems recursive. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things. Wait, no, the rule NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65 suggests that NT97 NT65 is a production, but according to the list, actually, no, looking at the provided rules, it's:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65, but that can't be right because that would loop. Wait, perhaps that's a typo. Looking back: The user provided a long list, perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I misread. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the rules more carefully:\n\nI see lines like:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\nNT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78\nNT38 \u2192 NT12 NT44\nNT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65 \u2192 Wait, no, that's not a terminal, that's a production that refers to NT97 and NT65 which might loop. Perhaps that's a mistake or perhaps I misunderstand. Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the strings and see if any possible derivation can get the initial t3 t4.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which produces NT68 NT63, both of which are 't3', so the first two tokens must be t3 t3. The given string starts with t3 t4, which can't come from S directly. Therefore, the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the string, but assuming the string is correct, the initial mismatch means the answer is no.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-253","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t1 t0 t2 t1 t4 t4 t5 t5 t1 t5 t0 t1 t3 t0 t0`.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are defined in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and either two terminal symbols or a single non-terminal on the right. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit because all the rules have two non-terminals except for the ones that produce terminals, like NT2 -> 't3'.\n\nThe goal is to check if this string can be derived by the grammar. Since it's Chomsky normal form, the parsing process should involve expanding the start symbol S using these rules, eventually resulting in the target string.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string step by step, seeing if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar rules.\n\nThe string has 15 tokens, which are all terminals (t1, t0, t2, etc.). Since each production in the grammar results in either terminals or two non-terminals, perhaps the string can be broken down into pairs of terminals that correspond to the productions.\n\nWait, but the string is 15 tokens long. Chomsky normal form productions either produce two terminals or one non-terminal. So, for each non-terminal, it can produce two terminals or one non-terminal. So, the derivation tree will have a structure where each node is either a non-terminal or a terminal, and the leaves are the terminals of the string.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the number of steps. Let's see: for a string of length 15, 2^n - 1 = 15 \u2192 2^n = 16 \u2192 n=4. So, it's possible that the derivation would take 4 steps, leading to 15 symbols. That seems plausible.\n\nBut how to check? Maybe it's easier to reverse the process: see if starting from S and applying productions, we can generate this string.\n\nThe string starts with t1, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce t1. For example, NT74 -> t1, NT52 -> t2, etc. Wait, let me see which non-terminals produce t1.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT74 -> t1, NT74 also has other productions like NT23 -> t2, but not t1.

Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT75's productions are:\n\nNT75 -> 't3' and NT75 -> 't1'. Hmm, let me check the list again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT75, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT75 -> 't3'\n- Also, looking further down, the lines seem to continue.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but let me try breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I can see that all the productions are in CNF because each has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the right, except maybe some others. Wait, no, it looks like they're all single-terminals or two non-terminals. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string given is a series of tokens: t5, t2, t4, etc. The grammar seems to have several rules that directly map non-terminals to these tokens. For example, NT47 \u2192 t3, so if a non-terminal NT47 appears in a derivation, it's replaced by 't3'. Similarly, NT18 can go to 't5', and so on.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the CYK parsing algorithm since it's efficient for CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm determines whether a string is in the language generated by a given grammar. I'll try to apply the steps of the CYK algorithm to the string.\n\nFirst, let's write down the positions of each token in the string. The string length is 16, so positions 0 to 15.\n\nThe tokens are: t5, t2, t4, t0, t1, t3, t2, t2, t1, t4, t0, t1, t4, t2, t3, t3.\n\nI'll create a table where the rows represent positions in the string, and columns represent steps in the parsing. Since the string length is 16, we'll have 16 columns. The table will have rows up to 16 (since the longest possible substring length is 16).\n\nWait, actually, the standard CYK algorithm for a string of length n has n rows, each row i corresponds to substrings of length i. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so maybe I'll outline the steps I remember.\n\n1. Initialize the table: For each position i (from 0 to n-1), look at the token at that position and find all non-terminals that directly produce it. For each such non-terminal, mark that cell in the table as containing the non-terminal.\n\n2. For each length l from 2 to n (string length), and for each starting position i, check substrings of length l starting at i. For each position j from i to i + l - 1, find non-terminals that can produce the substring from i to i+l-1, by combining rules that split the substring into two parts, each of which can be derived by some non-terminals.\n\n3. If the start symbol S can be derived by the entire string, the string is in the language.\n\nBut setting up a 16x16 table manually is tedious, especially since this might take a lot of time. Alternatively, maybe I can look for any obvious patterns or rules that can generate the string.\n\nLet me check the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which is defined as:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo S splits into two non-terminals, either NT68 and NT63, or NT64 and NT78. So any derivation starting from S must produce a string of two parts, each part derived from these two non-terminals.\n\nNow, let's see the string: it starts with t5. Looking at the tokens, the first token is t5. Where does t5 come from? Checking the productions, I see:\n\nNT39 \u2192 t0\nNT34 \u2192 t1\nNT44 \u2192 t4\nNT69 \u2192 t2\nNT99 \u2192 t5\nNT22 \u2192 t2 (among others)\nNT18 \u2192 t1, t5?\nWait, I need to check all rules that produce t5. From the given grammar:\n\nNT39 \u2192 t0\nNT44 \u2192 t4\nNT69 \u2192 t2\nNT99 \u2192 t5\nNT20 \u2192 t5\nNT9 \u2192 t1\nNT15 \u2192 t3\nWait, perhaps I should list all NTs that produce t5. Scanning through the rules:\n\nLooking for where NT \u2192 t5:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT20 \u2192 t5\nNT27 \u2192 t5\nNT18 \u2192 t4 (no)\nNT14 \u2192 t1\nNT72 \u2192 t0\nNT33 \u2192 t0\nWait, looking back:\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking for rules where the right-hand side starts with a terminal and the rest are non-terminals, but wait, in CNF all productions are either A \u2192 a (a terminal) or A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals). So each production has exactly one terminal, or is it?\n\nWait, no, all productions are in the form A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, so each production generates either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So any production that ends with a terminal gives the terminal's value.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't5' directly:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT99 \u2192 t5 (Yes)\nNT16 doesn't exist, maybe NT20 \u2192 t5\nWait, let me check:\n\nIn the given rules, I see:\n\nNT99 \u2192 t5\nNT20 \u2192 t5 (Yes)\nAlso, from the detailed list:\n...\nAlso, looking at the rules:\n\nNT75 \u2192 't0'\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\n...\nLooking through all the NTs, I see:\n\nNT99 \u2192 t5\nNT20 \u2192 t5\nNT27 \u2192 t5\nWait, wait, not all; some may produce t5 through intermediate steps. But in this grammar, each production is either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, so the direct productions are a single terminal. So any NT that can derive 't5' directly is either:\n\nNT99, NT20, or any other NT that has a production ending with t5.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 t5\n- NT20 \u2192 t5\n- Also, for example, NT55: looking at the given rules, do any NTs produce t5? Let's check NT20 \u2192 t5, NT27 \u2192 t5, and NT99 \u2192 t5. So three non-terminals can directly produce 't5'.\n\nSo the first token is t5, which must come from either NT99, NT20, or NT27. Wait, from the list:\n\nWait, checking all rules, I see:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\nNT99 \u2192 t5?

{"custom_id":"request-265","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I think means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and a non-terminal or a terminal on the right. The string to evaluate is \"t5 t5 t0 t5 t1 t4 t3 t1 t2 t1 t4 t3 t4 t4 t5 t1\". \n\nFirst, I remember that in a CNF grammar, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, each non-terminal can only produce a terminal or another pair of non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most non-terminals have productions leading to terminals 't3', 't5', etc. But some of them also produce other non-terminals, which complicates things. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and both NT68 and NT63 seem to produce other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nTo determine if the string is generated, I probably need to work backwards using the grammar, applying the reverse of the productions until I can't apply any more, which would show if the string can be fully reduced to the start symbol S. Alternatively, maybe I can parse the string according to the grammar rules step by step.\n\nGiven the string is a sequence of t's, maybe I can try to see how each t is generated. Let's break down the string into individual terminals: t5, t5, t0, t5, t1, t4, t3, t1, t2, t1, t4, t3, t4, t4, t5, t1. That's 16 symbols.\n\nStarting from the left, each t symbol must be produced by some production rule. Let's look at the possible options from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, I see many rules that produce a single symbol or two non-terminals. Wait, many are like NT38 \u2192 't3', so that's where some t's come from. The string has multiple t3s and t5s, so I need to see if the grammar can generate those.\n\nFor instance, the first symbol is t5. Let me check the productions for 't5'.

Wait, no. Wait, the grammar has symbols like NT33, NT45, NT73 is maybe not in the list. Wait, let me search for which non-terminals produce 't5'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't5' \n- NT39 \u2192 't0'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT55 \u2192 't4'\n- NT84 \u2192 't4'\n- NT97 \u2192 't3'\n- NT13 \u2192 't3'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT96 \u2192 't5'\n- NT26 \u2192 't5'\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT39 \u2192 't0'\n- NT47 \u2192 't5', oh wait, looking again at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT89 NT38\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n- NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n- NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some NT47 productions. Wait, the grammar is a bit lengthy. Let me check again from the top.\n\nLooking for productions that result in 't5', I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT96 \u2192 't5'\n- NT26 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, NT26 \u2192 't5'? Because in the provided grammar, near the end: NT26 \u2192 nt60 nt9 and nt60 \u2192 't3', but wait, someone else mentioned NT26 \u2192 t5? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT26 \u2192 ... I see:\n\nNear the end: NT26 \u2192 t5? Wait, no. Let me go through the grammar list:\n\nLooking through each line, I notice that there's NT26 -> 't5'? Or wait, NT26 has several productions.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT26 -> NT60 NT9\n\nWait, but then the individual lines after that:\n\nNT26 -> 't5', no. Wait, perhaps the grammar branches have some terminal symbols. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking through each production line, I notice:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9\n\nBut I also see:\n\nNT26 -> 't5' \nWait no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar's production for NT26 is:\n\nNT26 -> NT60 NT9,\n\nBut then further down:\n\nNT26 -> 't5' ?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines:\n\nWait, the last part says:\n\nNT26 -> NT60 NT9\n\nWait, that's for one production, but I don't see a direct production of 't5' from NT26. Hmm, perhaps I'm confused. Let me see:\n\nLooking for NT26, checking the grammar:\n\nNT26 is defined as:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9,\n\nand below that:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't5'?\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't5'\n\nBut the initial production is NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9. But in the list, the last few entries include:\n\nNT26 -> NT60 NT9\n\nAnd also:\n\nNT26 -> 't5'\n\nWait, that suggests that NT26 can produce either NT60 NT9 or 't5'. So yes, NT26 can produce 't5' directly.\n\nSo, in the first step, the string starts with 't5', which could be directly produced by NT26. Alternatively, 't5' can be produced by NT60 NT9, but that's two non-terminals, so perhaps more steps are needed. But since 't5' is a terminal, NT26 can generate it directly.\n\nSo, starting the reduction, we can take the first 't5' as the production of NT26. Now, the rest of the string would need to be generated from the other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but let's think in terms of derivation. The start symbol is S, and we need to see if S can derive the given string. So, perhaps we should start from S and apply productions step by step, trying to match the string.\n\nBut maybe reduction from the string is easier. Let me try that.\n\nThe string is: t5 t5 t0 t5 t1 t4 t3 t1 t2 t1 t4 t3 t4 t4 t5 t1\n\nLet me parse this backwards, applying inverse productions. Each step, replace the first terminal with a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nAlternatively, to make it clearer, perhaps parse the string step by step, processing each symbol and seeing if non-terminals can be replaced accordingly.\n\nThis might take a while, but let's proceed.\n\nFirst, the string is of length 16, so we'll need to expand each symbol until the entire string is reduced to S.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStart with the string: [t5, t5, t0, t5, t1, t4, t3, t1, t2, t1, t4, t3, t4, t4, t5, t1]\n\nI'll start from the end, trying to match each symbol with possible productions, working backwards.\n\nLooking at the last symbol: t1\n\nLooking at the grammar, t1 can come from various non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nPossible productions to t1 are:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't4' [No]\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3' [No]\n- NT19 \u2192 't3' [No]\n- NT67 \u2192 't2' [No]\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT55 \u2192 't4' [No]\n- NT12 \u2192 't5' [No]\n- NT69 \u2192 't0' [No]\n- NT9 \u2192 't5' [No]\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'\n- NT42 \u2192 't1'\n- NT26 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't3' [No]\n- NT84 \u2192 't4' [No]\n- NT45 \u2192 't3' [No]\n- NT58 \u2192 't3' [No]\n- NT75 \u2192 't1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-291","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t0 t4 t3 t2 t5 t4 t4 t4 t2 t1 t4 t2 t1 t0 t2 t3 t5`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in CNF looks like. CNF typically has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is a production with two non-terminals, and some NT productions like NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT9, again two non-terminals. Some seem to directly correspond to terminals, like NT38 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nThe goal is to see if the provided string can be generated by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions. The process would involve expanding S to NT68 and NT63, each of which then expand further until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me try to parse the given string step by step. The string is `t0 t4 t3 t2 t5 t4 t4 t4 t2 t1 t4 t2 t1 t0 t2 t3 t5`. It's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this can be derived from S through the grammar.\n\nI'll start by mapping each terminal in the string to possible productions. First, the first symbol is 't0'. Looking at the grammar, NT63 \u2192 't0' (line 4: NT63 -> NT97 NT65 and line 14: S->NT68 NT63; but wait, NT63->'t0' is line NT63->'t0'? Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT63 -> 't0' is not directly present, but looking again, I see line NT62->'t0' (line 28: NT62 -> 't0'), and NT65->'t0' is another production (line 49: NT65->'t5'). Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking at NT65: NT65 -> 't5' is in line NT69: NT69 -> 't0'? No, wait, looking back:\n\nWait, let me list all the productions with terminals to see where 't0' comes from. Scanning through:\n\n- NT62 -> 't0' (line 28)\n- NT65 -> 't5' (line 49)\nWait no, line 49 is NT69->'t0'? Wait, I might be mixing up numbers. Let me go through each production line.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLine 2: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\nLine 48: NT48 \u2192 't3' (line NT48->'t3'?)\nWait, no, let me look again:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, each line starts with NT<i>.

Let me check line 28: NT62->'t0' (line 28 is NT62->'t0'), but NT65 is line 49: NT65->'t5'.\n\nWait, in the initial problem, the grammar seems to have multiple lines, but perhaps I can figure out which NT produces which t.\n\nLet me make a list of all terminals and which NT produce them:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't0'?

Let me count:\n\nThe provided grammar has multiple lines. Let me parse each line.\n\nLine 1: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\nLine 2: NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT62\nLine 3: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 (same as line 1)\nLine 4: NT76 \u2192 NT71 NT48\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all lines and identify where a terminal is on the RHS.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nLine 1: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n- NT0 is not a terminal, needs to be resolved.\n\nLine 2: NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT62\n- Non-terminals on both sides.\n\nLine 3: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 (same as line 1)\n\nLine 4: NT76 \u2192 NT71 NT48\n- Both non-terminals.\n\nLine 5: NT23 \u2192 NT18 NT8\n- Non-terminals.\n\nLine 6: NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65\n- Left recursion. Problem because CNF doesn't allow left recursion. But the original problem states it's in CNF, so maybe it's allowed? Or perhaps it's a typo. Wait, in CNF, typically productions are not left-recursive, unless it's a special case.

So there might not be any direct terminal productions except possibly where a NT directly leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, NT34 -> 't3' is one line.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure a bit. Each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side, making it easier for certain parsing methods.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. It starts with S -> NT68 NT63, so the initial string should derive from these two symbols. Each of those NT symbols will presumably expand into other NTs or terminal symbols ('tX's). The string provided has 17 tokens, all 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.\n\nThe goal is to see if applying the grammar's rules repeatedly can transform S into the entire string. Since it's a context-free grammar, I'll approach this by parsing the string from left to right, each time matching non-terminals and trying to find a production that can generate the next required terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't5'.

Let's list the NTs that produce t5:\n\n- NT45 -> t5\n- NT39 -> t0 (no)\n- NT97 -> t5\n- NT1 -> t5\n- NT27 -> t5\n- NT47 -> t5\n- NT89 -> t5\n- NT99 -> t5\n- NT20 -> t5\n- NT74 -> t1 (no)\n- NT9 -> t5\n- NT8 -> t5\n- NT2 -> t5\n- NT84 -> t4 (no)\n- NT44 -> t4 (no)\n- NT50 -> t4 (no)\n- NT58 -> t3 (no)\n- NT62 -> t3 (no)\n- etc.\n\nSo, NT45, NT97, NT1, NT27, NT47, NT89, NT99, NT20, NT9, NT8, NT2 can produce 't5'.\n\nNow, let's note S can expand to NT68 NT63. So, in the first step, S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the next symbols should be generated by NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals. So, I need to find their productions.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT68 -> NT45 NT47\nNT63 -> NT85 NT81\n\nSo S can go to NT68 NT63, which is [NT68, NT63]. Then, NT68 can go to NT45 NT47, and NT63 can go to NT85 NT81.\n\nSo after first two steps, we have NT45 NT47 NT85 NT81.\n\nNow, according to the string, the first symbol is 't5', which would come from NT45, as it directly produces t5.\n\nSo the first terminal is 't5' generated by NT45.\n\nNow, the next symbol in the string is the second 't5'.\n\nLooking at NT47, what can it produce? The grammar for NT47 is:\n\nNT47 -> NT85 NT13\nNT47 -> NT28 NT22\nNT47 -> NT0 NT52\nNT47 -> NT47 NT47 (recursive)\n\nSo three possibilities.\n\nAfter generating the first 't5' via NT45, the next non-terminal after NT45 is NT47.\n\nFrom NT47, the possible productions are as above. Let's see:\n\nThe second symbol is 't5', so we need to see if any of the productions of NT47 can lead to 't5'.\n\nLooking at NT47's rules:\n\n1. NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13\n   NT85 produces t2 (from NT85 -> t2), and NT13 produces t3. So combining, it would be t2 t3. But we need a t5 here.\n\n2. NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n   NT28: NT28 -> NT60 NT69. Then NT69 -> t0.\n   NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT62 NT74.\n   So NT62 is t2, NT74 is t1. So NT22 produces t2 t1 \u2192 t21 in the string. But the second symbol is t5, not t2 t1, which doesn't match.\n\n3. NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52\n   NT0 -> t48 t47 \u2192 t48 t47. Wait, looking at the terminal mappings, NT0 is defined as:\n   NT0 -> NT48 NT47\n   NT48 -> t3, NT47 can go to t5 directly. So NT0 \u2192 t3 t5. That would produce 't3' followed by 't5'. But we need 't5' immediately, so that doesn't fit.\n\nSo, none of NT47's productions produce 't5' directly. Wait, did I miss any? No, the possible expansions are to t2, t3, and t3 t5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, NT0 -> t48 t47. If NT48 is t3, and NT47 can be t5, then NT0 is t3 t5. So that would generate 't3 t5'. So that sequence could produce two symbols.\n\nWait, but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT64 -> NT60 NT14, and NT14 -> NT1 NT98, which then produce terminals. So this grammar is actually bottom-up, replacing non-terminals with their terminals, but since it's in CNF, we can proceed with a recursive descent parser.\n\nNow, the string is 18 tokens, so I'll need to see if it can be generated by S.\n\nThe initial step is to see S produces NT68 NT63.\n\nThen, each of those non-terminals must expand into the respective parts of the string.

So S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78. \n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, S has productions to NT68 NT63 and NT64 NT78. So S is the top-level symbol, and each production leads to two NTs. Each NT can then produce further symbols until a terminal is reached.\n\nGiven that the language is defined by S, the string should be a leftmost derivation of S into the given token sequence. \n\nBut since the string is quite long, I might check if the grammar can generate sequences of t's and t's. The right-hand sides of the rules sometimes produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So some productions turn NTs into t's.\n\nFor example, looking at the rules, NT68 -> T0, so if NT68 can be derived into t0, and similarly for others. But since NT68 and NT64 are in the initial productions, perhaps the string starts with those.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3, t2, t4... So perhaps the derivation starts with S -> NT68 NT63, and then each NT is further expanded.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT68 can produce T3. Because one of the rules is NT68 -> T3. Let me check the list:\n\nLooking for NT68: Yes, \"NT68 -> T3\". So NT68 can produce t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 is another NT. Looking up NT63: \"NT63 -> T64 T62\". So NT63 can be expanded into T64 and T62.\n\nWait, no, let me check correctly. The provided grammar rules are listed, but it seems like each NT has multiple productions. Let me go through each NT to see possible expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps building a parse tree would help. Alternatively, considering that each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal derived from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each t in the string to a possible NT on the left side of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t3, t2, t4, t1, t1, t5, t4, t4, t5, t3, t3, t3, t3, t3, t0, t3, t0, t1.\n\nEach of these is a terminal generated by some NT rule. For example, NT68 -> T3, so t3 can come from NT68. Similarly, NT2 is another NT that can produce T2.\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, I see NT24 -> T2, and NT24 also appears in the string. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to represent each step recursively, but given the size, it's time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each symbol in the string must be matched by a terminal that comes from left-to-right expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be partitioned into segments that match the grammar's possible rule applications.\n\nWait, let me start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t3, which comes from NT68 -> T3. So the first NT68 becomes t3.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t2. Where does t2 come from? Looking at the rules, I see NT2 -> T3, but that's for NT2. Wait, no, in the rules, NT2 is \"NT2 -> NT67 NT20\". Oh, okay, but I'm looking for a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me find all the NTs that can produce a terminal (t0 to t9, maybe). Looking through the rules:\n\nNT68 -> T3\nNT66 -> T3\nNT64 -> T4\nNT78 -> T3\nNT94 -> T2\nNT97 -> T5\nNT38 -> T3\nNT94 -> T4\nNT58 -> T3\nNT77 -> T3\nNT99 -> T5\nNT89 -> T5\nNT47 -> T5\nNT55 -> T4\nNT26 -> T1\nNT20 -> T5\nNT44 -> T4\nNT84 -> T3\nNT94 -> T4\nNT62 -> T2\nNT74 -> T3\nNT81 -> T3\nNT97 -> T5\nNT34 -> T1\nNT94 -> T4\nNT72 -> T0\nNT17 -> T4\nNT99 -> T5\nNT85 -> T2\nNT23 -> T2\nNT26 -> T4\nNT98 -> T2\nNT89 -> T5\nNT39 -> T0\nNT34 -> T5\nNT42 -> T1\nNT60 -> T5\nNT99 -> T5\nNT20 -> T5\nNT74 -> T1\nNT9 -> T5\nNT8 -> T5\nNT2 -> T5\nWait, this might be getting too detailed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to model the grammar as a context-free grammar and check if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nBut for a human, it's more manageable to represent each step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar through a series of steps, perhaps using memoization or recursive checking.\n\nBut it's getting complicated, so maybe it's better to check each production rule and see if any part of the string can be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps the first two symbols are t3 and t2. So perhaps the leftmost derivation starts with S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me try the first option: S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 -> t3.\n\nNT63 can be expanded into T64 T62. So T64 T62 -> t2 t4, but in the string, after t3 comes t2, t4... So after t3 (from NT68), we have NT63, which is T64 T62, leading to t2 and t4, which matches the next symbols: t2, t4. So that seems good.\n\nNow, after that, the next part is t1, t1, t5, t4, etc. Let's see what comes next.\n\nWait, the expansion is: t3, followed by the expansion of NT64 NT62.\n\nNT64 -> T4 (from NT48 T60, but looking at the rules, I need to check. Wait, perhaps it's better to track each step more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a recursive descent parser.\n\nWait, perhaps we can proceed step by step:\n\n1. S expands to NT68 NT63.\n\nSo the string starts with t3 (from NT68), then NT63. Now, NT63 expands to T64 T62.\n\nT64 is NT64, which expands to T4 (I think; need to check the rules). From the rules, looking for NT64: it's one production, \"NT64 -> T4 NT60\". But T64 can be further expanded. Hmm, perhaps it's making it more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with S and trying to match the string's symbols step by step.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\nIndex: 0:t3, 1:t2, 2:t4, 3:t1, 4:t1,5:t5,6:t4,7:t4,8:t5,9:t3,10:t3,11:t3,12:t3,13:t3,14:t0,15:t3,16:t0,17"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t5 t0 t1 t1 t3 t2 t3 t0 t3 t2 t0 t5 t5 t3 t1 t0 t3 t4 t1`, and I have a bunch of production rules. Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, especially with the given rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know Chomsky normal form usually has productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems most of the rules are of the form NT<something> \u2192 NT<something> NT<something else>, except some have terminals like 't1', 't2', etc. So that's my starting point.\n\nI think I should start by trying to parse the string from the beginning, trying to match the rules. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to work backwards from the start symbol and see if we can derive the string. Let me see which symbols are non-terminals and which are terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- The start symbol is S, which produces NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n- All NT entries like NT68, NT64, etc., seem to be non-terminals because most of their rules produce other NTs or terminals like 't1', 't2', etc.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the string starts with t5, t0, t1,..., but let's see: if S derives to NT68 and NT63, then perhaps the string should derive from those. But the first part of the string is t5, which is a terminal. So looking at NT68, I don't see a production for NT68. Wait, let me check. Looking through the rules, NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81, but I don't see NT68 having a rule.

Wait, the list shows NT68 \u2192 't3'... Or is it? Let me go through each rule again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, some rules end with a terminal, like NT68 \u2192 't3'?

Let's break down the string into its components: ['t5', 't5', 't4', 't2', 't0', 't1', 't3', 't5', 't5', 't4', 't0', 't3', 't0', 't2', 't5', 't1', 't3', 't0', 't3'].\n\nGiven that the start symbol S produces either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78, let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, consider S -> NT68 NT63. Then, we need to check if both NT68 and NT63 can produce the first half and second half of the string respectively, or something that concatenates to the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT68 has two possibilities: NT68 can be 't3' or derived from NT66 NT81. Wait, no, looking up the rules, I see NT68 is actually a terminal 't5' because in the rules, NT68 is mapped to 't5'. Similarly, NT63 is a terminal 't3'. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, looking back at the production rules, I see:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'? Or is it another non-terminal? No, looking carefully, I see in the list:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, in the production rules, some lines say NT68 is mapped to 't3'. Let me find:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nOh no, actually, in the given rules, I see lines like:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'?\n\nWait, let me recheck. The rules as given:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT69 is 't0', NT78 is 't3', NT38 is 't5', etc.\n\nWait, there's a line that says NT68 -> 't3' in the context? Let me scan through the rules again:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT81 -> NT78 NT97  [t2, t5?]\n\nWait, no: looking at the rules, the actual terminal mappings are:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT18 -> NT50 NT38. Wait, but wait, some non-terminals are directly mapped to strings, like:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nNT63 -> 't3'?\n\nWait, wait no: Wait, looking into the rules, some non-terminals map directly to 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\nNT68: I don't see NT68 as a terminal, but maybe as a non-terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see many lines like NT68 -> 't3' at the end, but perhaps I miswrote. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the user input includes a long list of production rules. Let me scan for any lines that are NT68 and NT63 being terminals.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe lines are:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nNT63 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no. Looking at the production rules:\n\nI see:\n\nNT68: 't3'\n\nNT63: I don't see NT63 as a terminal. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT38 -> 't5'\n\n- NT81 -> 't2'\n\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n\n- NT97 -> 't5'\n\n- NT74 -> 't3'\n\nWait, looking for NT68 and NT63:\n\nI seeNT68 -> 't3', and looking for NT63, I don't see a direct rule. Wait, NT63 is actually the combination:\n\nWait, looking back, in the production list, under NT63, is there a rule? Let me check again.\n\nActually, the lines are:\n\nNT69 -> 't0'\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me scan the entire list again for NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n\n- NT63 -> 't3'? No, let's check.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nThe last lines:\n\nNT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nWait, no NT63 is a non-terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me look for NT63 and NT68.\n\nLooking through:\n\nLines:\n\nNT68 is given as 't3'\n\nLooking for NT63: Do I see any line with NT63 on the left side? Hmm, looking at the rules:\n\nHmm, scanning through, I don't see a production for NT63 beyond the non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps NT68 is 't3' and NT63 is also a terminal, but I might have misread it.\n\nWait, checking again: the production rules include NT68 as 't3' and NT63 as mapping to 't3'? Or is NT63 part of a production?\n\nWait, the last several lines are:\n\nNT38 -> 't5'\n\nNT81 -> 't3'\n\nNT26 -> 't2'\n\nNT69 -> 't0'\n\nNT38 -> 't5'\n\nNT45 -> 't3'\n\nNT94 -> 't2'\n\nNT58 -> 't1'\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing NT63.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all NT6x rules:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT62: NT68 NT69 \n\nWait, NT68 is 't3'\n\nNT69 is 't0'\n\nSo NT62 becomes 't3' 't0'?\n\nWait, so the line is NT62 -> NT68 NT69, which then becomes 't3' followed by 't0' because NT68 and NT69 are terminals. So any NT62 would produce 't3 t0'.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 is in production:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT63: Well, in the production rules, I don't see NT63 as an individual terminal; it's part of other productions.\n\nWait, the production rules all start with a non-terminal, right? So for example, NT68 is mapped to 't3', but do we have any NT63 mapping to 't3'?\n\nLooking more carefully, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate the production rules.\n\nLooking for NT63: I don't see a line where NT63 is on the left. So perhaps NT63 is part of a larger non-terminal expression.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about NT63. Let me check again:\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the list:\n\nHere's the list of rules:\n\n- S -> NT68 NT63\n\n- S -> NT64 NT78\n\n- NT62 -> NT48 NT0\n\n- NT81 -> NT78 NT97\n\n- NT47 -> NT85 NT13\n\n- NT94 -> NT75 NT49\n\n...\n\nEventually, I come across NT68 -> 't3'\n\nLooking through the rest, I don't see NT63 directly mapped to a terminal. So perhaps NT63 is used in a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT63 with NT68.\n\nWait, perhaps in the grammar, NT63 is a terminal as per the last production. Let me check the lines again.\n\nWait, the lines include:\n\nNT69 -> 't0'\n\nNT78 -> 't3'\n\nNT26 -> 't2'\n\nLooking through the entire list, the only terminals I see are lines like NT68 -> 't3', NT26 -> 't2', etc. So perhaps NT63 is also a terminal, but I might have missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the terminals in the given string: the string has lengths and types.\n\nGiven the string is: t5 t5 t4 t2 t0 t1 t3 t5 t5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-349","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t2 t1 t3 t0 t0 t5 t2 t1 t4 t0 t3 t0 t5 t1 t2 t0 t5 t3 t0 t3`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF implies. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left-hand side (LHS) and either a terminal or a non-terminal on the right-hand side (RHS). Some versions allow the RHS to consist of exactly two non-terminals, but in this case, it seems like most of the productions have two non-terminals on the RHS, except some have just a single terminal.\n\nNext, the grammar consists of several non-terminals (S, NT62, NT81, etc.) and terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. Each of these non-terminals has a production rule that either breaks them down further or directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol, it's S. The initial production for S is `S -> NT68 NT63`. So any string generated by this grammar must start with the concatenation of whatever NT68 generates and NT63 generates.\n\nNow, the string provided starts with `t2 t1`. I need to trace how this could be produced. Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t2. That would come from some production rule that has a terminal. Looking at the grammar, there are multiple NT symbols that produce t2:\n   - NT62 -> t2\n   - NT27 -> t5 (though that's for NT27, but I need t2. Wait, looking back, I see NT62 -> NT39 NT81 and NT39 -> t0, NT81 -> t4. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, looking again, some NT productions directly produce terminals. For example, NT26 -> 't2', so if NT26 can produce t2 directly, that's a way to get t2 in the string.\n\nBut wait, the initial production is S -> NT68 NT63. So the first two symbols after S will come from NT68 and NT63. So let's see what NT68 and NT63 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68's production is:\n- NT68 -> NT65 NT65\nBut wait, no. Let's check again. The given grammar shows:\n\nNT68: I see that S -> NT68 NT63, and looking through the productions, I see NT68: Let me scan all the lines for NT68. Looking through, it seems NT68 might be producing something else. Wait, I'm looking for NT68 production. Let me check the given productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT68 isn't explicitly listed except as a component. Wait, no, the main starting S production is S -> NT68 NT63, so I need to check the productions for NT68 and NT63.\n\nWait, in the grammar list, I don't see NT68 or NT63 having their own productions. Let me check each line for NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for NT68: I don't see any line starting with NT68, except perhaps NT68 in S's production.

Now, looking at the productions, I don't see NT68 or NT63 in the LHS. So, does that mean NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals that eventually produce 't's, or are they terminals?\n\nWait, no, in the list, some of the productions have 't's as terminals. For example, NT69 -> 't2', which is a terminal. So, in the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, others produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo, looking at S's production: S -> NT68 NT63. Therefore, after S, the string will be NT68's production followed by NT63's production. Now, the string starts with 't2 t1', so let's see if NT68 can produce 't2' and NT63 can produce 't1'.\n\nBut first, I need to check if NT68 and NT63 are terminals or non-terminals in the given grammar. Wait, no, in the grammar, all symbols are non-terminals except the terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So, when we have production rules like NT68 -> something, what's on the RHS could be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, for example, looking at NT68, I don't see a production for it in the given list. Hmm, that's confusing because if S's production is NT68 NT63, then NT68 and NT63 must have their own productions.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the productions again carefully.

Looking at the given grammar, all the productions on the left side are either two non-terminals or directly produce a terminal (like 't0'), which fits CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate consists of a sequence of terminals, so the grammar must have a derivation path that results in this exact sequence. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation either combines two non-terminals into another or produces a terminal. \n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S and see what productions are available. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the first two symbols in the string should come from one of these. Let's check the string: it starts with 't1', so I need to see if any of NT68 or NT64 can produce 't1'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT68 and NT64:\n\n- NT68 can produce 't3' (from S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and NT68 \u2192 t3)\n- NT64 can produce 't1' (from NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, and then NT60 \u2192 NT48 NT62, etc., but it's a bit more involved. Wait, let me check: NT64's production is S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Breaking it down, NT64 doesn't directly produce anything; it needs to be further expanded. NT64 can go to NT60 NT14, so maybe NT60 can produce 't1'? Let me check NT60: it has NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18. So that would produce two terminals. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, maybe NT64 \u2192 NT19 NT63, and then NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which could further break down. Alternatively, perhaps the longer path is better.\n\nWait, maybe I should map out a possible derivation. Let's assume the first production is S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Then both NT64 and NT78 need to be expanded.\n\nNT78 can produce 't2' directly. So that matches the first 't1' in the string? Wait, no. The string starts with 't1', but NT78 produces 't2', so perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe S uses NT68 \u2192 t3. But the string starts with 't1', so that's not matching.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the starting production might not be S \u2192 NT64 NT78, because NT78 can produce 't2', but the string starts with 't1'. Wait, unless NT64 can produce more than just the second part. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see which non-terminals can produce 't1' as the first symbol. The string starts with 't1', so the first step should be one of the productions that can start with 't1'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't1'? Let's check each production for 'a where a is 't1':\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t3\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT1 \u2192 t5\n- NT24 \u2192 t0\n- NT17 \u2192 t4\n- NT47 \u2192 t5\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n- NT72 \u2192 t0\n- NT81 \u2192 t2\n- NT65 \u2192 t5\n- NT23 \u2192 t2\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT15 \u2192 t3\n- NT27 \u2192 t5\n- NT35 \u2192 Hmm, no, not directly seeing 't1's. Wait, I need to check each production.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar productions, do any non-terminals directly produce 't1'? Let's see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't5' (from NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77)\n- NT73? No, perhaps not. Wait, I'm looking for any non-terminal that can produce 't1' directly.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the only one that directly produces a 't' as a terminal is listed in each rule. For example, NT68 \u2192 't3', NT66 \u2192 't3', etc. Now, is there any production where a non-terminal directly expands to 't1'? I'm looking through the list and I don't see any. So, there's no non-terminal that directly produces 't1'. Therefore, the first step must involve multiple non-terminals before any terminal is produced.\n\nSo the initial S must produce something that eventually leads to 't1'. Since S can go to NT64 NT78 or NT68 NT63, and NT64 and NT68 don't produce 't1' directly, but their expansions do, perhaps the derivation will go through a series of steps leading to 't1' as the first symbol.\n\nSo let's assume S \u2192 NT64 NT78, then NT78 produces 't2'\u2014but that's the first symbol of the string, which is 't1', so that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the initial production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which starts with 't3', but the string starts with 't1', so that's not matching either. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the first 't1' comes through a longer derivation. Maybe the non-terminals NT64 or GT68 can produce a sequence that starts with 't1' after some steps.\n\nLooking closer, let's consider NT64's production: NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. NT60 can produce 't1' via NT60 \u2192 NT48 NT62. Wait, NT48 \u2192 't3', NT62 \u2192 't2', so that gives 't3' 't2', which is not helpful. Alternatively, NT48 \u2192 NT0, and NT62 \u2192 NT39? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's step through this.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. Then NT60 splits into NT48 NT62, NT14 splits into NT1 NT98.\n\nSo the first part would be NT48 NT62 NT1 NT98. Then, NT48 \u2192 't3', NT62 \u2192 NT39? Wait, looking at NT39: NT39 \u2192 NT27 NT97. Then NT27 \u2192 't5', NT97 \u2192 't3' (as per NT97 \u2192 't3').\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\nNT60 \u2192 NT48 NT62\nNT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98\n\nSo NT60 NT14 becomes NT48 NT62 NT1 NT98.\n\nNow, NT48 \u2192 't3' (from NT48 \u2192 't3')\nNT62 \u2192 NT39 (since NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT97)\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nThe actual production for NT62 is NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT97. So NT62 would produce two symbols. Similarly, NT39 \u2192 NT27 NT97, and NT27 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe instead of trying to track each step, I can build the entire parse tree step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string using the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be built by the grammar without issues. Since the string is relatively short, maybe I can try to parse it starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string is: t1 t4 t0 t0 t3 t4 t5 t5 t1 t0 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5.\n\nLet me attempt to match this by starting with the first symbol, 't1'. But wait, the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that directly produces 't1'. So the first symbol must be the result of a longer chain.

{"custom_id":"request-365","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has all production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to follow CNF because all non-terminals on the left side have exactly two non-terminals on the right (except for those ending with 't', which are terminals, so those are the base cases).\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t2 t0 t1 t5 t5 t2 t2 t2 t5 t3 t5 t2 t1 t4 t1 t2 t2 t1 t0 t2 t1.\n\nI notice that the string starts and ends with various 't's, so I should check if the start symbol S can derive this string by expanding through the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbols S, there are two options:\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nI think I'll need to check both possibilities, but maybe one of them can lead to the desired string. Let's see.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\nSo, we need NT68 to produce the first part of the string and NT63 to produce the second part. But looking at the productions for NT68 and NT63, they both seem to produce two-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc. Let's see:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT68 \u2192 NT75 NT65 and NT65 \u2192 NT96 NT65, but wait, that seems like a problem because NT65's production includes itself and NT96. Hmm, maybe I should recheck the productions.\n\nWait, checking NT65's production: NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62. Oh, that's different. I might have misread earlier. So, NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62, and NT97 is a terminal 't5', and NT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93. Let me see how that plays out.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT68: its productions are:\nNT68 \u2192 NT75 NT65\nNT75 \u2192 't5'\nWait, so NT75 \u2192 t5, which is a terminal. So NT68 can go to t5 NT65, which is t5 followed by NT65. But wait, NT65's production is NT97 NT62, which is t5 followed by NT62. So NT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93, which is t3 and NT93.\n\nLooking at NT93: NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66. NT39 \u2192 t0 NT77, and NT77 \u2192 t3. So NT93 is t3 followed by NT77 \u2192 t3. So NT93 is t3 t3? Wait, no. NT93 is NT39 NT66. NT39 is t0 followed by NT77 which is t3, so NT39 produces t0 t3. Then NT66 is t3. So NT39 NT66 is t0 t3 t3.\n\nSo putting it all together, NT68 is t5 followed by NT65, which is t5 followed by t5 (from NT75) followed by NT62, which is t3 followed by NT93 (which is t0 t3 t3). So the entire expansion for NT68 would be t5 t5 t5 t3 t0 t3 t3. That's a sequence of seven symbols, some of which are terminals, but the string we have starts with t2, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT68 can expand differently, but I don't see another production for NT68 except NT75 NT65. So perhaps this path doesn't lead to the given string.\n\nNow, let's consider the second option: S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64's productions are:\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\nWait, NT68 is as before, which leads to a certain sequence, and NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98. NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90, and so on, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, NT64 can go to NT60 NT14. From NT60, as before, it leads to t5. So NT60 is t5, and NT14 is NT1 NT98, where NT1 is t3, and NT98 is t5. So NT14 \u2192 t3 t5. Thus, NT64 \u2192 t5 t3 t5.\n\nThat's three terminals, but our string starts with t2, which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to find if any of the other productions can lead to the string. Let me go through the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT62: NT62 can go to NT48 NT0, NT0 is NT48 NT47, with NT48 \u2192 t3, and NT47 has multiple options.\n\nFor example, NT47 can go to NT85 NT13. NT85 is NT58 NT28, which is t5 t3. NT13 is t3. So NT47 \u2192 t5 t3 t3.\n\nAlternatively, NT47 can go to NT28 NT22, where NT28 is NT60 NT69. NT60 is t5, NT69 is t2. So NT28 is t5 t2. Then NT22 is NT62 NT74, etc. But this seems too long.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the entire string and trying to break it down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t2 t0 t1 t5 t5 t2 t2 t2 t5 t3 t5 t2 t1 t4 t1 t2 t2 t1 t0 t2 t1.\n\nLet me try to see if it starts with some known symbol.\n\nBut looking at NT62, which produces t3 followed by something else, or perhaps NT65 \u2192 t5 followed by NT97 NT62, which is t5 t5 followed by NT62 \u2192 t3 t3. So maybe t5 t5 t3 t3... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT19 NT63. NT19 is t2, so NT52 \u2192 t2 NT63. NT63 \u2192 t5. So NT52 \u2192 t2 t5. But in the string, the first two are t2 t0. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, looking for the first symbol t2.\n\nPossible symbols that produce t2 include NT69 \u2192 t2, NT77 \u2192 t3, NT45 \u2192 t5, etc. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT18 \u2192 t1, NT50 \u2192 t4, NT62 \u2192 t3, NT55 \u2192 t4, NT94 \u2192 t2.\n\nSo, to generate t2, possible sources are NT18 \u2192 t1, wait no. Wait, checking the productions:\n\nLooking at NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT66. NT39 \u2192 t0 NT77. NT77 \u2192 t3, so NT39 is t0 t3. NT66 \u2192 t3. So NT62 is t0 t3 t3. Not matching t2.\n\nWait, looking through the symbols that have terminal symbols, I notice NT18 \u2192 t1, but there's NT26 \u2192 t2. Yes, NT26 \u2192 't2' directly. So if the grammar can produce t2 as a single terminal, then that could be a start.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S is either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Neither of these would directly give a terminal, as they are both two non-terminals. So perhaps the entire string must be derived from one of these via some steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with NT26, which is 't2', then goes to NT26, which is another 't2'? No, because NT26 is a single terminal. But the entire string must be generated by the start symbol S, which is a combination of two non-terminals. So perhaps the entire string is made up by expanding NT68 and NT63, each expanding into some terminals.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, let's see what NT68 and NT63 can produce.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT75 NT65.\n\nNT75 \u2192 't5'.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62.\n\nNT97 is 't5', and NT62 can be expanded as per its productions.\n\nNT62 can be:\n- NT48 NT0, which NT48 \u2192 't3' and NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47 \u2192 t3 and then NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-390","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. The CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it restricts each production rule to having no more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not dealing with a parser here\u2014I'm just trying to see if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. It looks like these tokens are symbols in the grammar. Let me list them out to make it clearer: t5, t5, t3, t5, t1, t1, t5, t2, t1, t4, t5, t3, t0, t3, t0, t0, t2, t1, t0, t0, t5, t5.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or terminals if they're leaf production rules. The start symbol is S, which immediately expands into either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, the first step is to consider whether the string can be generated starting from S.\n\nSince both options start with two non-terminals, I need to see if either can lead to the given string. Let's take the first option: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Breaking that down, each of these non-terminals (NT68 and NT63) must then expand into the appropriate sequences to build up the string.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with t5, t5, t3, etc. The terminals t5, t3, etc., are the result of the productions ending in those terminals. So, perhaps the key is to trace the expansion from S downward and see if it can match the string.\n\nI think I'll need to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be matched. Let's start by considering the first production S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68's productions include things like NT48 NT0, NT19 NT66, etc. I need to see what terminal symbols NT68 can generate. Looking at the rules for NT68, I see NT68 \u2192 NT48 NT0 and NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18. Wait, that's a bit confusing because NT68 appears on both sides. So, perhaps NT68 can be expanded into something else.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules more carefully, I see that NT68 has several productions, but some are cyclic like NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18, which might complicate things, but perhaps it's part of a left-recursive or other kind of structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals can end up producing them.\n\nWait, the first symbol in the string is t5. So, which non-terminals can produce t5?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, and in the rules, NT9 is defined as NT44 NT15, and also NT85 \u2192 NT18 NT8, which I think leads to t2 or t5. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at all the production rules that end in t symbols. For example, NT85 \u2192 t2, NT19 \u2192 t3, etc. It might be easier to work backwards from the string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by S. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nThe string is of length 21: t5, t5, t3, t5, t1, t1, t5, t2, t1, t4, t5, t3, t0, t3, t0, t0, t2, t1, t0, t0, t5, t5.\n\nWait, actually, I just counted and there are 20 tokens, each separated by a space. So the string is 20 symbols long.\n\nGiven that the CFG is in CNF, each step in the derivation will increase the length by 1 (each production increases the number of symbols by 1, since it's either two non-terminals).\n\nSo starting from S, the first expansion is two non-terminals, then each of those can be expanded.\n\nBut it's 20 symbols, so starting from S, after 19 productions, we'll have 2 + 19 = 21 symbols, but the given string is 20. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Each non-terminal expansion typically produces two symbols each time. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, each A becomes two symbols. But when a non-terminal is a terminal, that's the end.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. In this case, the grammar seems to have some productions that are two non-terminals and some that are a terminal.\n\nSo each time a non-terminal A is expanded, if it's two non-terminals, we add two symbols, if it's a terminal, we add one symbol.\n\nSo starting from S, which is a non-terminal, so after the first expansion, we have two non-terminals. Then each of those can be expanded again.\n\nBut the number of symbols in the derived string grows depending on how many terminals are produced.\n\nGiven that, the string is 20 symbols long, which is an even number, meaning that the depth of derivation would be such that the number of non-terminals is equal to the number of symbols divided by 2, but it's not straightforward because some non-terminals produce terminals or non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must start with either S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me check the first symbol in the string: t5. So, which non-terminals derive into t5?\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's list the production rules that terminate in t5:\n\nLooking through the productions for all non-terminals ending with t:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t5? Let me check. No, looking through the list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT68 \u2192 t3? No. Wait, looking through all the productions:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go through each rule and see which non-terminals produce t's:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, the only terminals are:\n\nt0: NT9, NT66, etc.\nt1: NT9, NT27, etc.\nt2: NT26, NT69, NT97, etc.\nt3: NT3, NT85, NT26, etc.\nt4: NT34, NT58, NT65, etc.\nt5: NT1, NT39, NT62, etc.\nt6: NT45\nt7: NT33, NT37, NT94, etc.\nt8: NT2, etc.\nt9: NT94, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully:\n\nThe productions that result in a terminal (i.e., ending in t0-t5):\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT2 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT4: Not terminal in the list; all productions are to non-terminals.\n- NT5: Not terminal.\n- NT6: Not terminal.\n- NT7: Not terminal.\n- NT8: t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t1\n- NT10: Not terminal.\n- NT12: t5 (from NT12 \u2192 t5)\n- NT13: t3\n- NT14: t1\n- NT15: t3\n- NT16: Not terminal.\n- NT17: t4\n- NT18 \u2192 t5 or t1?\nWait, looking through the productions, for NT18:\n\nLooking back, the rules are:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT67 NT94, which is a non-terminal. That's not a terminal. Also, elsewhere:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38, which doesn't terminate.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some.

{"custom_id":"request-386","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I'm evaluating is `t2 t4 t1 t1 t5 t1 t4 t2 t1 t5 t3 t0 t2 t3 t4 t3 t3 t1 t5 t5 t0 t5`. \n\nFirst, I should remember what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A CFG is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All productions are two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. That's important because the way strings are generated through leftmost derivations can be more straightforward when parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that there are several production rules leading directly to terminals, like S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and rules such as NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT66, and many terminals like NT3, NT81, etc., are mapped directly to 't' numbers. So, the grammar seems to have a start symbol S which eventually breaks down into terminals over a series of steps.\n\nThe string given is split into a sequence of t2, t4, t1, etc. Each ti represents a terminal symbol, I think corresponding to specific production steps. My goal is to see if this sequence can be generated by leftmost derivations from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. **Identify how the string is built:** Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step in the derivation must replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\n2. **Check if each terminal in the string can be derived correctly:** The string length is 21, which is quite long, so I'll have to follow the derivations step by step, perhaps starting from the start symbol and building up.\n\n3. **Reverse the process:** Alternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, maybe I can work backwards by checking if each terminal can be produced by a single production step or by a sequence leading down to it.\n\nWait, but the string is the result of a leftmost derivation, so the order of application matters. Let me think about the structure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can only produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78 because those are the two rules for S. So the first step in any derivation will be replacing S with either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, considering the string starts with t2. So the first step must be producing a string that starts with t2. Let's see which production leads to that.\n\nLooking at NT62, NT65, etc., I notice that some NT rules lead directly to 't's.\n\nWait, let me check the NT rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT67 NT20\n- NT67 \u2192 t2\n- NT20 \u2192 t5\n\nSo NT2 \u2192 t2 t5.\n\nBut the first symbol of the string is t2, which would require the first part of the string to come from a t2 production perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string starts with a production leading to 't2'. Let me check the NT rules that produce 't2's.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT34 NT85, and NT34 can be t1, and NT85 can be t2.\n\nWait, in the given NT rules, I see NT85 \u2192 t2, so that's one way to get a t2.\n\nSimilarly, other rules:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t0\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT99 \u2192 t5\n- NT88 \u2192 t4\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the possible steps.\n\nThe string is: t2 t4 t1 t1 t5 t1 t4 t2 t1 t5 t3 t0 t2 t3 t4 t3 t3 t1 t5 t5 t0 t5.\n\nSo, it's each symbol ti, seems to be a single symbol, perhaps each corresponds to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe way to proceed is to see if each ti can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a derivation tree that would generate this string.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Let me think about it backwards. Each step in a leftmost derivation would produce a sequence that can be broken down into the rules.\n\nLet me attempt to see:\n\nThe last symbol is t5.

{"custom_id":"request-407","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t0 t5 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t3 t2 t1 t0`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. It's a set of productions where each non-terminal (like S, NT62, etc.) is rewritten into other symbols. The entire grammar seems to be broken down into various non-terminals, each of which eventually leads to a terminal symbol (like t0, t2, etc.) or another non-terminal. \n\nThe key here is that the string is composed of these terminal symbols: t0, t2, t5, t4, etc., and each should correspond to the right-hand side of some production in the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nI remember that the CYK algorithm is useful for parsing context-free grammars, but I'm not sure if I should use that. Alternatively, maybe I can try to simulate the parsing process or look for patterns in the string that might match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first thing I notice is that some terminals repeat, like t0, t2, t5, etc. I should check if the grammar has any non-terminals that can produce these. For instance, I see that S is used in the top-level productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the string should start with the symbols produced by NT68 and NT63.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules for NT68 and NT63. NT68's productions include leading to t3, t0, t2, etc., and NT63 can lead to 't2' or other terminals. The first symbol in the string is t0, which might come from NT68. Let me check NT68's productions:\n\n- NT68 -> NT68 NT61\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n- ... and others.\n\nSo yes, NT68 can produce t0, t3, etc. So if the string starts with t0, it's possible that it's a result of NT68.\n\nNow, moving to the next part of the string. After the first t0 (from NT68), the next symbol is t2. Let's look at what other non-terminals can produce t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT65 -> NT96 NT65, but that's a self-recursive production which might not help. NT62 has a production that can lead to t2 via NT77 and NT85, etc., but the string has t2 next.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step. Let's consider that the string is a result of applying the productions rule by rule.\n\nThe entire string has 21 symbols. Each production either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. Since the string starts with t0, which is a terminal, it must directly correspond to a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is in CNF, so each production that introduces a terminal only has a single terminal on the right-hand side. So each terminal in the string must come from a separate production, and the non-terminals in between would be processed recursively.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the string is all terminals, it must be that the derivation leads directly to these terminals step by step. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions. Let me try to think of how the entire string could be generated.\n\nThe string is: t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t0 t5 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t3 t2 t1 t0.\n\nLooking at the start, the first t0 could come from NT68, as established. Then the next t2 would need to come from a production that either directly produces t2 or from another non-terminal that can produce t2.\n\nLooking at NT63's productions, since the first part of S is NT64 (which I haven't checked) or NT68 NT63. Wait, the top-level is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the entire string is generated by expanding S.\n\nSo S would expand to NT68 and NT63, each of which would then expand further until all are terminals.\n\nSo the string is built as S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then each of those non-terminals (NT68 and NT63) expand until they produce terminals.\n\nBut given that, the string is a series of terminals that result from expanding these non-terminals. So to determine if the string is possible, I need to see if each symbol in the string can be reached by the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I should look for sequences that match the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, maybe I can parse the string using the grammar. Let's try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t0 t5 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t3 t2 t1 t0\n\nLet me write it as a list to process:\n\nsymbols = ['t0', 't2', 't0', 't2', 't0', 't0', 't5', 't5', 't4', 't2', 't2', 't0', 't0', 't4', 't0', 't2', 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't2', 't1', 't0']\n\nThe entire derivation starts with S, which is NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT61 and some others. Or wait, S can be NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So perhaps the starting non-terminals are NT68 and NT63.\n\nLet me first try to process the symbols step by step.\n\nFirst symbol: t0. So in NT68, can NT68 produce t0? Yes, via NT68 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo after consuming the first symbol, we have N68 done, and need to expand NT63.\n\nSecond symbol: t2. So NT63's productions. Let's see what NT63 can do.\n\nLooking at NT63's productions:\n\nNT63 -> 't2' (from the list: `NT63 -> 't2'`). So that's possible. So the second symbol t2 can be produced directly by NT63.\n\nNow, the third symbol is t0. That would come from the next non-terminal in the string, which is whatever comes next after NT63. But wait, the string after t2 is t0, which is the third symbol. Since S is NT68 and NT63, after processing t2, the next would be whatever NT68's next production is. Wait no, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, S is NT68 followed by NT63. So the first symbol would come from NT68, the second from NT63. So for the entire string, it's S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which would mean that the string is a sequence of symbols produced by NT68 followed by symbols produced by NT63.\n\nWait no, that's not correct. The entire string must be the result of the entire tree. So when S expands into NT68 NT63, each of those can expand into more non-terminals or terminals. So the parsing tree could have a fan-out where each leaf is a terminal.\n\nBut since S is a top-level production, the entire string is the sequence of the productions from NT68 and NT63.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of how the entire string is built. Since S is NT68 NT63, the string is the concatenation of the symbols produced by NT68 and the symbols produced by NT63.\n\nSo for example, if NT68 produces 't0' and NT63 also produces 't2', then S would start with t0 t2... But our string starts with t0 t2 t0... So perhaps NT68's expansion produces multiple terminals, each coming from its productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is built by expanding each non-terminal to its right, step by step.\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the respective non-terminal in the correct order.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to see if each part can be split into the productions of NT68 and NT63.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production in the grammar either introduces a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the parse tree must correspond to this structure.\n\nBut given the string's length, it's going to be time-consuming to consider each possible expansion.\n\nAlternatively, I can look"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-404","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string provided is `t1 t5 t5 t5 t2 t3 t2 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t1 t5 t4 t1 t4 t5 t4 t4 t3 t5 t0`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'm a bit rusty on Chomsky normal form (CNF), but I remember that in CNF, every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to satisfy CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal (like 't1', 't2', etc.). Wait, actually, looking closely, some of the right-hand sides have two terminals, which I think might be a problem because in CNF, you can only have one terminal at a time, right? Oh, but the grammar is still in CNF; maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, productions can have two terminals, or one terminal, or two non-terminals. So I think the grammar is correctly in CNF. Okay, moving on.\n\nThe string we have is a sequence of terminals: t1, t5, t5, t5, t2, t3, t2, t2, t4, t0, t1, t0, t1, t5, t4, t1, t4, t5, t4, t4, t3, t5, t0. That's a lot of t's and digits. I notice that the grammar seems to have a lot of rules that lead to 't's, which are likely the terminals that form the string.\n\nMy approach should be to try to parse this string using the given grammar. If I can derive the string step by step by applying the production rules correctly, then it's generated by the grammar; otherwise, it's not.\n\nBut parsing manually could be time-consuming, especially with such a long string. I should look for patterns or parts of the string that might indicate which production rules are used. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the string starts with t1. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals directly produce 't's. For example, NT26 \u2192 t2, NT38 \u2192 t3, NT45 \u2192 t5, and so on. Also, certain rules produce two non-terminals, which I suppose would eventually resolve into other t's.\n\nBut I'm not sure whether to start from the top-down or bottom-up approach. Since the string is given, perhaps a top-down approach would work, trying to split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider that the start symbol is S, which according to the grammar has two production rules: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the string must start with either (NT68, NT63) or (NT64, NT78). Let me see the string's first symbol is t1.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT68 seems to be one of the non-terminals. Let me check what's NT68's production. Looking through the rules, I see that NT68 \u2192 't3'. So if the first part is NT68, which produces t3, but our string starts with t1, so that can't be right. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, wait, let me double-check. No, the first symbol is t1, so perhaps the production is from NT68 to t3 doesn't help here.\n\nWait, maybe it's the other production from S. Let me check the other option. S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Let me see what's NT64 and NT78. Looking at the rules, I don't immediately see a rule for NT64. Wait, no, the grammar is in CNF, so all productions should be either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through the rules, there's NT64 \u2192 't3' according to this grammar. No, wait, in the rules provided, I have:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\n\nAnd looking further, NT60 \u2192 't5' and NT14 has a production, for example, NT14 \u2192 't1'. Wait, let me parse this:\n\nWait, NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. So NT60 produces 't5', and NT14 also produces some t's. Let me see the rule for NT14: NT14 \u2192 't1'. So NT64 -> 't5' 't1', which would result in t5 t1. But the string starts with t1, so could the entire string start with NT64? But wait, the first symbol is t1, so let's see:\n\nIf the first part is NT64: NT64 produces 't5', NT14 produces 't1', so together 't5 t1', but the string starts with 't1 t5 ...', so that's the reverse order. Therefore, perhaps NT64 is not the right starting point.\n\nWait, this suggests that the entire string starts with 't1', which would need to come from a production that starts with a terminal. Looking at the grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't1'? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, some non-terminals produce 't1'. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 Wait, no, the grammar provided doesn't have a production for NT6. Let me check the given rules again. Hmm, the rules provided include NT63, NT64, etc., but I don't see a production for NT6 except S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all non-terminals that produce terminals to see which could start the string:\n\nLooking through the rules, any NT that directly produces a terminal:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5' (Wait, looking at the rules, some are: NT48 \u2192 't3', NT47 \u2192 't5', NT45 \u2192 't5', etc. So wait, the actual terminals are when a non-terminal directly expands to a single 't' or a number? Or maybe 't1' to 't9' are terminals and others are non-terminals. Hmm, I might have misunderstood the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps 't0' to 't9' are terminals, and other non-terminals like NT38, NT47, etc., have productions that lead into more non-terminals. So in that case, to generate 't1', some non-terminal must directly produce it. Let me check which non-terminals in the grammar directly produce 't1'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT15 \u2192 't3'\n- NT27 \u2192 't5'\n- NT39 \u2192 't0'\n- NT48 \u2192 't3'\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n- NT94 \u2192 't2'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' (Wait, no, NT26 is a non-terminal. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, for example, NT26 \u2192 't4' and other non-terminals. But I think 't4' is a terminal symbol. So NT26 can produce 't4' directly. Similarly, NT12 \u2192 't5', which is a terminal. So the NT's that produce terminals are any NT with a production where the right-hand side is a single terminal. Looking through the rules, here are some that do produce terminals:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't4', 't2', 't1'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT98 \u2192 't2' (but no, NT98's production is 't4' and 't3').\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each production in the grammar is either (1) A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or (2) A \u2192 a (a terminal).

{"custom_id":"request-428","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t4 t4 t5 t1 t0 t2 t4 t1 t4 t3 t1 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1 t4 t5 t2 t5 t2 t4 t2 t4`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and other productions like NT3 \u2192 't4' or NT19 \u2192 't5' are terminals.\n\nNow, to check if the string is generated by this grammar, I think about how string derivation works in such grammars. Each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either both non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal, etc. Since the given string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation must reduce all non-terminals down to terminals.\n\nI think I'll need to see if there's a way to parse the string backwards, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for CNF grammars. But since I'm not too familiar with the CYK details, maybe I can approach it by seeing if each terminal can be matched step by step.\n\nBut wait, the CYK algorithm builds a table where each cell represents whether a particular substring can be generated by a particular non-terminal. Since the string is quite long (24 symbols), this might take a while, but perhaps I can spot some patterns or inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t4`, and the last is `t4`. Let's see what NTs produce `t4`. Looking through the grammar, NT44 \u2192 `t5`, NT34 \u2192 `t1`, NT12 \u2192 `t5`, NT48 \u2192 `t3`, NT75 \u2192 `t3`, NT99 \u2192 `t5`, NT84 \u2192 `t4`, and some others don't produce `t4`. Wait, is there any NT that directly produces `t4`? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through all the NT symbols, I notice that some like NT18 \u2192 `t1`, NT9 \u2192 `t5`, NT5 \u2192 not sure, NT2 \u2192 `t3`, NT8 \u2192 `t5`, NT14 \u2192 `t1`, NT44 \u2192 `t5`, NT39 \u2192 `t0`, etc. Wait, does any NT directly produce `t4`?\n\nLooking again: NT44 is `t5`, NT84 is `t4`. So yes, NT84 can produce `t4`. That means the starting symbol S must eventually derive into something that ends with NT84.\n\nWait, but S is the starting symbol, and its productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the entire string must come from one of these. Let's see, the entire string is a sequence of 24 terminals. Since each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, the string must be built by a binary tree of productions.\n\nBut wait, the given string has 24 terminals. Let's count the number of symbols in the string: t4, t4, t5, t1, t0, t2, t4, t1, t4, t3, t1, t5, t0, t2, t1, t1, t4, t5, t2, t5, t2, t4, t2, t4. So that's 24 symbols. \n\nEach production step doubles the number of symbols. Starting from S, which is non-terminal, the first step would replace S with two non-terminals, giving us two symbols. Then each of those could be replaced, etc. If the string comes from a single S, the number of symbols at each level would be 1 (S), then 2, then 4, 8, 16, etc. \n\nWait, but the string has 24 symbols, which is not a power of 2. 24 isn't a power of 2, and the maximum we can get with n productions is 2^n symbols. The nearest lower power of 2 is 16 (2^4) and higher is 32 (2^5). Since 24 isn't a power of 2, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar, which produces strings with lengths that are powers of 2 after each production step.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, so starting from S, the first step is two symbols, then each of those can be expanded, so after n steps, the maximum number of symbols is 2^n. So the total string length would have to be some power of 2? Or maybe not necessarily, because some non-terminals may stay as non-terminals, and others may be terminals.\n\nWait, no. Because the only terminals in the grammar come directly from the productions where the LHS is a non-terminal, and RHS is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for example, NT3 \u2192 't4', which is a terminal.\n\nBut to build a string, each terminal is the result of a production where one of the non-terminals is replaced by a terminal. So the entire string is built by replacing all non-terminals down, with each step doubling the number of symbols.\n\nWait, actually, no. The length of the string would be equal to the number of terminals generated by the grammar. Each non-terminal replacement increases the length by 1 (if it's a terminal plus a non-terminal, or two non-terminals leading to a terminal). Wait, no, each step is replacing one non-terminal with two symbols, which could be either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or both terminals, but in our case, most are either non-terminals or single terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify:\n\nIn CNF, each production replaces a single non-terminal with exactly two symbols (which could be terminals or non-terminals). So the length of the string increases by 1 each time a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. Wait, no. For example:\n\nIf I have a production A \u2192 BC, and B \u2192 ab (terminals), then A can be replaced as follows: A \u2192 BC \u2192 abC, then C can be replaced depending on how. Wait, no, because B must be replaced first. So each replacement of a non-terminal with two symbols (which could be terminals or non-terminals) affects the length.\n\nAlternatively, starting from S, which is 1 symbol. Then S \u2192 NT68 NT63: now 2 symbols. Then each NT can be replaced, so the total length depends on how many non-terminals are replaced by terminals. \n\nFor example, suppose both NT68 and NT63 are replaced by terminals in the next step. Then the string's length would be 2. If one of them is a non-terminal and the other a terminal, it becomes 1 + terminal \u2192 total length 2 again? Hmm, maybe not. It depends on the number of steps.\n\nWait, no, each step doubles the number of symbols. For example:\n\nStart: S \u2192 NT1 NT2 (2 symbols)\nNext step: Replace NT1 with A and NT2 with B. So string becomes AB. But if they're terminals, it's 2 symbols. If one is non-terminal, then replacing it would lead to, say, NT3, so A becomes C D (if NT3 \u2192 CD), but then the total length becomes 3 (C D B), which isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each replacement replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. So the length is always increasing by one each time. Wait, no, not exactly. Because each replacement of a non-terminal adds one more symbol. Starting with 1, then each replacement increases the length by one. But in reality, it's tricky because some of the symbols may also be non-terminals, which would need further replacements.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So for example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is two symbols. Then, each of those could be non-terminals or terminals. If both are terminals, the string is done with length 2. If both are non-terminals, they each can be replaced, leading to 4 symbols, and so on. So the maximum possible length for n productions is 2^n.\n\nBut wait, the given string has 24 symbols. 24 is not a power of 2. The closest powers are 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). So unless the string is exactly 2^n, it's impossible for it to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, does that mean the string can't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-424","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check. The string is `t0 t3 t4 t0 t1 t3 t0 t2 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t5 t1 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2 t0`. I need to determine if this string is generated by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where every non-terminal (on the left side) produces exactly two non-terminals on the right side, or a single terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string must be derived from S by replacing all non-terminals with terminals according to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some rules have two non-terminals separated by a space, which suggests they are the left-hand sides (LHS) of the productions. For example, `S -> NT68 NT63` means S can produce \"t3\" and \"t3\", but I'm not sure what NT63 produces. Wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production's RHS should be either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, some productions have more than two parts. For instance, `NT62 -> NT48 NT0`, which is two non-terminals. Similarly, `NT81 -> NT78 NT97`, which is also two non-terminals. But other productions, like `NT35 -> 't3'`, are terminals. Wait, but in the provided grammar, the rules seem to have either a terminal or two non-terminals, but each production is written as \"X -> A B\", so maybe all rules are in the form of two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nWait, no, some rules have \"X -> 't0'\", which is a single terminal. So each production is either two non-terminals, or a single terminal, which fits the Chomsky normal form if we have productions like A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 't', etc.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that in the given grammar, most rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, but some also have rules like `NT75 -> 't3'`. So the grammar is indeed in Chomsky normal form. \n\nThe string is a series of terminals: `t0 t3 t4 t0 t1 t3 t0 t2 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t5 t1 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2 t0`. So we need to see if this can be derived from S.\n\nSince each step in a CFG derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (which could be non-terminals or terminals), the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps after starting from S. The given string has 24 symbols. The start symbol S is the only non-terminal, so the derivation would start with S, then at each step, each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. So for a string of length L, the number of steps n must satisfy 2^n = L. But 2^4 = 16 and 2^5=32. 24 is not a power of two, so this is a problem.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. Wait, in this case, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting with S, after one step, you have two symbols (if S is replaced by two non-terminals). Then each subsequent step can increase the number of symbols by a factor of 2 or not, depending on whether non-terminals are replaced or not. But in general, for a context-free grammar, the length can vary, but in this case, the string has 24 symbols. \n\nBut wait, perhaps each production increases the count by 1 if a non-terminal is replaced by two terminals, or by 2 if it's replaced by two non-terminals. But actually, for each replacement of a non-terminal by two symbols, regardless of whether they are non-terminals or terminals, the count increases by 1. So starting with 1 symbol (S), after one replacement, you have 2, then 3, then 4, etc. So the string length should be a number that can be formed by a series of replacements starting from 1, which can vary, but for most cases, the length is more than 2^n. Wait, no, actually, no. Each step can involve replacing multiple non-terminals, so the length can vary more unpredictably.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the given string's length must be a certain value. Let me count the given string's symbols: the string is `t0 t3 t4 t0 t1 t3 t0 t2 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t5 t1 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2 t0`. Let's count them: \n\n1. t0\n2. t3\n3. t4\n4. t0\n5. t1\n6. t3\n7. t0\n8. t2\n9. t3\n10. t5\n11. t3\n12. t3\n13. t3\n14. t1\n15. t5\n16. t5\n17. t1\n18. t3\n19. t2\n20. t0\n21. t0\n22. t4\n23. t2\n24. t0\n\nYes, 24 symbols. So the string is 24 symbols long. \n\nIn a context-free grammar, the derivation process starts from S and each step can replace a single non-terminal with two symbols. Therefore, the length of the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of steps taken, or perhaps a number that can be formed through a series of binary expansions. However, in most CFGs, the number of symbols in the string can vary, but for this grammar, perhaps it's structured in a way that the length is a key factor.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, for a CFG in Chomsky normal form, the length of the generated string is not necessarily a power of two. For example, S can produce two non-terminals, each of which can produce two more, leading to four, etc. Alternatively, some non-terminals may produce terminals, which do not expand further. So the length can be any number that is compatible with the structure of the grammar.\n\nBut in this case, 24 is a specific number. I'm not sure if the grammar can generate a string of 24 symbols, but perhaps that's not the main issue. Instead, the main issue is whether the sequence of terminals matches the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the grammar productions and see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of replacements that follow the production rules.\n\nBut looking at the productions, I notice that NT84 goes to 't3', NT44 to 't4', etc. However, the string has 't4' appearing multiple times, like at position 3 is 't4'. So perhaps the string starts with 't4', which would come from a non-terminal that produces 't4'. Let's see: \n\nLooking at NT47, is there a production to 't4'? Checking the grammar, I see NT47 has several productions like `NT47 -> NT85 NT13`, `NT47 -> NT28 NT22`, etc., but I don't see a production that directly gives 't4'. Similarly, NT36 isn't in the grammar, so I can't have 't4' unless another NT produces it, but I don't see any. \n\nWait, that's a problem. Let me check the provided grammar again. In the productions, I see rules like `NT69 -> 't2'`, `NT68 -> 't3'`, etc. Let me go through each production's RHS terminals. \n\nLooking through the list, the terminals are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', etc. The specific productions that produce single terminals include:\n\n- S -> NT68 NT63 (so S can go to 't3' and another)\n- S -> NT64 NT78 (S to 't3' and another)\n- NT62 -> 't2'?\nWait no, NT62's productions are:\n- NT62 -> NT48 NT0\n- NT62 -> NT68 NT69 etc.\n\nWait, no, the only terminal is in NT69: `NT69 -> 't2'`. And NT76: `NT76 -> 't1'`. Hmm, let me find all the productions that have a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- `NT22 -> 't0'`\n- NT34 -> 't1'\n- NT48 -> 't3'\n- NT50 -> 't4' (looks like a production)\nWait, looking more carefully, the lines in the grammar"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-445","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to check if a given string is produced by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's start by understanding what the grammar looks like.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a start symbol S which can produce two options: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, any string generated by this grammar should start with either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. But wait, in the string provided, the first token is t4, but looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the rules seem to produce terminal symbols 't' followed by a number or other NT symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I should map the NT (non-terminals) to their corresponding symbols from the string. The string is a sequence of t's and numbers ending with t0, t1, etc. So, each NT rule expands into a combination of terminals and NTs, but eventually, to produce the string, all non-terminals must be expanded into terminals in some way.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the rules have terminals as their right-hand sides. For example, NT75 \u2192 't1', NT38 \u2192 't3', and so on. So, to produce the given string, each non-terminal in the derivation must expand into the correct terminal sequence.\n\nThe string given is: `t4 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3 t1 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t3 t5 t0 t2 t1 t4 t1 t0 t0 t0 t3 t3`. Let's count the tokens: that's 27 tokens, so the derivation would start with S, which would split into two parts, each of which needs to expand into the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nWait, the string has to exactly match the concatenation of the two parts from either S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, the first two symbols of the string would determine which rule to use. But the first symbol is t4, so maybe we need to see which initial non-terminals expand to t4 followed by some other symbols.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, for example, NT68 \u2192 't3', which can't start with t4. Hmm, perhaps I need to look at each rule and see which can produce t4 at some point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should parse the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if each rule can produce the required sequence.\n\nLet me list the possible initial steps. Since the string starts with t4, which is part of NT68's production, but NT68 is 't3', which is not t4. Alternatively, maybe a deeper expansion is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by considering the entire string and breaking it into parts. The string has 27 tokens, so the initial S must split into two parts, each requiring a certain number of tokens.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT68 NT63: Each of these NTs would produce a certain number of tokens. Similarly for S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLet's check how many tokens each rule produces by expanding recursively. For example, NT68 \u2192 't3' (1 token), but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we need to see if the string starts with a certain expansion.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is too time-consuming. Perhaps I should look for specific NTs that can produce t4.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT45 \u2192 't5', NT47 \u2192 't5', NT24 \u2192 't1', NT34 \u2192 't1', NT55 \u2192 't4'? Wait, looking back: No, I don't see NT55 \u2192 t4. Wait, in the rules, maybe NT17 is produced by some NTs?\n\nWait, let me check each rule that ends with a terminal symbol. For example, NT89 \u2192 t5, NT24 \u2192 t1, NT39 \u2192 t0, etc. Hmm, I don't see a rule that directly produces 't4' as a terminal, except perhaps some I might have missed.\n\nWait, let's look through the rules provided:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3' and 't3' again (from the rules: NT68 seems to only go to 't3' sometimes, but I need to check). Wait, looking at the rules provided:\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n- NT62 \u2192 t2 or t3\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT64 \u2192 t3\n- NT78 \u2192 t3\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT26 \u2192 t1 or t2 or t4\n- Wait, looking back: NT26 \u2192 t1: For example, in the rules, I see NT26 \u2192 't1' (multiple times), and NT26 \u2192 't2' and 't4' as well.\n\nAh, so NT26 can produce t1, t2, or t4. So if a part of the string needs a t4, one of the NT26's could produce that.\n\nSo, starting with S, if the first rule is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then NT68 is 't3', then NT63? Let's see NT63's production. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT63, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, the provided grammar includes rules like NT65 \u2192 't5', NT63 \u2192 't5' (from NT63 \u2192 't5'), and NT66 \u2192 't3'. So if S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then that would be 't3' plus 't5', but the string starts with t4, so that can't be right. So perhaps the correct rule is S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nWait, S can be NT64 or NT78. Let's check NT64: Looking through the rules, NT64 \u2192 't3' (from NT64 \u2192 't3'). So that can't be right because the string starts with t4. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I need to recheck the grammar rules.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

So yeah, NT26 can produce t2, t4, etc.\n\nSo, NT26 can produce t4, which is needed at the beginning of the string.\n\nSo, considering the start:\n\nThe string starts with t4. Therefore, the first step must involve NT26 \u2192 t4, followed by other symbols. Wait, but S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would start with t3, which doesn't match t4. So that can't be the correct path.\n\nWait, does any non-terminal expand to t4 as the start? Because the string starts with t4, that suggests that either the first NT in the expansion is one that can produce t4, or the combination of NTs can produce a token that starts with t4. But in the given grammar, is there any path that starts with t4?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT26 can produce t4, so maybe the entire string is built by expanding NT26 into t4 followed by other symbols. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nSo, perhaps S \u2192 NT64 NT78 is the correct path because another rule may expand into a sequence that starts with t4. Wait, but S \u2192 NT64 produces t3, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but that would expand to t3 followed by something else. But the string starts with t4, so that can't be. Therefore, I'm stuck because neither S option starts with t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules or the string.

{"custom_id":"request-449","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is provided with production rules. Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that many rules end with a terminal symbol (like 't0', 't1', etc.) and a few are non-terminals (like S, NT62, etc.).\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t3 t1 t1 t4 t3 t2 t4 t5 t1 t4 t2 t4 t1 t1 t4 t0 t1 t4 t5 t0 t5 t1 t5 t0 t3`.\n\nHmm, the first step is probably to see if we can parse this string using the given grammar. Since it's a CNF, the grammar can be parsed using a pushdown automaton or by constructing a transition table for the CYK algorithm. But doing CYK manually might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe we can reconstruct the derivation from the string.\n\nWait, another approach is to substitute the terminals in the string with non-terminals, starting from the rightmost terminal and seeing if it can be generated by a rule. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which has the following rules:\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo the first step is to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to one of the two production rules of S. But how? Each production rule has two non-terminals, so the string must be split into two parts, each starting with NTsomething.\n\nWait, that's a bit vague. Let me think. Since the grammar is in CNF, the first production is NT68 \u2192 something, and NT63 \u2192 something else, so the string should have a way to split into two parts, each generated by NT68 and NT63, or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t3. Let's see what rules produce t3. Checking the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3' (from the given rules)\nNT63 \u2192 't3' as well.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs might produce different terminals. So NT68 and NT63 both can produce t3. So maybe the string starts with either NT68 or NT64 producing t3, and NT63 or NT78 producing the rest.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t3, which can come from NT68 or NT63. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nFirst case: the string is generated by S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nSo the first part is t3, which comes from NT68, and the remainder of the string is the part generated by NT63.\n\nThe remainder after the first t3 is: t1 t1 t4 t3 t2 t4 t5 t1 t4 t2 t4 t1 t1 t4 t0 t1 t4 t5 t0 t5 t1 t5 t0 t3.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let's think about the structure.\n\nEach NT can produce another NT or a terminal. So perhaps it's easier to work from the end. Let me look at the last part, which is the last few t's. The last token is t3. Looking at the grammar rules, how do non-terminals produce t3?\n\nChecking the rules, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\nNT63 \u2192 t3\nNT85 \u2192 t3 (Wait, no: in the original grammar, NT68 \u2192 't3', NT63 \u2192 't3', but looking at the provided rules, I think some might produce 't3'. Let me scan through the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar's production rules, I see lines like 'NT68 -> t3'? No, let me check. Wait, in the grammar, NT24 \u2192 t1, but looking again, no, NT68 in the grammar is probably a non-terminal that eventually produces t3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about how non-terminals can generate t3. Let's list all the production rules that produce t3:\n\nWait, from the given grammar, I see:\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 t3\n- NT19 \u2192 t3? No, looking again, the rules: NT3 \u2192 t4, NT2 \u2192 t5, etc. Let me search through the provided grammar.\n\nWait, I see:\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 t3\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT50 \u2192 t4\n- etc. So, the non-terminals that directly produce t3 are NT68, NT63, and others like NT74? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT74 \u2192 t2, which is given under NT74 \u2192 't2', but looking at the provided list, it's listed as NT74 -> NT33 NT85, which further translates to terminals:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of which non-terminals directly produce t3.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nLooking for any production where the right-hand side is t3. Let's scan:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 t3\n- Are there any others? Let me check all the production rules:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT34 NT85 (evaluates to t1 and t2, so t1 t2, which is not t3)\nNT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81, which becomes t5 t3, so t5 t3 is t5 followed by t3, which is perhaps not the case here)\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. So for the string, let's assume the first t3 comes from NT68, and then the rest needs to be generated by NT63. Alternatively, first t3 from NT63 and rest from NT68.\n\nWait, wait. Let's proceed methodically.\n\nFirst, the string is: ['t3', 't1', 't1', 't4', 't3', 't2', 't4', 't5', 't1', 't4', 't2', 't4', 't1', 't1', 't4', 't0', 't1', 't4', 't5', 't0', 't5', 't1', 't5', 't0', 't3']\n\nNumber of tokens: 25. So each S production has two parts, so the string is 25 tokens, which is an odd number. Wait, but wait, each production for S splits the string into two parts. So the string is 25 tokens, so 25 is odd. Each production for S is two non-terminals, so the entire string should be split into two parts, each of which is generated by the left or right part of the production.\n\nWait, 25 is an odd number, which is problematic because each production for S is two non-terminals, so the total would be split into two parts, each of which would be the expansion of NT..., which for a context-free grammar, might have variable lengths depending on recursion.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check the length. The string has 25 tokens, which is an odd number. But each S production splits into two parts, so S \u2192 A B, where A and B are non-terminals, each of which may expand into multiple tokens. So the total number of tokens in the string would be len(A) + len(B), which can vary.\n\nBut in this case, the string length is 25, which is odd, but len(A) and len(B) could sum to an odd number as long as at least one of them is even. For example, len(A) = 10, len(B) = 15, which sum to 25.\n\nSo moving forward, perhaps the string starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which produces a left part starting with t3 and a right part with t3.\n\nWait, let's see if the string can be split such that the first part is generated by NT68 and the second part by NT63, or vice versa.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t3, which can be generated by NT68 or NT63. Let's try assuming it's from NT68.\n\nSo the string is: t3 [rest], where rest is the remaining 24 tokens. Wait, no, because NT68 and NT63 each would generate some sequence of terminals, so if the entire string is the combination of their expansions, then the string is the result of NT68 followed by NT63, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but in the original grammar, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-471","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this task where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t3 t2 t3 t2 t3 t0 t2 t4 t3 t5 t5 t4 t1 t0 t4 t0 t5 t5 t0 t4 t2 t1 t5 t1 t0 t2`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF requires each production to either produce two terminals or two non-terminals. Every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, and S (the start symbol) can produce \u03b5. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, every production seems to be in CNF, as none of them produce more than two symbols, and both sides have two parts. So that's good.\n\nNow, the string needs to be parsed using the grammar. The string is composed of several tokens like t3, t2, etc., which I assume are the terminals. My goal is to see if applying the productions of the grammar can derive this string.\n\nSince the string is quite long, I'll need a structured approach. Let me try to analyze the grammar and look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. In CNF, the start symbol can expand into two non-terminals. From the given productions, S can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nI'll consider both options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nEach of these branches can further expand into two non-terminals, which in turn will expand until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at NT68: From the grammar, NT68 can produce t3 or perhaps other non-terminals. Wait, let me check the productions for NT68. Oh, no, in the given grammar, I don't see NT68 having any further productions. It just maps directly to t3. Similarly, NT63 is in several productions, like S \u2192 NT63 NT42, but that's for another part.\n\nWait, maybe I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this by trying to match the string against the possible derivations.\n\nThe string starts with t3, t2, t3, etc. Let's see if we can match the first few tokens.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which gives the first part as NT68 and NT63. NT68 maps to t3. So the first token is t3, which matches.\n\nNext, NT63. Looking at the productions for NT63: I see S \u2192 NT63 NT42. So NT63 (from S) must produce something. But NT63 is also a non-terminal; maybe it can expand into more symbols.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, NT63 is only found in S \u2192 NT63 NT42, which is part of the right-hand side of S. So maybe NT63 is derived from another production. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me list all NTs and their possible productions to see if I can find a way to expand to the desired string.\n\nLooking through the productions, I'll note that each NT has specific expansions. For example:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT64 \u2192 t2 (since NT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65 and NT96 \u2192 t5, NT65 \u2192 t5, so t5 t5, but wait, that's 't5 t5'. Wait, but in the grammar provided, NT96 is part of NT65's production, but I'm not sure. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. Each line is A \u2192 B C. So, for example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT96 NT65\n\nBut then NT96 and NT65 also have productions. NT96 \u2192 t5, NT65 \u2192 t5. So NT68 \u2192 t5 t5. Similarly, NT65 appears in other places, like S \u2192 NT64 NT78, and NT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65, which again gives 't5 t5'.\n\nWait, so perhaps NT68 is 't3', as given directly. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would be 't3' followed by whatever NT63 expands to.\n\nLooking at NT63's productions: I don't see NT63 in the grammar, except in S \u2192 NT63 NT42. Hmm, so maybe NT63's production is in the S's right-hand side, but in the context of S expanding. So perhaps NT63 is a non-terminal that further expands.\n\nWait, but NT63 hasn't been defined elsewhere except as part of S \u2192 NT63 NT42. Maybe it's another symbol with different productions. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems like each NT is only used in specific places. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT96 NT65\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65\n\nNT38 \u2192 various NTs.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing NT63 in the productions except in the context of S \u2192 NT63 NT42. So perhaps NT63 is a terminal, but in the grammar, none of the NTs are defined as terminals except those that have direct 't' mappings.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I can see that several NTs end up in 't' tokens. For example:\n\nNT26 \u2192 t2\n\nNT74 \u2192 t0\n\nNT33 \u2192 t3\n\nWait, let me compile a list of all NTs that directly map to terminals:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT64 \u2192 t2 (since NT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65, both mapping to t5, so t5 t5, but that gives 't5 t5')\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me check each production step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a parse tree by expanding S step by step.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string.\n\nGiven the string is 25 tokens, let's see if it can be derived by S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and then NT63 further expanding.\n\nBut from the first step, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 gives \"t3\" as the first token, which matches.\n\nThen, we have NT63 in the string. But where does NT63 appear?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT63 is only in S's RHS (S \u2192 NT63 NT42). So when S expands, one of the non-terminals is NT63, which must then be expanded into a sequence that produces the next portion of the string.\n\nLooking at the string after \"t3\", the next token is \"t2\", so after NT68's t3, the next symbol should be from NT63's expansion.\n\nBut how does NT63 expand? The grammar doesn't have a production for NT63, so perhaps that's a problem. It must have a production, but I can't find it. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar includes all possible NT productions, and perhaps NT63 is defined somewhere else. Let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT96 NT65\n- NT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65\n- NT38 \u2192 NT1 NT78\n- NT38 \u2192 NT97 NT77\nWait, no, I don't see NT63's production. So that suggests that NT63 is a non-terminal that eventually leads to terminals via some other productions.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the given grammar's NT63 is part of S's production: S \u2192 NT63 NT42. So in the start symbol, S expands to NT63 NT42, which then each expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up. Let me make sure: the grammar includes every NT with their productions. So perhaps NT63 is a non-terminal that has a production to two non-terminals, and those can expand further.\n\nWait, the problem is that in the initial list of productions, I don't see NT63 having a production. It only appears as part of S's RHS in S \u2192 NT63 NT42. So perhaps in the full grammar, each NT has all its possible productions, including terminal tokens.\n\nWait, reviewing the given grammar:\n\nThe first line is S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nThen all other lines are productions starting with NT followed by two other NTs or terminals. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT96 NT65\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65\n\nSo looking for NT63, I don't see any line starting with NT63. That's a problem. Because for a grammar in CNF, every non-terminal must have exactly two productions, each of which are non-terminals or terminals. But wait, no, in CNF, it's not that every non-terminal has exactly two productions, but rather that each production of the grammar starts with a non-terminal, and that production is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t0 t3 t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t1 t3 t2 t5 t0 t3 t0 t0 t4 t5 t2 t0 t5 t0 t0 t1 t0 t5 t4`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF for context-free grammars means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can be a terminal. Also, the start symbol can't be empty. In this grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and the productions all seem to be in CNF except perhaps for the ones that produce terminals directly, but wait, in CNF, all productions are to two non-terminals except for the start symbol which can go to a terminal. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most productions are like S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which are two non-terminals. Then there are productions like NT26 \u2192 't2' and others. Wait, but in CNF, productions can only have non-terminals on the left, and terminals only appear as leaves. So having a production like NT26 \u2192 't2' is fine because 't2' is a terminal, and it's a terminal production. \n\nWait, but S can go directly to terminals, right? So S \u2192 NT68 NT63, etc., but also, for example, NT26 \u2192 't2' is a terminal production, which would allow the grammar to generate terminal strings. So yes, that's consistent with CNF.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of terminals (t0, t1, etc.). The question is, can this string be generated by the provided grammar?\n\nI think a systematic approach is needed. The standard way to parse a string with a grammar in CNF is to use the CYK algorithm. However, applying CYK might be a bit tedious here, but I can try to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me list the string again: t0, t3, t5, t0, t0, t5, t0, t1, t3, t2, t5, t0, t3, t0, t0, t4, t5, t2, t0, t5, t0, t0, t1, t0, t5, t4.\n\nWait, the string is 27 tokens long, so we're dealing with 27 terminals. But the grammar might have some structure that could parse this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each terminal is compatible with the grammar rules. Since the grammar produces terminals, and each terminal is a single letter (like t0, t1, etc.), I can check which NT rules produce each terminal.\n\nLet me note the NT productions that produce the terminals mentioned in the string:\n\nLooking through the rules, here are the NTs and their rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT20 \u2192 't5'\n- NT62 \u2192 't3'\n- NT18 \u2192 't1'\n- NT94 \u2192 't2' (multiple rules)\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT69 \u2192 't0'\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT33 \u2192 't0'\n- NT65 \u2192 't5'\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'\n- NT19 \u2192 't3' (multiple rules)\n- NT97 \u2192 't1'\n- NT17 \u2192 't4'\n- NT58 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't1'\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2' (multiple rules)\n- NT84 \u2192 't3' (multiple rules)\n- NT85 \u2192 't2' (multiple rules)\n- NT13 \u2192 't3' (multiple rules)\n- NT96 \u2192 't5'\n- NT99 \u2192 't5'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT39 \u2192 't0'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT55 \u2192 't4'\n- NT84 \u2192 't3' (same as above)\n- NT97 \u2192 't5' (multiple rules)\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT75 \u2192 't1' or 't3' etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT12 \u2192 't5' (multiple rules)\n- NT48 \u2192 't3' (multiple rules)\n- NT45 \u2192 't5'\n- NT42 \u2192 't1'\n- NT3 \u2192 't4' (two rules: NT3 \u2192 't4' or NT3 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no, looking back, I think I might have misread. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, I think I need to list all NT productions that produce the terminals present in the string.\n\nLooking back, here are all the NTs and their rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT63 \u2192 't3'\n- NT64 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT78 \u2192 't3'\n- NT34 \u2192 't1' or 't2'? No, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I need to check all production rules correctly. Let me list each NT with its possible terminals.\n\nWait, this might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to check each production of each NT to see which terminals they produce.\n\nBut given that this process can be time-consuming, perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string using the CYK algorithm.\n\nThe CYK algorithm for parsing works by building a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j (inclusive). If after filling the table, the start symbol S is in the cell (1, n), then the string is accepted.\n\nHowever, since the string has 27 tokens, this would involve a lot of steps. Given the time constraints, perhaps I can at least outline how to approach it, but without actually building the entire table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the smallest possible substrings that can derive certain terminals and work my way up.\n\nLet me try a different approach: since the string is generated by the grammar, each terminal must be the direct production of some NT rule. So I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar, and how they might fit together.\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient, because the grammar's production rules define not just individual terminals but their combinations. So I need more than just individual matches; I need a structured way of combining them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find which NTs can derive certain substrings and see if they can form the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that the string length is 27, I can think about how it's generated through a series of productions in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note that each terminal in the string is an 't' followed by a number. Let me see which NTs produce each 'tX' in the string.\n\nLooking through the rules, let's list each terminal and which NTs produce them.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- t0: NT69, NT33, NT18, etc.\n\n- t1: NT18, NT2, NT58, NT49, etc.\n\n- t2: NT26, NT69, NT94, etc.\n\n- t3: NT62, NT78, NT38, NT97, etc.\n\n- t4: NT17, NT45, NT50, etc.\n\n- t5: NT1, NT65, NT66, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the list is too long.

The string in question is `t2 t1 t0 t3 t1 t3 t5 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t1 t0 t4 t2 t1 t5 t5 t4 t2 t4 t2 t1 t4 t0 t5`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in CNF looks like. CNF means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So all productions are two non-terminals on the right, except for the base cases which produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems to consist of several non-terminals (S, NT62, NT64, etc.) and terminals (t0, t1, etc.). The start symbol appears to be S, as it's the top-level production.\n\nMy goal is to check if the given string can be derived starting from S using the grammar's productions. Since the string consists of a series of terminals, I need to see if there's a derivation path from S to these terminals.\n\nOne approach is to parse the string according to the grammar. Since the grammar is given in CNF, each production can be seen as a binary tree structure, and the string should break down into a structure that fits these rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string components:\n\n- It starts with t2\n- Then t1\n- Followed by t0\n- Then t3, t1, t3, etc.\n\nSince the grammar is CNF, each step in the derivation reduces two non-terminals into a terminal. But the string is a linear sequence, so I need to see if it can be reduced as a sequence of such steps.\n\nI'll try to see possible splits of the string into pairs that match the right-hand sides (RHS) of the grammar rules. Each RHS in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal. However, in the CNF, each production has RHS as two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, in CNF, every production must have two non-terminals on the RHS, except for the ones that produce a single terminal. So for terminals, they must be derived directly from a rule that is A \u2192 a.\n\nI need to check if the string can be broken down into such a structure. Let me see if I can find a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string length is 27, which is odd, so it's possible that the parse tree has an odd number of leaves, which is fine.\n\nLet me try to list the string as individual tokens: t2, t1, t0, t3, t1, t3, t5, t4, t2, t3, t0, t4, t1, t0, t4, t2, t1, t5, t5, t4, t2, t4, t2, t1, t4, t0, t5.\n\nStarting from the beginning, I can see if the first two tokens form the RHS of any production. Alternatively, perhaps considering that non-terminals in the RHS can derive more tokens, I need to work recursively.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for possible pairs in the string that match the RHS of the grammar rules. For example, look for any two consecutive tokens that appear as a RHS of some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can list the non-terminals that produce terminals and note the RHS.\n\nLet me look at the rules where RHS is a terminal:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I see the following rules produce terminals:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t2\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT65 \u2192 t5\n- NT22 \u2192 t4\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT89 \u2192 t5\n- NT15 \u2192 t3\n- NT55 \u2192 t4\n- NT84 \u2192 t3\n- NT97 \u2192 t5\n- NT45 \u2192 t3\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT72 \u2192 t0\n- NT49 \u2192 t1\n- nt1 \u2192 t5 (Wait, let's be precise)\n\nActually, let me list them properly:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t2\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT65 \u2192 t5\n- NT22 \u2192 t4\n- NT23 \u2192 t2 (Wait, wait, in the grammar it's NT23 \u2192 t2?

Wait, no, let me check the provided grammar again:\n\nHere's a portion:\n\nNT23 -> NT18 NT8\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nThe user provided a long list of rules, but to parse them correctly, I need to list each production.\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\nLooking for rules where the RHS is a single terminal:\n\nI see a few:\n\n- NT69 -> t2\n- NT1 -> t3\n- NT3 -> t4\n- NT2 -> t5\n- NT65 -> t5\n- NT22 -> t4\n- NT23 -> t2\n\nWait, actually, looking again at the user's grammar, for example:\n\nNT69 -> 't2' (so this is NT69 \u2192 t2)\n\nSimilarly, NT1 \u2192 't3', so NT1 \u21d2 t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 \u2192 't4', NT2 \u2192 't5', NT65 \u2192 't5', NT22 \u2192 't4', NT23 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo, all these non-terminals produce a single terminal directly.\n\nAdditionally, some rules have multiple non-terminals on the RHS, as in:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, in the grammar, every production is either of the form A \u2192 a (where a is a single terminal) or A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals.\n\nNow, to generate the string, the only possible way is that the entire string is generated by a series of productions starting from S, breaking down each non-terminal into other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut the string in question is all terminals, so every non-terminal in the derivation must eventually produce a terminal directly or through another step.\n\nWait, actually, that's not entirely accurate. Some non-terminals can produce non-terminals on the RHS, which can then themselves produce more non-terminals or terminals. So, the string can have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but since the given string is all terminals, every non-terminal in the derivation must immediately produce a terminal without any non-terminals in between.\n\nSo, let's consider the string and try to see if it can be divided into pairs that match the RHS of the productions.\n\nThe string is: t2 t1 t0 t3 t1 t3 t5 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t1 t0 t4 t2 t1 t5 t5 t4 t2 t4 t2 t1 t4 t0 t5.\n\nWait, that's quite a long string. I need to see if I can parse it as a sequence of binary splits where each split is a production from the grammar.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, every production must consist of exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, except for the base case where it's a single terminal. So, for the grammar to generate a string of terminals, every intermediate non-terminal in the derivation must have been replaced by a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the way the string is given, it's just a sequence of terminals. So, perhaps the entire string is generated by splitting non-terminals step by step, and in the end, it all reduces to terminals.\n\nBut this feels a bit confusing. Let me try an alternative approach: since the string is a sequence of terminals, the grammar must have a derivation where each non-terminal at each step produces a terminal.\n\nSo, the string can be broken down as a result of applying productions from the grammar in reverse: starting from the string, see if it can be factored into a sequence of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the possible possible splits.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the end.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to note that in CNF, the generated strings must consist of a certain number of terminals, and the structure can be represented as parse trees. But since the string is all terminals, the number of nodes in the parse tree must be such that each non-terminal in the tree is replaced by a single terminal.\n\nHmm, another idea: since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a non-terminal that eventually derives a terminal or directly produces a terminal.\n\nLet me list all the rules that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t2\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT65 \u2192 t5\n- NT22 \u2192 t4\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-487","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or a terminal on the right. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t0 t3 t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t4 t5 t2 t2 t0 t0 t1 t3 t2 t0 t5 t1 t3 t5 t0 t4 t2 t1 t2 t5`. \n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the grammar rules and the string. The top-level symbols are S, and the start symbol is S. The string starts with `t0`, so I'll need to see if there's a production for S that leads to `t0`. \n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S -> NT68 NT63\n2. S -> NT64 NT78\n\nI need to check if either of these can produce the starting `t0`. \n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of S's productions, NT68 and NT63. For NT68, the production is either `t3` or NT66 NT81. NT66 can produce `t3`, and NT81 can produce `t3`. Wait, no, looking closer, NT68 can go to NT66 NT81, and each of those can be terminals or further non-terminals. However, the initial production starts with NT68 -> `t3` or NT66 NT81. Since the string starts with `t0`, not `t3`, perhaps I need to see if NT68 can produce `t0` through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal symbol to its possible terminal substitutions. Let me list each non-terminal and what terminals or other non-terminals they can produce, recursively.\n\nNT68: it has productions NT66 NT81. NT66 can become NT8 NT94, and NT94 can produce `t2`, etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to create a recursive approach or a parse tree.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, since the string starts with `t0`, I can check if there's any production that directly gives `t0`. Looking at the rules, many non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example, NT68 can produce `t3` or NT66 NT81. NT66 goes to NT8 NT94, which is `t8` (if any) or NT94 \u2192 `t2`, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I see NT0 -> NT48 NT47, and NT48 can produce `t3`, NT47 can produce `t3`. Wait, what about NT96? NT96 produces `t5`. I think I'm getting lost here. Maybe I can create a function or table mapping each NT symbol to the possible terminals they can generate, but manually doing that for all would take time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by chains of non-terminals leading to terminals. For example, the first `t0` must come from some NT that eventually produces `t0`. Looking for NTs that can directly produce `t0`. From the rules, I see NT69 \u2192 `t0`, NT97 \u2192 `t5`, NT26 \u2192 `t0` or others, etc. \n\nWait, looking for `t0` in the production rules. I see NT69 \u2192 `t0`, and NT20 \u2192 `t5`, but that's not helpful. NT65\u2192`t5`, NT75\u2192`t5`, etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, the first token is `t0`, so maybe it comes from NT69. Let me check the NT69 production: NT69 can be `t2` or NT38, NT26. So, NT69 \u2192 t2 | NT38 NT26. So if `t0` comes from NT69, it can either be `t2`, but in our string, it's `t0`, which is not possible directly. Alternatively, NT69 can be NT38 NT26, and then NT38 can produce `t3`, NT26 can produce `t0` via NT26 \u2192 `t0`.\n\nWait, looking at NT26: The productions for NT26 are:\n1. nt26 \u2192 nt60 nt9\n2. nt26 \u2192 nt32 nt17\n3. nt26 \u2192 t0 \n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, for NT26, the third production is `nt26 -> 't0'`? Wait, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking back:\n\nHere's the grammar, perhaps the key line is:\n\nNT26 -> NT60 NT9 | NT32 NT17 | 't0'\n\nYes, there is a rule where NT26 directly produces `t0`. So, if NT26 \u2192 `t0`, that would explain a `t0`.\n\nSo, perhaps the first `t0` is from NT26, which would have come from NT26's production. But how does that fit into the overall structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each `t0` comes from NT69 \u2192 NT38 NT26, and NT38 can produce `t3`, and NT26 can produce `t0`. But then in the string, you can have `t0` as a direct production from NT69 through NT26.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t0`, so let's see if NT26 can produce `t0` directly. Yes, according to the rules, NT26 has a production to `t0`. So that's a possible way.\n\nSo, starting with S, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but that seems more likely to produce `t3`, but perhaps not. Alternatively, if S is S \u2192 NT64 NT78, but again, NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, which can produce `t5`, and NT78 \u2192 `t3`. So that would give `t5` and `t3`, but our string starts with `t0`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first `t0` is from the other production of S, S \u2192 NT68 NT63. NT68 can go to `t3` or NT66 NT81. If it goes to `t3`, that's not `t0`, so perhaps it goes via NT66 NT81.\n\nNT66 is NT8 NT94. NT8 is NT26 NT18, which can produce `t0` (as per NT26\u2192t0) or NT18\u2192t4 via NT48 NT47, etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but the key is that the string starts with several `t0`s, so we need to see how they can be generated.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to start from the string and try to parse it using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree from the string.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt0 t3 t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t4 t5 t2 t2 t0 t0 t1 t3 t2 t0 t5 t1 t3 t5 t0 t4 t2 t1 t2 t5\n\nI'll start by seeing if the string can be generated by S, using production rules.\n\nLet's split the string into terminal tokens:\n\nt0, t3, t3, t5, t5, t5, t5, t4, t5, t2, t2, t0, t0, t1, t3, t2, t0, t5, t1, t3, t5, t0, t4, t2, t1, t2, t5\n\nHmm, maybe I can see if there's a way to group these into the productions.\n\nBut considering the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to look for sequences of terminals that appear in the grammar's expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the length of the string. The string has 27 tokens. Since each production replaces a symbol with either two symbols (non-terminals) or one terminal, the number of steps in a derivation from S to the string would result in the number of symbols being 2^n -1 for n steps, but perhaps it's more efficient.\n\nBut for a string of length 27, it's difficult to compute step by step without a proper strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the grammar's possible terminals.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals and their possible direct terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals that directly produce terminals are:\n\nNT69 \u2192 't0'\nNT26 \u2192 't0'\nNT78 \u2192 't3'\nNT81 \u2192 't3'\nNT20 \u2192 't5'\nNT7 \u2192 't4' (Wait, in the list, looking for 't4's:\n\nLooking for 't4' in the rules: NT44 can go to 't4', NT58\u2192't3', NT15\u2192't3', NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-506","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. In CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t2 t0 t2 t3 t4 t3 t2 t0 t2 t0 t2 t1 t5 t1 t0 t0 t3 t2 t0 t5 t5 t2 t1 t0 t5 t5 t1 t3`.\n\nI notice that all the symbols in the string are terminals, specifically t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5. Looking at the grammar, each terminal (like t0, t1, etc.) is produced by a specific rule. So, the idea is to see if these terminals can be created by applying the production rules correctly.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar, it might be helpful to build the derivation tree from the top (start symbol S) and see if we can reach the given string. Alternatively, maybe a bottom-up approach could be used, but since the string is quite long, that might be tedious. Alternatively, looking for patterns or possible rules that could lead to the string might help.\n\nWait, but the string consists of 27 tokens, each separated by spaces. So it's 27 terminals in sequence. Let's see how the grammar produces longer strings.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78, each of which are non-terminals. Let me look at the productions for NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking at NT68 \u2192 NT50 NT47, and NT47 has multiple options. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and so on.\n\nThis seems to get complex, but perhaps we can identify the possible paths that generate these terminals. Since all the terminals in the string are t0 through t5, and each production leads to specific t's, maybe we can see if the sequence can be built up through the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into segments that match the possible productions. For example, each time a non-terminal is expanded, the terminals that come out should match the current string.\n\nLet me think differently. Since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, each step in the derivation either splits a non-terminal into two or replaces it with a terminal. So, starting from S, each step would generate a string that's two non-terminals, which in turn can split or be replaced further.\n\nWait, the string is quite long, so maybe it's better to check each terminal in order and see if the grammar can produce that sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be matched by the start symbol. Let's see.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce two main branches: NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's pick one and see.\n\nTake S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow NT68 \u2192 NT50 NT47.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT18 NT47.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38.\n\nWait, this seems like it could get stuck in a loop unless some terminal is reached.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal corresponds to a specific output of terminals. For example, NT68 might produce t2, NT63 might produce t0, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal eventually produces a terminal when expanded all the way. For instance, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, and NT48 \u2192 t3, NT0 \u2192 t47, but wait, looking again: NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47, and then NT48 \u2192 t3 and NT47 has various paths. Hmm, maybe it's easier to see that each non-terminal can eventually produce a specific terminal.\n\nWait, that might not be the case because sometimes non-terminals can split into other non-terminals. But in some cases, they produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT38 \u2192 t3\n\nNT81 \u2192 t3\n\nNT26 \u2192 t2\n\nNT74 \u2192 t3\n\nNT94 \u2192 t2\n\nNT18 \u2192 t1\n\nNT45 \u2192 t5\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3\n\nNT27 \u2192 t5\n\nNT99 \u2192 t5\n\nNT44 \u2192 t5\n\nNT39 \u2192 t0\n\nNT34 \u2192 t1\n\nNT42 \u2192 t1\n\nNT60 \u2192 t5\n\nNT9 \u2192 t5\n\nNT8 \u2192 t5\n\nNT2 \u2192 t3\n\nNT84 \u2192 t4\n\nNT44 \u2192 t5\n\nNT58 \u2192 t3\n\nNT62 \u2192 t2\n\nWait, in some cases, non-terminals like NT68 produce NT50 NT47. If we can get from NT50 and NT47 to terminals, perhaps we can find what t2 t0 t2... means.\n\nWait, but maybe the string is generated by expanding S in a certain way, and each step adds the correct terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse-engineer the string by grouping the tokens into chunks that correspond to the possible expansions of non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\nt2 t0 t2 t3 t4 t3 t2 t0 t2 t0 t2 t1 t5 t1 t0 t0 t3 t2 t0 t5 t5 t2 t1 t0 t5 t5 t1 t3.\n\nThat's 27 tokens. Let me count the letters: t2, t0, t2, t3, t4, t3, t2, t0, t2, t0, t2, t1, t5, t1, t0, t0, t3, t2, t0, t5, t5, t2, t1, t0, t5, t5, t1, t3.\n\nWait, maybe each non-terminal produces two terminals, so the entire string must have a number of terminals that can be split into pairs in a certain way based on the grammar's productions. Since 27 is an odd number, that complicates things because each production would typically add two tokens at a time. Hmm, but the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, so the first step would add two, making the string have two tokens? Wait, no, the start symbol produces two non-terminals, which themselves can produce terminals or more non-terminals. So in the end, the derivation sequence needs to result in exactly 27 terminals.\n\nWait, this approach might not be the easiest. Maybe I should think about which parts of the string correspond to the possible production rules.\n\nLet's consider that the grammar may have certain symbols that can produce sequences. For example, looking at NT68 \u2192 NT50 NT47, and then NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT47. So if we follow that path, NT18 can produce t1, t38 (but NT18 itself is NT50 NT47, or does NT18 lead to t1? Wait, from the rules, NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38, which then produces NT50 \u2192 t18 and NT38 \u2192 t3. So maybe that would produce t1 from NT18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Each non-terminal can be expanded until it becomes a terminal. So, perhaps I can write down the expansion pathways for certain non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT50 NT47\n  - NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT47\n    - NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\n      - NT50 \u2192 NT18 NT47\n        - NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\n          - This seems to loop, but perhaps eventually it can reach a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to assign each non-terminal to a string of terminals. For instance, if a non-terminal expands to certain terminals when fully reduced.\n\nWait, but this might take a long time. Alternatively, maybe the grammar is designed such that each non-terminal can produce a unique terminal string of a specific length or a certain combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that each non-terminal can be associated with a specific terminal string when fully expanded. So for example, if we can map each non-terminal to its terminal string, then checking if the overall string is built correctly.\n\nLet me see if that's feasible.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n\nNT48 \u2192 t3, NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47.\n\nSo NT0 is NT48 (t3) followed by NT47.\n\nWait, this could get complicated. Maybe the string is generated by S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and then each of those non-terminals expand into sequences that produce the required terminals.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's start with the given string and see if it can be broken down into production rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce NT68 NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-504","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string correctly.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that most produce two non-terminals except some, which produce terminals like 't0', 't1', up to 't9'. So, the terminals are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5' and some numbers. But wait, in the grammar, numbers like NT68, NT47, etc., are on the left side, but on the right side, they produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So, NT68 is a non-terminal, and when it appears on the right, like in S \u2192 NT68 NT63, it's part of a production to another non-terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t4, t3, t1, t0, t4, t0, t2, t4, t2, t1, t1, t0, t2, t2, t5, t0, t0, t5, t3, t0, t5, t3, t3, t2, t3, t2, t4, t4. That's 28 symbols. The grammar's starting symbol is S, which produces NT68 and NT63. So, I need to see if this string can be generated starting from S.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the parse tree will have a binary structure. Each production has at most two symbols on the right, except for the terminals which are single symbols. So, each step of the parse can split into two subtrees.\n\nBut since the string is long, manually following every possible parse tree isn't feasible. Maybe I can find a pattern or use some properties of the grammar. Alternatively, I can try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nLooking at the first symbol of the string, which is t4. I need to find a production that directly produces t4. Wait, checking the grammar, are there any productions that produce t4?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT1 \u2192 t3, NT2 \u2192 t5, NT48 \u2192 t3, NT12 \u2192 t5, NT19 \u2192 t4 (from NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66), but NT166? Wait, no, looking at the productions, I see NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, and NT66 \u2192 NT33 NT66. Wait, but I'm looking for t4. Let's see:\n\nLooking back at each production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. From the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3\nNT2 \u2192 t5\nNT3 \u2192 t4 (since I don't see NT3, but looking, it's not present. Wait, checking the grammar, I see:\nNT3 \u2192 where? Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT3 \u2192 t4. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 Not present, but wait, maybe NT38 \u2192 t3 or something? Wait no, NT38 \u2192 NT1 NT78.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3\nNT2 \u2192 t5\nNT3? Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see NT3 \u2192 anything. That's confusing. Let me ensure I'm not missing any.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNT3 is not present in any production except the ones listed. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT38 \u2192 t3, NT47\u2192t2, NT94\u2192t2, etc. But no NT3 production. So, where does t4 come from?\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t4. So, I need a production that produces t4 directly. Looking through all productions, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t3\nLooking for t4: Do any NT65 \u2192 t5. Wait, NT65 \u2192 't5'. So, maybe t4 isn't directly produced by a single non-terminal. Then, perhaps t4 is a result of a longer chain.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the productions to see if any non-terminal directly produces t4.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't5' (line: NT65 -> NT97 NT65, and the lower lines have NT65 -> 't5')\nWait, in the last section, I see:\n\nNT97 \u2192 't5' (NT97 is not in any other productions), but NT65 is in a production that ends with 't5'.\n\nWait, no, I see: Under NT65, the production is \"NT65 -> 't5'\". So, NT65 directly produces t5. But no production for t4 except for some non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through all terminals:\n\n- t0 is produced by NT0, NT33, NT36 (which isn't in the list), etc. Wait, I see NT99 \u2192 't5', NT62 \u2192 't3', NT66 \u2192 't3', NT96 \u2192 't5', NT33 \u2192 't0', and others.\n\nWait, but where is t4 produced? Looking back, perhaps t4 comes from a non-terminal that's a result of a production.\n\nLooking at the parse tree: The initial symbol is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Let's see where these go.\n\nNT68 is produced by NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18, but that seems recursive. Wait, checking:\n\nIn the grammar, looking for NT68, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18 (line: NT68 -> NT68 NT18)\nNT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\nBut also, NT68 is on both sides. This looks like a recursion that might not terminate. Wait, but the initial step is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So, if NT68 and NT63 are part of the parse tree, but if their productions lead to another NT68, it might cause infinite recursion or could end in a different path.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to see if the string can be produced, starting from NT68 and NT63.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the root.\n\nSo, the string is t4 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t2 t4 t2 t1 t1 t0 t2 t2 t5 t0 t0 t5 t3 t0 t5 t3 t3 t2 t3 t2 t4 t4.\n\nBut this is a long string. Let's think about the start of the string: t4, t3, t1, t0, t4...\n\nHmm, the first symbol is t4. Since no single non-terminal directly produces t4, maybe t4 comes from a deeper part of the grammar.\n\nWait a minute, looking through the productions, I realize I might have missed some direct terminal productions. Let me list all non-terminals and see which ones directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking back through each production:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT3 \u2192 Not directly, but in lines, I don't see it. So, perhaps NT3 leads to something else, but I'm not sure.\n- NT4 \u2192 Let's check... Looking through the productions, I don't see NT4 appearing on the left side, except in S.\n- NT6 can be found? Hmm, production NT65 \u2192 t5. Wait, I think I might have missed some in the initial pass. Let me check the entire list again, maybe I missed t4.\n\nWait, in the last part of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT69 \u2192 t0\nNT26 \u2192 t1\nNT26 \u2192 t4\nWait, looking again, in the production for NT26:\n\nLooking through the grammar, line 56 is:\n\nNT26 -> NT60 NT9\n\nLine 91: NT26 -> NT32 NT17\n\nLine 163: NT26 -> NT60 NT9\n\nLine 180: NT26 -> NT39 NT77\n\nLine 227: NT26 is mentioned but not directly producing a terminal except in the lower part where NT26 \u2192 t4?\n\nWait, checking the lower part:\n\nLooking through all lines again for productions of non-terminals to terminals:\n\n- Check each line until I find any terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT12 \u2192 t5\nNT19 \u2192 t4 (Because in line: NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, but also NT19 may have other productions.

So each tX is a terminal symbol.\n\nActually, wait, in the grammar, the non-terminals (NT) can derive into either other NTs or terminal symbols. So for example, NT68 could be expanding into a terminal or another NT. Let me check the rules for NT68. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT68 is not directly present as a right-hand side. Wait, perhaps in the rules, NT68 is derived from other symbols. Oh, wait, let me see the end of the grammar: NT68 -> 't3'. Because I see the line 'NT68 -> 't3''. So, NT68 produces the terminal t3. Similarly, NT63 is somewhere else. Looking at the grammar, 'NT63 -> NT84 NT62'. Wait, no, maybe I'm misreading it. Let me check again: line says NT99 -> NT72 NT55, etc. Hmm, actually, looking back, the grammar has several NTs that produce terminals. For example, NT62 -> 't2', NT65 -> 't5', NT69 -> 't0', etc.\n\nWait, I should make a better approach. Let me try to list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nStarting from the grammar, each line is a production rule. Let's go through each line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2.

Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side for A \u2192 BC, unless it's a terminal. So, in this grammar, the terminals are all the strings with 't' followed by numbers, like t0, t1, etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, the first step is to see if the string can be derived from either S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the initial symbols are t4, t1, t3, etc. So, perhaps we need to backtrack through the productions to see if they match.\n\nFor S \u2192 NT68 NT63: NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals. I'll need to see what those produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT68 \u2192 t3. Wait, no, looking back: NT68 seems to have several productions. Checking the grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and NT68 has productions like NT8 -> t3, but for NT68, do I have any terminal productions? Looking through the rules, NT68 only has one production? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n\nAh, so NT68 directly produces t3. Then, NT63? Let me check the grammar for NT63.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which are both non-terminals. So, to get a t at the beginning, let's see:\n\nIf S uses the production S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then NT68 becomes t3. Now, the next symbol in the string is t1, so perhaps the second symbol t1 must come from NT63 somehow, but NT63 is NT48 NT0, which are non-terminals.\n\nSo, NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT0. Then, NT48 \u2192 t3, and NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. Wait, but NT0 is a non-terminal, and according to the rules, NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. So, that's still a non-terminal.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, let's consider the other production of S: S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo, NT64 \u2192 t3 (from the grammar). And NT78 has several productions: NT78 \u2192 t3, but wait, actually looking at the grammar, NT78 can produce t3, but let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT74 \u2192 t3? Or others. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Earley's algorithm would be more effective, but since I'm just thinking, maybe I can attempt a top-down approach.\n\nLet me outline the string: \"t4 t1 t3 t4 t4 t3 t4 t5 t4 t2 t5 t3 t4 t1 t0 t0 t5 t5 t0 t0 t2 t0 t1 t3 t1 t3 t5 t0 t3\". That's a long string, 30 symbols.\n\nI think it's better to break it down into segments that match the possible productions.\n\nAnother approach is to try to find a leftmost derivation. Starting from S, which becomes NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, consider S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then, NT68 \u2192 t3, and NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT0. The first symbol is t4, but according to this path, NT68 produces t3, which doesn't match t4. So that path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, check if NT64 or NT78 can produce t4. Wait, NT64 \u2192 t3 from the grammar. So NT64 produces t3, not t4. So if S \u2192 NT64 NT78, then the first two symbols must be t3 and something, but the string starts with t4. So that can't be it either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 \u2192 t3. So NT68 produces t3. For NT64, from the grammar: NT64 \u2192 t3. So both NT68 and NT64 produce t3. So the initial S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78 would both start with t3, but the string starts with t4. So that would mean the string can't be generated by either of these productions, meaning the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, did I misread the grammar? Let me look again. Oh, the grammar is in CNF, so all productions are N \u2192 NT..., except the terminals. Maybe I missed some terminals.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, for example, NT38 \u2192 t3, NT81 \u2192 t3, etc. So perhaps the initial S doesn't directly produce t4. Maybe the string starts with t4 through a different path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start at the beginning of the string: t4 is the first symbol. So looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t4. Looking through the rules, I see some NTs produce t4.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t4 (Looking at the rules, I see \"NT18 \u2192 t5\" and \"NT18 \u2192 NT67 NT94\", but no t4. Wait, let me check the rules.)\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t4.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t5\n- NT24 \u2192 t0\n- NT55 \u2192 t4\n- NT75 \u2192 t3\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT71? Not in the given rules. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar rules for any NT that directly produce 't4'. Scanning through, I find:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 t4\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n\nAlso, NT58 \u2192 t3, etc.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t4, then the first non-terminal must produce t4. So which NTs produce t4? NT26, NT44, and NT55.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with t4 via one of these NTs.\n\nSo, let's suppose that the first step is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78, but maybe the initial NT is not S. Wait, no, S is the start symbol. So the first two symbols must come directly from S's productions. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the symbols directly from the terminals, without any intermediate non-terminals. That would be if all the symbols in the string are directly produced by S, but that's not possible because S can only directly produce two non-terminals. So perhaps the string is built through a series of left or right derivations.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to model the possible sequences of t's that could be formed by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But since I'm doing it manually, let's try.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Since the string starts with t4, let's see which NT can produce it. As mentioned, NT26, NT44, and NT55.\n\nLet me choose one, say NT26. Now, NT26 has productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9\n- NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17\n- NT18 \u2192 t5 (Wait, no, checking the grammar, NT18 \u2192 t5 is incorrect. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT94 NT65\n- NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT65\n- NT18 \u2192 NT57\u2192 no, actually looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at the grammar provided again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are some rules that might be relevant:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9\n- NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17\n- NT18 \u2192 NT67 NT94\n- NT18 (not NT19, as in NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66)\n- Another rule: NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49\n- NT49 \u2192 NT1 NT79?"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's and numbers, which are terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it has various non-terminals (like S, NT62, NT81, etc.) and terminals. The terminals include 't0', 't1', up to 't9', and several numbers like 62, 63, etc. The string to check is `t0 t1 t0 t4 t4 t3 t2 t4 t2 t4 t3 t2 t3 t3 t4 t3 t2 t4 t3 t0 t0 t1 t2 t2 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4 t0`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived starting from S using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation uses productions that replace a single non-terminal with two others, except for the terminal productions, which produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, to analyze this, I can reverse the process: instead of starting from S and deriving the string, I can check if the string can be reduced to S using the inverse of the productions.\n\nEach terminal symbol in the string is a terminal in the grammar. Let's list them: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5. These correspond to certain non-terminals. For example, from the grammar, t0 is produced by NT62, NT97, etc. Similarly, t1 is produced by NT25 (though I need to check the grammar).\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, let's note where the terminals appear:\n\n- 't0' is produced by NT62, NT97, NT60, etc.? Let me check.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81\n- NT81 \u2192 NT78 NT97\n- NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66\n- NT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94\nWait, this seems getting too nested. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate the given string. Since the string is quite long, maybe 35 tokens, which suggests a fairly deep parse tree. But doing that manually would take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each production in CNF either leads to terminals or splits into two non-terminals. So, in the reverse approach, each step would collapse two symbols into a non-terminal that produces them.\n\nLet me try building this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t0, t1, t0, t4, t4, t3, t2, t4, t2, t4, t3, t2, t3, t3, t4, t3, t2, t4, t3, t0, t0, t1, t2, t2, t5, t3, t4, t4, t4, t0.\n\nThat's 35 symbols, meaning in the parse tree, we'll have 34 splits, perhaps. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to match the start symbol S, which in the grammar is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the first two symbols of the string should derive from NT68 and NT63. Let's check if t0 t1 t0... matches this.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S is a non-terminal that branches into NT68 and NT63. So, in the string, the first two symbols should be the results of NT68 and NT63. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT68's productions, from the grammar:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT62 NT69\n- Also, NT68 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- And NT68 \u2192 NT64 NT14\nWait, looking back, the grammar list:\n\nLooking up NT68:\n\nIn the given grammar, NT68 appears in the productions:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nNT68's productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT62 NT69\nNT68 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT68 \u2192 NT64 NT14\n\nWait, perhaps I missed NT68's own productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT68, perhaps in the list. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT62 -> NT48 NT0, etc. Let me go through the list to find all NT68 productions.\n\nLooking through the list, the productions starting with NT68 are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- NT3 \u2192 NT27 NT97\n- NT74 \u2192 NT9 NT85\n- NT97 \u2192 ...\nWait, perhaps I missed NT68.

{"custom_id":"request-546","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t2 t3 t2 t1 t2 t5 t3 t3 t4 t3 t5 t5 t3 t5 t5 t0 t5 t3 t0 t5 t1 t1 t5 t0 t0 t2 t4 t4 t4 t3`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific characteristics: every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems all the productions are in this form, either transforming a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a good candidate for a CYK parser, but I might try to approach it step by step.\n\nThe string has 31 tokens, each separated by spaces. I notice that the string starts with t2 and ends with t3. I also see various t's which correspond to terminal symbols in the grammar. My first thought is to check if the entire string can be generated by the grammar, but given the size, it might be complex.\n\nI recall that in CNF, the derivation can be thought of as a tree where each node is a non-terminal and each child is a terminal or a non-terminal resulting from applying a rule. Since it's CNF, all non-terminals must be expanded by two steps until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. The first token is t2. Looking through the grammar, I see rules that produce t2. For example, NT18 \u2192 t2, and others like NT26 \u2192 t2, NT2 \u2192 t3, but wait, NT2 doesn't produce t2. So, I should look for non-terminals that produce t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I spot a few places where t's are defined:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t2\n- NT72 \u2192 t0\n- NT34 \u2192 t1\n- NT45 \u2192 t3\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT77 \u2192 t3\n- And so on.\n\nSo, the first token t2 could come from several non-terminals. Let me note these possibilities: NT69, NT26, NT94, NT52, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the next token after t2 is t3. So, after t2, the second character must be t3. I need to see if t3 can be derived from the right-hand side of a production.\n\nGiven the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 t4, but not t3. Wait, looking through the grammar more carefully, I notice:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n- Etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t2 is t3. So, the first two tokens are t2 t3.\n\nLooking at NT68, what does it produce? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT68 is part of the production S \u2192 NT68 NT63. But I don't see NT68 being defined as a non-terminal that produces t2 or t3. However, NT68 could be part of a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first part of the string is generated by S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, meaning the first step is to derive NT68 and NT63. Let's focus on NT68 first.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT62 NT94 (since I remember from initial look at the rules that NT68 has a production NT68 \u2192 NT62 NT94). So, NT68 \u2192 NT62 NT94. \n\nNext, NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT93. Then, NT34 could produce t1, and NT93 is defined as producing t0. So, NT62 \u2192 t1 t0.\n\nWait, no, let me get the exact rules. Looking back, NT68's production is NT68 \u2192 NT62 NT94. And NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT93, as per the rules.\n\nThen, NT34 \u2192 t1, as I saw earlier.\n\nNow, for NT94, I see NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49, and from there, NT75 \u2192 t3, and NT49 \u2192 t1.\n\nSo, putting it together: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 NT62 NT94 NT63. But wait, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is two non-terminals. But each of these can be further expanded into a string of terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the tree differently. Let's see: each non-terminal in the string must be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should pick a segment of the string and see if it can be generated. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in CNF, the string must have a certain structure based on split into parts. For example, the length of the string in terms of the number of symbols.\n\nIn CNF, all productions are A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So, the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nTherefore, the parse trees should be such that the number of leaves is equal to the length of the string.\n\nWait, the given string has 31 tokens, which are all either t followed by a number (probably a terminal symbol), so the length is 31.\n\nIn CNF, a string of length n must require (n-1) steps, because each step in the derivation for terminals can only reduce the number of non-terminals by one (since each production increases the count from 1 non-terminal to 2, which then get processed). But I'm not entirely confident about that.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation must have a parse tree with a certain structure. Each non-terminal can produce two symbols each time, leading to a binary tree with leaves corresponding to the terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the number of non-terminals in the derivation would be such that the total number of symbols (terminals plus non-terminals at each step) would eventually reduce to terminals. For a string of length m, the number of non-terminals at the root would be 2^(k), where k is the depth. Hmm, perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the string must be equal to the number of leaves in the derivation tree. Since all productions are A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, each non-terminal corresponds to a node in the tree whose children are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that in CNF, for a string of terminals to be generated, the number of non-terminals in each production along the way must fit the structure.\n\nBut given the length is 31, let's check if that makes sense. CNF grammars have the property that the number of symbols in the sentential form (including both terminals and non-terminals) is non-decreasing as you go deeper into the derivation. I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for possible leftmost derivations. Let's try to map a small part of the string and see.\n\nLooking at the string: t2 t3 t2 t1 t2 t5 t3 t3 t4 t3 t5 t5 t3 t5 t5 t0 t5 t3 t0 t5 t1 t1 t5 t0 t0 t2 t4 t4 t4 t3.\n\nFirst two symbols: t2 and t3.\n\nI need to see if in the grammar, t2 can be derived from a non-terminal, which in turn can be followed by t3. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built from the top-down approach.\n\nSince the grammar's S starts with NT68 and NT63, let's look at NT68 and NT63.\n\nFrom earlier, I saw that NT68 can be split into NT62 and NT94.\n\nSo, S\u2192NT68 NT63 \u2192 (NT62 NT94) NT63.\n\nNow, NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT93, as per the rules.\n\nSo, now we have (NT34 NT93 NT94) NT63.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nNT34 can be NT1 (since NT34 \u2192 t1) or other possibilities. Wait, looking at the rules, NT1 is 't5', not 't1'.\n\nWait, I need to check the rules for NT34.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78, right? Because looking at the production for NT34: yes, NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78.\n\nSo, NT34 can be split into NT1 and NT78.\n\nNT1 is a non-terminal, and in the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t5 t2 t2 t1 t1 t3 t5 t3 t1 t3 t5 t2 t4 t3 t4 t5 t1 t3 t1 t4 t4 t2 t2 t4 t3 t0.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. The start symbol is 'S'.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems all the rules are in CNF. For example, S -> NT68 NT63, which is S (non-terminal) on the left, and on the right, it has two non-terminals, NT68 and NT63. Similarly, other productions either have non-terminals or sometimes a mix with terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. I notice that some of these sequences like t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 correspond to the terminals, such as NT69\u2192't2', NT75\u2192't1', etc. So each 't' followed by a digit is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nI'll approach this by parsing the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step is a non-terminal generating two symbols. The string has 35 tokens, which suggests that the number of steps in the derivation would be the number of leaves minus one divided by two.\n\nWait, another approach: the length of the string is 35. Each production in CNF increases the number of symbols by 1 (since each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols). Starting from S, which is one symbol, to get to 35 symbols, we have (35 - 1) = 34 steps. Each step doubles the count. Wait, no, in CNF, each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Since our string contains terminal symbols, I'll have to track each terminal as a production that can't be further split.\n\nSo, perhaps using a top-down approach, I'll try to find if each terminal can be matched by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string as symbols to derive: S => NT68 NT63.\n\nI need to see if the left part matches NT68 and the right part matches NT63.\n\nBut to break it down, let's see: the first symbol is t3. I need to find where t3 appears in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I find:\n\n- S -> NT68 NT63\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT69 -> 't2'\n- NT22 -> NT62 NT74\nLooking at the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 't3' (since it's in the end, NT68 -> 't3'). Wait no, looking through all the rules, I see a line: NT68 -> 't3' is not present. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the provided list, for example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, the string starts with t3, which perhaps is from a non-terminal NT68. Let's see if NT68 has a production that can derive to t3. Looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT68 in the list. Scanning through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 isn't explicitly listed, unless I missed it. Wait, I think the user provided a list of rules between S and NT22, etc. Maybe I misread.\n\nLet me re-examine the grammar provided. For instance, looking for any NT68 rule. Oh, I think it's mentioned here:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT26 -> NT60 NT9\nNT99 -> NT72 NT55\nNT87 isn't there. Wait, looking more carefully, in the initial grammar:\n\nStarting from S, S->NT68 NT63. So NT68 must have a production rule that includes a terminal. Looking through the provided rules, I don't see NT68 listed. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the initial user provided a grammar in a long list. I should look for NT68, NT63, etc. Looking through the list:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n- NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65 (wait, that can't be right, perhaps a typo, but for now, proceed)\n- NT68 \u2192 ...? I don't see NT68 in the given rules except for the start. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the rules are misaligned.

{"custom_id":"request-570","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. That means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps because it simplifies parsing; we can use methods like CYK or recursive descent to parse the strings, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to see if I can parse the string myself.\n\nThe given string is `t4 t3 t5 t3 t5 t3 t0 t2 t0 t5 t0 t2 t2 t3 t0 t5 t5 t2 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t1 t3 t2 t2 t1 t3 t3 t1`. I notice that the first symbol is t4, t3, etc. From the grammar, I know that t4 symbols come from NT3 -> t4. Wait, no, looking closer, I see things like NT3 is a production to t4. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce t1, t2, t3, etc. For example, NT32 \u2192 t4, NT34 \u2192 t1, NT45 \u2192 t5, etc. But in the string, I see t4, t3, t5, etc. So I need to see how these t-symbols are generated.\n\nLet me list out where each t comes from:\n\n- t1: From NT23 \u2192 t2, NT12 \u2192 t2, NT45 \u2192 t5, NT55 \u2192 t4, NT75 \u2192 t1, NT19 \u2192 t5, NT24 \u2192 t0, NT15 \u2192 t3, NT1 \u2192 t5, NT93 \u2192 t5, etc. Wait, perhaps I should cross-reference each t with their production rules.\n\nWait, the initial production rules are for S and various NTs. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\n- NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98, but NT19 is a non-terminal that produces 't2' (from NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, and NT66 is t3, no, wait, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nFor example, NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77; NT15 is a non-terminal that may produce t2, but I'm getting confused. Instead, perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step, starting with the string and trying to apply the grammar.\n\nLet me note that the string is 33 symbols long. The grammar's top-level productions start with S, which produces either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t4, t3, t5, t3, t5, t3, t0, t2, t0, t5, t0, t2, etc. \n\nThe first thing is that S's productions start with NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. Let's see if the string starts with any of those.\n\nLet\u2019s check the possible first symbols of NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT38 NT81\n- NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nSo, the first part of S's production is either starting with NT68 (produce t3) or NT64 (t4) or NT78 (t5). Let's check the first symbol of the string: it's t4. Therefore, the possible S production to use is S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo the first part NT64 \u2192 t4 (because NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, and looking further, I think NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98; NT1 \u2192 't5'; but wait, maybe I should look back.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT64 is a non-terminal that can produce NT60 NT14. Now, the first symbol of the string is t4, which could be from NT64 \u2192 something that starts with t4. Let me check NT64's productions.\n\nLooking at NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. What do NT60 and NT14 produce?\n\nNT60 is another non-terminal: its productions are NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18, NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78, etc. But I'm getting stuck; maybe another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should start breaking down the string into parts. The string is t4, t3, t5, t3, t5, t3, t0, t2, t0, t5, t0, t2, t2, t3, t0, t5, t5, t2, t3, t5, t3, t3, t3, t1, t3, t2, t2, t1, t3, t3, t1.\n\nLet me try to see the structure by matching the start symbol S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the string starts with NT64, which produces t4 something, then NT78.\n\nWait, S is S \u2192 NT64 NT78. NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. So NT64 starts with NT60, which as a non-terminal may produce a t or another NT.\n\nBut perhaps the top-down approach is better, but since this is getting too complicated, maybe I should look for patterns or the count of t-symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by S, but I need to check each step.\n\nWait, another approach: count the number of non-terminals and terminals as the string starts and see if they balance.\n\nWait, no, that's for leftmost derivations. Perhaps I can use the fact that each production of S requires exactly two non-terminals, so each step adds two symbols. The string has 33 symbols, which is odd, but S always produces two symbols. Wait, 33 is odd, but each step in the grammar starts with two symbols. So the initial S is S \u2192 NT... NT..., each step replaces a non-terminal with other symbols, but the total length increases by the number of symbols in the right-hand side minus the symbols being replaced.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the best approach. Instead, perhaps I should look for the structure of the string. For example, the first t4 could come from NT64, but let's check:\n\nWait, NT64's production is NT60 NT14. If NT60 produces something that starts with t3 (maybe NT38), and NT14 produces 't3' as well, then NT64 could produce t4... Hmm, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for each t and see how they're produced.\n\nLooking at t2: from NT62 \u2192 t2, and other rules. T3 comes from NT81 \u2192 t3, etc.\n\nWait, another approach: recursively parse the string.\n\nAt any point, we can have two possibilities when expanding a non-terminal, like in S's case. So we start with the entire string, and for each non-terminal, we try to split it into two parts that match the productions of that non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is to see that S can start with t4 (from NT64 \u2192 t4), but wait no\u2014looking at NT64's production: NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. So the first part might not be t4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, so the first two symbols would have to be part of NT60's and NT14's production. Let's check NT60 and NT14:\n\nNT60 can produce various things like NT68 NT18, and NT34 \u2192 t3, etc. So the first t4 in the string might not come directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol is t4 from NT68. NT68 \u2192 NT38 NT81.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT38 \u2192 t3, t5, etc. Wait, in the given productions, some NT38 rules produce t3 or t5: for example, NT38 \u2192 't3' and more.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nFor NT38:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 NT81 NT97 (t3?)\n- Wait, no, NT81 \u2192 t3, but the specific t3 in the string could come from NT38 \u2192 t3...\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck trying to match every single step.

That's quite a long string, so it's going to be a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies the analysis because it restricts the form of the productions, making them either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78.

So the first step is to see if the entire string is generated by S's productions.\n\nLet me list the first few steps.\n\nThe string starts with 't2'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't2'. Looking at the provided rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' (no)\n- NT23 \u2192 't2' (Yes)\n- NT62 \u2192 't2' (Yes)\n- NT72 \u2192 't0' (No)\n- NT52 \u2192 't2' (Yes)\n- NT94 \u2192 't1' or 't2' (Wait, there are two rules. Earlier it was NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT62, and then later a separate rule NT94 \u2192 't2'. So probably NT94 can be 't2' directly.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT94 \u2192 NT75 NT62 (which would produce a longer string), but then also NT94 \u2192 't2' which is a terminal. So each non-terminal can have multiple productions, some terminal and some non-terminal.\n\nSo, for NT94, it can produce 't2' directly, or it can produce NT75 NT62. But in our case, the string starts with 't2', so NT94 must have been directly replaced here.\n\nSo, the first part of the string: 't2' could be from NT94 \u2192 't2'. So the non-terminal NT94 would expand to 't2', and then we proceed to the next part.\n\nAfter 't2', the next symbol is 't1'. Now, the remaining string after 't2 t1' is 't5 t0 t5 t5 t2 t1 t0 t3 ...'.\n\nWe need to see how NT94 could lead to 't1' next. Wait, but if NT94 is 't2', it directly produces 't2', so the next symbol after 't2' would have to be the next symbol in the string, which is 't1'.\n\nBut wait, after the first 't2', the next symbol is 't1', so what non-terminal produces 't1'?\n\nLooking through the terminal rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't2' (No) Wait, no 't1' directly.\n\nWait, looking again: NT27 \u2192 't5' (No); NT50 \u2192 't4' (No); NT1 \u2192 't5'; NT24 \u2192 't1' (Yes); NT15 \u2192 't3'; NT68 \u2192 't3'; NT66 \u2192 't3'; NT49 \u2192 't1' (Yes).\n\nSo, NT24 and NT49 produce 't1'. So after 't2', we have 't1', which could be from NT24 or NT49.\n\nBut wait, if the string starts with 't2 t1', that would require that NT94 is followed by another non-terminal that produces 't1'. But no, because if NT94 is 't2', it directly produces 't2' and then the next symbol must come from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S was expanded to another NT.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me backtrack.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can expand to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Each of these is a pair of non-terminals. So the string must start with the first non-terminal of S, which is either NT68 or NT64.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is 't2'. So let's see if NT68 or NT64 can produce 't2'.\n\nLooking at NT68's productions: according to the list, NT68 \u2192 't3' and 't5' (Wait, no, NT68 is one of the NTs with productions, but in the provided list, looking for NT68:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT63. So that's a non-terminal production, not a terminal. The terminal 't's come from other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The start is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the first symbol in the string is 't2', which must come from the first non-terminal of the expansion of S.\n\nBut looking at NT68's productions, none directly produce 't2'.

Wait, NT18 is 't5' elsewhere. Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some are repeated for clarity. For example, NT69 \u2192 t0 appears multiple times, but that's fine.\n\nNow, the string begins with 't2'. Looking at the productions, which non-terminals generate 't2'? From the list:\n- NT78 \u2192 t2\n- NT26 \u2192 t4? Wait, no. Let's check again.\n\nLooking through each production, the terminals are:\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 t5\n- NT64 \u2192 t1\n- NT78 \u2192 t2\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT67 \u2192 t2\n- NT20 \u2192 t5\n- NT74 \u2192 t1\n- NT97 \u2192 t3\n- NT38 \u2192 t5\n- NT81 \u2192 t4\n- NT94 \u2192 t2 (wait, no: NT94 \u2192 t1)\nWait, no: Let's check NT94. Looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. NT94 \u2192 t2 is not correct. Checking the production list:\n\nLooking for NT68: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. NT68 \u2192 t3. NT63 \u2192 t5, so S \u2192 t3 t5. But the string starts with t2, so this can't be the starting path immediately. So perhaps S uses the other production, S \u2192 NT64 NT78. NT64 \u2192 t1, and NT78 \u2192 t2, so S \u2192 t1 t2. Wait, but the string starts with t2, so maybe that's possible.\n\nWait, no. S's first option is NT68 (t3) and NT63 (t5), so that would produce t3 t5. The string starts with t2, which isn't produced by the first S option. So the second S production is NT64 (t1) and NT78 (t2), so that would produce t1 t2. But the string starts with t2, which doesn't match t1. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if the entire string can be derived through some expansion. Alternatively, maybe the initial expansion is more complex. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows production rules that introduce more non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but NT68 might expand into more NTs, which in turn expand into terminals and so on.\n\nLet me try to find a way to get 't2' as the first symbol. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't2':\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 t2\n- NT26 \u2192 t4 (I thought earlier, but let me check: NT26 \u2192 t4? Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT26 \u2192 t4 in some cases. For example, line 26 says NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9, but another line says NT26 \u2192 t4. So NT26 can produce either NT60 NT9 or t4. So NT26 can produce 't4' or further non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 \u2192 t5, but that's another pathway.\n\nWait, but for the string to start with 't2', the starting symbol must expand into a non-terminal that can produce 't2'. The only NTs that produce 't2' are NT78 and NT62.\n\nLooking at NT62: according to the productions, NT62 can expand into NT34 NT99 or other non-terminals. But one option for NT62 is to produce 't3' because looking through the list, NT62 \u2192 t3 is in line 25: NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT99, which then produces t4 and t5. Wait, no, line 25 shows NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT99, but looking for terminal expansions:\n\nWait, let's list each NT and their possible terminals and other expansions.\n\nLet me try to create a list for each NT and their possible outputs:\n\nNT68: t3\nNT63: t5\nS: NT68 t5; NT64 t2\n\nSo S can produce t3 t5 or t1 t2. But the string starts with t2, so if S produces t1 t2, the first part is t1, but the string starts with t2, so that can't be. So perhaps S's first production is the one to use, meaning the first output is t3, but the string's first token is t2. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the initial derivation needs to involve more layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production of S is the other option, and then another non-terminal in the expansion produces t2. Wait, but that can't be because the first non-terminal from S would be t3. So perhaps the string cannot be generated, but I'm not so sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. S's productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63 (t3 t5)\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78 (t1 t2)\n\nSo S can produce either t3 t5 or t1 t2. Since the string starts with t2, neither of these directly produce it as the first token, unless one of the NTs in the production can produce t2 as the first token after expansion.\n\nWait, but S would first produce either t3 t5 or t1 t2, but the string starts with t2, so if S produces t1 t2, perhaps one of those NTs can expand into other NTs that then produce the t2. No, because the expansion would proceed recursively. So the first token generated would be t1 or t3, not t2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the first token in the string is t2, but neither of the direct expansions from S start with t2. So perhaps the answer is 'No', but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check if there's another pathway.\n\nWait, perhaps the production for S is S \u2192 NT64 NT78, which produces t1 and NT78. If NT78 can expand into 't2', then S would produce t1 t2, but the string starts with t2, so that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe there's a longer expansion where the first t2 comes from"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-611","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to fit this structure. Each non-terminal on the left side produces exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe given string to evaluate is: `t3 t3 t5 t4 t5 t3 t2 t4 t5 t1 t5 t3 t1 t2 t0 t0 t3 t5 t4 t4 t5 t5 t1 t4 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0 t5 t4 t3 t3`\n\nWow, that's a long string with 31 tokens. To approach this, I think the best way is to simulate the parsing process. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for determining membership in such grammars. However, I'm a bit rusty on implementing CYK exactly, so maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be constructed by expanding the start symbol S step by step.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Each of these is a pair of non-terminals. So, the first step is to see how the given string can be broken down into these pairs.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t3 t3`. I need to check which non-terminals produce 't3'. Let me scan the productions for each NT that ends in 't3'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3 (from NT68 -> t3)\n- NT63 \u2192 t3 (from NT63 -> t6, wait no, looking back, NT63's productions are not listed? Wait, maybe I should make a list.\n\nWait, some of the productions are given as NT62 -> NT48 NT0, but then later, NT48 -> t3, right? Wait, no, in the terminal productions, for example, NT48 is not a terminal. Wait, no. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, many non-terminals have productions ending in terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3. So NT68 is a terminal. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 t3. So both NT68 and NT63 produce 't3' when applicable.\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar, I think I need to parse all the terminal symbols. For example, looking through all the productions, we have several terminals like 't0', 't1', up to 't9'. So the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nSo the first token in the string is 't3'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't3' when expanded.\n\nLooking at all the productions, the NT's that produce 't3' are:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 t3\n- other non-terminals like NT8 -> t5, so no. \n\nWait, I think I should list all the NTs that produce 't3' directly:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t3, NT33 \u2192 t3, NT47 \u2192 t3 (appearing twice), and others?\n\nWait, some NTs may produce 't3' through a chain. For example, NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13, and both NT85 and NT13 produce 't2' and 't3' respectively, so NT47 \u2192 't2' 't3' = 't2t3'. So 't2t3' could be a production of NT47.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 \u2192 NT97 NT65, which is 't5' and 't5', so 't5t5'.\n\nSo, to parse the string, we might need to look for these chain productions.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't3 t3'. So, perhaps the first two symbols are from some production that splits into two 't3's.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, S can produce NT68 NT63. Both NT68 and NT63 produce 't3', so S \u2192 t3 t3. That's perfect because the string starts with t3 t3.\n\nSo the first step is that the entire string must be derived from S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and each NT68 and NT63 must derive the first and second t3's. But wait, NT68 and NT63 directly produce 't3', so that would only give us two t3's. But the string is longer than that, so we need to go deeper.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because the string has many more tokens than just two. So perhaps I was wrong. Maybe the entire string is derived from expanding S in a way that each production splits into two NTs, which can themselves split further.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using the CYK algorithm. The CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of NTs that can derive the substring from i to j.\n\nBut since I'm more comfortable with the top-down approach, let me try to see if the string can be split into parts that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t3 t3 t5 t4 t5 t3 t2 t4 t5 t1 t5 t3 t1 t2 t0 t0 t3 t5 t4 t4 t5 t5 t1 t4 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0 t5 t4 t3 t3\n\nFirst, let's see if the first t3 comes from NT68 or NT63. Since both produce t3, the first token is okay. Then the second t3 is also from either NT68 or NT63. So after S \u2192 NT68 NT63, we get t3 t3. But the string continues, so we need to see if each of these t3's can split further.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The grammar is in CNF, so each production is two NTs. The string is a sequence of terminals. So each terminal in the string must come from an NT production.\n\nLet me think of the string as a sequence of terminals, each from an NT. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of reduction splits a NT into two NTs. So, the entire string is built by expanding NTs until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut the string is long, so perhaps it's better to check if all the terminals in the string are present in the grammar. Looking at the string, the terminals are t0 to t5, which are all present in the grammar.\n\nBut more importantly, I need to see if the structure of the string can be captured by the productions.\n\nAnother approach: Starting from S, which splits into NT68 and NT63. Both of these directly produce t3, which matches the first two tokens. But the string continues beyond that, so we need to look at how the NTs after these t3s are processed.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the case. Maybe S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and each NT68 and NT63 can produce more NTs, which can then produce terminals.\n\nWait, wait, I think I made a mistake. NT68 and NT63 in the grammar are on the left side of productions. Let me look at their productions.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nSo, NT68 directly produces 't3', a terminal. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 t3. So, if S \u2192 NT68 NT63, that immediately produces 't3 t3', matching the first two tokens of the string.\n\nBut then, the third token is 't5', which must come from some other NT. So, perhaps after the initial split, each of these NTs can split further into other NTs until we reach the terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to see if each token can be matched by some NT.\n\nEach token is a terminal, so each must be produced by some NT production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which NTs directly produce which terminals:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 t3\n- NT48 \u2192 t3 (I think, I need to check)\nWait, no, let me go through the grammar again.\n\nFrom the given productions, looking for all NTs that lead to 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nNT48 \u2192 t3? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT48 is on the left of a production: I don't see NT48 appearing in the left-hand side of any production except perhaps in some cases. Wait, let's go through all the productions:\n\nLooking for NT48:\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are terminal symbols. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's a CFG in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The start symbol is S. The productions are things like S \u2192 NT68 NT63, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, and so on until the terminal symbols like t0, t1, up to t5.\n\nLooking at the given string: t2 t2 t2 t4 t3 t4 t4 t0 t1 t3 t2 t0 t2 t1 t1 t0 t4 t2 t0 t3 t1 t2 t0 t0 t4 t3 t5 t1 t4 t0 t4 t1 t5. So, the string consists of 35 tokens, all of which are terminals (t0 to t5), no non-terminals listed, so I'm assuming that the entire string should be derived starting from S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production leads to exactly two non-terminals, except at the very end when terminal symbols are produced. The leftmost symbol in the string is t2, which comes from a production like NT26 (since looking at the rules, NT26 \u2192 't2'). Or wait, actually, in the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9 and NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18, etc. But in the given list, I can see that NT26 can be 't2'. Wait, looking at the rules, I see: for example, NT26 \u2192 t2. No, wait, actually, let me parse the grammar properly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that several NTs are assigned to 't' values. For example:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't2'\n\nSimilarly, NT74 \u2192 't3', etc. So each 't' is a terminal, and the NTs are non-terminals that eventually produce these t's.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the terminals, which are of length 1. But in this case, all terminals are single symbols, like t0, t1, t2, etc., so each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a derivation from S that results in this string.\n\nThe string is long, so I'll need to approach this systematically. Let me consider the structure. The start symbol is S, and S can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, the starting rule is:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63 | NT64 NT78\n\nEach of these NTs can split further. For example, NT68 and NT63 can each be broken down into other NTs, until ultimately they produce the terminals t's.\n\nSo, for the string to match, every time there's an NT on either side, it must correspond to a production that ends up with the t's.\n\nAlternatively, since all tokens are terminals, every production in the derivation must end with a terminal. But wait, no\u2014since the grammar uses non-terminals, each production can generate a single symbol, so the entire string must be a combination of terminal symbols generated by non-terminals.\n\nLet me see how the given string breaks down. Let's write down the tokens:\n\nt2, t2, t2, t4, t3, t4, t4, t0, t1, t3, t2, t0, t2, t1, t1, t0, t4, t2, t0, t3, t1, t2, t0, t0, t4, t3, t5, t1, t4, t0, t4, t1, t5.\n\nWait, that's 35 tokens. Since each apply rule is two non-terminals, and the start is two, the total number of symbols produced must be 2 * (2^(n)) where n is the number of steps. But wait, actually, in CNF, each production step increases the number of symbols by one. So, for a string of length k, the number of productions is k-1, leading to a total of 2k-1 non-terminals. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree from the top down or bottom up. But given the length, maybe a better approach is to look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLet's see which one could generate the starting t2's.

So, NT68 leads to NT66 and NT65.\n\nThen, each of those can be broken down:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT49 NT47.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62.\n\nSo, the leftmost symbol is T68, which is T66 T65, which is T49 T47, T97 T62.\n\nWait, let me clarify the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT49 NT47\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62\n\nSo, the NT68 becomes NT66 NT65: NT66 \u2192 NT49 NT47 and NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62.\n\nSo, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT47 NT97 NT62.\n\nBreaking these down further:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT44 NT5.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT48 \u2192 t3, NT44 \u2192 t5? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the table is very long.\n\nWait, no, perhaps looking again: it's better to refer to each rule one by one.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT65\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT49 NT47\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT89 NT38 (from the grammar)\n\nNT89 \u2192 NT89 is transformed: wait, let me check the grammar rules to find exact definitions.\n\nWait, the productions for NT49 are not in the list provided here, but perhaps it's better to see if the string can be matched by S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with t2 t2 t2, which may not align with some of the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT64 NT78 would be a better starting point.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14.\n\nSo, NT64 becomes NT60 NT14.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18.\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98.\n\nSo, so far, S \u2192 NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14 \u2192 NT68 NT18 NT1 NT98.\n\nNow, each of these T68, T18, T1, T98 will have their own breakdown.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT65.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT49 NT47.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT89 NT38.\n\nWait, NT38 can be either t5, t3, etc. Let me check: looking at the grammar rules, NT38 has several productions. For example, one production is NT38 \u2192 't3', another is NT38 \u2192 't5', and others as NT38 \u2192 NT99 NT81, etc.\n\nWait, for NT38, according to the grammar, lines 54-56 say:\n\nNT38 -> NT99 NT81\n\nNT38 -> NT12 NT44\n\nNT12 -> 't5'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, so NT38 can produce t3, t5, or further non-terminals.

Wait no, looking again: the NT62 rules include NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT63, which is a production, but NT39 and NT63 are non-terminals, so NT62 can't be a terminal directly.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only NT symbols that directly produce 't's are:\n\nNT75 \u2192 t5\nNT33 \u2192 t0\nNT65 \u2192 t5\nNT2 \u2192 t3\nNT52 \u2192 t2\nNT69 \u2192 t0\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT45 \u2192 t5\nNT18 \u2192 t1\nNT97 \u2192 t3\nNT94 \u2192 t2\nNT62 \u2192 via NT17 NT81, but both are non-terminals. Wait, wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait the grammar as written:\n\nWait, the part that's confusing is that many NT rules point to other NTs, which in turn may point to t's. For example, NT38 can go to 't3' via several paths, but also to other NT combinations.\n\nSo the string we have is a series of t0, t2, etc., and each t corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. My job is to see if there's a parse tree for the string.\n\nApproach:\n\n1. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a), it's a binary grammar, so each rule produces two symbols. To parse a string, the number of symbols must be 2^n - 1 for some n. Let's count the tokens in the string.\n\nThe string is: t0 t2 t0 t5 t1 t2 t1 t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t1 t3 t1 t0 t1 t4 t0 t5 t5 t1 t4 t2 t3 t2 t0 t0 t2 t2 t4 t1 t2 t2.\n\nThat's 39 tokens. Let's see if 39 = 2^n -1. So 2^n = 40, n= log2(40) \u22485.32, which is not an integer. So that's a problem because the string length must be 2^n -1 for a CNF grammar. Wait, 2^6 -1 is 63, which is larger than 39. 2^5-1=31, which is less than 39. So 39-31=8 tokens extra, meaning the string cannot be derived from the grammar, which expects exactly 2^n-1 tokens.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding, the string length must be 2^n -1. So 39 is not of that form (since 39+1=40, which is not a power of 2). So immediately, the string can't be generated because the length is not suitable for a CNF grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe the initial S can produce multiple symbols, so let's check the production steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which are two non-terminals, so each of those must produce the necessary t's.\n\nFor example, NT68 could produce t0 and NT63 another t0, but let me see what the possible options are.\n\nWait, NT68 can go to 't3' via NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT47, then NT45 \u2192 't5', NT47 can vary. Alternatively, looking at NT68's rules, NT68 can produce 't3' directly from NT45 NT47? Wait, no, looking at NT68: the rules are:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT78 NT97\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, for NT68, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT48 NT97\nWait no, actually, looking again at the grammar:\n\nNT68: The rules are:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT48 NT97\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18\n\nSo NT68 can produce two NTs. Both are non-terminals. So to derive a terminal from NT68, the NTs must eventually derive a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT48: NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT78. NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90. NT88 \u2192 NT45 NT47. NT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38. And so on. So this could go on until it reaches a terminal.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the initial S can produce two symbols, so the total number of terminals in the string must be 2^k -1 for some k. Since our string is 39, which isn't 2^k -1, it can't be generated.\n\nWait, 2^6-1=63, so 39 is much less. So perhaps the string's length is 39, which isn't a possible number of terminals for any derivation starting from S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Each application of a rule adds one more symbol (since it's CNF, each rule is A \u2192 BC, which length is 3, so each step increases the length by 1, but overall, the total number of terminals must be 2^n -1.\n\nSo 39 is not 2^n -1 for any integer n, so the string can't be generated by this grammar, hence the answer is no.\n\nSo I think I can conclude that the answer is 'No' because the length isn't compatible.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string has 39 tokens. In a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, the number of tokens generated must satisfy 2^n - 1 for some integer n. However, 39 is neither 31 (2^5 - 1) nor 63 (2^6 - 1), meaning the string's length is incompatible with the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-630","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the start symbol is S, which is initially split into two non-terminals with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So any string generated must start with two symbols derived from NT68 and NT63.\n\nThe target string given is: `t0 t5 t2 t0 t4 t4 t5 t0 t3 t3 t0 t1 t0 t5 t0 t0 t3 t3 t0 t0 t5 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t4 t4 t1 t3 t3 t4 t1 t2`\n\nI notice that each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, the string consists of a sequence of 35 terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal. This suggests that the derivation of the string can be represented as a binary tree, where each node either splits into two non-terminals or is a terminal.\n\nThe key steps I'll take are:\n\n1. Check that the number of symbols in the string is correct based on the grammar's structure.\n2. Analyze the grammar's productions to see if the terminals can be derived through the rules.\n3. Look for patterns or any inconsistencies with the grammar.\n\nStarting with the structure: The start symbol S produces NT68 NT63. Each of these can then produce other non-terminals or terminals. Since the string is all terminals (t-symbols), the derivation must ultimately produce all terminals through the non-terminals that have productions ending in t's.\n\nFor example, many non-terminals have productions that result in t0, t1, etc. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81, and if NT39 \u2192 t0 or another terminal, then it can contribute to the string.\n\nWait, but some of the non-terminals might not directly produce a terminal. For example, NT75 \u2192 't1', which is a terminal, so NT75 can become 't1'. Similarly, NT69 \u2192 't0' and NT2 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nSo, each non-terminal can be expanded either into two non-terminals or a terminal. The process continues until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLet's count the number of symbols. The given string has 35 symbols. Since S produces two non-terminals, each subsequent step can generate more symbols, but the number of symbols should follow a certain pattern.\n\nIn CNF, each step in the derivation tree increases the number of symbols by one. So starting from S (1 symbol), after the first expansion, we get 2 symbols. Each of these can either terminate or become non-terminals, leading to 3, 4, etc. The total number of symbols in the derived string must be 2^n - 1 where n is the depth of the tree.\n\nBut in this case, the string length is 35, which would imply that 2^n - 1 = 35. Solving for n: 2^n = 36 \u2192 n\u22485.169. But n must be an integer, so 2^6 -1 = 63. So 35 is less than 63, which might suggest that the derivation doesn't go that deep.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for different production rules that don't necessarily build up the string in a binary fashion, but perhaps allows for some non-binary expansion if productions have more than two symbols. But wait, CNF requires all productions to have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the entire derivation must be a binary tree.\n\nTherefore, the number of symbols in the string should be a power of 2 minus 1. 35+1=36, which is not a power of 2. Next power of 2 is 64, so 64-1=63. 36 is not equal to 63. So that suggests that either the string can't be entirely derived from S without non-terminals, or my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe the string length is 35, which is possible if the derivation doesn't fully expand all non-terminals into terminals. For example, some non-terminals might not produce terminals all the way, but I think in this case, each rule either goes to a terminal or two non-terminals, so every terminal in the string must be the result of a direct production of a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nBut in any case, the string is a sequence of all t's and numbers, so perhaps it's a matter of checking whether each 't' can be matched by a production that ends in that terminal.\n\nWait, let me take a different approach. Maybe I should try to parse the string backward to see if each terminal can be matched to a production.\n\nEach 't' in the string is a terminal symbol, so it must come from a non-terminal that directly produces that t.\n\nLooking at the grammar, we have several non-terminals that produce 't's. Let's list them:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81, but if NT39 \u2192 t0 and NT81 \u2192 t3, then NT62 produces t0 and t3, which are 't0' and 't3', but actually, in the string, after t0, we have t5, then t2, etc. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t0, so perhaps NT68 \u2192 t0 and NT63 \u2192 another non-terminal which eventually produces the rest.\n\nWait, no. The start is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the first two symbols must be the results of NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking at NT68's productions: NT68 \u2192 NT65 NT68, NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT47, etc. Or it might have a direct terminal production, but from the given rules, it looks like all NT68's productions except NT68 \u2192 NT48 NT47 don't have terminals. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, none of the NT68 productions directly produce a terminal. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and none of those produce terminals except possibly elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking further down, we have NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65, NT97 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this using the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars in CNF. CYK can determine whether a string is in the language of the grammar.\n\nThe CYK algorithm involves creating a table where each cell represents whether the string from i to j can be derived from a certain non-terminal.\n\nThe steps for CYK:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each cell [i][j] is empty.\n2. For each position k in the string, if the k-th symbol matches a production of a non-terminal, then add that non-terminal to [k][k].\n3. For lengths l from 2 to n (length of string), for each i from 1 to n-l+1, j = i + l -1. For each position m between i and j, if [i][m] contains A and [m+1][j] contains B, and A \u2192 B exists in the grammar, then add the common non-terminal to [i][j].\n\nAt the end, if the start symbol S is in [1][n], then the string is accepted.\n\nBut considering that the grammar is very large, and the string is 35 symbols long, this would be a bit time-consuming to do manually. But perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if each terminal in the string appears in a production that directly or indirectly leads to it.\n\nLooking at the last symbol in the string: t2. Let's see what non-terminals can produce t2. Looking at the rules, NT94 \u2192 't2', NT1 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81, where NT39 could be a terminal. NT39 produces 't0' according to the given rules.\n\nWait, let me list all non-terminals and their terminal productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t3\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT12 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t3\n- NT14 \u2192 t1\n- NT15 \u2192 t3\n- NT17 \u2192 t4\n- NT18 \u2192 t1, t4, etc.\n- NT19 \u2192 t1, t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t2\n- NT23 \u2192 t2\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n- NT26 \u2192 t2 (multiple rules: NT26 \u2192 t2 (from NT62 rule), NT26 \u2192 t4, etc.)\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-645","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t0 t2 t3 t4 t3 t5 t4 t3 t0 t0 t3 t3 t3 t5 t4 t1 t1 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2 t4 t1 t1 t3 t2 t0 t2 t3 t5 t2 t3 t1 t4`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form is. CNF is a specific form of CFG where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing and can be transformed into an equivalent parse tree where each node has exactly two children, which is helpful for algorithms like CYK parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it starts with S, which can produce other non-terminals. The initial rules are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. But wait, NT here seems to be placeholders for other non-terminals, with numbers indicating different states or rules. For example, NT68 is another non-terminal which might have its own production rules.\n\nThe problem is that the grammar seems quite complex with 99 NTs, each with their own production rules. But for recognizing a string, I might not have to trace all possible derivations manually because that would be too time-consuming. Instead, I can think about how the string is built from the end, using a reverse approach or considering the structure of the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string consists of a series of t0 to t5, which I assume are terminal symbols. However, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals (NT) seem to expand into other NTs and terminals only at the very end. For example, looking at some rules like NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81, and then NT39 might produce 't3' etc. So, each NT eventually expands into a sequence of terminals and other NTs.\n\nBut the string given is all terminals: t0 t2 t3 t4 t3 t5 t4 t3 t0 ... etc. So, each 't' is a terminal symbol. The string's length is 34 tokens. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. The CYK algorithm is designed to efficiently determine if a string can be generated by a grammar in CNF. But doing CYK manually for a 34-length string would be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether the string could be derived starting from S. Since S can only produce two NTs, maybe I can see if each part of the string can be split into two compatible parts based on the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the start symbol S. Each S production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, the string must be the concatenation of two sequences: one derived from NT68 and another from NT63, or alternatively, one from NT64 and another from NT78.\n\nWait, but looking closer, the string starts with t0. Let me check the production rules for t0. Looking through the provided grammar, I see that NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47, and NT48 \u2192 't3'. Also, other non-terminals may eventually produce 't0' as a terminal.\n\nBut this feels too vague. Maybe I should try to build the derivation step by step, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if each 't' in the string is reachable from some NT, but since every NT eventually leads to terminals, maybe the issue is ensuring the correct structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to recognize this as a CNF grammar, so I can use the fact that each symbol in the string corresponds to a node in the parse tree with exactly two children. The structure of the string should allow such a division into pairs that match the grammar's rules.\n\nBut without specific production rules except for the form, it's a bit challenging. Alternatively, maybe there are patterns in the string that don't fit any of the rules, indicating it's not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let me consider the end symbols. The first symbol is t0. So, looking for any rules that generate t0. From the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I find NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47, NT48 \u2192 't3', etc. So, unless NT64 or NT68 can produce a t0, but looking through, I don't see any rules that directly produce t0. Let me scan the rules: I see NT0 producing t3, but perhaps in the deeper derivations.\n\nWait, but the initial S production starts with NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. So, I need to see if the string can be split into two parts that are compatible with these NTs.\n\nBut this approach is too time-consuming without a full analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on whether the string contains any symbols beyond 't5' or 't7', but in this case, the string only has t0 to t3.\n\nWait, no, the string contains t0, t1, t2, etc. Looking through the grammar, I see that some NTs produce 't' symbols, like NT33 \u2192 't5', etc. But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is designed to have a specific structure that can be broken down into pairs based on the grammar. For example, each 't' could be part of a two-step split.\n\nBut honestly, without more specific information about the structure, it's challenging. I think to make progress, I should consider that since the grammar is in CNF, the string must be parseable into a derivation tree where each node has exactly two children or is a terminal. If I can split the string into two compatible parts that match the grammar's starting symbols.\n\nAlternatively, a more efficient method would be to see if all the terminal symbols are compatible with the grammar's rules.\n\nAnother angle: I can check if each symbol in the string is present in the grammar. Wait, the grammar uses 't0', 't1', etc., as terminals, which are listed in the grammar. But I'm sure that all the terminals in the grammar map to some 't's, so the string is built from these terminals.\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if the string is feasible. Each part must come from a production that's either a single 't' or a combination of two terminals or other NTs. But since the string is linear, I can't go forward anymore.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the grammar's starting symbols require specific sequences. For example, S can only produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78, so the string must be the concatenation of two sequences. But the given string starts with t0, so maybe the first NT68 produces a prefix that starts with t0.\n\nLooking for rules that produce 't0', I see NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47, and then NT48 \u2192 't3', etc. So, maybe NT68 produces a sequence that includes 't0' as part of it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial NT68 can produce a t0 via a chain of derivations, but without knowing the exact steps, it's hard.\n\nAnother angle: Since the grammar is in CNF, every production starts with S as NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78, so perhaps the entire string is split into two parts, each generated by NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nBut that's the starting point, and from there, each part must be generated by NT68 and NT63.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to check for conflicts. For example, certain 't's in the string cannot appear together because the grammar doesn't allow certain sequences. But without knowing which pairs are allowed, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that certain symbols in the string don't appear as terminals in the grammar. Wait, looking at the provided grammar, are all the symbols in the string present? The string contains t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, etc. But looking through, the grammar uses symbols like NT68, NT63, etc. So unless the grammar defines these 't's, they shouldn't be present.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs produce 't's. For example:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't0', NT69 \u2192 't2', NT33 \u2192 't3', etc. So, the 't's are terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the right-hand sides have 't0', 't1', etc., meaning some non-terminals produce 't's directly.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n\nNT48 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo, NT0 \u2192 't3' NT47 and so on. It seems 't's are generated by some NT rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the string given is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is useful because it simplifies parsing and allows the use of algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, I'm not sure if I need to use that here since the string isn't too long, and maybe a top-down approach could work, even though without a parser it might get complicated.\n\nThe given string is: `t1 t3 t2 t5 t4 t2 t3 t0 t3 t2 t5 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t4 t0 t5 t1 t0 t1 t3 t4 t4 t3 t0 t3 t1 t5 t4 t3 t0 t3 t4`.\n\nWait, that's a lot of tokens. Let me count them. Each `t` followed by numbers like t1, t2 etc. So I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo any string derived from S will start with either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t1. So let's see which non-terminals can produce t1.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t4\n- NT69 \u2192 t0\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT47 \u2192 t5\n- NT18 \u2192 t1\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n- Others may produce t2, t3, etc., but let's check:\n\nFrom the 't's in the string, the first one is t1. So which NT can produce t1?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT75 \u2192 t1, NC08 in some rules? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar rules provided have:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n- NT18 \u2192 t1\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n- Also, NT15 -> t3, etc.\n\nSo, the first token t1 can be generated by NT24, NT18, or NT75.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S produces NT68 and NT63, or NT64 and NT78.\n\nSo the string starts with NT68 (which I think is NT68) followed by NT63.\n\nLooking at NT68's productions:\n\nLooking back at the rules, NT68 \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, no: looking through the rules, NT68 is on the left side of some rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3 (is that correct?) Wait, I need to search through the rules.\n\nWait, the grammar provided seems to have rules like NT68 -> t3, NT66->t3, NT62->t2, etc.\n\nWait, for example, looking at NT68's productions, I see:\n\nIn the rules, NT68 is on the left of some rules, like:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo yes, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would produce t3 followed by what NT63 produces.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT64 NT78 would produce [NT64 production] followed by [NT78 production].\n\nSo let's see what the first token is. The string starts with t1, but if S starts with NT68, it would produce t3 (since NT68 \u2192 t3).\n\nBut the first token is t1, which doesn't match t3, so the first production rule (S \u2192 NT68 NT63) must not be used here. Therefore, the only other possibility is S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo the first part would be NT64 followed by NT78.\n\nWhat does NT64 produce?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14.\n\nSo NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. Then, the string starts with t1, but the first symbol after NT64 is t3 (from earlier? Wait, no. Wait, wait, let me correct.\n\nWait, when S \u2192 NT64 NT78, then the first two symbols are NT64 and NT78. But NT64's production is NT60 NT14, and NT78's production is NT33 NT66.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of derivations.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this using the CYK algorithm, which can parse strings in CNF grammars efficiently.\n\nBut I'm a bit rusty on CYK, so maybe a step-by-step approach would help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can notice patterns or use the fact that each rule produces a single terminal or two non-terminals, and so the entire string must be the concatenation of the left-hand sides of the productions.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be split into segments where each segment is either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals that can produce two terminals. But this might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the entire string to be a sequence that can be mapped to a series of productions.\n\nWait, another approach: Since every production is in CNF, the entire string must have length equal to the number of non-terminals in the parse tree. Since each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of symbols in the string at each level depends on the number of non-terminals at that level.\n\nWait, let's see: The start symbol S is a single non-terminal. Each production for S gives S as the root of the parse tree with two children. Then each of those can be NT68\/NT63 or NT64\/NT78, which in turn each produce two NTs, etc., until we reach terminals.\n\nSo the string length should correspond to the number of leaves in the parse tree. Each S production leads to a string of length 2^k where k is the depth of the tree. But the string here has 38 symbols. Let's see 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 38 is in between. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a series of pairs and single terminals, each of which can be matched by the grammar.\n\nWait, another way: Let's model the string as a sequence of steps, where each step can produce two symbols or one.\n\nBut given the grammar's complexity, perhaps a better way is to use the fact that each non-terminal can only produce a specific terminal or a pair of non-terminals, and see if the string can be divided accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to write a small parser, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can try to split the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the rules again to see what each NT produces.\n\nFirst, some of the key rules:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list all rules for each NT.\n\nBut that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps focus on the starting symbol.\n\nThe string starts with t1, so let's see where that t1 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t1 is produced by:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t1\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n\nSo to get t1, we need to find a path in the grammar that produces t1.\n\nIn the grammar, let's trace possible paths.\n\nSince the string starts with t1, let's see if there's a possible NT that can produce t1.\n\nThen, the next symbols would depend on whatNT produced t1.\n\nFor example, if t1 is produced by NT18, which is NT18 \u2192 t1.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 production: NT18 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n\nAnd NT58 \u2192 t3\n\nNT65 \u2192 t5\n\nSo NT18 \u2192 t3 followed by t5, which would be t3t5.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t1, not t3t5, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, if t1 was produced by NT24 \u2192 t1.\n\nWait, let's check NT24's production. In the grammar, NT24 is on the left of the production NT24 \u2192 t1. So NT24 produces t1.\n\nBut looking in the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT24 is on the left except that one. So NT24 \u2192 t1.\n\nSo if a part of the string is t1, it could come from NT24.\n\nAlternatively, NT75 \u2192 t1, so perhaps another NT75 elsewhere."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar consists of. The grammar has a starting symbol S, and several non-terminals (like NT68, NT63, NT64, etc.) that eventually lead to terminals (like 't0', 't1', etc.). Each production rule is in the form of A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate, it's a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: `t1 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t1 t4 t5 t0 t0 t4 t3 t3 t1 t4 t5 t4 t0 t4 t4 t4 t1 t1 t2 t5 t2 t0 t2 t0 t5 t2 t5 t3 t0 t2`.\n\nI remember that for a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, the parsing can be done using a specific algorithm, but maybe a simpler approach is to see if each token in the string corresponds to a production that can generate it.\n\nBut wait, each non-terminal doesn't directly give a single terminal. Instead, each rule breaks down a non-terminal into two symbols. So, maybe I can construct a derivation starting from S and seeing if the string can be produced.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So each S-> is followed by two non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider the string. The first part starts with 't1'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT75 -> 't3' and others, but maybe I should look through all the non-terminals to see if any of them directly produce 't1'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 -> NT88 NT90 (not t1)\n- NT2 -> NT67 NT20 (not t1)\n- NT3 -> ...

Because in the given rules, I don't see any of that. So maybe the grammar doesn't have 't1' as a terminal.\n\nWait, so that means the string given has a 't1', but the grammar doesn't have any production rule where a non-terminal directly leads to 't1'. Then, how can the string have 't1'?\n\nBut that can't be. Unless the 't1's are generated through some intermediate steps where multiple steps produce the 't1', but in this grammar, all terminals are only two letters, so perhaps 't1' is produced through some non-terminal that is not a single letter.\n\nWait, no, the terminals are all two-character strings. So in this grammar, any 't1' would have to come from a production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't1', but since the grammar's rules seem to only have single terminals as two-letter strings like 't0', 't1', etc., and none directly produce 't1' as single or combined.\n\nWait, I'm confused.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens that I need to parse against the grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has each production rule either producing two non-terminals or a terminal. From the given grammar, I can see that it's indeed in CNF because all the productions consist of two non-terminals on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which breaks down into non-terminals, and NT38 \u2192 't3', which means it can produce a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t2 t5 t0 t0 t0 t3 t1 t4 t2 t5 t3 t4 t3 t4 t0 t1 t5 t0 t4 t1 t3 t1 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t1 t3 t1 t5 t4 t2 t3.\n\nI know that the strategy for parsing a string with a CFG is usually to use either recursive descent parsing, the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, or some kind of top-down parser with backtracking. Since this grammar has a lot of non-terminals and the string is quite long, I might consider using CYK because it's efficient for CNF grammars. \n\nCYK works by building a table where each cell (i,j) corresponds to a substring of the string starting at position i and ending at position j. For each of these substrings, it checks all possible productions that can generate two non-terminals, splitting the substring into three parts and seeing if each part can be generated by the corresponding non-terminals. The base case is when the substring is a single terminal, which means the starting non-terminal must directly produce that terminal.\n\nTo apply CYK, I'll start by listing the terminals in the string and mapping them to their respective non-terminals. Let's list the string:\n\nt2, t5, t0, t0, t0, t3, t1, t4, t2, t5, t3, t4, t3, t4, t0, t1, t5, t0, t4, t1, t3, t1, t3, t4, t3, t3, t3, t3, t1, t1, t3, t1, t5, t4, t2, t3.\n\nNow, the first step is to map each terminal to the possible non-terminals that can produce it directly. From the grammar, each production that directly produces a terminal is of the form NTxxx \u2192 tnumber. For example, NT26 \u2192 't2', so when I encounter t2 in the string, I need to check if this t2 could come from NT26 according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can create a mapping for each terminal:\n\n- t0: NT62, NT68, NT77, NT99, NT75, NT74, NT69, NT26, NT96, NT86 (Wait, I need to check the grammar provided. Let me go through the grammar rules and note all NTxxx \u2192 tnumber productions. \n\nFrom the grammar, the direct terminals are:\n\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT81 \u2192 t3\nNT26 \u2192 t2\nNT77 \u2192 t3\nNT99 \u2192 t5\nNT62 \u2192 't2'?

{"custom_id":"request-684","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t3 t0 t0 t3 t2 t3 t1 t5 t1 t5 t2 t0 t3 t3 t1 t5 t1 t1 t4 t2 t4 t4 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t0 t5 t2 t2 t5 t5 t4 t4 t4`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar's start symbol is S, and the productions for S are either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, the start string for S would be something like (something) followed by another, but in the context of the string, the provided string is a sequence of t followed by digits, which I assume are the results of the productions. \n\nEach 't' followed by a number might correspond to a terminal in the grammar. But looking at the productions, I don't see NT68 or NT63 appearing as terminals. Instead, the terminals in the grammar are like 't0', 't1', etc., which suggests that each 'tN' is a terminal symbol. So, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols that are generated by the grammar.\n\nTo determine if the string can be generated by the grammar, I'll need to parse it according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is left-derivation, and each step involves replacing a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. However, the end result is that the entire string must be derived from S through these productions, ending with terminal symbols.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string (36 terminals), this would involve a lot of steps. But perhaps there's a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a possible derivation or notice if certain patterns in the string can only be produced by specific parts of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a mix of NTs and t symbols. Each NT can produce other NTs or terminals. For example, NT68 can produce t3 (which is a terminal), as can NT63, NT52, and others. So the start symbol S can only generate specific combinations of NTs that end up producing all the ts in the string.\n\nWait, actually, looking again: S produces NT68 NT63. Each of those NTs can further break down. For example, NT68 might produce something else, maybe a pair of NTs or a terminal. Similarly for NT63. The way the string is constructed is by combining the results of these productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be generated by some production in the grammar. However, that's not sufficient because the structure must match; you can't just have all terminals, but they have to be generated in a way that fits the productions.\n\nWait, no. Each production in the grammar either combines non-terminals or produces a terminal. So every symbol in the string must be a terminal, and every non-terminal must be expanded into terminals via the productions.\n\nSo, looking at the string, all elements are of the form 'tN', which are terminals. Therefore, the string can be generated only if there's a way to reach all these terminals through the grammar.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach non-terminal can expand into other non-terminals or a terminal. So for the string to be generated, starting from S, each production must lead towards the ts in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to reverse the process. Instead of starting from S, perhaps check if each sequence of ts can be derived by the grammar.\n\nBut that's complex. Alternatively, look for production rules that generate each terminal and see if the overall string structure can be built from those.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT60 -> 't5'\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT28 -> 't7' (Wait, no. Let me check. Looking back at the productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT68 -> 't3' (since line NT68 -> NT66 NT65, but there's another line NT68 -> 't3'. Wait, let me check the lines more carefully.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with many lines. Let's make sure I pick the correct ones. The first few lines:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nThen, later in the grammar, we have:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT66 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't2'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT81 -> 't2'\nNT78 -> 't1'\nNT97 -> 't5'\nNT33 -> 't3'\nNT85 -> 't2'\nNT32 -> 't1'\nNT42 -> 't1'\nNT60 -> 't3'\nNT99 -> 't5'\nNT34 -> 't5'\nNT47 -> 't5'\nNT89 -> 't5'\nNT24 -> 't1'\nNT39 -> 't0'\nNT34 -> 't5'\nNT42 -> 't1'\n\nWait, so NT68 is in line NT68 -> 't3', and NT66 -> 't3'. So NT68 and NT66 produce t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT47 has several productions, some to terminals:\n\nNT47 -> 't5' (three times). So NT47 can produce t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 -> 't5' (twice). So NT27 can produce t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT84 -> 't4'\n\nAlso, NT45 -> 't5'\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be broken down into sequences that match these terminal productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be split into a series of such terminals, each being produced by some NT in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t0 t3 t0 t0 t3 t2 t3 t1 t5 t1 t5 t2 t0 t3 t3 t1 t5 t1 t1 t4 t2 t4 t4 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t0 t5 t2 t2 t5 t5 t4 t4 t4`\n\nWait, let me count the number of 't's: there are 37 terms. Since each production in the grammar either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of steps required to derive the string from S would be such that the total number of terminals minus 1 equals the number of productions. But since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces one non-terminal with two. So for a string of length n, the derivation would require n-1 steps, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more feasible to notice that the grammar allows for certain patterns. For example, S can go to NT68 NT63, which are both non-terminals. Let's see what those can be:\n\nNT68 -> t3\nSo, the first part of S's production is NT68, which immediately produces t3. Then, the next part is NT63.\n\nLooking at NT63's productions, I see:\n\nNT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nSo, NT63 splits into NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 can production 't4', given NT84 -> 't4'.\n\nNT62 can produce several options, including 't2', which is one of the early terms in our string.\n\nSo, one possibility is S -> t3 (from NT68) followed by NT63, which splits into t4 and NT62. If NT62 is t2, then we have t3 t4 t2. But looking at our string, the first few are t0 t3 t0 t0 t3 t2, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other production for S: S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 -> 't2' (NT64 -> 't2'), and NT78 has several options, including NT78 -> 't1', which is present in the string.\n\nSo, S generates t2 and then t1, but the string starts with t0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think again.\n\nLooking back at the productions:\n\nS can go to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nIf we take S -> NT68 NT63:\n\nNT68 -> 't3' (from the production NT68 -> 't3')\n\nNT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT84 -> 't4' (NT84 -> 't4')\n\nNT62 can go to NT3 (I think, but looking at the productions, NT62 -> 't2').\n\nWait, no. In the grammar, NT62's productions include multiple options, but one of them is 't2' (from NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar has various productions, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't5 t0 t0 ...' and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. I see that the start symbol is S, and the productions are between S and other non-terminals, eventually terminating into terminals. The string I'm given is made up of terminals, so I need to see if the non-terminals in the grammar can expand into this string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly expand into 't' followed by a number. For example, NT75 -> 't1', NT66 -> 't3', and so on. So the string consists of several of these 't' symbols with different numbers attached.\n\nI think the approach should be to work backwards from the string, trying to find which non-terminals can produce the string when expanded. Alternatively, maybe building a parse tree from the start symbol to the string. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, which might make it a bit easier in terms of structure.\n\nWait, no, wait. Context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form have each production as a non-terminal producing two non-terminals, except for the starting symbol which can produce terminals. So each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the productions are A -> BC, except ones like NT69 -> 't2', which are terminals. So the string is composed of terminals, so each symbol in the string must correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nBut the string is quite long: 33 symbols. So each symbol is either a 't' followed by a number or possibly some combination, but I think the 't' numbers are terminals themselves because in the grammar, some NT produce those. For example, NT62 -> NT39 NT81, and NT39 -> 't3', NT81 -> 't3'. So NT62 can produce 't3' 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs can produce combinations of 't's and other NTs.

So the string is a sequence of these tokens: 't5', 't0', 't0', etc.\n\nSo, each token in the string corresponds to a production that produces exactly that terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs produce 't' followed by a number.

{"custom_id":"request-712","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t4 t5 t5 t5 t1 t3 t4 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t1 t2 t5 t3 t2 t1 t4 t0 t5 t5 t0 t1 t3 t1 t5 t2 t1 t3 t4 t5 t2 t4 t2 t0`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that a grammar in CNF has productions where the right-hand side of each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that many non-terminals expand into two non-terminals, and some directly into terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. The start symbol is S, which splits into either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So the initial expansion begins with S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and then each of these NTs will have to expand further.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the tokens generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, leftmost derivation is the standard way, but perhaps a recursive descent parser or a stack-based approach like CYK could work. However, manually simulating this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, every step involves replacing a symbol with two symbols or a terminal. The key is that the number of symbols should increase by one each step, except for terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't4'. I need to check if there's a production that directly outputs 't4'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n- NT48 \u2192 't3' \u2192 wait, that's 't3' but NT48 has another production: NT48 \u2192 NT0. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, let me check each one that ends with a terminal:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT47 \u2192 't5' [Wait, no: looking back, I see NT47 has several productions, but some of them end with t5. For example, NT47\u2192 NT28 NT22, and NT22 \u2192 NT62 NT74, etc. But other productions under NT47 go directly to terminals? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT38 (Wait, but then under NT85, it's 't2'.\nSo NT47 could produce 't2' via NT85 \u2192 't2', right?\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I have:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT38 (that's two non-terminals)\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22 (two non-terminals)\n- NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52 (two non-terminals)\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22 again?\nWait, I see in the detailed list, NT47 has multiple productions, some of which are two non-terminals, others lead to terminals?\n\nWait, maybe I've misread the grammar. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions again to make sure I parse correctly.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT38 can go to 't3'\n- NT47 can go to 't5' via certain productions? Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first compile all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can consider that each production in CNF can produce a string of terminals after a number of steps. Since each step replaces a symbol with two, the length of the string should be a power of 2. Let's check the given string: The number of tokens is 44 (since there are 45 spaces). Wait, counting them:\n\nThe string has 44 tokens, because it's a list of 44 't's separated by spaces. So the length is 44. But since each step in the grammar's expansion doubles the number of symbols, the number of symbols should be 2^n, but since the grammar starts with S (1 symbol), the total length after n steps would be 2^n. However, the string has 44 tokens, which is not a power of two, so it's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, is that right? Because the string length after derivation is indeed 2^n - 1 + 1 = 2^n, but actually, the initial symbol is S, which is replaced in each step by two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can either expand into two or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the number of symbols as starting at 1 (for S), and each replacement step increases the number of symbols by one if a non-terminal is expanded into two symbols, but if a terminal is produced, it's replaced by two non-terminals (since CNF requires each production to have exactly two symbols on the right-hand side). Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but each step can produce more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is that the given string length is 44, but any derivation in CNF will result in a string whose length is a power of two, because each expansion step either keeps the same number or doubles it. Wait, no: actually, each production replaces a single symbol (non-terminal) with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal?), no, wait, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal.\n\nSo each production in CNF can produce either one terminal or two symbols. But when you perform a leftmost derivation, each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal, so if it's a terminal, the string length increases by zero. But if it's replaced by two non-terminals, the string grows by one symbol.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: when a non-terminal A is replaced by BC (two non-terminals), the total number of symbols increases by one (since one becomes two). If A is replaced by a terminal, it's just one symbol replacing one, so the length doesn't change.\n\nWait no, because if you have a string with k symbols, and you replace a non-terminal in it with two non-terminals, the length increases by one symbol because one symbol is replaced by two: net gain of one. But if a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, the length remains the same because one symbol is replaced by one.\n\nTherefore, for a context-free grammar in CNF, the possible derivations can produce strings of various lengths, but they might be any length as long as the rules allow. However, the initial step is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78, so the initial step increases the length from 1 to 2. Then, each subsequent step can either keep the same length or increase it by one.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me clarify: in a leftmost derivation, the first step replaces S with NT68 NT63, making the string length 2. Then, each subsequent step replaces the leftmost non-terminal with its production.\n\nIf that non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, the total length increases by one (because 1 becomes 2: net +1). If replaced by a terminal, the length remains the same.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 length 2.\n\nStep 2: Replace NT68 with something. If it's replaced by a terminal, the string becomes a terminal plus the expansion of NT63, say NT63 \u2192 something.\n\nBut NT63's expansion: looking at the grammar, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62 or 't3'. So if NT63 is replaced by 't3', the string becomes, at this point, something like A 't3', where A is the expansion of NT68.\n\nBut after each step, the number of non-terminals can vary, and the length can be any number, but each expansion can make it increase or stay the same.\n\nBut the initial string is 44 symbols. I need to check if that number is possible.\n\nWait, let me see: in a leftmost derivation, the string length can indeed be any number, because you can have multiple terminals produced directly, and the non-terminals can be expanded as needed.\n\nBut wait, the key here is that the given grammar might not have a production that can directly produce certain terminals in a way that sums up to 44.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to think about how many steps are needed. Each step can at most increase the number of symbols by 1 (if a non-terminal is replaced with two non-terminals).

{"custom_id":"request-709","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step because I'm still a bit new to this.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier because I don't have to worry about more complex forms.\n\nThe grammar has various non-terminals (S, NT62, NT81, etc.) and a bunch of terminals, which seem to be 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', and a few others like 't8', 't9', but I think the terminals we're dealing with here are mostly 't0' to 't5' based on the productions.\n\nThe given string to evaluate is: `t3 t4 t4 t2 t1 t4 t5 t5 t2 t5 t4 t5 t1 t0 t4 t3 t5 t1 t3 t2 t3 t5 t0 t0 t1 t1 t3 t1 t3 t1 t2 t1 t5 t0 t2 t4 t4 t0`.\n\nI need to check whether this string can be derived from the given grammar. \n\nThe initial step is to check the start symbol, which from the grammar looks like S. Looking at the productions, S has two rules: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Both of these produce strings that start with NT68, NT64, but wait, the string starts with t3. So I need to see if either of these can lead to a string starting with t3.\n\nWait, looking at the terminal productions, for example, NT68 \u2192 't3', so if S uses NT68 and NT63, which produces t3 and something else. Similarly, NT64 produces t3? Let me double-check. Oh, I see NT68 \u2192 't3', so using S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would give a string that starts with t3, which matches the beginning of our string.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t3, which matches if we take S \u2192 NT68 NT63. That means the first part is 't3', which is the first part of our string. So that's a match.\n\nNext, I need to see if the rest of the string can be generated by the remaining part after NT68 and NT63. Let's think about how the grammar works. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each rule is a binary production, so each step introduces two symbols. Since the string is long, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps I can work backwards or look for possible reductions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a sequence of productions that would lead to the string. Let's try to parse the string step by step, assuming the initial production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nThe first symbol is t3, which comes from NT68. So after that, what's left is the rest of the string starting from t4.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t4. Since NT68 has produced t3, what can produce t4 next? Let me check the grammar. Looking at the productions where the left-hand side is NT62 or other non-terminals that can produce 't4'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a part of the string that can be generated from other non-terminals. For example, let's consider if there's a rule where NTx can produce a 't4'. Looking through the productions, I see some but it's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string with the grammar. Since the grammar is given, and the string is provided, I can try to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me write down the string again: t3 t4 t4 t2 t1 t4 t5 t5 t2 t5 t4 t5 t1 t0 t4 t3 t5 t1 t3 t2 t3 t5 t0 t0 t1 t1 t3 t1 t3 t1 t2 t1 t5 t0 t2 t4 t4 t0.\n\nThat's 41 symbols. Since each production is binary, the number of productions needed would be log2(n) but since the string is given in order, maybe I can check by breaking it into parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be built using the productions. But that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see if each production leads to the next part. Starting with S, which is t3... Let me consider S \u2192 NT68 NT63. NT68 \u2192 t3, so next we need to see what NT63 can produce over the remaining string.\n\nLooking at NT63, from the grammar: NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo after t3, we have NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. That splits the remaining string into two parts: after t3, we have t4 t4 t2 t1 t4 t5 t5 t2 t5 t4 t5 t1 t0 t4 t3 t5 t1 t3 t2 t3 t5 t0 t0 t1 t1 t3 t1 t3 t1 t2 t1 t5 t0 t2 t4 t4 t0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is t3 followed by NT63. So after t3, the next symbol is t4, which is the first symbol of NT63's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT63, it's nt63 \u2192 nt84 nt62.\n\nSo NT63 can produce two terminals, nt84 and nt62. So after nt63, we have to process nt84 and nt62. Let's see the string from t4 onwards:\n\nt4 t4 t2 t1 t4 t5 t5 t2 t5 t4 t5 t1 t0 t4 t3 t5 t1 t3 t2 t3 t5 t0 t0 t1 t1 t3 t1 t3 t1 t2 t1 t5 t0 t2 t4 t4 t0.\n\nWait, the string is t4, t4, t2, t1, etc. So the first symbol after t3 is t4 from nt63's nt84.\n\nLet me check if nt84 can produce a t4. Looking back at the grammar, nt84 \u2192 nt58 nt28.\n\nSo nt84 is nt58 followed by nt28. So we need to see if this can produce the next t4.\n\nWait, the next symbol after t3 is t4. So the first symbol of nt84 is nt58, which produces 't4'? Let me check the productions where the left-hand side is t4.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that nt16 \u2192 nt46 nt5, but that's not 't4'. Wait, nt45 \u2192 nt89 nt38, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking for a production where the next symbols are 't4's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to look for the sequence of symbols and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals or terminals. So each step increases the string length by 1, but in the given grammar, each production is binary. Wait, no, each production adds exactly one non-terminal, but then when those are expanded, they add more.\n\nWait, maybe the number of symbols in the string can help. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step in the derivation adds exactly one symbol, so the number of symbols should be n steps for a string of length n. But wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is length 2, so from start symbol, each production step adds one non-terminal, and each non-terminal can be replaced by two non-terminals, leading to exponential growth. Hmm, but the exact length is determined by the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I should just try to work through the string step by step.\n\nSo initial step: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 t3 followed by NT63.\n\nNow, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo now, the string is t3, and then we need to process NT84 and NT62.\n\nLooking at NT84: Let's see, NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT28.\n\nSo NT84 \u2192 NT58 NT28.\n\nThen, NT58 \u2192 NT29 NT5.\n\nWait, not sure about NT29's productions. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking for NT58 productions: NT58 \u2192 NT49 NT9, which seems like it produces 't1' and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the grammar. It seems extensive, with many non-terminals and production rules. The terminals in the grammar are the 't's followed by numbers. The string to evaluate starts with 't0 t3...' and ends with a series of 't's and numbers.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production only produces two symbols.

So each 'tX' in the string corresponds to a rule that ends in that terminal.\n\nMy approach is to check if the entire string can be decomposed into a sequence of production rules starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Each of these is a two-symbol production. So the string must start with either of these two sequences, each followed by the next production of each symbol in those sequences.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it starts with t5. Let me check the grammar for which NTs produce what 't's.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT69 -> 't2' (I recall from the grammar provided)\nBut my string starts with t5, so I need to find which NTs produce t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT39 -> 't0' (no)\n- NT99 -> 't5' (Yes, there's a rule NT99 -> 't5')\n- NT24 -> 't1' (No)\n- NT9 -> 't5' (Yes, because NT9 -> 't5')\n- NT94 -> 't2' (No)\n- NT15 -> 't3' (No)\n- NT89 -> 't5' (Yes)\nBut maybe more than one NT produces a specific t.\n\nSo the string starts with t5. So the first part must come from a non-terminal that produces t5. Let's see, which NTs produce t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar's rules, I find:\n\n- NT99 -> 't5' (Yes)\n- NT1 -> 't3' (No)\n- NT39 -> 't0' (No)\n- NT89 -> 't5' (Yes)\n- NT21 -> Not present, looking for NT21, but not listed. So perhaps only NT99 and NT89 produce t5.\n\nWait, checking the grammar again, the rules:\n\nNT99 -> 't5'\nNT79 -> ... Hmm, wait, let me check the full list.\n\nWait, the grammar is provided with each line. Let's go through the grammar and see which NTs produce which t's.\n\nLooking at each production where the result is a terminal 'tX':\n\n- NT69 -> 't2' \u2192 t2\n- NT38 -> 't5' \u2192 t5\n- NT75 -> 't5' \u2192 t5\n- NT97 -> 't5' \u2192 t5\n- NT26 -> 't2' \u2192 t2\n- NT69 (again) \u2192 't2'\n- NT99 -> 't5' \u2192 t5\n- NT94 -> 't2' \u2192 t2\n- NT81 -> 't3' \u2192 t3\n- NT48 -> 't3' \u2192 t3\n- NT85 -> 't2' \u2192 t2\n- NT72 -> 't0' \u2192 t0\n- NT26 -> 't4' \u2192 Wait, do I have that?

So the actual production rules leading to terminals. Wait, no, the rules like NT62-> NT48 NT0 are not terminal. So perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nWait, correction: The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A,B,C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-744","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm not very familiar with all the details, but I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure CFGs where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems like all the productions are in CNF. Each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, right? Wait, no, in CNF, every production must produce two symbols on the right-hand side (either two non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal, but since in this grammar all are two non-terminals or a terminal?), but looking at the rules, I see some have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is two non-terminals. Then, other rules have NT followed by numbers, like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, so each production seems to be A \u2192 B C where B and C are either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. I need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, so I'll start from S and try to apply productions step by step to reach the given string. But the string is quite long, so maybe I should look for patterns or see if the string can be parsed by working backwards or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check the overall structure. Each NT symbol can generate a terminal or another NT, so the string is a series of t followed by numbers. Each production that ends with a terminal is like NT followed by a number that directly gives the 'tX' part. But I need to make sure all the NTs in between can derive the necessary terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the productions, many of them have NTxy, where x and y are digits. Some of these have the terminal 't' followed by a digit, like NT38 -> 't3', etc. So perhaps each non-terminal can be expanded into a 't' followed by a specific digit, and the string can be checked by matching each 'tX' with the corresponding NT rule.\n\nLet me list out the mappings from NT to their terminals based on the given productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, each NT has a production that either continues (like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0) or results in 't' plus a digit. So for example:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't4'\nNT8 \u2192 't5'\nNT0 \u2192 't4'\nNT2 \u2192 't3'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT5 \u2192 't1'? Wait, no, looking back: NT52 -> 't2', NT5 -> 't5', maybe?\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NTs and their corresponding terminals, assuming they can derive them.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT63 \u2192 't3'\nSo S can produce 't3 t3', but the string starts with 't1', so S directly won't produce that. So S must expand to other NTs.\n\nThe grammar has two initial S productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Let's note those.\n\nNow, let's see the given string: \"t1 t0 t3 t5 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t1 t4 t5 t2 t5 t5 t0 t1 t2 t3 t3 t5 t1 t3 t2 t3 t2 t5 t1 t1 t1 t0 t5 t2 t4 t0 t4 t5 t0 t2\".\n\nThat's a lot. Maybe I can parse it by breaking the string into segments that match the grammar. For example, each 'tX' must come from a particular NT production. So perhaps each 'tX' can only be produced by one specific NT.\n\nLooking at the given NT productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT63 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo NT68 produces 't3' and NT63 also produces 't3'. So if the string starts with 't1', that can't come from NT68 or NT63. Therefore, maybe the string isn't derived from the initial S productions, but perhaps via another path.\n\nWait, maybe that's not possible because S can't directly produce 't1'. Let me check that. The initial S has productions like NT68 and NT63, both producing 't3', so S would produce 't3 t3', right? So any string generated by S should start with 't3 t3'. But the given string starts with 't1', so that suggests that maybe the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the NT productions.\n\nWait, let me go back. The grammar's NT productions are given for each NT like NT62, NT65, etc. For example, NT38 \u2192 't3'. So each NT can produce a specific 'tX' and perhaps other NTs. So the initial S's productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63, both of which produce 't3', so starting with 't3 t3'. But the given string starts with 't1', so that's a conflict. So perhaps the string isn't part of the language.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding which NTs produce which terminals. Let me try to see if each NT has a unique terminal expansion.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't5'\nNT8 \u2192 't5'\nNT3 \u2192 't4'\nNT2 \u2192 't3'\nNT5 \u2192 't3'?\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, some of the NT rules produce a 't' followed by a digit. For example, NT38 \u2192 't3', NT75 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, but I'm noticing that multiple NTs produce the same 'tX'. For example, both NT68 and NT63 produce 't3'. So if the initial S can produce 't3 t3', but the string starts with 't1', perhaps 't1' is not produced by any NT in the grammar, making the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can produce NTx, where x is such that its expansion starts with 't1'. But looking at the NT productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't1'. Let me check the given NT rules:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, is there any that produce a 't1'? Let me scan the list.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't0'\nNT34 \u2192 't1' (Wait, NT34 \u2192 't1'? Let me check: yes, \"NT34 -> 't1'\".\n\nWait, hold on. In the given grammar, looking for which NT rules produce a 't1':\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't1'\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT15 \u2192 't3' (Wait, no)\nWait, in the grammar, let me look:\n\nYes, NT34 is \"NT34 -> 't1'\", and NT24 is \"NT24 -> 't1'\". Also, NT47 has several rules, but some produce 't5' and one to NT0 and 't5' again. Wait, no, let me recheck.\n\nSo in the grammar, NT34 is explicitly given to produce 't1'. Therefore, the NT34 can produce 't1', meaning that if in the derivation, an NT34 can be used to produce 't1'. So perhaps the initial S, which can't produce 't1' directly, but if during expansion, some NT can produce 't1', then maybe the string can be generated.\n\nWait, but let me think about the overall structure.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nBoth of these produce 't3' each because NT68 and NT63 both have production 't3'. So S would produce 't3 t3' in both cases.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string must be 't3 t3', but the given string starts with 't1'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with a symbol that's not produced by the initial S productions.\n\nBut wait, am I sure that all possible derivations of S lead to 't3 t3' as the first two symbols?\n\nYes, because S can only be expanded into NT68 and NT63, both producing 't3'. So any string generated by S starts with 't3 t3' at the beginning.\n\nTherefore, the given string, which starts with 't1', can't be generated by this grammar. So the answer would be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string starts with 't1', but all direct expansions of the start symbol S produce 't3' as per the provided grammar rules, making it impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the string: `t3 t4 t3 t1 t0 t0 t2 t1 t1 t0 t5 t2 t5 t2 t0 t0 t2 t5 t0 t5 t2 t5 t0 t4 t2 t1 t4 t0 t2 t1 t0 t4 t3 t5 t3 t5 t2 t1 t3 t5`.\n\nHmm, these 't's are likely terminals. So my goal is to see if this sequence of terminals can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions from S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo whatever string is generated must start with the concatenation of two non-terminals: either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t3. Let me check which non-terminals produce t3.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see several non-terminals that produce 't' terminals:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t3\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n- NT62 \u2192 t2\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n- NT94 \u2192 t1 (Wait, is that correct? Let me check: NT94 seems to produce 't1' and 't2'. Wait, in the provided rules, I see NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49, but then 75 \u2192 t1 and 49 \u2192 t1. Wait no, let's check the actual rules.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. Some entries in the grammar are non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right. For example:\n\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT81 \u2192 t3\nNT26 \u2192 t2\nNT74 \u2192 t3\nNT9 \u2192 t5\nNT45 \u2192 t5\nNT34 \u2192 t1\nNT94 \u2192 t2\nNT72 \u2192 t0\nNT18 \u2192 t4\nNT49 \u2192 t1 (Wait, maybe I misread. Let me go back.)\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT18 \u2192 t4\n- NT49 \u2192 t1\n- So which non-terminals produce t3? NT38, NT81, NT74, and maybe others? Let me go through all the RHS:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 \u2192 produces t3 (if NT48 \u2192 t3) and then NT0 \u2192 t4. Wait, but 't3' and 't4' as the first two symbols would be problematic if S starts with NT62, since NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which would start with t3 and t4, but our string starts with t3 t4 t3...\n\nWait, S's first production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So NT68 and NT63 must be expanded. Let me see what NT68 and NT63 produce.\n\nLooking at NT68: The rule is NT68 \u2192 t3 (from NT68 \u2192 t3). So if S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then the first symbol must be t3, which is the case here.\n\nNow, NT63: Looking at the rules, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT63 must expand to NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, NT84: Checking the rules, NT84 \u2192 NT62 NT69. So NT84 expands to NT62 NT69.\n\nSo putting that together, S expands to NT68 (t3) followed by NT63 (NT84 NT62) which expands to NT62 (which is t3) followed by NT69 (which is t2?).\n\nWait, no. Let's check NT69: NT69 is defined as NT26 NT42. Wait, NT69 \u2192 NT26 NT42?\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has multiple entries. Let me parse each line correctly.\n\nEach line is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, the first line is S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNext is S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nThen, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65? Wait, that's a terminal and a non-terminal. Hmm, but Chomsky Normal Form typically requires productions to be two non-terminals. So perhaps that line is actually NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT\u2086\u2085? Wait, no, that would be a non-terminal on the left and a non-terminal on the right, which is allowed. Or does the presence of a terminal indicate this is not in CNF? Because in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So in that case, if any production has a mix of terminals and non-terminals, it's not in CNF. But here, the line is NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT\u2086\u2085, which is two non-terminals, so it's fine.\n\nWait, no, in the initial list, some lines have the terminal 't' as the RHS. Like NT38 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo the productions can have terminal symbols. So all the productions here are in CNF because each RHS is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, back to NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, where NT0 \u2192 t4 and NT48 \u2192 t3. So NT62 expands to t3 t4.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 \u2192 NT26 NT42. Let's look at NT26 and NT42:\n\nNT26 has two rules: NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9 and NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17.\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT60 NT9. So, for example, NT26 could expand to NT60 NT9, then NT60 \u2192 t5, and NT9 \u2192 t5, so that would be t5 t5.\n\nWait, but NT26 could also expand via NT32, but let me see NT32: NT32 has two productions: NT32 \u2192 NT4 NT8 and NT32 \u2192 NT12 NT44. Hmm. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nBut back to S \u2192 NT68 NT63. NT68 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo S \u2192 t3 (from NT68) followed by NT63. Let's expand NT63 step by step.\n\nFirst, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT62 NT69.\n\nSo NT84 \u2192 NT62 (which is t3 t4) and NT69 (which is NT26 NT42).\n\nWait, not quite. Because NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which is t3 t4.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use a parsing approach, starting from S and seeing if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string backward, checking if each symbol can be produced by the reverse productions. This is sometimes called the CYK algorithm approach, but implemented manually.\n\nLet me list the given string as a list of symbols:\n\n[ t3, t4, t3, t1, t0, t0, t2, t1, t1, t0, t5, t2, t5, t2, t0, t0, t2, t5, t0, t5, t2, t5, t0, t4, t2, t1, t4, t0, t2, t1, t0, t4, t3, t5, t3, t5, t2, t1, t3, t5 ]\n\nSo that's 35 symbols. We'll need to see if we can find a derivation that matches this sequence.\n\nWe'll start by considering that the string must be the concatenation of two parts, either derived from NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Since the string starts with t3, let's see which productions can start with t3.\n\nLooking through the RHS, NT38 \u2192 t3, NT81 \u2192 t3, NT74 \u2192 t3, and others.\n\nWait, from S's first production: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So when we expand NT68, we should get something that starts with t3. Looking at NT68's definition: NT68 \u2192 t3. So the first symbol is t3, which matches the string.\n\nNext, we need to expand NT63 into t4 t3...

{"custom_id":"request-768","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminal symbols. Also, the grammar ends with some rules leading to terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the rules to understand the structure. The start symbol is S, which splits into two non-terminals on either side. Looking at the string, it starts with 't4 t2...', so I need to see if the rules can generate these terminals in the given sequence.\n\nThe string is quite long, but I can break it down step by step. Since it's in CNF, the length of the string can be checked using the properties of the grammar. A string of length n in CNF can only be generated if the corresponding parse tree has exactly n-1 non-terminals. The number of symbols is 36, so the parse tree should have 35 non-terminals. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because the specific string might have dependencies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, starting from the root S. Let's see how S can split into NT68 NT63. So the first two symbols after S would be determined by NT68 and NT63. However, looking at the string, it starts with 't4', which means the first terminal is t4. So I need to find how 't4' relates to NT68 or NT63.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT68, I see NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT81. Wait, that's not helpful because NT68 isn't a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I should look at the productions that result in terminals. Let's check if NT68 can produce a terminal. Scanning through, I notice NT84 \u2192 't3'. But that doesn't help with NT68. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for NT68 in the rules. Scanning through, I see that NT68 is only defined as \u2192 NT63 NT81, so it doesn't directly produce a terminal. That's a problem because the string starts with 't4', which is a terminal, so NT68 can't directly produce that. Maybe I need to go deeper. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Let's consider NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT81. Then both sides would need to generate further.\n\nNT63 is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but that seems recursive and might not be useful. Alternatively, let me look for 't4' in the terminal rules. Wait, the terminal rules are listed at the end, under the NT names. For example, NT3 \u2192 't4'. So every NT that ends with a 't' has that 't' as a terminal.\n\nSo, NT3 \u2192 't4', that means if we can get to NT3, it would produce 't4'. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't5', and so on. So maybe I can track how the non-terminals lead to these terminals.\n\nLooking back at the string, the first symbol is 't4', which is produced by NT3. So for 't4', I need a production that ends with NT3. Now, I need to see how NT3 can be reached from S. Let's trace the possible paths.\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63. So we need to see how NT68 and NT63 can produce the first part 't4'... Hmm, but NT68 only leads to NT63 NT81, which again are non-terminals. So maybe S can't start with 't4' directly. Alternatively, maybe S could split as NT47, but I don't see that in the rules. Wait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so no other productions from S except NT68 and NT63. So S must produce NT68 and NT63, which are both non-terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with 't4', so one of NT68 or NT63 must derive to 't4'. Let's check NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking for NT68 \u2192 ?\n\nIn the rules, NT68 isn't listed, except for some others. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT68 nowhere else. Hmm, perhaps I need to check if any of the NT68's produce a terminal. Wait, in the given rules:\n\nWait, the start of the rules says:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nWait, S can also produce NT64 and NT78. So maybe I misread before. The initial S has two productions: S\u2192 NT68 NT63 and S\u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo first, the string starts with 't4'. Let's see which of these two productions could lead to 't4'.\n\nNT68 and NT64 are both starting points.\n\nLooking at NT68, from the rules, NT68 is not followed by anything directly except that S itself can produce it. Wait, let me check the rules for NT68. Oh, in the given rules, I can't find any production for NT68 except as part of S. Similarly for NT64, its production is just as part of S.\n\nSo NT68 and NT64 don't have productions that result in terminals directly. Hmm, that complicates things. Let's look for where 't4' is produced. From the terminal rules, NT3 \u2192 't4', NT34 \u2192 't1', NT26 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, so 't4' can be produced by multiple NTs. For example, NT26 \u2192 't4'. So maybe the first part of the string is 't4' from NT26.\n\nThen, perhaps the string is being generated through a path like S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then NT68 \u2192 something, and NT63 \u2192 something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because NT68 seems to only split into more non-terminals. Let me try another approach: parse the string by breaking it into possible non-terms.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt4 t2 t2 t4 t2 t5 t5 t4 t1 t1 t2 t1 t5 t3 t0 t2 t1 t4 t1 t3 t3 t4 t2 t1 t5 t4 t5 t0 t3 t1 t0 t2 t2 t5 t0 t5 t4 t4 t4 t4 t2.\n\nThat's 36 symbols. Let me try to see if I can build a parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the first two symbols should come from NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking at NT68, the available rules are not clear because I don't see it on the left side of any arrow except in S. So NT68's productions aren't given, meaning it must be part of a deeper derivation. But since it's a non-terminal, it must split into other non-terminals until it reaches a terminal.\n\nBut without knowing the rules for NT68, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the string starts with another production from S, like S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nWait, that's another option. If the string starts with 't4', then perhaps the first part is from NT78. NT78 can be split into NT33 NT66. Let's see if NT78 can produce 't4'.\n\nLooking at NT78's rules: NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66. If these further split, perhaps I can reach a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should backtrack. Let's look for the first occurrence of 't4' in the string. The first symbol is 't4', so we need to find how it can be generated from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the terminal rules, 't4' is produced by several NTs:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, so perhaps the string starts with NT26 or NT3.\n\nAssuming it's NT26, then S must have a production leading to NT26 NT something else. But the start only produces NT68 NT63 and NT64 NT78. So unless NT26 can be reached via one of those, it's not directly possible.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider the entire string and see if its length matches the expected length.\n\nIn CNF, any string generated must have a length that's 2^n, where n is the number of productions. Since S has two productions, the start, the minimum number of steps would generate a string of length 2 (S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then each NT68 and NT63 would split into two more, giving total length 4, etc.).

I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string that I need to determine if it's generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't produce a non-terminal on the right side in the same production. This structure makes parsing easier with algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just evaluating one string, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. The string to evaluate starts with \"t2 t2\", so I need to see how \"t2\" and \"t2\" can be generated from S or part of the non-terminals.\n\nThe terminals in the string are \"t0\", \"t1\", \"t2\", \"t3\", \"t4\", \"t5\". I notice that each terminal corresponds to a production of the form NTxxx \u2192 t, where xx is some number. For example, NT26 \u2192 t2 means that NT26 can generate the terminal \"t2\".\n\nMy plan is to check if each \"t\" in the string can be derived from the corresponding non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet's list out the terminals in the string and their positions:\n\n1. t2\n2. t2\n3. t0\n4. t1\n5. t5\n6. t4\n7. t1\n8. t4\n9. t0\n10. t4\n11. t0\n12. t1\n13. t0\n14. t4\n15. t2\n16. t2\n17. t5\n18. t0\n19. t2\n20. t3\n21. t1\n22. t4\n23. t4\n24. t0\n25. t2\n26. t5\n27. t5\n28. t2\n29. t4\n30. t5\n31. t4\n32. t3\n33. t3\n34. t4\n35. t5\n36. t2\n37. t1\n38. t4\n39. t2\n40. t3\n41. t4\n\nEach \"t\" corresponds to a specific NT. So I need to map each \"t\" to the NT that produces it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT has productions ending in a terminal (like NT26 \u2192 t2, NT84 \u2192 t3, etc.). So each ti corresponds to an NT.\n\nLet me create a mapping from \"t\" to the NT that generates it.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT2 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT5 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT10 \u2192 ?\nWait, looking back, I might have misinterpreted the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-786","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a particular string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is pretty extensive, with a lot of production rules. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces: \n\n`t1 t5 t3 t4 t1 t3 t5 t0 t5 t4 t3 t3 t4 t4 t2 t3 t1 t1 t3 t3 t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t3 t5 t0 t5 t3 t3 t3 t1 t2 t0 t2 t4 t5 t2 t1 t1 t5`\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the structure of the problem. Since it's a CNF grammar, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, except for the terminals which are the 't' followed by a number. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So the initial step is to see whether the string can start with either combination.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't1'. So, if the first part is NT68 NT63, that would produce a sequence starting with whatever NT68 and NT63 produce. Alternatively, if it starts with NT64 NT78, that would start differently. Let me check the NTs to see which ones produce 't's.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT68: 't3'\n- NT63: 't3'\n- NT64: 't3'\n- NT78: 't3'\n\nWait, so NT68 and NT64 both produce 't3', and NT63 and NT78 also produce 't3' or maybe other 't's? Let me check each one:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT63 -> 't3'\n- NT64 -> 't3'\n- NT78 -> 't3'\n\nSo if S starts with NT68 NT63, the first two tokens would be 't3 t3'. Alternatively, if S starts with NT64 NT78, that's also 't3 t3'. But the string starts with 't1', so neither of those options fit. That suggests that the string might not be in the language, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The string's first token is 't1', but according to the grammar, S can only produce 't3 t3' as the first two tokens. So unless the 't1' is somehow generated by a different combination, this might not match. Could there be another starting point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me double-check the grammar. The start symbol S is defined as S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78, each of which produces 't3 t3'. So the string must start with 't3 t3', but it starts with 't1', so that immediately suggests it's not in the language. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to derive 't1' using a different symbol. Let me see if any of the non-terminals produce 't1'. Looking for NTs that produce 't1':\n\nChecking the grammar rules:\n\n- NT1 -> 't3'\n- NT2 -> 't3'\n- NT3 -> 't4'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT5 -> 't4'\n- NT6: Let's see, NT0: 't3'; NT1: 't3'; NT2: 't3'; NT3: 't4'; NT4: 't5'; NT5: 't4'; NT6: Hmm, looking through the list, none of the NT6 rules produce 't1'. Wait, let me check all the NTs.\n\nLooking through the NT6 entries:\n\n- NT62 -> NT48 NT0. I don't see 't1' here.\n- NT65 -> NT96 NT65? Wait, that's a cycle, but NT96 might eventually resolve to something, but I don't see 't1' there.\n- Other NTs like NT19: -> NT1 NT66. NT1 is 't3', so that's 't3 t3').\n- NT39: -> NT27 NT97. NT27: t5, NT97: t5, so 't5 t5'.\n- NT85: -> NT18 NT8. NT18 is 't5', NT8 is 't5', so 't5 t5'.\n- NT93: -> NT39 NT66. NT39 is t5, NT66 is possibly some terminal or NT leading to 't3'.\n- Wait, but looking at the full list, do any of the NTs produce 't1'?\n\nLooking through each NT rule, does any rule for NTsomething produce 't1'? Let me go through the list.\n\nNT18: t2\nNT0: t3\nNT9: t5\nWait, I see NT1: 't3', NT2: 't3', NT3: 't4', NT4: 't5', NT5: 't4', NT6: Hmm, no NT6 rules directly produce 't1'.

Let me check each rule:\n\n- NT1-> t3\n- NT2-> t3\n- NT3-> t4\n- NT4-> t5\n- NT5-> t4\n- NT6 (several rules, all involve NTs that don't produce 't1')\n- NT7: no, looking at the rules, I don't see any NT7 rules.\nWait, let me check each NT:\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\nNT1: 't3'\nNT2: 't3'\nNT3: 't4'\nNT4: 't5'\nNT5: 't4'\nNT6: Not found to produce 't1', but let's check:\n- NT62 is 't3'\n- NT63: 't3'\n- NT64: 't3'\n- NT65: 't5'\n- NT66: 't3'\n- NT67: 't2'\n- NT68: 't3'\n- NT69: 't3' (wait, in the initial grammar, NT69 is 't0' according to the last entry, but earlier I thought NT69 was producing 't3'.

{"custom_id":"request-788","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t2 t4 t2 t1 t3 t1 t0 t4 t3 t3 t4 t0 t4 t5 t0 t3 t3 t2 t5 t0 t0 t0 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t3 t1 t2 t4 t4 t1 t5 t0 t5 t0 t4 t2 t2 t0 t1`. That's a lot of symbols, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I know the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should help simplify things because each step in the derivation will involve replacing a symbol with either a terminal or two symbols.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The first production from S is `NT68 NT63`. And wait, I notice that the string starts with `t2 t4`, but according to the grammar, S directly expands to NT68 and NT63. So the starting point is always NT68 and NT63.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of t's. Each t corresponds to a terminal derived from a specific production. From the grammar, some non-terminals lead directly to t's. For example, NT62->NT48 NT0, which eventually leads to t2, t4, or other t's through further productions.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I need to see if it can be derived from the grammar starting from S. Since the string is a series of t's, each t must come from a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nLet me recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal can only produce two symbols, and the derivation works by expanding each non-terminal step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nMaybe a good approach is to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar, treating each t as a terminal step. Alternatively, I can try to see if the sequence of t's can be generated from the start symbol S by breaking down each part.\n\nBut given the complexity of the string and the number of non-terminals, it might be easier to try to see if each t in the string corresponds to a possible terminal production.\n\nFor example, looking at the grammar, NT26 can produce t2 or t4 based on the productions:\n\n- NT62 -> NT48 NT0, which eventually leads to t2 or t4 (since NT48->'t3', NT0->'t4', but not sure if that's correct). Wait, no, the grammar has more specific rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the productions, each non-terminal may have multiple ways to reach a terminal. For example, NT26 can produce 't2' if one of its productions ends in t2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps constructing the parse tree step by step would help, but that would take a lot of time for a 40-symbol string.\n\nAlternatively, note that any non-terminal that ends in 't' must have a production that leads directly to a terminal, not just non-terminals. For example, NT60 -> NT68 NT18, which further breaks down into 't3' and 't0' via NT68 and NT18.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should try to see the first symbol in the string, which is 't2'. Then I need to see what non-terminals produce 't2' directly.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, for example, NT69->'t2', NT2->'t3', NT81->'t2', etc. So 't2' can come from NT69, NT81, NT26 (as per NT26->'t2'?), or others. Wait, the grammar list might not be complete as it's too long.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT69 -> 't2'\n\nSo NT69 can produce 't2'. So if in the string, the first symbol is 't2', perhaps it's coming from NT69.\n\nSimilarly, I need to see if, after expanding each non-terminal, the sequence of t's can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a parser approach, trying to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser could work, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the strategy is to note that each non-terminal in the grammar can only produce a specific set of terminals, or combinations, allowing me to check if the string can be broken down correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to model each step of the derivation. However, with such a long string, that's impractical manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should note that each production in the grammar leads to certain t's. So for example, NT62 leads to 't2' and 't4', depending on its further production. Wait, no: looking at NT62->NT48 NT0, and then NT48->'t3' and NT0->'t4', so NT62 would produce t3 t4, but that might not directly result in a single t. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, each production is in CNF, so for each non-terminal, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So if a non-terminal has a production that leads to a terminal, that's a terminal production. For NT26, one of its productions is 't2', so it's a terminal.\n\nTherefore, 't2' can be produced by NT69, NT26, or others if they have 't2' as a production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT69 -> 't2'\n- NT81 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> 't2' (from the rule NT26->'t2'? Wait, in the list I provided, looking through the grammar, in the initial part, I see:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0  \nNT64 -> NT78 NT98  \n...  \nAnd then later:\n\nNT26 -> NT60 NT9  \nNT26 -> NT32 NT17  \nAlso, looking elsewhere:\n\nNT69 -> 't2'  \nNT26 -> 't2'\n\nWait, in the full grammar, looking at the end of the provided content, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't2'\nNT69 -> 't2'\nNT0 -> NT48 NT47\nAnd in the first part:\n\nNT99 -> 't5'\nNT38 -> 't3'\nNT47 -> 't5'\n... etc.\n\nSo, the non-terminals that can directly produce a 't2' are NT26 and NT69.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is 't2', so that could come from either NT26 or NT69.\n\nLet me pick NT26, as it's lower down in the list. So I can set the current production step to NT26, which expands directly to 't2'. Then, the next symbol must be generated by another production.\n\nWait, no, because the string is the entire sequence, so each production step must lead to the correct sequence.\n\nThis approach is getting too tangled. Maybe a better way is to see if each 't' in the string can be matched to a possible production.\n\nBut without knowing the entire parse tree, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the key is to see that every production leads to either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals, and thus the string must be a sequence of terminals compatible with the CFG.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem reduces to checking whether each 't' in the string corresponds to a valid terminal production, considering the order.\n\nBut considering that each production is in CNF, each non-terminal can be expanded into either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, for a string to be in the language, it must be possible to parse it step by step, recursively expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can think of the string as consisting of a series of 't's that are the result of expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nBut with 40 symbols, manually checking this is tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps noting patterns or looking for contradictions.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, the total number of symbols in the string after full expansion must be of the form where, starting from S, each step either increases the number of symbols by one (if a non-terminal expands to a terminal) or keeps it the same (if it expands to two non-terminals). Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So for S \u2192 NT68 NT63, that's two non-terminals, which when expanded further, each can produce either a terminal or two non-terminals. Each production step can increase the count.\n\nBut for the string given, it's 40 symbols, which is a specific number. Perhaps it's possible, but without knowing the exact derivation, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on the fact that each 't' corresponds to a terminal production. So, for each 't' in the string, there must be a non-terminal in the grammar that can produce that 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-811","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is a string of 't's followed by a digit, except for the ones like 't5' etc., which I think are literals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's presented in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the grammar is given with all the productions. \n\nLooking at the strings, the start symbol is S, which produces NT68 NT63. So the initial expansion from S would be NT68 followed by NT63. Each NT has its own productions, so I can follow that chain.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string is: t5, t5, t2, t1, t5, t1, t5, t5, t5, t3, t1, t4, t5, t4, t4, t5, t5, t1, t2, t2, t3, t2, t1, t4, t4, t4, t1, t2, t2, t3, t2, t0, t2, t2, t0, t1, t1, t1, t5, t2, t0, t0, t5.\n\nI'll need to see if I can derive this string by expanding the grammar. Since each terminal in the CNF grammar is a single character, each production step should correspond to adding two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal. Therefore, when generating the string, each step either adds a terminal or introduces a split that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nSo for the string, which is 39 tokens long, I need to check the length. In Chomsky normal form, the number of steps to generate a string of length n is n-1. Each production either adds one terminal or splits into two non-terminals. The initial S is one symbol. The maximum length of the string at any step is 2^k, where k is the number of splits. So 39 is possible because 2^6 is 64, which is more than 39.\n\nNow, to approach this, perhaps I can parse the string from the start symbols, trying to match the productions.\n\nLooking at the string starting with t5, which is a terminal. So that could come directly from a production. Looking at the grammar, tokens ending with 't' must be derived from the productions.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, for example:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18\nNT62 \u2192 NT39 NT3...\nWait, no, actually, the grammar is given in a particular way. I need to check each non-terminal's productions.\n\nLet's list the relevant non-terminals and their productions that produce terminals, since these are the leaf nodes.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS is non-terminal and its productions start with NT68 and NT63. So the first step is to expand S into NT68 and NT63. Now, I need to see how these can produce the starting t5, t5.\n\nLooking at NT68, which has the production: NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18. NT66 is another non-terminal. NT66 \u2192 NT96 NT66? Wait, no, looking back, actually, it's:\n\nWait no, wait, looking through the list:\n\nNT66 is defined as NT74 NT96, right? Wait, no:\n\nWait the grammar has:\n\nNT47 is defined with multiple productions, but looking through all the productions, I need to find non-terminals that produce terminals.\n\nSo let's go through the grammar and find which non-terminals produce terminals. \n\nNT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94\nNT89 \u2192 NT38 NT97\nNT77 \u2192 NT33 NT66\nNT74 \u2192 NT34 NT85\nNT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78\nNT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 \u2192 NT62 NT84?\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: look for any non-terminals that lead to terminals directly. For instance, if a production is A\u2192a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the productions, perhaps I have some:\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT74 NT96\n\nWait, but NT96 is another non-terminal, and looking for its productions: NT96 is used in NT18's production, right? \n\nWait this might get complicated. Maybe I should backtrack and see which non-terminals lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t5 t5...\n\nThe first t5 must come from some production rule that leads to 't5'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals have 't5' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the last entries:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't0' and 't3', right? So NT33 can produce t0 or t3 based on the productions. But where does NT33 come from?\n\nSimilarly, NT47 can produce 't5' in one of its productions, right? Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't5' in the grammar, for example:\n\nLooking through all the productions at the end:\n\nFor example, NT99 \u2192 't5', NT39 \u2192 't5', NT38 \u2192 't5', NT47 \u2192 't5' (three times), NT75 \u2192 't5', NT89 \u2192 't5', NT24 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nSo, NT99 \u2192 't5', so that's a way to get t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT47 \u2192 't5' in several cases.\n\nSo, the first t5 could come from NT99 or NT47.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT62 has the rules:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start building the derivation.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nThen, we need to see how NT68 and NT63 can be expanded to get the string.\n\nLet's track each part.\n\nStarting with NT68:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT96 NT66?\n\nWait, perhaps no, better check each production step.\n\nNT68's productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT74 NT96\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT34 NT85\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94\n\nNT94 \u2192 NT25 NT24\n\nWait, I think this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for the entire string in terms of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the beginning and trying to match the productions. Parsing is often done top-down, starting with S and trying to match the string.\n\nThe string starts with t5, t5, t2, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first t5 comes from NT68, but NT68 expands to NT66 NT18, which might lead to something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first t5 is from NT99 \u2192 't5', but that is a long way down.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for the beginning of the string and see which part of the grammar can produce it.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t5 t5 t2 t1...\n\nSo the first two characters are t5 and t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t5 t5.\n\nLooking for rule A \u2192 a B or any production that starts with a t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT62 has a production NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT3, which might not help. Alternatively, NT47 can produce t5 three times.\n\nWait, actually, NT47 has the production NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22, but also NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52, etc., and one of the production is NT47 \u2192 't5' three times.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT47's productions: \n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n- NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT66\n- NT47 \u2192 NT34 NT9\n- NT47 \u2192 NT94 NT24\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT8\n- NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52 again?

The string is `t0 t0 t3 t2 t0 t2 t3 t5 t5 t3 t1 t4 t0 t3 t4 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t5 t1 t3 t4 t1 t0 t3 t5 t5 t3 t2 t0 t5 t2 t5 t5 t2 t3 t2 t5 t3 t5 t0`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The given grammar seems to fit that since all productions either end with a terminal or have exactly two non-terminals on the left.\n\nThe goal is to see if we can derive the given string starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S in the grammar has two options: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So initially, we have to expand S using these two non-terminals. \n\nLet me try to approach this step by step. Maybe I can parse the string backward since that sometimes works with CNF grammars. Parsing with the leftmost symbol might be tricky, but backward might be easier.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t0 t0...`. I notice that some terminals like `t0` are produced by specific non-terminals. For example, in the given grammar, NT68 \u2192 `t0` and NT63 \u2192 `t0`. So, the first `t0` in the string must come from either NT68 or NT63.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT63 has a production NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT62. So to get `t0`, it's via NT68 directly, but NT63 expands further. Hmm, maybe I should check what each production leads to.\n\nLet's see, NT68 \u2192 `t3` and NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT62. So for the first T0, the start symbol could provide it directly if S \u2192 NT68, but since the second rule is S \u2192 NT64 NT78, which starts with NT64. \n\nWait, actually, the first T0 in the string must be from NT68. So that would come from S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then, the next T0 would need to come from either NT68 or NT63 again, but since NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT62, which further breaks down, it's possible.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that the entire string is a sequence of terminals, not nested non-terminals. So perhaps I can see if the string can be split into a sequence of terminal symbols that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can represent it as a parse tree, and the string should correspond to the leaves of that tree in order.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the possible terminal sequences from each non-terminal. Let's see:\n\nFrom NT68, the only terminal is `t3`. From NT63, it's NT34 NT62, which both are non-terminals. NT34 has productions leading to NT99 and NT81, and since NT81 \u2192 `t3` in one of the productions? Wait, no. NT81 is a non-terminal that produces NT78 and NT97 in some rules, but I think I might be getting confused.\n\nWait, let's list out the terminals generated by each non-terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal's end productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\nNT64 \u2192 t2\nNT78 \u2192 t3\nNT95? Wait, the terminals are single letters: t0, t1, etc.\n\nLooking back at the rules, I see:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78 \u2192 NT1 leads to t5, but wait, NT34 appears in the rule for NT19, which goes to t5. Let me retrace.\n\nPerhaps it's better to create a mapping of each non-terminal to the possible terminals it can produce. That is, for each NT, what terminal symbols can it derive.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\nNT64 \u2192 t2\nNT78 \u2192 t3\nNT97 \u2192 t5\nNT94 \u2192 t1, t2? Let's see NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49. NT75 is 't1' and NT49 is 't1' or 't2'? Wait, no, in the rules, NT94 has two productions: NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49 and NT75 \u2192 't1', and NT49 \u2192 't1'? No, wait:\n\nLooking at NT49: I see in the rules, NT49 \u2192 't1', NT55? Wait, no, looking back, it says:\n\n\"NT49 \u2192 't5', NT58 \u2192 't3', etc. Wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT75 \u2192 't3', NT69 \u2192 't0', NT94 \u2192 't2', NT38 \u2192 't3', NT81 \u2192 't3'. Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Perhaps I should list each non-terminal and their direct terminal symbols.\n\nLet me go through each rule:\n\n- S starts as NT68 NT63.\n\nEach rule has either two terminals or a production to two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, all productions in CNF have left side as a single non-terminal and right side as two non-terminals or a terminal and something. Wait, no, in CNF each production right side has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some rules have a single terminal on the right. For example:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't2'\n\nSo, each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, to find all possible terminal sequences, starting from S.\n\nS can be NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT62.\n\nSo, the first step from S is t3, and then the next part is NT34 NT62.\n\nBut wait, no, the string is a sequence of terminals, so when expanding NT68, it adds t3, and then NT63 becomes two non-terminals, which in turn would generate more terminals, but since NT63 is a non-terminal, it would generate something else.\n\nWait, but if the string is just a single series of terminals, the number of non-terminals during parse would have to match the number of splits. This is getting a bit complex. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be produced by the grammar step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, the total number of terminals in the string should be equal to the number of initial symbols in the start production, considering that each non-terminal can produce either a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the start symbol S can only generate two non-terminals at the top level: NT68 and NT63. So, any valid string derived from S must be a sequence that can be split into two parts where the first part is the expansion of NT68 and the second part is the expansion of NT63.\n\nSo, the string can be divided into two parts: the first part generated by NT68 and the second by NT63.\n\nSince the given string is of length 32 (if I count the separators), but let me check: t0, t0, t3, t2, t0, t2, t3, t5, t5, t3, t1, t4, t0, t3, t4, t0, t4, t5, t4, t3, t5, t1, t3, t4, t1, t0, t3, t5, t5, t3, t2, t0, t5, t2, t5, t5, t2, t3, t2, t5, t3, t5, t0.

{"custom_id":"request-830","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what CNF is. CNF means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, most of the productions seem to fit CNF, except for some that produce terminals and others that produce non-terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions except the start symbol can produce terminals. Oh no, wait, no, in CNF, all productions except the start must be to terminals or two non-terminals. The start can produce anything.\n\nWait, no, no\u2014I think CNF requires all productions except the start symbol to have either two non-terminals or a terminal. Or is it that the start symbol can produce a terminal directly? I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think. Actually, in CNF, all productions for non-terminals (except the start symbol) must produce two non-terminals. The start can produce anything, including terminals. But wait, I'm a bit confused because some of the symbols here seem to be terminals (like 't0', 't1') but others are non-terminals like S, NT62, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT68 NT63, both of which are non-terminals. So the string should be built by expanding these non-terminals until we get to terminals. So the process will involve expanding S into NT68 and NT63, then each of those into their components, and so on until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, matching the given string.\n\nOk, the string is: `t2 t4 t4 t4 t0 t2 t2 t5 t4 t4 t1 t5 t1 t5 t2 t1 t3 t2 t1 t5 t0 t1 t4 t2 t2 t4 t1 t3 t3 t0 t5 t4 t2 t0 t2 t2 t5 t5 t3 t2 t3 t5 t0 t4`.\n\nSo, let's try to model this. The first step is to see how the string could be built starting from S. Since the string starts with t2, which is a terminal, it must come from a production that has either two non-terminals, but in this case, the last step must produce a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals have productions ending in terminals, like NT77 -> 't3', NT62 -> 't0', etc.\n\nBut wait, looking through the grammar rules, I see that most non-terminals have productions that lead to other non-terminals, but some directly to terminals. Like NT38 can produce 't3', NT26 't2', etc.\n\nSo, the string is 41 symbols long. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree for the string must have a structure where the number of symbols is equal to the number of leaves, each corresponding to a terminal production. Each internal node is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals.\n\nThus, the number of symbols should be 2^k, where k is the number of steps in the parse tree. Let's see: 41 is not a power of two, which suggests that the string might not be of a length that fits the parse tree structure. Hmm, that could be a red flag.\n\nWait, but the grammar might not be a full CNF. Wait, in CNF, the left-hand side must be a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be two non-terminals or a single terminal. But in the provided grammar, I see that for example, NT62 -> NT48 NT0: that's two non-terminals, so that fits. NT26 -> 't2': that's a terminal. So, that's a production for a non-terminal that can produce a terminal.\n\nBut in CNF, all productions except the start symbol can produce only terminals or two non-terminals. So as long as all non-terminals except S produce either two non-terminals or a terminal, it's fine. The start symbol can have any productions, but S is the only non-terminal that can be the start.\n\nSo, the first thing I'll check is whether the string's length is compatible. For a string generated by a CNF grammar, if the string has length n, the height of the parse tree would be log2(n+1) - 1 or something like that. Wait, let's think: the number of symbols in the string, when it's expanded from S, should be 1 (for S) then 2, then 4, then 8, and so on. So the number of terminals must be 2^k for some k. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. The string here is 41 symbols, which is between 32 and 64, and not a power of two. So that suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar, because the length doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because the string starts and ends with certain terminals, but each step doubles the count, but the production steps can vary. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each production in CNF either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (increasing the length by 1 step) or a terminal, which stops that branch. So the total length would indeed be 2^k, but if some productions have terminals earlier in the expansion, perhaps the length isn't a pure power of two.\n\nWait, no. Each expansion step for a non-terminal that splits into two non-terminals increases the number of nodes. The terminal steps don't contribute to further expansion. So, the total number of terminals would be the number of leaves in the parse tree, which must be a power of two if all non-terminals expand all the way until terminals. But if some non-terminals are expanded into terminals before others, perhaps the total number isn't a power of two. So, for example, if the parse tree has some leaves that are terminals and others that are further non-terminals, the count might not be a power of two.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the string is 41 characters, which is not a power of two. That might mean that the string can't be generated by a CNF grammar, which requires that the length of the derived string is a power of two. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Consider if the production S -> A B, then A -> a, B -> b, so the string is \"ab\", length 2, which is 2^1. If A -> a C, and C -> c, then the string would be \"ac\", length 2. Alternatively, if B -> B C, and eventually C -> c, then the string would be longer, but how?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: in a deterministic context-free grammar, the generated strings are always of length that is a power of two, but that's for the case where the parse tree is perfectly balanced. But in reality, some derivations can lead to strings that aren't powers of two if the grammar uses left or right recursion.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the grammar is strictly in CNF, each production for a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each time you expand a non-terminal that has a two-non-terminal production, it increases the count by one. But if you have a mix, it's possible for the length to be anything. But actually, for strictly CNF, when expanding all the way until terminals, the number of terminals should be equal to 2^n for some n.\n\nWait, actually, I think that for any string derived from S in a CNF grammar, the length of the string must be a power of two. Therefore, since 41 is not a power of two, the string cannot be generated by this grammar, and the answer would be 'No'. But I'm not entirely sure, so let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm remembering from the Chomsky-Sch\u00fctzenberger theorem that certain context-free languages have generating functions that are algebraic, but I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me try to see the first few symbols of the string and see if they can be the start of a valid derivation.\n\nThe string starts with 't2 t4 t4 t4 t0...'. Looking at the grammar, 't2' can come from NT68 (since NT68 -> t3? Wait, looking back: no, I have to check which non-terminals produce 't2'.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT68 -> 't3', NT66 -> 't3', NT62 -> 't0', NT77 -> 't3', NT78 -> 't3', NT60 -> 't5', NT67 -> 't2', NT74 -> 't3', NT38 -> 't3', NT26 -> 't2', etc. Oh, so there are non-terminals that produce 't2' such as NT26 -> 't2'.\n\nNow, if the first 't2' comes from NT26, then the parse would be S -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-832","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has a specific structure where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit that because all the productions have exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left with two non-terminals on the right. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, some productions like S \u2192 NT68 NT63 have two non-terminals, others like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 have two non-terminals, but there are no cases where a production has a single non-terminal on the left and a single terminal on the right, which would indicate a terminal not part of a production with two non-terminals. Wait, but looking again, some NT productions end with 't', like NT68 \u2192 't3', so those terminal symbols are in the productions.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So the grammar should only have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Let me check if all the productions here are of those forms. Looking through the grammar: all the productions on the left are non-terminals, and on the right, they have two non-terminals or a terminal. So yes, it's in CNF.\n\nNow, the string we need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t2 t0 t2 t2 t3 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t2 t3 t4 t1 t4 t0 t5 t4 t5 t3 t4 t0 t5 t5 t1 t2 t0 t5 t0 t5 t2 t3 t0 t5 t4 t2 t0 t4 t4 t3 t2.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some terminals like 't' are part of the productions, like NT68 \u2192 't3', so in the string, I should see sequences that could be derived from these productions.\n\nBut let me think about how to approach this. One way is to model this as a parsing problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser could work, but doing this manually for a long string would be tedious, especially with 43 tokens.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the grammar as a parse tree. Each production either introduces two symbols (non-terminals) or terminates with a terminal. But doing this for a 43-symbol string would be time-consuming, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent each non-terminal and the possible terminals they can expand to, but that might not directly help.\n\nAnother idea: Since the grammar is in CNF, any derivation is directly represented by a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal and has exactly two children (either terminals or non-terminals). So the string must be a result of replacing each non-terminal step by step, always combining two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) at a time.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in reverse: the string is built from the start symbol S by expanding S into NT68 and NT63, which in turn expand into more symbols until we reach the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, but given the string is 43 symbols long, and the grammar has a leftmost derivation that splits each symbol into two at each step, the length would grow exponentially. So for a string of length N, the derivation would require log2(N) steps. Hmm, but 43 is an odd number, which might be problematic, but maybe it's possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can look for the structure of the string and see if it can be decomposed into the parts specified by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string forms a specific pattern in the grammar's structure. For example, let's consider the string as a sequence of terminals, and see if I can map it to the productions.\n\nLet me try to break the string into parts that match the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the string: t2 t0 t2 t2 t3 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t2 t3 t4 t1 t4 t0 t5 t4 t5 t3 t4 t0 t5 t5 t1 t2 t0 t5 t0 t5 t2 t3 t0 t5 t4 t2 t0 t4 t4 t3 t2.\n\nWait, that's 43 terminals. Let me see how the productions can form such a sequence.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT68 NT63. So the initial step would be replacing S with NT68 NT63, but since the grammar is right-angled, maybe I'm thinking incorrectly about it.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, meaning when you expand S, you get two non-terminals: NT68 and NT63. Each of these, in turn, can be expanded into other symbols.\n\nBut this seems complex. Maybe I can try to find a way to build up the string from the grammar's structure, looking for starting points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a CYK algorithm would be effective here to check parsing. But since the string is quite long, that might not be feasible manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for repeated patterns or using a stack-based approach to simulate the parsing.\n\nAnother thought: Each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, in terms of the string processing, each symbol in the string is either a direct terminal from the grammar, or the result of two non-terminals being expanded, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is structured in a way where each symbol can be traced back through the productions. Maybe I can check if each segment of the string matches a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if the string starts with a production that can derive t2, since t2 is the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0. Wait, but for the first symbol t2, do any production end with t2?\n\nLooking at the productions, NT68 \u2192 't3', NT66 \u2192 't3', NT62 \u2192 't2', but wait, in the grammar, looking carefully: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, and so on.

The production rules are all of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the two base cases where non-terminals are replaced by terminals. For example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which translates to non-terminals. But wait, some of the right-hand sides are terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So, the top-level rule is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which starts the derivation.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. But in the list, I see S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so that's how the grammar begins. The other option is S \u2192 NT64 NT78, but as the first rule, I think it's just one of the possible productions for S. So, the grammar can only be S as the start symbol, and the productions are the ones listed, including those that produce terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these 't' commands. So, each non-terminal in the grammar can be replaced by a terminal or further expanded.\n\nNow, the approach is to parse the string using the grammar, checking if it can be derived. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is a replacement of a single non-terminal with two symbols (terminals or non-terminals). \n\nI think I should attempt a leftmost derivation or at least see if I can find a way to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a derivation tree where each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two symbols. The string is essentially the concatenation of the symbols derived at each step until all are terminals.\n\nBut this seems complex. Another approach is to see if the string is a correct sequence of terminal expansions starting from S. So, each part of the string must correspond to the sequence of productions.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The string starts with `t2`, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can directly produce 't2'?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, in the right-hand sides, I see several 't's. For example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, but also some rules produce 't0', 't1', 't2', etc. Let's list all the terminals and their possible sources.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't2' (rule 26: NT26 \u2192 't2')\n\nSo, NT26 directly produces 't2'. \n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't2'. So, in the derivation, the first step must replace some non-terminal that can produce 't2'. The possible non-terminals that can directly produce 't2' are those rules where RHS includes 't2' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n\nIs there any other rule that produces 't2' directly? Let me scan:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't5' (No)\n- NT99 \u2192 't5' (No)\n- NT38 \u2192 't3' (No)\n- NT74 \u2192 't3' (No)\n- etc.\n\nOnly NT26 \u2192 't2' is a rule that produces 't2'. So the first step in the derivation must be replacing NT26 with 't2'.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is 't2', so in the string, that's the first symbol, so perhaps the first non-terminal to replace is such that the first step gives 't2'. So, perhaps the initial S production must derive to start with something that can become 't2' after expanding.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nSo, S splits into NT68 and NT63. Therefore, the first expansion is NT68 and NT63. But NT68 could produce a sequence, and similarly for NT63. So in the string, the first two symbols should correspond to the sequence derived from NT68 and NT63.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Because in a leftmost derivation, we process the leftmost non-terminal first. So, after S \u2192 NT68 NT63, we first replace NT68, then NT63, or wait, no: in a leftmost approach, at each step, you replace the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nBut actually, in the initial step, we replace S. So S becomes NT68 NT63. So the string starts with the symbols derived from NT68 followed by those from NT63. So the first part of the string is from NT68, then the next part is from NT63.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is 't2', which is the output of NT26, but how does that tie into S? Because S starts with NT68 NT63, so the first expansion is NT68 and NT63. Therefore, the first symbol must come from NT68.\n\nBut wait, NT68 is involved in the production? Let me check the grammar rules for NT68:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any production for NT68 except perhaps one. Wait, the initial S production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So, in the grammar, NT68 is a non-terminal, but are there any other production rules where NT68 appears on the left-hand side? Looking at the rules, perhaps not. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking for rules where the RHS includes NT68.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT68 only appears on the left of the initial S production, not on the right. So, the only rule with NT68 is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Therefore, NT68 can only be derived from S, or perhaps it can be a leaf node if it appears in another production.\n\nWait, but if NT68 doesn't have any production to the right (other than in S), then in the grammar, NT68 is a leaf node that can only be replaced by a terminal. But looking through the rules, do any of the RHSs include NT68 except for S?\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any other production with NT68 on the RHS, except possibly one. Wait, looking at all the rules again:\n\nLooking at rule numbers and the right-hand sides.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Rule 9: NT38 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the production rules again to find if any non-terminals have multiple RHSs.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT68: is there any production for NT68 besides S \u2192 NT68 NT63?\n\nLooking through the entire list, I don't see any rules where the LHS is NT68 other than the S production. Therefore, NT68 can only be a leaf node, i.e., it's derived to a terminal symbol. But wait, does any rule have NT68 as the only non-terminal on the RHS? Because if so, then NT68 can only produce a terminal.\n\nBut in the rules, for example, NT68 is in S's production, but is there a rule where NT68 is on the RHS by itself? Like NT68 \u2192 something?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNo, it seems that NT68 only appears in the S production. So, the only way NT68 can produce a terminal is if it can be derived from itself, which isn't allowed in a context-free grammar unless it's an epsilon production, which it's not here.\n\nWait, but that can't be. That would mean that NT68 can't produce any terminal, which would make S stuck because in S \u2192 NT68 NT63, both would need to be terminals, but NT68 isn't a terminal. So, in that case, the grammar wouldn't generate any string because you can't derive a terminal string from NT68 and NT63. But that's a big issue, probably meaning that the grammar is invalid or can't generate any string, but that can't be true because the problem gives a specific string to check.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me go through each production rule to see if any rule has NT68 as the only non-terminal on the RHS.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\n1. S -> NT68 NT63\n2. S -> NT64 NT78\n3. NT62 -> NT48 NT0\n4. NT81 -> NT78 NT97\n5. NT47 -> NT85 NT13\n... and so on. It seems that NT68 only appears in rule 1 with S.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-852","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar consists of several production rules, and I have a string composed of tokens separated by spaces. The tokens include 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', and some numbers like 17, 18, etc. Each of these must come from the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form looks like. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol expands into two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. The grammar provided fits this since all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of tokens: t4 t3 t5 t1 t5 t4 t2 t1 t5 t3 t4 t3 t2 t2 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t0 t2 t5 t4 t5 t2 t1 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t1 t0 t3 t2 t5 t1 t1 t0 t5 t0 t3 t3. That's a lot of tokens, so the derivation tree could be deep but manageable.\n\nI should start by trying to match the entire string starting from the top symbol S. The initial rule is S -> NT68 NT63. So the first two tokens must come from NT68 and NT63. Let me check the starting tokens: the first two tokens are t4 t3. So according to the right-hand side, NT68 should produce t4 and NT63 should produce t3. Do these correspond to any production rules?\n\nLooking at NT68, in the grammar, NT68 is actually a terminal symbol 't3' because in the provided rules, NT68 -> 't3'. Similarly, NT63 is another terminal 't3' as per NT63 -> 't3'. Wait, but the first token is t4, which doesn't match NT68. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the initial step is not correct, but wait, perhaps NT68 produces t4 somehow. Wait, no. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT68 -> 't3', so the first production from S would produce 't3 t3', but the string starts with 't4'. That seems like a problem. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, let me parse the string correctly. The string is \"t4 t3 t5 t1 t5 t4 t2 t1 t5 t3 t4 t3 t2 t2 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t0 t2 t5 t4 t5 t2 t1 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t1 t0 t3 t2 t5 t1 t1 t0 t5 t0 t3 t3\".\n\nSo the first token is t4. The initial step of the grammar is S -> NT68 NT63, which expands to t3 t3. So the string starts with t4, which doesn't match. That would mean the string is not generated by the grammar since the first token doesn't come from the start symbol.\n\nWait, am I missing something? Let me confirm. NT68 -> 't3' and NT63 -> 't3' because in the provided rules, I see NT63 -> 't3'. So the initial S -> NT68 NT63 would produce 't3 t3', not 't4 t3'. So the first token in the string is t4, which is not possible.\n\nBut maybe I've made a mistake in understanding the rules. Let me check the rules again. Yes, NS68 is written as NT68 -> 't3', and NT63 is written as NT63 -> 't3'. So the first two symbols should be t3 and t3, but the string starts with t4, which doesn't match. Therefore, the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the string. Let me check again. The string is:\n\nt4 t3 t5 t1 t5 t4 t2 t1 t5 t3 t4 t3 t2 t2 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t0 t2 t5 t4 t5 t2 t1 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t1 t0 t3 t2 t5 t1 t1 t0 t5 t0 t3 t3.\n\nYes, the very first token is t4. Since the initial production is NT68 NT63 producing 't3 t3', the first token should be t3, not t4.

{"custom_id":"request-864","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means that all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and S has two production rules: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, the string I'm given starts with 't0', which is an terminals. I need to see if these t's can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, there are other non-terminals as well, like NT62, NT68, etc. Each of these seems to have their own production rules. For example, NT68 seems to produce several combinations, one of which is 't3'. Wait, looking at NT68, one of its rules is NT68 \u2192 't3', right? So if I see 't3' in the string, that could come directly from NT68.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the first 't0' is from NT68 \u2192 't3'\u2014no, actually, NT68 can produce 't3', but in the string, it's 't0'. Hmm. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT68, one of them is NT68 \u2192 't3'. So if the string starts with 't0', that must come from some other rule. Let me check NT63, which is part of the initial S rule.\n\nLooking at NT63, its production rules include NT63 \u2192 't1', NT84 NT62, etc. Wait, the initial S is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so the string starts with 't0' (from NT68) and 't1' (from NT68 producing 't1')? Wait, no, NT68 produces 't3', but the string begins with 't0'. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the first part of the string is t0 t1 t1 t2 t0 t4 t5 t1... So the first symbol is t0, which would have to come from either NT68 or NT63. Let me check NT63's rules. Looking at NT63, one of the rules is NT63 \u2192 't1', another is NT84 NT62, etc. So NT63 can produce 't1' or other combinations. Similarly, NT68 can produce 't3', but in this case, we have 't0'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the initial production rules again. S can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So the first part of the string is 't0' followed by 't1', which suggests that t0 comes from NT68 and 't1' comes from NT63.\n\nLooking back, NT68 can produce 't3' or combinations, but t0 isn't directly in NT68's productions. Wait, let me check NT68's productions properly. Looking at NT68, one of the rules is NT68 \u2192 't3', but where does 't0' come from? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check NT68's production rules again.\n\nLooking through the NT68 productions: I don't see 't0', but there's another rule NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT81. Could 't0' come from NT66 or NT81? Let's see: NT66 has a production rule that includes 't2' and 't3's, and NT81 can produce 't2' or 't3's.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complex. Maybe I should try breaking down the entire string step by step, seeing how each token can be generated from the grammar. Starting from S, which can be NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nThe string starts with t0, so let's assume that comes from NT68. If NT68 \u2192 't3', that would give us t3, but the string starts with t0. Alternatively, maybe there's another rule for NT68 that I missed. Let me recheck: NT68's rules include NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT81, which could derive other symbols, but does it produce t0 otherwise? Looking at the rules provided, no, NT68 doesn't have a production that directly yields t0. So maybe t0 comes from NT68 via some other path? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial part.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the initial 't0' comes from NT63. Let me see NT63's rules. NT63 can produce 't1', which is the case here (the first symbol is t0? Wait, no, the string starts with t0. Wait, let me make sure I'm not confused. The string is: t0 t1 t1 t2 t0 t4 t5 t1 t1 t0 t0 t1 t2 t5 t2 t3 t4 t4 t3 t1 t0 t4 t4 t1 t5 t2 t4 t2 t0 t5 t1 t3 t5 t4 t0 t3 t3 t2 t4 t0 t4 t4 t0 t4 t0 t1.\n\nWait, that's t0 as the first symbol. So the first symbol is t0. Looking at NT63's rules, can it produce t0? Let's check:\n\nLooking through NT63's production rules: NT63 \u2192 't1', but I don't see any rule that produces t0. So if NT63 can't produce t0, then perhaps the first symbol must come from NT68. But NT68 doesn't have a production for t0. So is this possible? Or maybe I made a mistake in identifying which non-terminal the symbol comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the string starts with t0, which could come directly from a non-terminal that has production t0. Let's check the given rules. Looking for any NT that produce 't0':\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that NT66 has a production \u2192 t0, but wait no, checking: NT66's rule is 't2' and 't3's. Wait, no, looking again: the rules for NT66 include NT66 \u2192 NT42 NT69 and 't2'. So NT66 can produce 't2' but not 't0'. What about NT84? Let me check NT84's rules. NT84 \u2192 t3 and others, but not t0. Wait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT66 has NT66 \u2192 't2'\n- NT82 has NT82 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait wait, I think I missed NT82 in my initial scan. Let me check the production rules again carefully.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9, NT64 NT9, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the production rules that produce terminals. Let me compile a list:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't2' (multiple times)\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' (multiple times)\n- NT63 \u2192 't1' (once)\n- NT84 \u2192 't3' (multiple)\n- NT99 \u2192 't5' (multiple)\n- NT26 \u2192 't1' (multiple)\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4' (multiple)\n- NT85 \u2192 't2' (multiple)\n- NT19 \u2192 't5' (multiple)\n- NT25 \u2192 't3' (multiple)\n- NT27 \u2192 't5' (multiple)\n- NT35 \u2192 't5' (multiple)\n- NT45 \u2192 't5' (multiple)\n- NT37 \u2192 't5' (multiple)\n- NT39 \u2192 't0' (once)\nAh, here we go! So NT39 \u2192 't0'. Okay, so if a non-terminal can produce 't0', it's NT39.\n\nSo, in the string, we have the first symbol as 't0', which must come from NT39 \u2192 't0'. Now, how do we get the next symbols?\n\nWait, but in the production, NT39 is derived from what? Looking at NT39's rule: it's only \u2192 't0' at the top level? Or does it have any other production? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see NT39 having any production besides NT39 \u2192 't0'. So NT39 can only produce 't0'. But in the string, after 't0' comes 't1'. That's a problem because NT39 can't produce 't1'. Therefore, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's think again. The string starts with 't0 t1 t1...'. So to get 't1' after 't0', maybe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of symbols ending with specific markers (t0, t1, etc.), and the grammar has a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The provided grammar consists of multiple rules where non-terminals transform into other non-terminals or terminals. Some of these are in the form of A \u2192 a, like NT85 \u2192 t2, which seem to be the terminal symbols. Others are of the form A \u2192 BC or similar.\n\nThe target string is:\n\nt5 t0 t2 t0 t5 t3 t3 t1 t5 t3 t5 t0 t3 t0 t0 t5 t1 t4 t0 t2 t2 t5 t5 t3 t2 t5 t0 t4 t4 t2 t4 t3 t3 t0 t4 t1 t1 t1 t3 t1 t4 t4 t5 t5 t0 t2 t4.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the process might involve breaking down the string into the allowed non-terminals step by step, perhaps using a method similar to expanding the grammar into a parse tree.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, it's going to be challenging. I'm thinking of maybe applying the concept of the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing strings according to context-free grammars. However, since the grammar is large, setting that up manually would be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reconstruct a possible derivation by starting from the start symbol S and expanding it, seeing if I can reach the string step by step. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar can produce either NT68 NT63. So, S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t5 and t0. Wait, but how do the start symbols relate to those terminals? Let me check:\n\n- NT68 and NT63. Looking at the production rules for NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT81 NT8. Wait, no.

Let me check:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT68 is defined as:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT81 NT8\nWait, no, let me check properly:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT68: NT68 \u2192 NT81 NT8\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me find NT68:\n\nFrom the provided list:\n\nNT68: NT68 \u2192 NT86 NT4\n\nWait, no, actually I need to go line by line.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT81 NT8 (Wait, no, that's not in the provided list.)\n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules:\n\nI think I've got the list. Let me find NT68 and NT63.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nLooking for what NT68 produces:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT86 is a production (I'm not sure), but NT68 is in the provided list.\n\nWait, let me list all the rules for each NT.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n1. S -> NT68 NT63\n\n2. S -> NT64 NT78\n\n...\n\nLooking for all entries for NT68:\n\nWait, actually, it's easier to find the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nLooking through each line, for NT68:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT81 NT8 (I don't think any, though...)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not looking correctly.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nLooking through each line, let me see:\n\n- NT68 is probably involved in some production, so I'll scan all lines for NT68 as the left side.\n\nWait, scanning all lines:\n\nNo, the list is a long one. Let me try to find NT68 and NT63.\n\nI see:\n\nNT38 has several productions, but that's a different NT.\n\nWait, perhaps looking through each production:\n\nFor NT68:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nOther lines: NT68 is the left side in this line:\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT68. Let me check the entire list.\n\nLooking for NT68:\n\nYes, here:\n\nLine 22: NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nLine 34: NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49\n\nLine 36: NT38 \u2192 NT85 NT81\n\nLine 38: NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13\n\nLine 40: NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49\n\nI think I might have missed NT68. Let me go through each production:\n\nNo, in the given list, NT68 only appears on the left side of S in the first rule, so S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nThus, S can directly produce NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, the string starts with t5 t0. So, in the first step, S produces NT68 NT63. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to expand further.\n\nLooking at NT68 and NT63:\n\nStarting with NT68. Does NT68 produce something that can lead to t5 or t0?\n\nLooking through NT68's productions. Wait, the initial line S \u2192 NT68 NT63 means that NT68 and NT63 together produce the two symbols after S. But in our string, the first two symbols are t5 and t0. So perhaps NT68 produces t5 and t0.\n\nLooking through the productions for NT68:\n\nLooking through each line where NT68 is on the left.\n\nWait, let me look for lines starting with NT68:\n\nNT68: ... ?\n\nWait, the provided list of productions is for NTs, but I don't see NT68 as a left-hand side except in S's rule. So maybe NT68 has some production rules. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, NT68 only appears in the S rule as S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and nowhere else. That means NT68 is a terminal symbol? But that can't be because, in standard notation, NTs are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo, but likely, NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals with their own production rules.\n\nWait, this might be a miscalculation. Let me re-examine the provided grammar.\n\nIn the given grammar:\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar for other NT68 and NT63 rules. I see that NT68 and NT63 have no other rules, which is unusual because non-terminals in a context-free grammar need to have at least one production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking for NT68 in the entire list:\n\nLooking at each line, starting from the beginning:\n\n1. S -> NT68 NT63\n\nSo, S expands to NT68 NT63. Then, perhaps NT68 and NT63 each have their own productions.\n\nNow, I'll check all NT68 rules:\n\nLooking at all lines for NT68 as LHS.\n\nFrom the list, only the first line is NT68 in LHS. So NT68 has only one production: S.\n\nWait, that can't be, because then it's a terminal. But perhaps NT68 leads to something. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar was incorrectly input.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, and NT68 and NT63 have more rules. Alternatively, it's possible that I was given a corrupted or improperly formatted grammar. However, assuming it's correct, perhaps S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and NT68 and NT63 have other productions.\n\nBut looking through the list again, I don't see NT68 or NT63 appearing as LHS anywhere else. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63 is the only rule involving them. So their productions are undefined except for what they produce.\n\nWait, maybe NT68 and NT63 are treated as terminals. In that case, their only expansion is themselves, but that would cause the string to end up as such.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of 't' symbols. So it's clear that NT68 and NT63 must expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I need to find production rules for NT68 and NT63 that result in the relevant terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I don't see any production rules for NT68 or NT63 except that they appear in S's production. So unless there's a mistake in the provided grammar, this might complicate the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the grammar includes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-885","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of 't's and numbers, which I assume are terminals representing specific operations or tokens. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure. The grammar consists of non-terminals (NTs) and terminals. The terminals are represented by 't' followed by a number, like t0, t1, etc. Non-terminals are all the other symbols, which can be rewritten into other symbols until they become terminals.\n\nThe starting symbol of the grammar is S. The production rules for S are:\n- S -> NT68 NT63\n- S -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo to generate a string, S must first split into either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. \n\nNext, I need to see the provided string: `t5 t3 t5 t0 t3 t1 t3 t2 t3 t0 t5 t1 t1 t3 t0 t5 t5 t3 t1 t4 t4 t1 t0 t2 t1 t1 t4 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t0 t5 t5 t5 t1 t5 t3 t5 t1 t4 t0 t3 t3 t2 t3`.\n\nI notice that the string is a list of terminals, but I need to map each token to a non-terminal that can produce it. For example, 't5' would come from a non-terminal that has a production ending with 't5'. Looking at the provided grammar, most non-terminals end with specific terminals. \n\nLooking at the non-terminals, some of them produce terminals. For instance, NT68 -> 't3', NT63 -> 't3', but wait, the production rules for NT68 and NT63 might not end with 't'. Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can see some non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT63 -> 't3'\n- NT2 -> 't3'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT1 -> 't4'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT65 -> 't5'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT2 -> 't3'\n- NT72 -> 't0'\n- NT33 -> 't2'\n- NT69 -> 't0'\n- NT94 -> 't2'\n- NT45 -> 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't47' Wait, no, NT0's production ends with 't47' or some other? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\nNT0 -> NT48 NT47.\n\nSo NT0 doesn't produce a terminal directly. But NT47 has several productions that might lead to terminals. For example:\n\nNT47 has:\n- NT47 -> NT28 NT22\n- NT47 -> NT0 NT52\n- NT47 -> NT65 NT49\n- NT47 -> NT28 NT22 (same as first)\n- NT47 -> NT0 NT52 (same as second)\n- NT47 -> NT22 NT24\n\nWait, so NT47 might produce a terminal if some of the subsequent non-terminals do. But let me see: NT28 -> 't1', NT24 -> 't1', but not directly yielding a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string backward, using the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar might be a bit complex, perhaps I can find a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for patterns in the string. The string starts with 't5 t3 t5 t0'. Let me see if any non-terminals produce 't5' followed by 't3' and 't0'. For instance, looking for NT sequences that can produce these in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string represents a sequence of productions starting from S. Each step in the production rules would generate a pair of symbols, which can either be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long (42 tokens), I need to find a way to parse it step by step. However, doing a full parse manually would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a specific path in the grammar that matches the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first four symbols are 't5 t3 t5 t0'. Let's see where these sequences can come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that 't0' comes from several non-terminals:\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT63 -> t3\n- NT65 -> t5\n- NT0 -> t47\nNo, wait, NT68 ends with 't3', not 't0'. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see that 't0' comes from NT72 (NT72 -> 't0'), NT33 (NT33 -> 't2'), NT69 (NT69 -> 't0'), and NT97 (NT97 -> 't5').\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all non-terminals that directly produce 't0' or 't3' or 't5' or other terminals.\n\nWait, I think a better approach is to look for the productions that generate the terminals and see how they can chain together.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt5 t3 t5 t0 t3 t1 t3 t2 t3 t0 t5 t1 t1 t3 t0 t5 t5 t3 t1 t4 t4 t1 t0 t2 t1 t1 t4 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t0 t5 t5 t5 t1 t5 t3 t5 t1 t4 t0 t3 t3 t2 t3.\n\nThat's 42 symbols. Since it's built by starting from S and expanding, each step should produce two non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually is error-prone. Maybe I can find a section that's problematic.\n\nFor example, at the beginning: t5 t3 t5 t0.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that produces t5. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't5':\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT99 -> 't5'\n- NT75 -> 't3'\n- NT74 -> 't3'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT77 -> 't3'\n- NT69 -> 't0' (no, that's 't0')\nWait, perhaps I should go through each rule and see which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT63 -> 't3'\nNT2 -> 't3'\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT18 -> 't5'\nNT38 -> 't5' (multiple times)\nNT48 -> 't3'\nNT47 -> produces various non-terminals, none directly producing a terminal.\nWait, some non-terminals may have rules that lead to terminals eventually, but perhaps the string is such that some production paths don't terminate, leading to non-terminal symbols remaining that shouldn't be there, making the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a point where a 't5' is supposed to come from a certain non-terminal, but the grammar doesn't allow that.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the string, at position 0, it's 't5', which is generated by NT99, 27, 74, etc. But is there a way to have NT99 appear?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I don't see any production that starts with NT99 except NT99 itself. So NT99 can only be expanded into 't5' and nothing else. So if the string starts with 't5', that would correspond to NT99 producing 't5'.\n\nBut then, what comes after that? After 't5', the next is 't3', which is from NT68 or NT63 or NT2. Let's say we have NT99 -> 't5', which consumes the first symbol. Then, assuming NT99's production is only 't5', which would leave the next symbol as 't3', which must come from another non-terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, how can we produce 't5' followed by 't3'? Maybe NT99 is followed by another non-terminal that produces 't3'. But looking at the grammar, the first symbol is S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nSo the root is S, which splits into two non-terminals. So the string should be a series of pairs of symbols, each pair coming from a production rule that splits a non-terminal into two others, until all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the count is 42 symbols, which would require 21 pairs. Each pair is a split from a non-terminal into two non-terminals, until the non-terminals are terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, perhaps at some point, there's a symbol that cannot be the result of any required split.

{"custom_id":"request-909","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it looks like all the productions are in CNF because each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either another non-terminal or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string we need to check is: `t0 t5 t0 t5 t2 t0 t0 t2 t3 t5 t3 t2 t1 t2 t4 t4 t4 t2 t0 t3 t1 t0 t5 t1 t5 t1 t2 t1 t4 t1 t1 t3 t2 t0 t2 t5 t1 t3 t1 t5 t1 t2 t0 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4`\n\nI notice that 't's are terminals, and the rest are non-terminals that eventually reduce to terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, parsing the string can be done with the CYK algorithm, which efficiently checks membership in a grammar.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell [i,j] represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j. We start by initializing the table and then iteratively fill it for substrings of increasing lengths.\n\nFirst, I'll list the string with indices to see the structure:\n\nIndices: 0:t0, 1:t5, 2:t0, 3:t5, 4:t2, 5:t0, 6:t0, 7:t2, 8:t3, 9:t5, 10:t3, 11:t2, 12:t1, 13:t2, 14:t4, 15:t4, 16:t4, 17:t2, 18:t0, 19:t3, 20:t1, 21:t0, 22:t5, 23:t1, 24:t5, 25:t1, 26:t2, 27:t1, 28:t4, 29:t1, 30:t1, 31:t3, 32:t2, 33:t0, 34:t2, 35:t5, 36:t1, 37:t3, 38:t1, 39:t5, 40:t1, 41:t2, 42:t0, 43:t3, 44:t5, 45:t5, 46:t0, 47:t4.\n\nThe length of the string is 48, so the CYK table will have 48 rows and 48 columns.

Let me list out the productions to see if there's a pattern or something that stands out. The start symbol is S, and the initial productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT68 or NT64, followed by NT63 or NT78, respectively.

Hmm, not a terminal yet.\n\nWait, let me go through the rules one by one.\n\nStarting from the top, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT68 expanding into t3 or NT64 expanding into t3? Wait, looking at the start of the string, the first token is t2. Hmm, that doesn't match because both S options start with NT68 (t3) or NT64 (t3), but the string starts with t2, so something's wrong here. Or maybe there's another production for the starting NT that leads to t2.\n\nWait, wait, the initial start symbol S is either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. But if neither of those leads to t2, then the string can't start with t2 unless there's a different path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NT transitions. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT2 \u2192 t5, but in the grammar, is there an NT2 production? Let me see the rules.\n\nYes, here's a line: NT2 \u2192 t5. So NT2 produces 't5'. But in the string, there's a 't2' at the beginning. Hmm, but the start symbol S doesn't directly produce t2. So perhaps there's a non-terminal that produces t2, and a path that goes into S.\n\nWait, but looking at the initial productions, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So whatever S produces must come from NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. So if the string starts with t2, I need to see if NT68 or NT64 can lead to a token that starts with t2.\n\nBut wait, based on the rules, NT68 \u2192 t3, and NT64 \u2192 t3. So how can there be a t2 at the beginning? That suggests that maybe my initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing some rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, perhaps there are other rules I haven't considered. Let me check all the NT rules.\n\nScanning through the rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT5 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t3\n- NT7 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT10 \u2192 t5 (Wait, but in this grammar, there's no rule for NT10. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the lines, I see NT20 \u2192 t5, NT24 \u2192 t1, etc., but no NT18. Wait, do I have all the rules?

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal, and the start symbol is S. From the provided grammar, I see that S is expanded into NT68 and NT63. So any valid string has to start by producing S, which in turn requires NT68 and NT63, right?\n\nLet's look at the string. The first part is `t1 t4 ...` So we have t1 and then t4. Looking at the grammar productions, I need to see which NTs generate t1 and t4.\n\nFrom the NT productions, most seem to end with certain terminals.

Wait, no, the actual terminal for NT47 is 't1' as per the rule NT47 -> 't1'? No, wait, looking again, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions:\nNT47 has several productions:\n- NT47 -> NT85 NT13\n- NT47 -> NT28 NT22\n- NT47 also has -> 't1', but wait, no, no\u2014I think I need to check again.

{"custom_id":"request-931","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I\u2019ve got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It seems a bit complex with a lot of productions. Each symbol on the left side of the -> is a non-terminal, and the right side consists of terminal symbols (t's and numbers) and other non-terminals. My string to check is a sequence of these t's and numbers, so I\u2019ll need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nThe grammar is in CNF, which means each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, most of the productions are indeed of the form NTxy -> NTxz NTyz, but some also produce terminals. For example, NT62 -> NT39 NT97, and so on. Wait, no, some have more than two symbols on the right side. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking closer, in the grammar, most seem to be two non-terminals on the right except for some. For example, NT62 -> NT48 NT0. Wait, but 0 is a terminal? Hmm, but in CNF, productions should have at most two non-terminals. Here, 0 is a terminal, so that's okay because in CNF, you can have productions that produce a terminal and a non-terminal as well. So, S -> NT68 NT63, right? So the string starts with t3 and ends with t4. Wait, let me check the string again.\n\nThe string is: t3 t3 t1 t1 t1 t5 t1 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t0 t2 t3 t0 t2 t0 t2 t3 t5 t5 t3 t2 t3 t0 t1 t3 t4 t4 t1 t3 t5 t1 t0 t2 t0 t5 t5 t5 t4 t2 t1 t2.\n\nSo, first I need to see if the start symbol S can generate this string. Let me start by looking for the start symbol S. The productions S -> NT68 NT63 and S -> NT64 NT78 seem to be the only ones. So, the initial step would be to produce either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t3 and t3. So, let's see what the productions of NT68 and NT63 produce. Let me check the grammar for NT68 and NT63.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT68 -> NT98 NT0\nNT0 -> NT48 NT47\n\nWait, that's two non-terminals, so NT68 produces NT98 and NT0. Then, NT98 -> NT58 NT65, and NT65 can produce terminal 't5' or another non-terminal? Wait, looking at NT65: NT65 -> NT97 NT62. Hmm, both are non-terminals. Wait, but NT97 is a production that ends with 't5' as per the table. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this recursively. Let me break down the string and see if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut this seems quite involved. Maybe a better approach is to see if the grammar can produce a string that matches the given sequence by following the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using dynamic programming to check if the string can be parsed according to the grammar, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can construct a parse tree and see if it matches.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production in CNF only produces at most two non-terminals, so the depth of the parse tree is proportional to the length of the string. Let me try to see if the string can be built up using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S:\n\nS can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLet's take the first possibility: NT68 and NT63.\n\nNT68's production is NT98 NT0. Let's see what NT98 and NT0 produce.\n\nNT98 -> NT58 NT65.\n\nNT58's production is NT18 NT8, wait no\u2014Looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT58 is under NT18: NT18 -> NT50 NT38. Hmm, maybe I got confused. Let me look up all productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, I should create a list for each non-terminal to see their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write down the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT68 -> NT98 NT0\nNT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nSo, from S, we get NT68 and NT63. Let's see what comes next.\n\nThe string starts with t3 t3... So the first part is NT68 produces something that starts with t3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find what NT68 and NT63 produce in terms of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recursive nature makes it easier to see.\n\nLet me pick the first possibility: S uses S->NT68 NT63.\n\nSo, NT68 produces NT98 NT0, and NT63 produces NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals will be broken down further.\n\nFor NT98, it has productions like NT58 -> NT18 NT8, but let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT98 -> NT58 NT65\n\nNT58 -> NT18 NT8.\n\nWait, wait, let me look: NT58 is under NT18's productions? No, I think NT58's production is:\n\nLooking at the grammar, let me list each:\n\nNT68 -> NT98 NT0\n\nNT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT62 -> NT39 NT97\n\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14\n\nNT19 -> NT1 NT66\n\nNT67 -> NT2 NT20\n\nNT48 -> NT1 NT78\n\nNT75 -> 't0'  -- this is a terminal production.\n\nWait, some of these non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT75->t0, meaning when a non-terminal NT75 is processed, the string 't0' is added.\n\nBut earlier, in NT68, we have NT98 NT0. Let's see NT98's production.\n\nNT98 -> NT58 NT65\n\nNT58-> NT18 NT8\n\nNT18-> NT67 NT20\n\nNT20 -> NT74 NT94\n\nLet's break this down further:\n\nNT20 -> NT74 NT94\n\nNT74 -> NT0 NT50\n\nNT0 -> NT48 NT47\n\nNT48 -> NT1 NT78\n\nWait, this seems to get complicated. Let me try to see if any paths can produce the t3's in the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with two t3's. Let's think about what NT68 produces. From NT68: NT98 and NT0.\n\nLooking at NT98: it's NT58 NT65.\n\nNT58 is NT18 NT8.\n\nNT18 is NT67 NT20.\n\nNT67 is NT2 NT20.\n\nNT20 is NT74 NT94.\n\nNT74 is NT0 NT50.\n\nNT0 is NT48 NT47.\n\nLooking at these, perhaps there's a way to produce a t3.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any path that leads to a terminal 't3'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that some NT productions produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT26 -> 't2', NT77->t3, etc.\n\nWait, looking back at the production for NT77: NT77-> 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, NT44-> 't5'; NT27->'t5'; NT73? Wait, I don't see that, but the key is, I need to find in the derivation for the given string any spot where a terminal t3 is produced.\n\nLooking at the given string: after several t3's, t1, etc.\n\nWait, maybe when NT77->t3 is used, that could account for a t3.\n\nBut let me try to see if I can have a t3 in the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with S->NT64 NT78, as the first option.\n\nLet me try this approach: S->NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 is produced by NT60 NT14.\n\nNT14 is under 'NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98'.\n\nSo NT14: NT1 produces t3, and NT98 produces...

{"custom_id":"request-953","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar has production rules where each non-terminal can produce two other non-terminals, and some symbols represent terminal characters, which are here mapped to specific 't' followed by a number, like 't0', 't1', etc. My goal is to see if the string can be generated by the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which can only go to NT68 NT63. So the first two symbols should be 't3' (since NT68 -> 't3') and 't2' (since NT63 -> 't2'). Looking at the string, the first two tokens are 't1' and 't2', which don't match. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the mappings again. Oh no, I see that NT63 isn't 't2'. Looking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT63 is mapped to 't2' in one rule, but others might have different mappings. Wait, let me list the terminal rules carefully.\n\nLooking through the provided mappings, I see:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nSo the first step is S -> NT68 NT63, which gives 't3 t2' as the first two symbols.\n\nBut the string starts with 't1 t2', which doesn't match. So that means the string can't start with S directly. But maybe the grammar allows for some non-terminal productions elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar has more than one production for S, but in the provided context, I see only S -> NT68 NT63 and S -> NT64 NT78. So the first two symbols must be one of these pairs.\n\nLooking at the string, starts with t1, so let's see what could produce 't1'. Looking at the terminal mappings, I see NT2 -> 't3', NT12 -> 't5', NT49 -> 't1', and NT84 -> 't4'.\n\nWait, maybe a non-terminal other than S could start with 't1'. For example, looking at the grammar, maybe NT67 -> 't2', NT58 -> 't3', NT72 -> 't0', NT94 -> 't1'. Oh, wait, yes! NT94 can produce 't1'. So maybe at some point in the derivation, a production like NT94 is used.\n\nBut for the string to start with 't1 t2 t2 t0', let's see what could generate that.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't1', which could be from NT94. Then the second symbol is 't2' from NT49 perhaps. But wait, looking at the grammar, NT94 is part of a production: NT94 -> NT75 NT49. So to get 't1', perhaps it's NT94, then to get 't2', we might need another NT.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently. Maybe it's better to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals, and the string is made of terminals, so the parse tree would be a binary tree with leaves as terminals.\n\nBut manually parsing a string of 40 symbols would be tedious. Instead, perhaps I can check if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nWait, from the start symbol S, the first split is into two non-terminals. Given that the string starts with 't1', maybe one of these non-terminals can produce 't1' in some way.\n\nLooking at the terminal mappings, the key NT that can produce 't1' is NT94. So that could mean that the first rule used is N T94 -> 't1' followed by something else. But in Chomsky normal form, each node is a production of two non-terminals, so the entire string must be built by expanding these.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the string starts with 't1', the first production must involve a non-terminal that can eventually derive 't1'. So perhaps one of the non-terminals in the left-hand side of the start symbol's productions leads to 't1 t2 ...'.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S must split into two non-terminals, which then expand further. So maybe the first two symbols of the string are from the two non-terminals derived from S.\n\nWait, S can be either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nIf S is NT68 NT63, the first two symbols should be 't3' and 't2'. But the string starts with 't1 t2', which doesn't match. So that can't be the case. Therefore, the only other option is S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me check what NT64 and NT78 produce. From the terminal mappings:\n\nNT64 -> 't6'? Wait, no, looking through the mappings, I see:\n\nLooking for NT64, no direct terminal mapping. Hmm, maybe I've misremembered. Wait, in the provided mappings, the first list starts with S producing NT68 and NT63. Then other NTs have mappings.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal productions to better understand.\n\nWait, looking through the provided list:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT64 -> 't' something? Let me check each line.\n\nLooking for any NT that has a terminal production, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't2'\n\nWait, but some lines have NT39 -> 't0', NT47 -> 't5', NT81 -> 't3', etc. Wait, actually, the 't' terminals are given as:\n\nt0: NT26, NT75, NT18, etc.\n\nt1: NT2, NT49, NT74, NT94\n\nt2: NT3, NT63, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each terminal production:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n\n- NT75 -> 't1'\n\n- NT94 -> 't1'\n\n- NT49 -> 't1'\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused because some lines have the same NT pointing to different terminals. Let me look again.\n\nAh, I see that NT94 has two productions: NT94 -> NT75 NT49 and NT94 -> NT18 NT8.\n\nWait, no, the provided grammar is in the form of rules like NT68 -> NT68 NT63 and others. Let me try to list all the direct terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the provided list:\n\n- NT26 -> 't2' (two times)\n\n- NT75 -> 't1'\n\n- NT94 -> 't1' (from NT94 -> NT75 NT49?)\n\nWait, no, in the list, NT94 is produced as NT94 -> 't1'? Or is it a production that leads to a terminal?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT26: 't2' and 't2' in different rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the entire list to see which NT directly map to terminals:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n\n- NT62 -> 't2'\n\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n\n- NT39 -> 't0'\n\n- NT97 -> 't5'\n\n- NT33 -> 't0'\n\n- NT94 -> 't1'\n\n- NT18 -> 't1' (twice)\n\n- NT58 -> 't3'\n\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n\n- NT39 -> 't0'\n\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding; the grammar is given in the form of S \u2192 NT1 NT2 etc. So some non-terminals expand into two other non-terminals, while others directly expand into terminals.\n\nWait, I think the way it's presented, each line is a production, so some non-terminals produce two non-terminals (e.g., S \u2192 NT68 NT63), but for other non-terminals, like NT62, it's NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which are again non-terminals, and so on, until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I can also see direct terminals:\n\nFor example, NT94 -> 't1', NT49 -> 't1', NT18 -> 't1', etc.\n\nSo in the grammar, for some NTs, the production is just a terminal and a number, but I think that indicates an error because in Chomsky normal form, all productions must be non-terminals expanding into two non-terminals, except for the terminals which are atomic.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. Chomsky normal form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base case where a non-terminal can produce a single terminal symbol.

So, the task is to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string given is:\n\nt5 t5 t2 t3 t0 t4 t2 t1 t3 t3 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t0 t3 t5 t0 t2 t3 t4 t1 t1 t1 t5 t3 t2 t2 t4 t4 t4 t4 t2 t1 t0 t3 t3 t2 t2 t1 t4 t0 t2 t2 t1 t3 t5 t1\n\nHmm, that's quite a long string. First, I need to understand the grammar's rules to see how it can generate this string. Let me list out the production rules again to get a clear picture.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that the start symbol is S, which expands to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. These seem to be non-terminals that further expand into other non-terminals or terminals. The non-terminals eventually lead to terminals like t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, and t5. Each non-terminal has specific productions that connect them to specific terminals.\n\nSince each production is in Chomsky normal form, each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t5 t5... which suggests that the first step is to expand S to either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Both NT68 and NT64 have productions that lead to t3 or t5, respectively. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking up NT68: it has a production NT68 \u2192 NT63 and NT68 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT64 \u2192 NT60 and NT64 \u2192 't4'. NT60 has a production NT60 \u2192 't5'. So, if S expands to NT68 NT64, then NT68 would produce 't5' (from NT63 later or 't3', but wait, I'm confused.\n\nHold on, maybe I should map out the possible paths. Let me try to see how S can generate a mix of t's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to trace the steps systematically. Let's think about each production:\n\nStart: S can go to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 can go to NT63 or 't3'. NT63 goes to NT84 NT62. Let's pick NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Now NT84 \u2192 NT81 and NT84 \u2192 't4'. Let's choose NT84 \u2192 't4'. So now we have 't4' and NT62. NT62 can go to NT39 or 't2'. Let's pick NT62 \u2192 't2'. So now the sequence is 't4 t2'.\n\nNext, NT81 (from NT84) goes to NT78 NT97. NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66. Let's choose NT78 \u2192 NT33, and NT66 \u2192 't3'. So 't3' is added. Now we have 't4 t2 t3'.\n\nContinuing, NT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94. NT13 \u2192 't3', NT94 \u2192 NT75. So 't3 t5'. Now the string is 't4 t2 t3 t4 t2 t3 t3 t5'.\n\nWait, this seems a bit arbitrary. Maybe a better approach is to see if the entire string can be constructed by tracing through the substitutions step by step. Alternatively, perhaps using memoization or a parsing algorithm like CYK could help, but given the time constraints, perhaps it's easier to look for patterns.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production leads to specific terminals. For example, NT68 can become 't3' or require further expansion, while NT64 can become 't4' or require more steps. The t's in the string seem to be a combination of t5, t5, t2... so perhaps the initial steps need to produce t5's.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. For example, NT69 \u2192 't2', NT38 \u2192 't3', NT47 can produce 't5', NT50 \u2192 't4', NT18 \u2192 't1', etc. Also, some non-terminals have multiple pathways: for instance, NT38 can go to 't3' or via NT12 and others.\n\nI think a potential way to approach this is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the possible terminal outputs from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent approach would help. Since each non-terminal can only expand in specific ways, maybe each part of the string can be matched by the productions.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, it's quite extensive, so manually tracing each step might not be practical. Instead, perhaps identifying patterns or specific segments that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother observation is that the grammar uses a mix of non-terminals that can lead to 't0', 't1', ..., 't5'. Since t's are the only terminals, the entire string is a sequence of these t's.\n\nWait, I might be overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the initial token in the string can be generated by any non-terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t5, t5, so perhaps the first two t5s. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't5'?\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't4', so not t5.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't5' is one. Also, from NT97 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps S can expand to NT68 NT63, and one of those could produce 't5'. Alternatively, NT68 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no, looking back, NT68 produces NT63 or remains 't3' if I remember correctly.\n\nWait, no, NT68: looking back, I think I might have miswritten. Looking at the top of the grammar:\n\nS->NT68 NT63\n\nNT68-> NT63\n\nNT68-> 't3'\n\nSo NT68 can become 't3' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT64 can become 't4'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't5', so perhaps that's generated from another non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT69 \u2192 't2', so that's not it. NT38 \u2192 't3', so no. NT47 can produce 't5', for example.\n\nNT47 can produce 't5' when it's the third production: either NT85 \u2192 't2' or NT18 \u2192 't1', etc. Wait, earlier I noticed NT47 has multiple production rules. Let me check NT47:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52\n\nWait, but in the earlier list, it was written as:\n\nNT47 -> NT85 NT13\n\nNT47 -> NT28 NT22\n\nNT47 -> NT0 NT52\n\nBut from the user's input, it's more detailed:\n\nNT47 is in the main grammar, but under grammar it shows multiple branches.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT47: \n- -> NT85 NT13\n- -> NT28 NT22\n- -> NT0 NT52\n\nAnd then a note that one of the productions is NT47 -> NT28 NT22 and another is NT47 -> NT0 NT52, which leads to producing t5? Or perhaps other terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the list, looking for which NT47 can produce 't5':\n\nSome NT47 branches go to NT85, which further can produce 't2' or other terms. Let's see if any path leads to t5.\n\nWait, maybe another non-terminal that can produce t5 is NT99 via NT33, which eventually becomes 't5'. Let's see NT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94, then NT13 \u2192 't3', NT94 \u2192 NT75, NT75 \u2192 't5', so NT33 leads to 't3 t5'.\n\nSo if NT33 is part of a substitution, it could produce 't5' as the terminal after 't3'. But then that would make a segment like 't3 t5'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the initial segments are 't5 t5 t2 t3...'.\n\nHmm, perhaps thinking recursively, can any non-terminal start with 't5'? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NT can produce 't5' directly?\n\n- NT47: has a production to '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-17","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t3 t4 t3\" can be generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of terminals and non-terminals, along with production rules. Here, the grammar is provided, and I see that there are a lot of productions, but I'm only dealing with the string \"t3 t4 t3\".\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking through the given grammar, it seems to follow this structure since every production on the left side seems to have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for some cases where terminals are present. Wait, actually, some productions have a single terminal, like S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is two non-terminals. Wait, no, S is a non-terminal that can produce NT68 followed by NT63, both non-terminals. So each production is either two non-terminals or, at the bottom level, a terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, many productions have a mix. For example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which is two non-terminals. But there's also NT38 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. So each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string we need to check is \"t3 t4 t3\". Let's see how each 't' can be generated.\n\nEach 't' is a terminal, so we'll need to find a production that directly produces that 't'. Let's look at the terminals and their corresponding productions:\n\n- From the grammar, I see:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't3'  \nNT44 \u2192 't5'  \nWait, not t4. Hmm. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't3'  \nAnd then other terminals:\nLook for NT that go to 't4'. Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\nIs there any NT that produces 't4'? Let's go through the rules:\n\nLooking at the provided list:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'  \n- NT38 \u2192 't3'  \n- NT3 \u2192 't4'? Let me check: No, I don't see NT3 being a terminal; maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for any rule where a non-terminal produces a terminal that matches the 't's in the string.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that produces 't4' directly. Let me scan through the list again.\n\nLooking for 't4' in the productions:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'  \n- NT48 \u2192 't3'  \n- NT75 \u2192 't3'  \n- NT62 \u2192 't2'  \n- NT66 \u2192 't3'  \n- NT94 \u2192 't2'  \n- NT52 \u2192 't2'  \n- NT26 \u2192 't4'! Ah, here we go. Wait, looking back, in the provided grammar, there's a rule for NT26:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo, NT26 can produce 't4'. Similarly, look for 't3' and 't3' again.\n\nSo, the string is \"t3 t4 t3\". Breaking this down, we have three tokens: t3, t4, t3.\n\nEach token must correspond to a production path from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S. So S must derive each token in sequence.\n\nLet me see how S can produce these tokens. The first production from S is:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nSo S can produce NT68 followed by NT63. Now, each of these can further break down into other non-terminals.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Now, each NT68 and NT63 can be replaced by their respective productions.\n\nLooking up NT68's productions:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nAh! Yes, NT68 can directly produce 't3'. So first token can be produced by NT68.\n\nNext, NT63. Let's see the production for NT63:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nSo NT63 breaks down into NT84 and NT62. Now, each of these must produce their respective terminals or new non-terminals.\n\nNow, NT84: Looking for its production.\n\nNT84 \u2192 't3'\n\nYes, NT84 can produce 't3'. So after NT63 is processed, it can become 't3'.\n\nBut wait, NT84 is a terminal. So after expanding NT63 to NT84 NT62, NT84 becomes 't3', and NT62 needs to be processed.\n\nWait, so after S \u2192 NT68 NT63, we have 't3' (from NT68) and then NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT84 is 't3', and NT62 needs to be processed.\n\nNow, NT62 can produce 't2'. So NT62 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo putting it together, S \u2192 't3' (from NT68), then NT63 \u2192 't3' (from NT84) and 't2' (from NT62). So the second token is 't3' from NT84 and the third is 't2' from NT62.\n\nBut our string is \"t3 t4 t3\". So the third token should be 't3', but here we're getting 't2' from NT62. That's a problem because the third token in the string is 't3', but the grammar here would produce 't2' there.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to derive the string. Let's see.\n\nThe string is three tokens: t3, t4, t3. So S must derive these in order.\n\nAnother possibility is that the initial production of S can be different, but looking at the grammar, S only has two productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63  \nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo only these two. The first one leads to 't3' and 't4'? No, wait: NT68 \u2192 't3', so from the first S production, the first token is 't3'. Then NT63 becomes 't3' as we saw, but to get 't4', maybe another production path.\n\nWait, maybe the string is longer than three symbols. Wait, no, the string is three tokens. Each terminal is a single token. So each 't' is a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo the initial production S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would produce the first token as 't3', then we need to produce 't4' as the second token, but that would require that after the first 't3', the next production is a different one. However, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and NT63 is 't3', so the second token can't be 't4' unless S can derive another path, but S only has these two main productions.\n\nSo perhaps the initial path using S \u2192 NT68 NT63 can't produce the required string because the second token is 't3', not 't4'.\n\nWait, but if we can find a way for the second token to be 't4', perhaps by a different production.\n\nWait, maybe we should consider the other S production: S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't3' (Looking at the grammar: NT64 \u2192 't3'), so NT64 would produce 't3'.\n\nThen NT78: Let's see. NT78's productions:\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66  \nNT78 \u2192 't3'  \nNT78 can also produce 't3'.\n\nWait, no, NT78 \u2192 't3' is a terminal. So if we take NT78 \u2192 't3', then S \u2192 NT64 NT78 would produce 't3' and 't3', so the string would be 't3 t3', which doesn't match 't3 t4 t3'.\n\nBut wait, maybe NT78 can be expanded into another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT78's rules:\n\nNT78 can produce NT33 NT66 or 't3'.\n\nBut to get 't4', we need a production that can produce 't4' from somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe we're missing a production elsewhere.\n\nLooking back through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo if I can find a way to have a production that leads to NT26, which can produce 't4'.\n\nBut in the string, the 't4' is the second token, so that would require that in the second position, we have a production that leads to 't4'.\n\nSo perhaps, instead of using the first production S \u2192 NT68 NT63, we"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-19","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t3 t3 t2\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol which can have just one non-terminal. \n\nFirst, let me recall that Chomsky Normal Form has productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the provided grammar, some of the productions end with terminals like 't3', so I think in this case, 't' is being used as a terminal symbol, but I'm not entirely sure. The string has \"t3 t3 t2\", so all are terminals, which suggests that these are terminal symbols. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and the first production from S is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So I need to see if I can derive \"t3 t3 t2\" from any of these.\n\nI need to break down the string step by step. The string \"t3 t3 t2\" consists of three terminals. So in the parse tree, there are three leaves corresponding to these three terminals. Each production rule can contribute to breaking down the string into these terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that some terminals correspond to specific non-terminals. For example, NT68 is a non-terminal that produces 't3', based on the rule NT68 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 't2', according to NT63's production. This is helpful because the last part of the string is \"t2\", which would come from NT63.\n\nSo, starting from S \u2192 NT68 NT63, let's see where that leads. NT68 is 't3' and NT63 is 't2', but the string is \"t3 t3 t2\". So the S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would generate \"t3 t2\", but we have an extra \"t3\" at the beginning. That suggests maybe another production is needed. \n\nWait, maybe S is used in a more complex way. Let me check other productions. S can derive other non-terminals. For example, S can go to NT64 NT78. Let's see what NT64 and NT78 produce.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find NT64 \u2192 't3', according to the rule NT64 \u2192 't3'. Then NT78 can go to various things. Let's see: NT78's productions include several, like NT78 \u2192 NT75 NT49. Wait, but NT75 is another non-terminal that can produce 't2' because NT75 \u2192 't2'. So perhaps NT78 can lead to that.\n\nBut let's try to see how the string can be broken down. The string \"t3 t3 t2\". If I have S \u2192 NT68 NT63, that gives \"t3 t2\". To get an extra \"t3\", perhaps another production from S is needed. Alternatively, maybe NT68 can derive into another non-terminal that can produce \"t3 t3\". Hmm, but NT68 \u2192 't3' straight away. So perhaps that route isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT64 NT78 can be the starting point. NT64 \u2192 't3', and then NT78 needs to produce 't3 t2'. Let's look at NT78's productions. NT78 can go to NT75 NT49, among others. Let's see: NT75 \u2192 't2', and NT49... looking at NT49's productions, I see NT49 \u2192 't1'. That's only 't1', which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe NT78 can go to NT77 NT85.\n\nLet's check NT77 \u2192 't3', and NT85 \u2192 't2'. So if NT78 \u2192 NT77 NT85, that would produce \"t3 t2\". So starting with S \u2192 NT64 NT78, NT64 is 't3', and NT78 is 't3 t2'. That makes the entire string \"t3 t3 t2\", which matches exactly.\n\nSo, putting it together, S \u2192 NT64 NT78, then NT64 \u2192 't3', NT78 \u2192 NT77 NT85, then NT77 \u2192 't3', and NT85 \u2192 't2'. So the derivation would be S \u2192 NT64 NT78 \u2192 't3' (from NT64) followed by NT78 \u2192 't3' (from NT77) and 't2' (from NT85), giving \"t3 t3 t2\".\n\nTherefore, the string is indeed generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-43","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t3 t3 t3 t3 t5` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two productions: S -> NT68 NT63. So the string must start with the concatenation of whatever NT68 generates and NT63 generates. Let me check what each of these NTs eventually resolve to.\n\nNT68 has the production NT68 -> 't3', right? Oh, yes\u2014every time NT68 appears, it's replaced by 't3'. Similarly, NT63's production is NT63 -> 't5'. So the start production S must first produce the string 't3' followed by 't5', resulting in 't3 t5' as the initial expansion. But our input string is longer, four 't3's and a 't5'. So I must be missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the productions. Let me look again. Oh, wait\u2014that can't be right because S's first production leads to 't3 t5', but the string is 't3 t3 t3 t3 t5'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the derivations work here. Maybe the NTs can derive longer strings by expanding further.\n\nWait, each NT production may derive multiple terminals. So maybe some of these NTs can produce sequences of terminals, and others may combine those sequences.\n\nLet me take NT68 first. It directly goes to 't3' without any further expansion. So NT68 produces exactly one 't3'.\n\nNT63 also directly goes to 't5', producing one 't5'.\n\nSo the initial expansion of S is 't3 t5'. But the input string is longer\u2014it has four 't3's and a 't5'. So this suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the NTs can expand into multiple symbols.\n\nWait, let me double-check the productions. For example, NT68: looking through each production, I see NT68 only appears in one production: NT68 -> 't3'. So it cannot expand further\u2014it's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 has the production NT63 -> 't5'; so it cannot expand further.\n\nBut then, the initial expansion is just two terminals: 't3 t5', which doesn't match the input. Therefore, the string must be derived in a way that the NTs somehow lead to more than one 't3's.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to check other productions for these NTs. Let me go through each NT to see if any of them can derive more than one terminal.\n\nLooking at NT62: it has productions leading to other NTs, like NT62 -> NT48 NT0. Let's check NT48 and NT0.\n\nNT48: Check for any productions\u2014it seems NT48 only appears as a terminal. NT0 has production NT0 -> NT48 NT47. Looking at NT48 and NT47: NT48 goes to 't3', NT47 has multiple productions. NT47 can go to 't3' via NT47 -> NT85 NT38, but wait, NT85 goes to 't2' (I see NT85 -> 't2'), and NT38 can go to 't3'. So that path would produce 't2 followed by t3', which is 't2 t3'.\n\nAlternatively, NT47 can go to NT28 NT22, which may then produce more NTs. Let me check NT28's productions: NT28 -> NT60 NT69, both of which are terminals. NT60 is 't5', NT69 is 't0'.\n\nWait, but if NT28 goes to 't5 t0', then that's two terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 can go to multiple NTs: NT22 -> NT62 NT74. NT62, as we saw, can go to NT48 (which is 't3') and NT47. NT47 can then again have various paths.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about how to derive the input string.\n\nThe input string is five symbols: four 't3's and one 't5'. So the structure is something like [t3][t3][t3][t3][t5], or maybe the t3's are consecutive or follow some other grouping.\n\nWait, but according to the start production, S is NT68 NT63, which are both terminals. So the initial expansion is 't3 t5', as I thought earlier. So how can we get four 't3's and a 't5' from that?\n\nMaybe the NTs NT68 and NT63 can themselves be non-terminals that produce longer strings.\n\nWait, no. Looking at NT68's productions: the only way NT68 can be replaced is by 't3', a single terminal. Similarly, NT63's only production is 't5'. So perhaps the initial expansion is fixed as 't3 t5'.\n\nBut the input string is 't3 t3 t3 t3 t5', which is length 5. So that's four t3's and one t5, which doesn't match 't3 t5'. Therefore, perhaps the NT68 can expand into something else, but I don't see that in the given productions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again the productions for NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nLooking up NT68: It only has production NT68 -> 't3', no further expansions.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 has NT63 -> 't5', nothing more.\n\nSo S -> 't3 t5' is the only way S can be derived.\n\nSo the generated language by the grammar starts and ends with 't3 t5' for the initial and only expansion.\n\nBut our input is 't3 t3 t3 t3 t5', which is longer.

The string is `t3 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3`. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe goal is to derive the string `t3 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3` from the start symbol S. The string has six tokens, so I'll need to see if there's a way to split it into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the grammar rules:\n\nThe initial productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT68 or NT64 followed by NT63 or NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t3. Now, I need to see if any of the non-terminals produce t3.\n\nI'll look through all the non-terminals to see which ones can derive t3. Scanning the productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't4' (Wait, no, let me check again. The productions are in a lengthy list. Let me compile a list of which NTs produce 't's.\n\nScanning through each production:\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'\n- NT47 \u2192 't5'\n- NT94 \u2192 't2'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT75 \u2192 't1'\n- NT18 \u2192 't1'\n- NT49 \u2192 't1'\n- NT27 \u2192 't5'\n- NT47 \u2192 't5' (again)\n- NT93 \u2192 't3'\n- NT12 \u2192 't5'\n- NT67 \u2192 't2'\n- NT45 \u2192 't5'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT69 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' (wait, NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47, but somewhere in the rules... need to check each NT.\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs that directly produce 't's.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'\n- NT47 \u2192 't5' (twice)\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT18 \u2192 't1'\n- NT67 \u2192 't2'\n- NT49 \u2192 't1'\n- NT27 \u2192 't5'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT93 \u2192 't3'\n- NT94 \u2192 't2'\n- NT69 \u2192 't0' (but it has a production, so not directly a terminal)\nWait, no\u2014the 't's in the string must come directly from NT productions. So, NT74 \u2192 't3', NT93 \u2192 't3', so these can produce 't3's.\n\nLooking back, the first token is t3, so the first non-terminal must be either NT74 or NT93 since those directly produce 't3'.\n\nSo, let's consider the first possibility: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nWait, but looking at the initial productions, S can go to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, the first step is either NT68 followed by NT63 or NT64 followed by NT78.\n\nBut the first token in the string is t3. So, if we go down S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then NT68 must produce t3, but looking through the productions, I don't see any NT68 rules. Checking the rules:\n\nLooking for NT68, it doesn't appear in the given grammar as a left-hand side of any production except as part of other non-terminals or terminals. Similarly, NT64 doesn't seem to produce t3. So, perhaps S must derive through NT64 or NT68, but neither seem to produce t3. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all NT productions.\n\nLooking at each NT and their productions:\n\n- NT68: Is there a production? Let me scan the rules. No, NT68 only appears on the right-hand side, e.g., NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, etc. So NT68 might not be a starting point unless derived from other NTs.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try a different approach.\n\nThe string is `t3 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3`.\n\nSince each 't' token comes from a non-terminal production, let's consider how the string can be split into substrings that correspond to possible splits of these NT productions.\n\nIn CNF, each production is two NTs, so the string can be split into pairs. Let me see if the string can be split into three pairs (since the length is 6, which is 6\/2=3 pairs). Wait, no, the string is 6 tokens, each token being a result of a single NT production. Since each rule produces two NTs, the entire derivation would involve multiple steps. The number of tokens would correspond to the number of NTs in the final parse tree. Hmm, maybe I should model it as a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t3 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3`.\n\nLet's think of this as a sequence of six NT productions. The idea is to see if we can find a way to split this into a series of rules that match the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a parse tree where each 't' is the result of a single NT production, and each NT is the result of applying a rule.\n\nThe first token is t3. So, the first NT must be NT74 or NT93, as they produce t3.\n\nSuppose the first NT is NT74. Then, NT74 \u2192 't3'. So the first token is covered.\n\nNow, the next token is t3. Again, that needs another NT that produces t3. NT74 or NT93.\n\nBut before that, perhaps we can look deeper. Let's see what NT74 can derive:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT33 NT66.\n\nAh, so NT74 can produce 't3' (as it's NT74 \u2192 't3') and also can be split into NT33 and NT66. So, if NT74 is part of a more complex derivation, perhaps it's split into NT33 and NT66, each of which can further produce 't' tokens.\n\nSimilarly, NT33 could produce 't3' (as NT33 \u2192 't3' in some rules), or it can be split into NT13 and NT94.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT33: Yes, one of the productions is NT33 \u2192 't3', and another is NT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT94: NT94 \u2192 't2' or NT65 NT49.\n\nWait, but let's build this step by step.\n\nLet's start by considering the first t3.\n\nOption 1: The first t3 comes directly from NT74.\n\nSo, NT74 \u2192 't3'.\n\nThen, the next token is another t3. Now, after NT74, the next NT must also produce t3. Let's see how NT74 leads to the next part.\n\nBut wait, if NT74 is already producing t3, the next t3 must be the result of another NT that's part of the same NT74 production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT74 is a part of a larger production tree.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to model the entire string as a sequence of NTs derived from the initial NTs.\n\nGiven that the initial NTs are derived from S, which is either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at the initial rules, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nSo, the initial split is into either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nNow, the string starts with t3, which suggests that either NT68 or NT63 must derive to t3, but looking at the productions for NT68 and NT63:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT68 being a left-hand side of any production except as part of larger rules, so NT68 probably doesn't produce t3 directly. Similarly, NT63 is NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and I don't see NT63 being a terminal. So perhaps the S \u2192 NT68 NT63 path doesn't lead to t3 as the first token.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT64 NT78: NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-62","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string \"t3 t4 t4 t5 t3 t3\" can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have all production rules in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, that seems to be the case, so I'm on the right track.\n\nThe string provided is \"t3 t4 t4 t5 t3 t3\". Each \"t\" followed by a number presumably represents a terminal symbol. I think each of these is a terminal, so the string has six tokens: t3, t4, t4, t5, t3, t3.\n\nIn CNF, all the non-terminals in the derivations produce terminal sequences step by step. So, each step, we replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial symbol is S. The S has two options: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, the string must be built starting from either NT68 followed by NT63 or NT64 followed by NT78.\n\nWait, let's check the string length. The string has six tokens, so in terms of derivations, we'll likely be expanding S six times, but since each production splits into two, the number of symbols can grow exponentially. But here, since the string is six tokens, maybe each production in the derivation leads to exactly one token for each step. That might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal expansion corresponds to one token. For instance, when we have NT68, which produces 't3', and NT63 producing 't3' as well. So, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would produce t3 t3. But our string is longer, so we need to see if the non-terminals can expand further.\n\nWait, maybe I should build the parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe string is t3 t4 t4 t5 t3 t3.\n\nLooking at the first token, t3. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminal produces 't3'? Scanning through the productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT64 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't3'\n\nAlso, look at NT84, which \u2192 t3. So, perhaps multiple non-terminals can produce 't3', but let's track them.\n\nBut let's structure this. Since the string is six tokens, perhaps each production (except the initial S) corresponds to one token. Alternatively, maybe the grammar has a series of steps where each non-terminal production leads to one token, so we can track the possible expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is structured as a series of expansions from S, each step producing two symbols until we get the final string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting from S, which can be NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nSuppose we take S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then, the string starts with t3 (from NT68) and the next from NT63.\n\nLooking at NT63's production: I see NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT63 becomes NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, looking at NT84: NT84 \u2192 't3' and NT62 \u2192 NT68 NT69.\n\nWait, but then NT62 would split into NT68 and NT69, which would each produce 't3' and 't2' respectively. But our second token in the string is t4, not t2. So that path seems problematic.\n\nWait, maybe I need to try a different route.\n\nAlternatively, let's try starting with S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't3', and NT78 \u2192 't4'. So the first two tokens would be t3 t4, which matches the first two tokens of our string.\n\nSo after expanding S \u2192 NT64 NT78, the next step would be to expand NT64 and NT78.\n\nNT64 is terminal 't3', so it doesn't expand further. NT78 \u2192 t4, also terminal.\n\nSo perhaps the string is built in a different way. Wait, maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT64 NT78, which is t3 t4. Then we need to expand further.\n\nBut then, the string would need more production steps. Let me think in terms of the entire string being generated. Each non-terminal production should produce a sequence that eventually leads to the terminals in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal in the derivation corresponds to a substring of the given string. Let's think about the entire string as a sequence of t3, t4, t4, t5, t3, t3.\n\nMaybe it's better to model this as a parse tree, seeing how each node can be broken down.\n\nLooking for each token in the string, let's see what non-terminals produce them.\n\nt3 can come from NT68, NT64, NT1, NT84, NT26 (since NT26 \u2192 't2' is not, wait NT26 \u2192 t2? Wait looking back:\n\nWait wait, in the provided grammar, NT26 has two productions: NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9 and NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17.\n\nLooking at the later part, I see NT26 is eventually a terminal. Let's check each production:\n\nIn the grammar, after NT26, I see NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9 and NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17. Then NT60 is a non-terminal that leads to 't5' and others.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\n\nAnd NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe the string is built in a particular way, so I need to find an expansion path that matches the string.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S, which can become NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's try the second option: S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't3', NT78 \u2192 't4', so after first expansion: t3 t4.\n\nNow, we need to expand the first token, which is 't3' - but wait, in the string, the first two tokens are t3 t4, but in the second step, we might need to expand S further, but since S has already been expanded once, perhaps we need to expand the other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is built by expanding the non-terminals step by step. Let me map the string to the grammar.\n\nLooking at S, it can be NT64 NT78. So S \u2192 NT64 NT78, which is t3 t4. Now, we need to see if t4 can be further expanded into sub-termsinals that can produce the next token, which is t4.\n\nWait, but t4 is a terminal or a non-terminal? From the grammar, T3, T4, etc., are terminals, I think. So each 'tX' is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but no, looking back at the grammar, for example, NT1 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals, each of which must come from a non-terminal expansion.\n\nSo the first non-terminal after S is NT64, which \u2192 t3, and NT78 \u2192 t4, which matches the first two 't3 t4's.\n\nSo after S is expanded into NT64 NT78, we get t3 t4 as the first two tokens. Now we need to expand these non-terminals further until we get the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but in the leftmost derivation, we would expand the leftmost non-terminal first. So after S \u2192 NT64 NT78, we can expand NT78 next.\n\nNT78 \u2192 't4'? Or does it expand into other non-terminals? Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT78 except one that's empty because when I scan the provided grammar:\n\nWait, let me look through the productions for NT78. Yes, in the provided grammar, NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66.\n\nSo when we have NT78, it can expand into NT33 NT66.

{"custom_id":"request-81","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t3 t4 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3` can be generated by the given context-free grammar. First, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a specific structure where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The terminals are the 't's and digits, so each rule must derive into either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of seven tokens: `t3, t4, t5, t2, t3, t3, t3`. I think the approach here is to work backwards, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if we can expand it into this string through the given production rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the string must come from expanding S into NT68 and NT63. Let's see if both NT68 and NT63 can be expanded into the tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at NT68, the productions for NT68 are not listed in the grammar provided. Wait, actually, in the rules given, I can see that NT68 is used in the production of S: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. But looking through the other rules, I don't see any rules for NT68. That might be an issue because if NT68 can't be expanded into a terminal, how do we get to t3, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, actually, in the rules provided, some NTs are converted into terminals:\n\nFor example, NT68 \u2192 't3', NT66 \u2192 't3', NT84 \u2192 't3', etc. So maybe that's a typo. Let me check the rules again. Wait, looking back, under NT68, I don't see a rule. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan the list.\n\nWait, the rules are provided as a list of NT's with their productions. Looking through them, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT66 \u2192 't3'\n- NT84 \u2192 't3'\n- And others like NT68, etc.\n\nSo, looking at S \u2192 NT68 NT63, if both NT68 and NT63 are terminals or can be expanded into terminals, then S can produce the string. But wait, NT68 is a terminal as per the rules (since it's mapped to 't3'), but what about NT63?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT63 in the given list. Wait, let's check again. The rules provided are a list where each line is an NT followed by its rule(s). So I need to see if NT63 has any production. Let me scan through the list.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see a production for NT63 except possibly in a rule like NT63 \u2192 't3' or similar. Wait, let me check. Here's a part of the rules:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n...\nLooking through the list, I see NT63 is present. Wait, no, looking back, the rules are:\n\nLooking specifically for NT63:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT64 -> 't3'\n- NT74 -> 't3'\n- NT38 -> 't3'\n- Others... Hmm, actually, I don't see a direct rule for NT63. Wait, but in the given list, I might have missed it. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\nNT64 -> NT78 NT78? Wait, no, in the given rule list, NT64 is: NT64 \u2192 NT78, but that's incorrect. Wait, actually, in the provided rules, it's written in a way that each line is an NT followed by its productions. For example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n- NT64 \u2192 NT78 NT78? No, wait, in the provided rules, NT64 is:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT78\n\nWait, that's a problem because if NT64 \u2192 NT78, and NT78 \u2192 't3' or something, then perhaps the string starts with t3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which can be expanded as S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So to get the string, we need to expand S into NT68 and NT63, each of which must be terminals or can be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT68: if it's a terminal, it's 't3'.\n\nLooking at NT63: is there a rule for NT63? Let me scan the list. I see NT78 \u2192 't3', NT64 \u2192 NT78, etc. Wait, I don't see a direct rule for NT63. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps NT63 is an intermediate step that can be expanded into 't3' directly or through other rules.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT63 is in the following production:\n\nLooking through each line, the relevant ones are:\n\n- NT62 -> NT48 NT0\n- NT64 -> NT78 NT78 \u2192 no, wait, NT64 \u2192 NT78\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT69 \u2192 't0' and 't2'\n... and so on. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a production for NT63.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me double-check. In the given list, each line is an NT variable and its productions. So, for example, the line:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nMeans NT68 can be replaced by the terminal 't3'. Similarly, NT78 \u2192 't3'. But what about NT63? I don't see any rule for NT63 in the provided list. That's a problem because if NT63 can't be expanded, then how do we get a production beyond S?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking too broadly. Let me re-examine the rules to see if any NT is called that can produce the string.\n\nWait, the string is `t3 t4 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3`. So the first symbol is 't3', which could come from NT68 as given. Then the next symbol is 't4', which would have to come from the expansion of the second non-terminal in S's production, which is NT63. But we don't have a rule for NT63, so this seems to be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that S \u2192 NT68 NT63 is the only production for S. Wait, looking back, yes, in the given grammar, S is defined as:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nSo S directly expands into NT68 and NT63. Therefore, both NT68 and NT63 must be terminals or expand into the tokens in the string.\n\nBut the string has seven symbols, so each must be a terminal produced by NT68 and NT63. But if NT63 can't be expanded into any terminal except 't3', but our string has a 't4' as the second element, then this seems impossible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the list again for NT63. I see that in the rules, NT63 is not listed. That probably means that NT63 is not defined and is thus not a valid symbol, which would imply that the grammar might have a problem. But perhaps that's not the case; maybe I'm reading the rules incorrectly.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, perhaps I missed NT63 entirely. Let me count the rules:\n\nLooking through each line, after NT64, NT65, etc., I don't see a line for NT63. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it was supposed to be included. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed in a way that NT63 can produce 't4' somehow, but that doesn't seem to be directly evident from the rules.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way through the grammar steps. Since both NT68 and NT63 are part of the S production, and both must be expanded into a terminal for the string to start with 't3' followed by whatever. But our string has 't3' as the first symbol, which fits with NT68, but the second symbol is 't4', which can't be produced by NT63 as per the given rules.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the string is not generated by the grammar because the second symbol in the string is 't4', which cannot be produced by NT63 given the rules provided.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I misread the rules. Perhaps the rules allow for NT63 to be part of another expansion.

{"custom_id":"request-75","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to check is `t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3`. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all productions have either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. The fact that all non-terminals expand to terminals in this way means the derivation eventually produces a string of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, let's check if it's in CNF. The rules seem to fit because each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or terminals. So, I can proceed.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nI'll start by working backwards. The last symbol in the string is t3. Let me find a production that produces 't3' or a non-terminal that can derive into 't3'. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22, but none of those directly produce t3.\n- Wait, actually, let me list all 't' productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT24 \u2192 t1, t0, etc. But not t3.\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT19 \u2192 t3\n- NT69 \u2192 t0\n- NT75 \u2192 t5\n- NT62 \u2192 t3 (NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT66; NT34 \u2192 t1)\nWait, no, that's not directly t3.\n\nWait, in the given productions, NT62 is `NT34 NT66`, which translates to t1 and t3 respectively, so NT62 would produce t1 t3. Not t3 alone.\n\nWait, let's get the t3 rules clear. Looking through the given production rules, NT1 \u2192 t3 is one. Another is NT9 \u2192 t5, which is not helpful. Also, NT27 \u2192 t5, NT47 \u2192 t5, but no, not t3.\n\nWait, is there another NT that directly produces t3? Let's scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules provided, in the terminal productions, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT19 \u2192 t3\n- NT47 \u2192 t5 (multiple times)\n- NT38 \u2192 t3 (it appears twice)\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT99 \u2192 t5\n- NT69 \u2192 t0\n- NT26 \u2192 t2 or t4 or t1\nWait, in the initial analysis, I may have made a mistake because the user provided the entire set of production rules, including non-terminals. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the production rules, for NT38 \u2192 t3 is present twice? Let me check:\n\nYes, NT38 \u2192 t3 is actually two separate rules? Wait, no, in the given list, I see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t3 appears twice: once as NT38 \u2192 t3 and another as NT38 \u2192 t3 in the list? Let me check.\n\nIn the provided rules, after several lines, I see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 t3\n\nAlso, NT38 is also a terminal here:\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\nNT38 \u2192 t3 is listed twice? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT38 \u2192 t3 appears twice, perhaps a typo in the list? Or maybe not. Regardless, important for parsing.\n\nSo the terminals that produce t3 are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT38 \u2192 t3 (twice, but it's the same)\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n\nSo in the string `t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3`, the last symbol is t3, which could have come from NT1, NT38, or NT74.\n\nLet me try to work backwards from the string, trying possible derivations.\n\nLet's denote the string as S = t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3.\n\nI'll reverse the order to process from the end. Let's denote the string as a list:\n\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 (t3, t3, t4, t5, t5, t0, t3)\n\nTo generate S, the last symbol is t3. So the last production must have been NT74 \u2192 t3, or NT38 \u2192 t3, or NT1 \u2192 t3.\n\nLet me take NT74 \u2192 t3 as the last step. So, the step before the string S would have been [something] that produced NT74, followed by t3? No, wait: In a derivation, each step replaces a single non-terminal with RHS. So, for the last t3, it must have been produced by a non-terminal that becomes t3 when all non-terminals in its production are resolved.\n\nSo, considering NT74 \u2192 t3. Therefore, the last part of the string would be the production of NT74. So, in the previous step, there would have been a string where the last element is NT74, because NT74's production leads to t3. Wait, not necessarily, because NT74 is a non-terminal, so in the previous step, the last non-terminal would have been transformed into NT74, and then in the next step, NT74 becomes t3. Hmm, no, that's not quite right. Let me rephrase.\n\nIn a leftmost derivation, you start with S and replace non-terminals step by step. Since we're going backwards, the last step is that a non-terminal was replaced by its RHS, which in this case, the last symbol, t3, must come from a production where the last symbol in the RHS is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work from the beginning. Starting from S and trying to find a production that can produce the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is given, let's try to see if it's possible to generate it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it by trying to see if each symbol can be derived from the grammar. For each t in the string, find a production that can derive it.\n\nBut since it's a context-free grammar, perhaps we can break down the string into possible non-terminal productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for sequences of terminals that can be grouped into non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the start symbol S and see how to derive the given string.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so the string starts with NT68 and NT63, which produce terminal symbols. Let's see what NT68 and NT63 produce.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3 (from NT68 \u2192 t3, as the last part of the production chain: NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65, but looking through the given rules, I see NT68 \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, in the given list, after several lines, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nYes, that's one of the productions. Similarly, looking for NT63:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo, NT63's RHS is NT84 \u2192 t4, and NT62 \u2192 t3 t3.\n\nWait, but let's get it right. Let me check:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and we need to see what NT84 and NT62 produce.\n\nNT84 \u2192 t3 (from NT84 \u2192 t3)\n\nNT62 \u2192 t3 (from NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT66, and NT34 \u2192 t1, NT66 \u2192 t3)\n\nSo, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 t3 t3.\n\nWait, but the initial string has t3 as the first symbol. So the first part of the string is t3, which is the left-hand side of NT68, which then produces t3.\n\nSo, the first symbol t3 comes from NT68 \u2192 t3, and the second part is NT63, which produces t3 t3.\n\nWait, wait, that's not possible because NT63 is non-terminal, so it can't produce just t3 t3 because in the string, the first two symbols are t3 t3.\n\nWait, no, the string is `t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3`. So, after the first t3 comes t3, which is the second symbol.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting a bit tangled.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each rule has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal on the left. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, all the productions either start with a two-symbol left-hand side (like S -> NT68 NT63) or a terminal (like NT9 -> 't3').\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. So each 't' represents a single terminal symbol. Let me write out the string as a list of terminals: ['t3', 't4', 't3', 't3', 't5', 't0', 't3', 't3'].\n\nI know that the grammar's start symbol is S. So, I need to see if I can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nLooking at the productions from S:\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nI need to find which of these can lead me to the desired string. Let's try both.\n\nFirst, try S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, I need to find how NT68 and NT63 can produce the string.\n\nLooking up the production for NT68: From the list, NT68 \u2192 't3'. So that's the first terminal.\n\nNow, NT63: Let's see its production. Looking at the grammar, NT63 \u2192 't3'.\n\nWait, wait. Did I see that correctly? Let me double-check. The grammar lists NT63 as NT62 -> NT39 NT63, and looking further down, yes, for NT63 it's listed as NT63 \u2192 't3'. So NT63 can produce 't3'.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 't3' 't3'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't3 t4', so this path can't be right because after 't3', we get another 't3', not 't4'. So maybe S \u2192 NT68 NT63 is not the right starting point. Let's try S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at NT64: From the grammar, NT64 \u2192 't5'. Wait, no, looking back, the productions for NT64 are: NT64 -> NT60 NT14, which isn't a terminal, so I need to find if it can derive to 't4'.\n\nWait, no, actually, the grammar has some terminals. Let me check again. The list shows NT64 \u2192 't5' or something else? Let me look carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT68, it's 't3'. Under NT64, is there a production? Let me scan the list again:\n\nLooking for NT64:\n\nUnder NT64, the production is NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. So it's a non-terminal production, not a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided grammar again, I see:\n\n- NT62 -> NT39 NT63\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT64 -> NT60 NT14\n\nWait, but then other entries include:\n\n- NT18 -> NT50 NT38\n- NT14 -> NT1 NT98\n- NT75 -> 't3'\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to find all the terminals.

Let me check.)\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, looking for terminals:\n\nWait, NT33 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, no, the first line is the grammar, and the second is the string. The grammar is in a long list, each line is a production. Some lines have two NTs separated by an arrow, others have a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- S starts with NT68 NT63, which are non-terminals.\nThen, looking for NTs that produce terminals:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT75 \u2192 't3'\nNT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38 (not terminal)\nNT58 \u2192 't3'\nNT69 \u2192 't0'\nNT38 \u2192 't3'\nNT81 \u2192 't3'\nNT26 \u2192 't2'\nNT78 \u2192 't3'\nNT34 \u2192 't1'\nNT94 \u2192 't2'\nNT74 \u2192 't3'\nNT9 \u2192 't5'\nNT85 \u2192 't2' \u2014 wait, is that right?

It's 8 terminals long. Now, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a two-node tree, so the derivation could be binary, but since it's not a context-free language with a limited max length, maybe we can approach it as a binary tree parse.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to match the entire string using a top-down approach, starting with S and trying to match its productions.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions of S: S can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at the string: t3 t4 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3 t3.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which produces 't3' 't3' at the first two symbols, but the string's first symbol is 't3', second is 't4' which doesn't match NT68 \u2192 't3'. Wait, that's not matching. So this path can't be part of S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nSo perhaps the start production is S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Now, NT64's production: looking up, NT64 \u2192 't5' isn't correct because NT64 has the production NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. So it doesn't produce a terminal directly. Therefore, to get 't4' in the string, it's possible that NT64 leads to something that can produce 't4'.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't3', we have 't4' as the second symbol. So S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, NT64 produces some string, and NT78 produces some string. So the total string would be NT64's production concatenated with NT78's production.\n\nGiven that NT78 is a non-terminal, in the grammar, NT78 can produce 't3' or further.\n\nWait, looking back: NT78 \u2192 't3' or NT78 \u2192 other NTs.\n\nWait, under the grammar, looking for NT78: NT78 \u2192 't3'. So that's a terminal production.\n\nSo NT78 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo the second part of the string after S is 't3' (from NT78). But the string after the first symbol is 't4', which would mean that the second part of the string must start with 't4', not 't3'.Hmm, contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production of NT64 leads to something that can produce 't3 t4'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t3, t4, t3, t3, t5, t0, t3, t3.\n\nLooking for ways to break the string into two parts (since in CNF, the left-hand side is two symbols, so each step reduces the string length"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t5 t5 t3`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this because all the non-terminals (like S, NT62, NT81, etc.) are on the left, and on the right side, they either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78 are both in CNF because each non-terminal on the left is replaced by two non-terminals on the right. Similarly, rules like NT38 \u2192 't3' or NT26 \u2192 't2' are terminals, which also fit since they're a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is a series of terminals. The string given is `t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t5 t5 t3`. Each symbol here is a terminal, so I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use a parsing technique for CNF grammars, maybe the CYK algorithm. But since I'm just doing this manually, I'll try to look for possible derivations.\n\nLet's list all the production rules where the right side is a terminal. For example, NT38 \u2192 't3', NT44 \u2192 't5', NT26 \u2192 't2', and so on. So, each rule like NT38 \u2192 't3' gives a single terminal. \n\nThe string has eight symbols, so I'll need a derivation that leads to exactly eight steps. But wait, no, the number of steps corresponds to the length of the string. For a string of length n, the number of steps would be n-1, but here n=8, so seven steps. But I'm not sure about that, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of productions needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to construct a parse tree that yields this string. Let me see.\n\nStarting with the start symbol, which is S. Looking at the production rules for S, we have S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Both are two non-terminals, which means each of those needs to produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, the string is eight terminals long, which suggests that each production for S should eventually derive a sequence of four terminals each. Let me check:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then both NT68 and NT63 need to generate four terminals each. Similarly, S \u2192 NT64 NT78 would mean NT64 and NT78 each generate four terminals.\n\nLet me check each of these non-terminals on the right side to see if they can produce four terminals.\n\nFirst, let's take NT68. Looking at the production rules, NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18, NT66 \u2192 NT3 NT93, and so on. Wait, I need to see if NT68 can produce four terminals, but perhaps it's more involved.\n\nWait, maybe I should take a top-down approach, trying to see if each step can produce the required symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see each production and track how they might lead to the string.\n\nWait, let me list the production rules that produce terminals:\n\nHere's a list I can refer to:\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT44 \u2192 t5\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT58 \u2192 t3\n- NT34 \u2192 t1\n- NT62 \u2192 t2, but wait, looking at the rules, I see NT62 has other productions like NT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93, and NT77 \u2192 t3, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking back, some of the production rules for non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT38 \u2192 't3', NT44 \u2192 't5', NT26 \u2192 't2', NT58 \u2192 't3', NT34 \u2192 't1', NT77 \u2192 't3', NT97 \u2192 't5', and so on.\n\nSo, the idea is that each terminal in the string must be matched by a production rule that yields that symbol.\n\nSo, the string is t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t5 t5 t3.\n\nTo generate this string, each symbol must be obtained from a production rule that directly produces that symbol. So, perhaps I can parse the string from left to right, matching each symbol with possible non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to do a recursive descent parsing approach.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be derived from the start symbol S. So, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then, NT68 must produce the first part of the string, and NT63 must produce the second.\n\nThe string starts with t3. So, I need to see if NT68 can produce a string that starts with t3, and NT63 can produce the rest of the string after that.\n\nBut wait, NT68's production rules are: NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18, NT66 \u2192 NT3 NT93, etc. Hmm, none of these produce a terminal immediately. Wait, looking back, does NT68 have any terminal production?\n\nWait, checking the rules, I see:\n- NT62 \u2192 NT62 NT3, NT39 \u2192 NT27 NT97, etc. But looking for NT68, it's in the list under NT66: NT66 \u2192 NT3 NT93, and so on. Wait, perhaps I need to look carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's list all production rules again more carefully.

{"custom_id":"request-123","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string `t5 t5 t2 t2 t3 t5 t3 t5 t3` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Since the string is a series of t-commands, I'm guessing each t corresponds to a terminal symbol, and the numbers might represent something like steps or transitions, perhaps in a parser's derivation.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. It's in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. So the grammar can be broken down into a series of rules leading to terminals or other rules.\n\nThe string has 9 elements: t5 six times, t2 three times, t3 four times. That's a lot of t's, so each one corresponds to a terminal symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of steps in the derivation should relate to the length of the string.\n\nThe string's length is 9, which is an odd number. In Chomsky normal form, a string of length n must have n-1 production steps starting from the start symbol. Since 9-1=8, there should be 8 steps. However, the number of non-terminals generated along the way might be more complex.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production either produces a terminal or splits a non-terminal into two. So the maximum length after k steps is k+1. So for length 9, we'd need exactly 8 steps because 8+1=9.\n\nBut the problem is, each production can split a non-terminal into two, so in some cases, the number of non-terminals can grow exponentially, but for a given derivation, the specific path matters.\n\nI should attempt to find a leftmost derivation that produces the string. Let's start with S. Since the string starts with t5, I need to find a production for S that leads to a chain of terminals starting with t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce two options: NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's see which of these can lead to the first t5.\n\nEach of these starts with NT68 or NT64. Let's check NT68 and NT64.\n\nNT68 -> NT62 NT97. NT62 -> NT39 NT93. Let me see NT39 and NT93. NT39 -> NT27 NT97, and NT93 -> NT39 NT66. Wait, that's a cycle. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at NT64. NT64 -> NT60 NT14. NT60 -> NT68 NT18. If we go this way, NT60 goes to NT68 and NT18. NT18 has a production to NT50 NT38.\n\nWait, this seems complex. Maybe I should represent each NT with its possible productions and see if any path leads to the t's in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built up step by step. Each step adds a t, so the first t is the first symbol of the string. Let me see the first production: S is NT68 NT63. So the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then we need to derive each NT into a sequence of t's.\n\nSo the first symbol is t5, which is the result of NT68. Let's look at NT68's production: NT68 \u2192 NT62 NT97. Then NT97 has several productions. Let's see, NT97 \u2192 NT50 NT65. Hmm, but NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65, which seems recursive and might lead to more NT97, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, NT97 could go to NT18 NT94.\n\nWait, NT97 has several options. NT97 \u2192 NT58 NT65, NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62, and NT97 can also go to NT18 NT94. Also, NT97 \u2192 NT23 NT24.\n\nLooking for a path where NT97 leads to t's. Let's check NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38, NT38 \u2192 NT12 NT44, etc. But NT12 might produce 't5' as per the grammar.\n\nWait, NT12 has production NT12 -> NT48 NT91? Wait, I see the given grammar; looking for NT12. Wait, in the list, NT12 is under NT34: Wait no, the list provided seems to have all the NTs, but looking through, I don't see NT12 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps NT12 is a non-terminal with its own productions. Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar rules again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT34 -> NT1 NT78\n\nNT38 -> NT12 NT44\n\nNT12 is a non-terminal, so it's not a terminal. Therefore, it can't produce a t12, which is not a terminal. So perhaps that's a dead end.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is CNF, and the string is a sequence of t's, perhaps each 't' corresponds to a production step that ultimately ends in a terminal. So for each t_x, we need to find a production leading to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the last t3 in the string: the last symbol. The last t3 is the 9th symbol. So we need to end with a production that results in t3.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, the production NT24 \u2192 t0. So that would be a t0. Hmm, but the last is t3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me see the t5's and t3's.\n\nThe string is: t5 t5 t2 t2 t3 t5 t3 t5 t3.\n\nWait, the 9th symbol is t3, which is the end. So the last production must be a terminal that is t3.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce t3. Let's see where t3 appears as a result.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs have 't3' as a result. For example, NT84 \u2192 't3', NT55 \u2192 't4', NT97 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nWait, looking for NTs where a production results in t3.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t3\n\nNT55 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT26 \u2192 t2\n\nNT62 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, NT62 has a production to 't2', which is a terminal. NT62 is in the initial productions.\n\nSo, let me think: perhaps the derivation path starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 NT62 NT97 NT63 \u2192 NT39 NT93 NT63 \u2192 etc. But this might not lead directly to t5 t5 t2 t2...\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is structured in such a way that the rules branch in a way that accumulates the t's.\n\nWait, another idea: since the string starts with t5, t5, t2, t2, t3, t5, t3, t5, t3, maybe the production S leads to two parts that can generate the t5's, and then each of those can lead to t5 again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first t5 comes from NT68 \u2192 't5'. Let's check NT68's productions. NT68 \u2192 NT62 NT97. Now, does NT62 lead to 't5' or 't2'? Looking back, NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT93. Then NT39 \u2192 ... Wait, that doesn't seem to lead to t5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT68 \u2192 't5' directly, but checking the grammar, I don't see NT68 having a terminal production. Because in the grammar, S\u2192NT68 NT63, which are both non-terminals. So NT68 must be derived into terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's look for NTs that directly produce 't5'. Checking the list:\n\nLooking through all the NTs and their productions, when a non-terminal is expressed with a t_x, that's a terminal production.\n\nLooking for any NT where production includes 't5'. Scanning:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t0\n\nNT3 \u2192 t4\n\nNT65 \u2192 't5' (NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65) but that's a recursive production leading to more NTs.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Looking back at the list, I don't think any NT directly produces 't5' except perhaps:\n\nWait, looking at all the productions:\n\nLooking for any production where the right-hand side is a single terminal 't5'. Scanning through, I see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 t3\n\nNT33 \u2192 t0\n\nNT69 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully:\n\nIn the list, I don't see any NT directly producing 't5' except perhaps in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-115","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the string `t3 t4 t5 t5 t1 t5 t3 t4 t3` is generated by the given grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each non-terminal symbol produces exactly two non-terminal or terminal symbols. The terminals here include 't0', 't1', etc., and some are 't3', 't4', 't5'.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo any string starting with these combinations will be generated from S. The string we have starts with `t3`, which I notice is a terminal from NT34 and a few others, but looking at the grammar, S has to produce two non-terminals from the first step.\n\nWait, no, S produces two NTs, right? So the string should be a sequence of these NTs and the terminals they produce. But in the given string, the first symbol is `t3`, which comes from NT85, NT34, NT97, etc. But the string starts with `t3`, so let's see the possible ways NT can produce t3.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT81, NT38, NT26, and NT52 all produce 't3'. So NT could be one of those. But the initial step from S produces two NTs, so the string must start with two terminals from two NTs. But our string starts with only one `t3`. That's confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's re-examine. The string is `t3 t4 t5 t5 t1 t5 t3 t4 t3`. Hmm, that's a total of 9 symbols. Since each production (for non-terminals) produces two symbols (either NT or terminal), the number of steps would vary. But wait, for each non-terminal, S directly splits into two NTs, so that would take one step, then each of those could split further.\n\nLet me think about the possible reductions. But the string has 9 symbols, which is odd. Each non-terminal produces two symbols, so the length should be a product of 2s, unless we have a mix of NT and terminal in the productions.\n\nWait, no, actually, in each production, one NT can be terminal. So the number of symbols generated from S would be variable. It could be 2 (if both NTs are non-terminals), 3 (if one is terminal and the other is NT which then produces terminals), etc.\n\nWait, but the initial production from S is two NTs, so the first level would be two NTs. Each of them can either be NTs or terminals. Let's see the string: it's a sequence of t3, t4, etc. But we need to see how these t's can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's best to try to parse the string using the grammar rules, seeing if each symbol can be generated by a production.\n\nBut maybe I should start by mapping each production and terminals. Let's list all terminals and their productions:\n\n- 't0' \u2192 NT68, NT96, NT45, NT18, NT65, NT19, NT78, NT58, NT49, NT99, NT33, NT84, NT62, NT69, NT0, NT15, NT77, NT75, NT52, NT24, NT44, NT34, NT42, NT12, NT26, NT55, NT85, NT39, NT38, NT94, NT74, NT97, NT33, NT88, NT98, NT66, NT17, NT34, NT42, NT94, NT72, NT18, NT49, NT15, NT80, NT55, NT69, NT81, NT34, NT85, NT42, NT26, NT39, NT47, NT89, NT24, NT39, NT42, NT60, etc. Wait, actually, each symbol can only be a terminal or non-terminal based on the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for each terminal in the string and see which NTs can produce it, and then see if the NTs can be connected in a way that the string is generated.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string: t3, t4, t5, t5, t1, t5, t3, t4, t3.\n\nSo each symbol in the string must be the result of some production. Let's try to see the possible derivations.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLet's assume the string starts with NT68 and NT63.\n\nFirst production: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, NT68 \u2192 what? Looking at the grammar, NT68 \u2192 t3. That matches the first symbol.\n\nThen NT63 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at NT63's productions, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, or could it produce a terminal? Looking back, NT62 is another NT. So perhaps NT63 is a non-terminal, so it would have to produce another two symbols. The next symbol in the string is t4, which is NT89 \u2192 t5 and NT24 \u2192 t1, but wait, no.\n\nWait, let me check NT63. Looking through the productions, NT63 is only used as a parent non-terminal; it's in the children of other NTs. Wait, I don't see NT63 on the left side of any production. Let me scan through the production rules to see if NT63 is a parent or a child.\n\nHmm, looking through the productions, I see NT63 on the right-hand side of NT75: NT75 \u2192 NT45 NT47, but that's for NT75, not as a child.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. NT63 is not on the left side of any production. That means NT63 is a non-terminal that does not have any production rules except perhaps implicitly, but if it's not in the production list, it means it's not a starting symbol and cannot be expanded further.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me check all the productions again. Did I miss NT63?\n\nLooking back: NT63 is not listed as a left-hand side in any of the given productions. That suggests that NT63 is a terminal. But looking at the productions, all the non-terminals are on the left, except the terminals. So, the left-hand side of the productions are NT labels, and right-hand side are sequences.\n\nSo, if NT63 isn't a parent in any production, it's a terminal symbol. Therefore, NT63 can be 't3', 't5', 't6', etc., but looking for t4 in our string.\n\nWait, but the second symbol in the string is 't4'. If the first NT68 produces 't3', then the second symbol should be from NT63. But if NT63 is a terminal, what is it?\n\nLooking through the productions, let's see if any NT63 is a terminal. Scanning all the right-hand sides, I don't see 't4' or 't5' directly on the right of any production as a terminal. The terminals are things like 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5'.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, are any NTs producing 't4'? Let me check: looking through the productions, NT89 \u2192 't5', NT94 \u2192 't1', NT24 \u2192 't1', NT42 \u2192 't1', NTL5 \u2192 't3', etc. Hmm, NT33 \u2192 't0', NT60 \u2192 't5', NT1 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing NT63. Let me re-examine the productions. I think I missed NT63. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT34, NT38, NT19, etc., but not NT63. So, if NT63 is not a starting non-terminal, and it doesn't have a production rule, it must be a terminal. So in that case, NT63 would produce a specific terminal. So, let's look through the right-hand side of all productions to see if any NT63 is on the left. But I don't see that. Therefore, the only possibility is that NT63 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but then, does any production have a terminal as 't4' at the right-hand side? Looking through the productions, the right-hand sides are all either NTs or terminals. For example, NT22 \u2192 't62' but that's part of another NT. Wait, perhaps looking for where a terminal is 't4'.

I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t3 t1 t5 t1 t5 t5 t5 t5 t0 t3` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should help because each step in the derivation is straightforward.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are several rules leading to 't's. Wait, the terminals are 't0', 't1', etc., which matches the string we need to check. So, my task is to see if the string can be derived using the given rules.\n\nThe string is: t3, t1, t5, t1, t5, t5, t5, t5, t0, t3.\n\nThat's ten symbols long. Let me think about how the grammar could produce such a string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation combines two symbols into one. So, the length of the string would be 2^n where n is the number of steps, but here the string length is 10, which is not a power of two. Wait, that might be a problem. Let me confirm: the initial string in the grammar is S and then it branches. Each production of S adds two symbols, but each non-terminal can further branch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived through a series of steps where each step combines two symbols into one, but the string can vary in length based on how the non-terminals are expanded.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string has 10 symbols, which is an even number, but the derivation might not necessarily have to be a full binary tree. Hmm, maybe I should try to reconstruct the derivation.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and see which terminals are connected. The string is t3 t1 t5 t1 t5 t5 t5 t5 t0 t3.\n\nLooking at the end, it's t0 followed by t3. So, that suggests that somewhere there's a production where a non-terminal produces t0 and t3.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Since the right-hand side of the productions uses terminals and non-terminals, and the grammar is given, I'll need to analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and the productions go from S to NT68 NT63 or S to NT64 NT78. So each production starts with two non-terminals. From the string, I notice it starts with t3, which is a terminal. The productions for NT69 and NT38 produce t2 and t3, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t3, so the relevant production from the non-terminals must give t3. Checking the grammar, NT38 produces t3. So I think the first step is to see if the start symbol S can derive this initial t3.\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's see what NT68 and NT63 produce. From the grammar, NT68 is part of S's production, but let me check each step.\n\nWait, S can go to NT68 and NT63, so I need to find which path can lead to t3 t2... Let's start building the parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. NT68 has a production, for example, NT68 \u2192 NT60 NT69. So the first part is NT68. Then, NT69 is a terminal 't0' as per the grammar. But the string starts with t3, not t0. So maybe S is taking the other branch, not NT68 but NT64.\n\nWait, S's first production is NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's consider the second option: S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Now, NT64's productions include NT60 NT14, but that leads to more steps. Alternatively, looking at NT78's productions: NT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66 and also \u2192 NT97 NT62. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for terminals in the grammar to create a path that leads to the given string.\n\nAnother approach is to break down the string step by step, trying to find a derivation.\n\nThe string is: t3 t2 t1 t5 t4 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production at each step involves two non-terminals, and terminals are derived directly.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's assume the first production: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT60 NT69. Then NT69 is 't0'. But the string starts with t3, so that can't be the correct path. So the first production must be S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. NT60's productions include NT68, NT69, etc. Let me see: NT60 can go to NT68 NT69, NT63, NT48 NT0, etc. If NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT69, then NT68 \u2192 NT60 NT69, leading to a chain of NT60's again. Hmm, that might not help because the string starts with t3. Alternatively, perhaps NT60 \u2192 NT58 NT28.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me see the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking for paths that lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nThe string starts with t3, so looking for a production path that starts from S and reaches t3.\n\nFrom S, it's S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nFrom NT38 \u2192 t3. So perhaps one of the non-terminals in the path must be NT38.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT78 (since NT84 is elsewhere, let's see: S can be NT64 or NT68. NT68 leads to NT60 which leads to NT68 again, which is cyclic. NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. Let's see NT14: NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98. NT98 \u2192 NT23 NT38. NT23 \u2192 NT18 NT8, but 18 is a non-terminal: NT18 \u2192 NT67 NT94. NT94 \u2192 't2' or NT1... Wait, NT94 \u2192 't2' or NT58 NT65. So from NT94, can we get t2? Let me check: NT94's productions are NT58 NT28 or NT26 NT24 or NT19 NT63. Hmm, I think I'm getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be built step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: t3 t2 t1 t5 t4 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3.\n\nLet me see if I can find a way to derive this starting from S.\n\nFirst symbol must come from one of the productions of S. So S \u2192 NT64 NT78 or S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, let's see NT64's productions: NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT60 NT14 NT78.\n\nBut NT60's productions are numerous. Let's see NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT69, which would give 't0' as the first terminal. But the string starts with t3, so maybe NT60 \u2192 NT48 NT0. NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47, which is 't3' or another branch.\n\nAlternatively, NT60 \u2192 NT58 NT28. Then NT58 \u2192 NT18 NT8. NT18 \u2192 't1' or NT67 NT94. But let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see each production and track the terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, NT64 can produce NT60 NT14. So S becomes NT60 NT14 NT78.\n\nNow, NT60 can produce NT48 NT0, which then becomes NT48 NT47.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n2. NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\n3. NT60 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n4. Now, NT48 is a terminal? Wait, no, NT48 is a non-terminal. So from NT48, let's see its productions: NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT78. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT48 \u2192 NT99 NT81. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking back, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the grammar is structured with non-terminals, but when I look, e.g., NT48 has a production \u2192 't3'.\n\nYes, looking at the rules, NT33 \u2192 't0', NT34 \u2192 't1', NT18 \u2192 't1', NT69 \u2192 't0', NT38 \u2192 't3', and so on.\n\nWait, I might have misread the initial rules. Let me look again.\n\nLet me re-express the grammar rules properly. Each production has a non-terminal on the left, and then a series of non-terminals or terminals on the right. The productions with a single terminal are the ones that produce that terminal.\n\nWait, the user has listed all the productions, so I can list them as:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't3'\nNT26 \u2192 't2'\nNT33 \u2192 't0'\nNT81 \u2192 't3'\nNT97 \u2192 't5'\nNT18 \u2192 't1'\nNT44 \u2192 't5'\nNT15 \u2192 't3'\nNT27 \u2192 't5'\nNT89 \u2192 't5'\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT58 \u2192 't1'\nNT49 \u2192 't1'\nNT50 \u2192 't4'\nNT75 \u2192 't3'\nNT12 \u2192 't5'\nNT48 \u2192 't3'\nNT65 \u2192 't5'\nNT20 \u2192 't5'\nNT74 \u2192 't3'\nNT9 \u2192 't5'\nNT39 \u2192 't0'\nNT42 \u2192 't1'\nNT99 \u2192 't5'\nNT23 \u2192 't2'\nNT19 \u2192 't1'\nNT85 \u2192 't2'\nNT62 \u2192 't3'\n...\n\nSo the key is that several non-terminals produce specific terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-160","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t3 t4 t2 t5 t3 t4 t3 t2 t4 t3 t3`. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific structures. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the given grammar has production rules where either the left-hand side is a non-terminal that expands into two other non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of rules where NT symbols (like NT68, NT75, etc.) expand into other NT symbols and sometimes into terminal symbols like 't1', 't2', 't3', and so on. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which means the start symbol S can be replaced by NT68 followed by NT63. So, I need to see how this string relates to the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t3 t4 t2 t5 t3 t4 t3 t2 t4 t3 t3`. Let me note down each token: t3, t4, t2, t5, t3, t4, t3, t2, t4, t3, t3. There are 11 tokens. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either results in two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) or a single terminal. That means the overall derivation tree for a string of length n would have a height of log(n), and the number of steps would be proportional to n. \n\nBut how do I approach this without writing the entire parse tree? Maybe I can use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars to check whether a string is in the language. Alternatively, I can look for possible reductions or see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that several non-terminals expand into terminals with specific patterns. For instance, NT65 -> 't3', so that's a direct production. Similarly, NT75 -> 't3', perhaps. Let me check if any of the tokens in the string directly appear in the grammar as terminals. \n\nLooking through the productions, NT75 is given as -> 't3', so t3 is a terminal. Similarly, others like NT65 is 't3', NT18 is 't1', NT48 is 't3' (twice in the productions), NT62 is 't2', etc.\n\nWait, in the string, I have t3, t4, t2, t5, etc. Let me see: NT33 is 't3', so t3 is produced by NT33. But in the string, the first token is t3. So perhaps the starting symbol S needs to be able to produce a sequence of t's that include t3 at some point.\n\nBut let's think about how S is structured. S can be NT68 NT63. So, to get t3, maybe NT68 or NT63 can expand to a terminal. Looking back, NT68 is produced by NT68 -> NT66 NT18 or other rules, but wait, no, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT68 -> anything with 't'. Wait, let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking more closely at the grammar productions:\n\n- NT2 -> NT67 NT20\n- NT75 -> 't3'\n- NT68 is defined as S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but I don't see NT68 being expanded further into terminals. Similarly, NT63 is in the same rule. So, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but that's probably not directly helpful unless these NTs can expand into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the NTs can expand into terminals through multiple steps. So, I need to see if any of the NTs can produce a terminal at some point in their expansion.\n\nLet me look for all the NTs that have a direct production to a terminal:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't3' (since NT2 \u2192 't3')\nWait, is that correct? Wait, looking at the last production in the string, I see NT2 is defined as -> 't3' (last line in the grammar):\n\nNT2 \u2192 't3' \n\nYes, that's correct. Similarly, checking others:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't3'? Wait, let me check the grammar. Looking at the end:\n\nNT62 -> 't2' (since NT62 \u2192 't2'), but looking through the production rules, I don't see NT62 in the terminal productions. Wait, the initial grammar provided might have been cut off, but according to the part provided, yes, NT62 is a terminal as it has a production that results in 't2' in one of the lines.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 \u2192 't5', I think.\n\nWait, for example, line 45:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't5'\n\nYes, so NT45 produces 't5'.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule to see which NTs produce terminals.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't3'\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n- NT62 \u2192 't2'\n- NT69 \u2192 't0' but t0 is not in our string, so not relevant.\n- NT97 \u2192 't3' (since NT97 is in line 'NT97 -> 't5'', no, wait: looking through, I see that some are t0, t1, etc. Wait, let's check each line:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-154","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t3 t2 t1 t5 t1 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3`. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember what Chomsky normal form (CNF) looks like. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals or an terminal followed by a non-terminal or two terminals.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of t's, each corresponding to a terminal symbol. Each t is a terminal, so I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string length is 11 tokens: t3, t2, t1, t5, t1, t5, t5, t5, t5, t5, t3. Since each symbol in the grammar is replaced by two symbols (per CNF), the string length should fit the derivation rules. The number of symbols in the string is twice the number minus one, but let me think. If the string is 11, then the derivation would have taken 10 steps, as in each step the number of symbols increases by one. But the number itself is manageable.\n\nI think I should start by seeing which terminals appear in the string and check if they have corresponding production rules. Let's list the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 t2\nSo S can derive t3 t2.\n\nBut the string starts with t3 t2, which matches the first two symbols. So the first step might be S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which becomes t3 t2.\n\nThen, we need to check the rest of the string after t3 t2. The next tokens are t1 t5 t1 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3. However, the problem is that S after producing t3 t2 is done, so unless the grammar allows for more strings, I might be stuck. But wait, maybe it's a more complex derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is generated through multiple steps, not just one.\n\nWait, another approach: let's consider each terminal in the string and check if they have a production rule. For example, t3 is from NT68, t2 from NT63, and so on.\n\nLooking up each t:\n\nt3 comes from NT68, t2 from NT63, t1 from NT3, t5 from NT97, NT94, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is constructed by replacing non-terminals step by step until all are terminals.\n\nBut let me try to outline possible steps.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 which gives t3 t2. But the string is longer than that, so perhaps I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, maybe the S \u2192 NT68 NT63 is the top-level step, but from there, NT68 and NT63 can each be expanded further, but in this case, NT68 is t3 and NT63 is t2, so S can only generate strings starting with t3 t2. But the given string starts with t3 t2 t1..., so perhaps S is expanded into something like NT68 NT63, and each of these can be part of longer derivations.\n\nWait, maybe S is not directly the start, but perhaps it's better to see how each terminal in the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me attempt to see the string step by step.\n\nThe string is [t3, t2, t1, t5, t1, t5, t5, t5, t5, t5, t3].\n\nLet me first check if the first two symbols can be derived from S. S can produce NT68 NT63, which becomes t3 t2, so that's the beginning. So the first two symbols match.\n\nNow, after that, the string continues. So we have t1 t5 t1 t5 and so on. So after t3 t2, we have t1 t5 t1 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3. That's nine more symbols, so in total 11, meaning 10 steps after S.\n\nBut perhaps the grammar allows for longer strings. Let me see which non-terminals can produce these.\n\nt1 is from NT3, which has production NT3 \u2192 t4. Wait, but NT3 has production NT3 \u2192 't4'. So t4 is another terminal.\n\nWait, looking back: the grammar has productions like NT3 \u2192 't4', which is a terminal. So NT3 can produce t4. But in the string, after t3 t2, we have t1, t5, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to track the possible non-terminals and their expansions.\n\nLooking at the productions, let me see which non-terminals can lead to t1, t5, etc.\n\nt1 comes from NT3 \u2192 't4' (wait, that's a problem). Oh, no, wait: looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't4' is not correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the productions:\n\nThe list has lines like NT3 \u2192 't4', which would mean NT3 directly produces 't4', so t4 is a terminal.\n\nBut in the given string, I see t1, t5, etc. So where do those come from?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nLooking for which NTs produce t1, t2, t3, t4, t5.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't0'\n- NT55 \u2192 't4'\n- NT2 \u2192 NT67 NT20, etc.\nWait, perhaps I need to list all NTs and their terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for production rules where the right side is a single terminal.\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n- NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90\n- NT2 \u2192 NT67 NT20\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n- NT4 \u2192 NT1 NT98\n- NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT6 \u2192 NT62 NT69\n- NT7 \u2192 ?\nWait, perhaps I should make a list.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each NT and their possible productions.\n\nBut given the extensive list, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that in this CNF, any terminal can appear exactly once, and their parent non-terminals can derive them. But the string given has multiple t1, t5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't possible. Let's think: to have t3 t2 t1..., but S produces t3 t2 only, unless t3 t2 have children.\n\nWait, but perhaps S can be expanded further beyond the initial t3 t2. Let's see: the initial S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is t3 t2. But to get further, perhaps NT68 can only produce t3 (since t3 is NT68's terminal), and NT63 can produce t2, so after S, we have t3 t2, and no further expansion from there.\n\nWait, that can't be, because otherwise the string of length 11 can't be derived. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is the only production for this string. Wait, if S is only able to produce t3 t2, then any longer string wouldn't be possible. Unless S can produce other things beyond t3 t2. But looking at S's production rules, it only goes to NT68 NT63, which produce t3 t2. So perhaps the string starts with t3 t2, but then continues beyond, which would require that S can produce something that allows for further expansion after S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is structured in a way that's not possible. For example, if the string is t3 t2 t1 t5..., but S directly produces t3 t2 and nothing else, then perhaps the string can't be longer than t3 t2. But the given string is longer, so that would mean it's generated by another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me think differently. Maybe I should parse the string as generated by S.\n\nWait, maybe S can be part of a larger production. Let me see. S is the start symbol. So all derivations must eventually start with S. If the string is longer, perhaps S splits into NT68 NT63, which could lead to more symbols.\n\nWait, maybe NT68 can be further expanded beyond being just t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-183","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string given is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t5 t3 t5 t2 t5 t3 t4 t3 t2 t5 t0 t3`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, all the rules seem to fit this form, so that's good.\n\nNext, I recall that for a string derived from a CNF grammar, its length must be a power of two. This is because each non-terminal can produce two other symbols, leading to a binary expansion in the number of steps. So, let's count the number of tokens in the string. There are 12 tokens, and 12 is not a power of two (since 2^3=8 and 2^4=16). That might already be an indication that the string isn't generated by this grammar, but I shouldn't conclude just yet. It's possible that the grammar has a more complex structure that doesn't rely strictly on the length being a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar includes some rules that allow for different lengths, but given that it's in CNF, each production splits into two. However, the start symbol S can produce multiple symbols in one step, so over multiple steps, the number of terminal symbols can increase exponentially. Wait, no\u2014each step doubles the length, so starting from S, after one step, you have two terminals, then four, then eight, and so on. So the total number of terminals must indeed be a power of two. Since 12 isn't a power of two, that directly tells me that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misapplying this rule. Let me think again. Chomsky Normal Form ensures that each production is binary, so the maximum possible number of terminal symbols after each step is 2^n. So, starting with S, which is one symbol, after one expansion, you get two symbols; after the next, four, then eight, etc. So, the string must have a length of 2^k for some k. Here, 12 is 3 * 4, which is not a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for this string to be generated by the grammar, regardless of other factors.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the provided rules, some of them produce terminals like NT26 -> 't2', NT69 -> 't0', etc. The string has various 't's with different indices, so perhaps the grammar can generate such tokens. But the key issue here is the length.\n\nI should also consider whether there are any exceptions or specific cases where the length doesn't hold. For example, if the grammar has epsilon productions or single-step productions that allow for longer strings, but in CNF, all productions are either two symbols or terminals. So, the string's length must be a power of two.\n\nThus, since 12 isn't a power of two, the string can't be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-178","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t3 t2 t4 t0`. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since all the productions are split into two parts, the string should be broken down into tokens matching these rules.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it's a sequence of t-suffixed tokens and some numbers like 1,2,3,4,5. I think the numbers after t might represent the production steps, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe each t corresponds to a step in the derivation.\n\nLet me list out the tokens: t3, t3, t3, t3, t3, t3, t1, t5, t3, t2, t4, t0.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string must be formed by combining these step-by-step. Each step consumes two symbols (non-terminals) and produces a terminal followed by other symbols.\n\nI think I should try to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules. Starting with the full string:\n\nt3, t3, t3, t3, t3, t3, t1, t5, t3, t2, t4, t0\n\nThe initial symbols are t3 t3. Each t3 must correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules, t3 is generated by several non-terminals. For example, NT62 produces t3, so the first production is NT62 \u2192 t3. Similarly, NT81 \u2192 t3 is another option.\n\nSo, for the first t3, let's choose NT62 \u2192 t3. Now, the remaining string is t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t3 t2 t4 t0.\n\nWait, actually, the initial token is t3, which from NT62 and NT81. Let's pick one, say NT62.\n\nSo, after the first t3 (NT62), we look at the next t3. So, the next production should again be NT62 or NT81.\n\nBut actually, in parsing, you can't just pick any; you need to follow the structure of the grammar. Maybe the parsing process is step-by-step, checking possible productions.\n\nAn alternative approach is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. Each production in the grammar consists of two non-terminals. So the entire string should be a series of transitions that can be applied step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the reverse: each t in the string represents the result of a production. So the string is a sequence of symbols generated by the grammar. Each non-terminal in the string is replaced by a production until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut in this string, most tokens after t are numbers like 1,2,3,4,5, which I think are non-terminals, because each production is a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the production rules, the non-terminals are represented as NT followed by some number (like NT62, NT81, etc.). The terminals include 't3', 't1', etc. So in the string, each token is either a 't' followed by a number (like t3, t1, etc.) or a non-terminal like NT62, NT81, etc.\n\nWait, no, the string given is tokens like 't3', 't3', 't3', etc. So in the string, each token is a terminal symbol. But in the grammar, the non-terminals produce these terminals. So perhaps each t3 corresponds to a terminal symbol '3', but with a 't' prefix? Wait, no, that might not make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't' in the string is a way to represent steps in the derivation. Or maybe each 't' followed by a number is a step in the parse.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't's are the steps, and the numbers are the indices of the non-terminals in the grammar. For example, t3 could mean that the current symbol was derived from NT62 \u2192 t3, where 3 refers to the third production of NT62, but in the grammar, NT62 has only one production: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't's are part of the terminal symbols, like 't3' as a single symbol. So the string is made up of symbols like 't3', which are either terminals or non-terminals. But according to the grammar, the non-terminals are all starting with 'NT', so 't3' must be a terminal. So, perhaps the 't's are just part of the terminal symbols.\n\nWait, let's clarify: in the grammar, the non-terminals are all in the form NT followed by a number. The productions for these non-terminals produce either other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are either 't' followed by a digit, like 't0', 't1', etc., or other constants?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some productions end with terminals like 't0', 't1', etc., while others consist of two non-terminals. So the string we have must be a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSo, the string is 't3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t3 t2 t4 t0'. Let's count the number of symbols: 12 symbols.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, each production step reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So starting from a non-terminal, each step replaces it with two non-terminals until the end. But in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that must have been generated through leftmost derivations.\n\nWait, no, CNF allows leftmost or rightmost derivations. Each step replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, each production in CNF has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to generate a string of length n, the derivation starts with the start symbol S, which is a non-terminal. Then, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal, and so on until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo, the length of the string is the number of terminals produced. Each step can potentially increase the number of symbols, but in the end, it's supposed to match the given string.\n\nBut the given string has 12 symbols, which are a mix of 't' and numbers. Since the grammar's terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't0', 't1', etc., perhaps the string is constructed by a sequence of t's and numbers indicating steps or indices.\n\nWait, maybe each 't' is a separator, and the numbers correspond to the non-terminal productions. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals, and each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, such as 't3'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that include terminals, like NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, which is a production from NT64 to NT60 and NT14. But these are non-terminals until they reach the leaves of the parse tree, where they produce terminals. \n\nWait, in the grammar, the only terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't0', 't1', ..., 't9'. The non-terminals are all prefixed with 'NT' and have numbers following, like NT3, NT4, etc.\n\nWait no, looking more carefully, the right-hand sides of the productions are combinations of non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14 is a production that combines two non-terminals, so that would not be a terminal. Another production, like NT66 \u2192 NT72 NT55 is also two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but some productions end with a terminal, like NT38 \u2192 t3, which is a terminal. So, in the grammar, the terminals are 't0', 't1', ..., and the non-terminals are NT3, NT4, etc.\n\nSo, in the given string, 't3' is a terminal symbol, which is derived from a production of a non-terminal that ends with that terminal.\n\nSo, going back, the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no, the string is a flat list of symbols.

The string is `t3 t1 t3 t2 t2 t5 t5 t1 t5 t4 t3 t3 t3`. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My goal is to see if there's a way to derive the string step by step using these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its productions are:\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo any string generated by the grammar must start with either NT68 followed by NT63 or NT64 followed by NT78. But the string we're checking starts with `t3`, which I assume corresponds to a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, actually, each 't' with a number seems to be a terminal. So I should check what each production can produce. Let me go through the productions and see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nStarting from S, the first step could be S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Let me check what NT68 and NT63 produce.\n\nLooking up NT68: It has a production NT68 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 't3'. So if I choose S \u2192 NT68 NT63, the initial two symbols would be t3 t3.\n\nBut the string starts with t3 t1 t3... Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, actually, the string is t3 t1 t3 t2 t2 etc. So maybe S \u2192 NT64 NT78 is a better starting point.\n\nNT64's productions: Let's see, NT64 \u2192 't3' or another production. Wait, I need to check all rules. From the list, under NT64, the productions are:\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\nNT64 \u2192 NT19 NT48\nNT64 \u2192 NT69 NT65\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the productions for NT64 are:\nLooking back, it says:\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14\nNT64 -> NT19 NT48\nNT64 -> NT69 NT65\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nSo that's four productions for NT64. Also, I think NT64 might produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking through all the non-terminals, I don't see a direct production like NT64 \u2192 't4' or similar. So, NT64 must be broken down further.\n\nWait, let me verify. For NT64:\n\nLooking through the productions:\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14\nNT64 -> NT19 NT48\nNT64 -> NT69 NT65\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nSo, NT64 must be produced by expanding further. Let's see what each of these non-terminals produce.\n\nFirst, NT60: From the list, NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18. Both are non-terminals, so it needs to be expanded.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can look at the given string and see if we can parse it step by step.\n\nThe string is t3 t1 t3 t2 t2 t5 t5 t1 t5 t4 t3 t3 t3.\n\nLet me try to parse it from left to right using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. S can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So the first step is either t3 t3 (if S \u2192 NT68 NT63) or a different combination.\n\nBut the string starts with t3 t1, which is different. So maybe S \u2192 NT64 NT78 is the right way to go.\n\nLet me check what NT64 and NT78 can produce.\n\nNT64 can expand into several non-terminals. Let's pick one. Looking at the options, NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. Then NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18, and NT14 can produce 't1'.\n\nWait, NT14: Looking at the grammar, NT14 \u2192 't1' or another production?\n\nWait, in the list, under NT14: It says:\nNT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98\nNT14 \u2192 't1'\nSo it has a production to 't1'. So if NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, and NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18, and NT14 \u2192 't1', that would make NT64's production: NT68 NT18 't1'. But NT68 \u2192 't3'. So NT64 \u2192 t3 NT18 't1'? Wait, no, each step is a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT64 \u2192 't3' directly. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look for NT64's productions again. From the list, under NT64, the productions are:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\nNT64 \u2192 NT19 NT48\nNT64 \u2192 NT69 NT65\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nSo those are the four options for NT64. None of these directly produce a terminal, so NT64 must be expanded into other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nLooking at NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18.\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'. NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38.\n\nNT50 \u2192 't4'. NT38 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38 \u2192 t4 t5.\n\nSo putting it together, NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18 \u2192 t3 NT18. And NT18 is t4 t5. So NT60 expands to t3 t4 t5.\n\nWait, or is that not correct? Let me see:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\n\nNT50 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, yes, NT18 becomes t4 t5.\n\nTherefore, NT60 becomes t3 t4 t5.\n\nSo, if NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, and NT60 becomes t3 t4 t5, and NT14 \u2192 't1', then NT64 \u2192 (t3 t4 t5) 't1' \u2192 t3 t4 t5 t1.\n\nBut wait, no: NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, which expands to (t3 t4 t5) 't1' \u2192 so the string generated from NT64 would be t3 t4 t5 t1.\n\nBut in the string, after t3 comes t1. Wait, but according to this, the first symbols would be t3 t4 t5 t1. So in the string, we have t3 t1... which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, let's see other options for NT64.\n\nAnother production for NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT19 NT48.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66.\n\nNT1 is 't3' because under NT1: NT1 \u2192 't3'.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT38 NT81.\n\nNT38 \u2192 't5', NT81 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo NT66 becomes 't5' 't3', so NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66 \u2192 t3 t5 t3.\n\nThen NT48. Looking at NT48: NT48 \u2192 't3' directly, from the list under NT48: NT48 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo NT64 \u2192 NT19 NT48 becomes (t3 t5 t3) 't3' \u2192 t3 t5 t3 t3.\n\nBut the string starts with t3 t1, which again doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong production for NT64.\n\nAnother production: NT64 \u2192 NT69 NT65.\n\nNT69 \u2192 't2' because under NT69: NT69 \u2192 't2'.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65. Hmm, that's a loop. Wait, under NT65, the production is: NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65. Wait, that's a problem. That seems like an issue because a non-terminal can't produce a shorter string if it leads to an infinite loop.\n\nLooking back, the production for NT65 is: NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65. That suggests it's recursive and may never terminate unless it's resolved by another production. Wait, but in the list, I see under NT65 another production: NT65 \u2192 't5'.

The string is `t3 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2 t0 t4 t2 t3 t1 t3`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has production rules that start with symbols like S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and others, and many of these rules produce two non-terminals, except some that produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of terminals: t3, t5, t3, t5, t3, t3, t2, t0, t4, t2, t3, t1, t3. Since each non-terminal production in CNF can only produce exactly two non-terminals or a terminal, I need to see if we can parse this string by following the derivation steps.\n\nI think the standard way to test this is to perform a top-down parsing, using the leftmost derivation, or alternatively, to use the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure about the details, so maybe I'll try to construct the derivation step by step.\n\nLet me list the production rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are multiple rules where non-terminals produce terminals, such as:\n- NT3 \u2192 t4\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT5 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t3\n- NT7 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t3\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT10 \u2192 t3\n- NT11 \u2192 t0\n- NT12 \u2192 t2\n- NT13 \u2192 t3\n- NT15 \u2192 t3\n- NT18 \u2192 t1\n- NT19 \u2192 t2\n- NT20 \u2192 t5\n- NT22 \u2192 t3\n- NT23 \u2192 t2\n- NT24 \u2192 t0\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT27 \u2192 t5\n- NT34 \u2192 t1\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT39 \u2192 t0\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT45 \u2192 t5\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT55 \u2192 t4\n- NT62 \u2192 t3\n- NT65 \u2192 t5\n- NT69 \u2192 t0\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT85 \u2192 t2\n- NT97 \u2192 t5\n- NT38 \u2192 t5\n- NT45 \u2192 t3\n- NT58 \u2192 t3\n- NT62 \u2192 t0\n- NT74 \u2192 t1\n- NT81 \u2192 t4\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n- NT97 \u2192 t3\n- NT33 \u2192 t3\n- NT42 \u2192 t1\n- NT48 \u2192 t3\n- NT60 \u2192 t5\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT77 \u2192 t3\n- NT84 \u2192 t4\n- NT99 \u2192 t3\n- And so on...\n\nWait, maybe I should map out which non-terminals produce which terminals because this could help in reconstructing the string.\n\nI notice that many non-terminals produce 't3', 't5', 't2', 't0', 't1', etc. So, perhaps the given string is built by choosing at various points non-terminals that produce the required terminal.\n\nBut let's try to approach this systematically. First, maybe it's possible to split the string into parts that correspond to the right-hand sides (RHS) of the production rules.\n\nSince the starting symbol is S, according to the given CFG, S can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, the first step would be to split the string into two parts, each part being derived from NT68 and NT63, or NT64 and NT78.\n\nWait, but the initial string is a single sequence of terminals, not split into two parts. So perhaps we need a production where each side of the RHS can derive a sequence leading to the terminals.\n\nFor example, if S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then we need to find if NT68 can derive a sequence of terminals that matches the first part, and NT63 can derive the second part. Alternatively, the same applies for S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo the string is of length 13: t3 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2 t0 t4 t2 t3 t1 t3. Let me count: that's 13 elements, but each production contributes two terminals on the RHS. Wait, but the starting symbol S produces two non-terminals, and each of those could produce one or more terminals.\n\nWait, according to the rules, in CNF, each non-terminal expands into exactly one terminal string of length 2^k, where k is the depth of derivation. So at each step, a non-terminal can only expand into exactly two non-terminals, until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, but in our case, the given grammar's rules either produce a terminal or two non-terminals. So, the initial S produces two non-terminals, say A and B. Then each of A and B can produce two non-terminals, and so on until the leaves are terminals.\n\nEach step builds a tree where each node has two children, and the entire tree must match the input.\n\nAlternatively, since S is the start, the RHS of S's production is two non-terminals, A and B. Then A and B each must derive into a sequence of terminals that, when combined, form the left half and right half of the overall string.\n\nSo perhaps the first step is to choose which production from S to use.\n\nLooking at the given CFG, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So perhaps we can try both options.\n\nLet me try expanding S \u2192 NT68 NT63 first and see if that leads to the target string.\n\nSo, S would be replaced by NT68 followed by NT63. Then each of these would need to derive into parts of the string.\n\nGiven the string is t3 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2 t0 t4 t2 t3 t1 t3, which is 13 symbols, which is an odd number, but since each production step (for non-terminals) leads to an expansion of possibly even number of symbols, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe each step leads to a concatenation of two parts, each of which is a sequence of terminals derived from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the initial expansion of S produces NT68 NT63. Each of these non-terminals could then derive into sequences. So NT68 would derive a sequence of terminals, and NT63 another. The concatenation of these two sequences must be exactly the given string.\n\nSimilarly, for S \u2192 NT64 NT78, the same process applies.\n\nSo maybe I'll start with S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, I need to see what NT68 and NT63 can derive. Let's look up NT68.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT68 \u2192 t3, according to the list provided. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nYes. So NT68 can directly produce 't3' as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the string should be 't3'. Let's check: the string starts with t3, so that's a match.\n\nNow, the second part is NT63. Let's see what NT63 produces.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT63 is present. Let's check: according to the rules, NT63 \u2192 't3' again.\n\nWait, the rule is:\n\nNT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nHm, that's an expansion into two non-terminals. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let's correct that.\n\nWait, when I first looked, I thought NT68 \u2192 t3, which is correct. So, when we replace NT68 with 't3', the beginning of the string is t3. Then, NT63 needs to produce the remaining part.\n\nBut looking at the given production rules, maybe I need to expand NT63 further.\n\nWait, looking at the specific rules given, the rule for NT63 is:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nWhich are both non-terminals. So, to get terminals, we'd need to expand NT84 and NT62.\n\nLet me look at NT84. According to the list, I see:\n\nNT84 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo NT84 can directly produce 't3'.\n\nSo, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62 becomes t3 (from NT84) followed by NT62, which itself can be expanded.\n\nWhat's NT62's rule?

{"custom_id":"request-214","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is `t5 t5 t5 t1 t5 t2 t3 t2 t5 t3 t1 t5 t0 t3`, and I need to determine if it's part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule either produces two terminals or two non-terminals. This form is particularly useful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to approach it step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The productions for S are `S -> NT68 NT63` or `S -> NT64 NT78`. So, the string must start with either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. Each of these then breaks down into other non-terminals or directly into a terminal (like t*, t5, etc.), depending on the rules.\n\nI need to see if each part of the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let's break down the string into individual tokens to see which parts are terminals and which might be non-terminals. However, some of the rules refer to other NT symbols (like NT64, NT68, etc.), which might need to be further expanded.\n\nI'll start by looking at the productions for the NTs that appear in the string. For example, NT68 might be a non-terminal that can be expanded into other symbols. I need to check how each part of the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the string: `t5 t5 t5 t1 t5 t2 t3 t2 t5 t3 t1 t5 t0 t3`.\n\nEach part is a single token, either a terminal or a non-terminal. Since the grammar uses NT followed by numbers, which represent non-terminals, I'll need to refer to the productions for each of these.\n\nStarting with the first part, t5. Let's look at the productions that result in t5. For example, NT9, NT45, NT72, and others. From the grammar, I see that NT39 -> t0, but that's t0, not t5. Maybe I can track back from the string to see which NTs could produce these t's.\n\nWait, I might need a better approach. Perhaps building a parse tree starting from S and seeing if I can reach this string. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t5, which could come from various NTs. Similarly, each subsequent part of the string must come from the expansion of the earlier non-terminals.\n\nI think I should try to reconstruct possible sequences that can generate parts of the string. For instance, looking at the first t5, which could be from NT39 -> t0, but that's t0, not t5. Alternatively, NT97 is t5, so maybe that's a possibility. Let me check the grammar: NT97 -> 't5'. So NT97 can produce t5.\n\nWait, but how do I reach NT97 from S? The start symbol is S, which expands to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nFrom NT68, looking at the productions: NT68 -> 't1', 't5', 't8', 't2', 't4', 't3', etc. Hmm. Wait, no, actually, looking through the list, I see NT68 has several productions:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT68 -> 't5'\n- NT68 -> 't6' (but doesn't seem to be in the list)\nWait, correction: Actually, looking through the provided productions, NT68 is a bit ambiguous. Let me search for NT68 in the provided rules.\n\nLooking through the provided NT rules:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT68 -> 't5'\n\nAh, so NT68 can produce 't5' or 't3'. So the first part of the string is t5, which could come from NT68 -> 't5'. That seems possible.\n\nThen the second part is t5 again. Let's see what comes after. The next production after NT68 would be another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to see a detailed breakdown. Since the string is a sequence of t5, t5, t5, t1, etc., each of these must be generated by the productions in the grammar.\n\nBut how exactly? Let's try to model each step.\n\nStarting with S.\n\nFirst production: S -> NT68 NT63. Let's see if that can generate the string.\n\nSo after S, we have NT68 and NT63.\n\nNT68 can be 't5' or other options, but we take 't5' as the first token.\n\nThen, NT63: Looking at the grammar for NT63: NT63 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT63 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, NT84: NT84 -> 't3' or other options, but let's see. From the list, NT84 has two productions: \n- NT84 -> 't3' and NT84 -> NT84 NT62 (recursive). But the recursive option isn't helpful because it would just get stuck, so we'll take NT84 -> 't3'.\n\nThen NT62: NT62 can be, for example, 't2' or other options. From the list, NT62 has:\n- NT62 -> 't6'? Wait, looking back, the provided rules for NT62 are:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT62: NT62 -> NT48 NT0, so it's a combination of NT62 leading to other NTs. But this seems like a more complex expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we're taking one of the options that produce terminals first.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Maybe tracking all possible expansions step by step is too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use dynamic programming or memoization, but that might be beyond my current capacity.\n\nAnother approach: Try to see if the string can be decomposed into parts that match the grammar's expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is composed of several units that can be generated by the grammar. Let's count the tokens: 14 tokens. Each production in the grammar either produces two terminals or two non-terminals. So each step in parsing uses one symbol and replaces it with two, thus increasing the number of symbols by one. Starting from S (1 symbol), after n steps, the number of symbols is 1 + n. Since the string has 14 symbols, we'd need 13 steps of expansion. However, the initial step would require replacing S with two non-terminals, leading to two symbols. So each production step doubles the number of symbols, and the count might not match neatly.\n\nBut wait, that's more about how parsing works. Let's think about the structure of the string.\n\nLooking at the string: 14 t's and numbers. Let's try to parse it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if the given string can be generated by writing out each step, but that might take too long.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the end of the string: the last token is t3. Let's see what can produce t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT32 -> 't4', NT69 -> 't0', NT98 -> 't2', NT74 -> 't3', etc. Wait, from the grammar list, I see NT22 -> 't5', NT27 -> 't5', NT26 -> 't1' or 't4', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules, there are multiple NTs that produce t3:\n\n- NT2: 't3'\n- NT72 -> 't0'\n- NT85 -> 't2'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT47 (various rules) -> 't3'?\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT47 has several productions, including NT47 -> 't5', so that's t5, not t3.\n- Not much is clear. Let me check which NTs produce t3.\n\nLooking through the provided NTs:\n\n- NT2 -> 't3' (yes)\n- Are there others? Let me see:\n\nLooking through each NT entry:\n\n- NT2 -> 't3'\n- NT3 -> 't4'\n- NT4: Not in the list\n- NT5: Not in the list\n- NT6: I don't see\nBut from the grammar list, after all the rules, I think only NT2 directly produces 't3'. The others may produce 't5', 't2', etc.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs produce different t's. For example, NT23 -> 't2', NT24 -> 't1', etc.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the string must derive through a series of steps that result in each token being produced by the NTs.\n\nWait, another thought: Since the grammar's start symbol is S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-218","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is `t3 t4 t3 t5 t5 t3 t3 t5 t4 t5 t5 t3 t0 t3`. It's a series of symbols, some of which are terminals like t0, t1, etc., and others might be non-terminals, but looking at the productions, most symbols seem to be terminals, except maybe some like S, NT62, etc. But in the string, we're seeing t's, so maybe the non-terminals are reduced to these t's through the productions.\n\nFirst, I should note that in Chomsky normal form, the start symbol can only have two non-terminals in its production. Looking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S, and its productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So S can only expand into these combinations, each of which are two non-terminals.\n\nNow, I need to see how this string could be derived. But given the complexity, maybe I should try to parse the string using the grammar or see if it can be built up step by step.\n\nLet me list the productions again to see what each non-terminal can produce. The productions include NT68, NT63, NT64, NT78, etc., many of which are mapped to t's. I can see NT68 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t5, NT64 \u2192 t5, NT78 \u2192 t3, and so on. Some of these non-terminals might produce t sequences, others might split further.\n\nThe string is 14 symbols long. Let me see where it starts: t3, t4, t3, t5, t5, t3, t3, t5, t4, t5, t5, t3, t0, t3.\n\nWait, I notice that the grammar might have rules that produce t's, like NT23 \u2192 t2, but in the string, I see t3, t4, etc. So perhaps each t corresponds to a production rule that eventually reduces to a terminal.\n\nBut maybe it's better to approach this by building the parse tree. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the parse tree should end at the start symbol S, with the leaves being these terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t3. I need to find a production rule that ends with t3. Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, NT23 \u2192 t2, but that's t2; what about other non-terminals? For example, NT52 can produce t2, but maybe I'm looking for t3.\n\nWait, from the productions, NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, and then NT74 \u2192 NT0 NT50, which might be more complex. Maybe it's easier to think about the top-down approach.\n\nStarting from S, which can be NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me see NT68 \u2192 t3, so the first symbol is t3, so the first part must be NT68. The second part must be NT63, which is t5.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t3 t4, so maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, the string is t3 t4 t3 t5 t5 etc. So the first symbol is t3, second is t4.\n\nWait, S can only expand into two non-terminals, so maybe the string can only have two non-terminals at each step, reducing them into terminals as we go.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which would produce t3 followed by what NT63 produces. Or if S is expanded into NT64 NT78, which would be t5 followed by something. But our string starts with t3, so maybe the first expansion is NT68 (t3) followed by NT63, which is t5. So the first two symbols would be t3 t5, but in the string it's t3 t4, so that's a problem.\n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe the string can't be generated by this grammar because the second symbol would have to be t5 if following NT68 NT63, but it's t4 instead.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the tree builds. Let me consider the first two symbols: t3 and t4. So maybe the S production is NT68 (t3) followed by NT64 (t5), but then the second symbol is t4, not t5, which contradicts that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT64 NT78, which would be t5 (from NT64) followed by something. But the string starts with t3, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe this isn't a leftmost derivation or something else. Maybe the grammar can have non-terminals that themselves produce further non-terminals, leading to more complex productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production of NT68 can produce more than one symbol, but in the grammar, each production seems to be a single symbol or a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, most of the productions are either to a terminal or another non-terminal. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3, so it's a direct production to a terminal. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, but the problem is that in the string, the second symbol is t4, which isn't the next symbol from S's expansion. So perhaps it's impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the NT68 and NT63 productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, yes, NT68 is mapped to t3 and NT63 to t5. So S as NT68 NT63 would produce t3 followed by t5, which is not matching the string t3 t4 t3...\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT64 NT78 would produce t5 followed by whatever NT78 produces.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the start symbol S, it has two productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the string must start with either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens: t3 t5 t2 t4 t3 t5 t2 t5 t3 t1 t3 t5 t3 t4 t3. So the length is 15 tokens.\n\nI think the way to tackle this is by using a parsing method. Maybe I'll try a recursive descent approach, where each production corresponds to a function that handles a certain part of the string.\n\nBut wait, parsing such a long string by hand might be error-prone. Maybe I can look for patterns or reductions that could help. Let's see.\n\nStarting with S, it's either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Both NT68 and NT64 are in the non-terminals. Let's see what they produce.\n\nLooking at NT68: it's S. Wait, no, NT68 is a non-terminal with production rules. Let me check the grammar. Oh, NT68 isn't listed as a non-terminal; instead, S is the start symbol. Wait, in the grammar, all the non-terminals are those with arrows from S or other non-terminals. Let me list them: NT62, NT63, NT64, NT65, NT68, NT69, NT74, NT75, NT78, NT81, NT94, NT19, etc. Oh, there are a lot.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parsing table or something, but that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can process the string step by step by seeing which non-terminals can produce the given tokens.\n\nEach production is either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 B C. Since all are length 1 or 2, the processing must follow these steps.\n\nThe string starts with t3. Let's see which non-terminals produce t3. Looking at the grammar, I see NT78 \u2192 t3, NT2 \u2192 t3, NT13 \u2192 t3, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT26 \u2192 t3, NT52 \u2192 t3, NT95 \u2192 t3 (Wait, is there an NT95? No, checking the grammar, NT95 isn't listed. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, terms that produce t3: NT78, NT2, NT13, NT68, NT26, NT52.\n\nSo the first token is t3, so the parser can start with any of these. Let's pick one, say NT2, which produces t2 and has productions NT2 \u2192 NT67 NT20. But wait, NT2 is one of the non-terminals, right? Wait, looking back, the first production of NT2 is: NT62 -> NT67 NT20.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each non-terminal has its own productions. Let me check, for example:\n\nLooking at NT2, I don't see it in the grammar. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all non-terminals:\n\nNT62, NT63, NT64, NT65, NT68, NT69, NT74, NT75, NT78, NT81, NT94, NT19, NT14, NT69, NT9, NT45, NT26, NT34, NT38, NT12, NT48, NT75, NT12, NT67, NT45, NT50, NT75, NT68, NT66, NT62, NT17, NT81, NT97, NT33, NT94, NT74, NT94, NT18, NT49, NT15, NT27, NT47, NT89, NT24, NT39, NT42, NT60, NT99, NT20, NT74, NT9, NT8, NT2, NT84, NT44, NT58, NT62, NT12, NT67.\n\nWait, maybe I should just go step by step.\n\nThe string: t3, t5, t2, t4, t3, t5, t2, t5, t3, t1, t3, t5, t3, t4, t3.\n\nFirst, after the first t3, the next token is t5. So the possible options are non-terminals that produce t3 followed by t5. But since the productions are left-associative and in Chomsky normal form, each step should take a pair of symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about each production as leftmost, so starting with S, which can go to two options.\n\nLet me try with the first production S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nSo, processing NT68 first. What can NT68 produce? Looking for NT68's productions. Wait, in the grammar, NT68 is one of the non-terminals. Let's check where NT68 is used.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT68 \u2192 t3. That's right there: NT68 \u2192 t3. So that's one option.\n\nSo the first step is NT68 \u2192 t3, matching the first token. Then, we need to process the remaining string: t5, t2, t4, t3, t5, t2, t5, t3, t1, t3, t5, t3, t4, t3.\n\nNow, the next symbol after t3 is t5. So now we're processing the NT63 non-terminal (since S \u2192 NT68 NT63). Wait, but after NT68, we have to process NT63 next.\n\nSo after NT68 is consumed (producing t3), the next non-terminal is NT63. Let's see what NT63 produces. Looking at the grammar, NT63 is: NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo, NT63 \u2192 NT84 and NT62. Both are non-terminals.\n\nSo, the parser needs to process NT84 and NT62 in order.\n\nBut wait, since our grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is a binary step. So, after producing t3 (NT68), the next step is to process NT63. So, NT63 must expand into two non-terminals: NT84 and NT62.\n\nSo, the string after t3 is t5, t2, t4, etc. So, after t3, we have to process t5, which is the next token, but NT63 is generating two symbols. So perhaps the next step is to see if NT63 can produce t5 and the next symbol. But wait, NT63 produces two non-terminals, so we need to see if the two symbols after t3 are the results of NT84 and NT62.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure this step by step.\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nProduces t3, and leaves to process NT63.\n\nStep 2: NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nSo, we need to process NT84 and NT62 as the next two symbols. The remaining string after t3 is t5, t2, ... So after t3, the next symbols are t5, t2, etc.\n\nSo, the next token is t5. So, NT84 must produce t5, and then NT62 must produce the next token, which after t5 is t2.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nAfter NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, the next two tokens are t5 and t2. So, NT84 produces t5, and NT62 produces t2.\n\nLooking for NT84's productions: looking through the grammar, I don't see NT84 being a terminal. Wait, but in the given grammar, NT84 \u2192 something?\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar rules, I don't see a production for NT84. So, maybe that's a problem. Because NT84 is supposed to be a non-terminal, but it doesn't have any production rules, which would mean it's invalid.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the grammar. Did I miss NT84?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT67 NT20\n\n- NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\n\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me see the string again: t3 t5 t3 t5 t2 t5 t3 t1 t1 t3 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3.\n\nI notice that the grammar's start symbol S branches into two possibilities. Let's see what each of them leads to.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n   - NT68 \u2192 t3\n   - NT63 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking up NT63: From the grammar, NT63 can produce NT84 NT62 and NT84 \u2192 t3. Also, NT63 can produce other things, but the only terminal production I see is NT84 \u2192 t3. So for NT63, one option is NT84 NT62, but if that can produce t3 and something, but I need to see if the whole S can produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, S can also produce NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me follow each path.\n\nFirst path: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 what? Well, NT63 can produce NT84 NT62, which would be t3 (from NT84) and then NT62 can produce t2 or other things. Alternatively, NT63 has another production: NT63 \u2192 NT93 NT66.\n\nLooking at NT93: From rules, NT93 \u2192 t3 t5. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, checking the rules for NT93: In the given list, NT93 isn't directly shown, but from the list, there's NT39 \u2192 NT27 NT97, NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66, and others. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look through all the NT rules and find which produce terminals.\n\nLet me try to find all NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking for NTs that have rules ending in a single terminal:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT78 \u2192 t2\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT38 \u2192 t5\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT18 \u2192 t1\n- NT97 \u2192 t5\n- NT85 \u2192 t2\n- NT98 \u2192 t5\n- NT62 \u2192 t2\n- NT74 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, maybe I should make a list of all NTs and their terminal productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to generate the string step by step. Let's take the first approach where S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3 (so the first token is t3, matching the string's first t3).\n\nNow, NT63: Let's see what it can produce. From the rules, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. NT84 \u2192 t3, and NT62 can produce t2 or other things.

{"custom_id":"request-257","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nThe given grammar has several production rules, and it's large, but I notice that some symbols are mapped to terminals. At the end, there are entries like S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and then each NT symbol maps to a specific terminal or another NT. For example, NT0 is 't4', NT2 is 't3', etc., and some NTs directly correspond to terminals like 't0', 't1', up to 't9'. So, the string I'm supposed to check is composed of these tX strings.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t3 t5 t3 t1 t2 t2 t3 t2 t3 t4 t5 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3`. Hmm, it's a sequence of these tX symbols. Wait, each 't' seems to be a terminal derived from a specific NT production. The task is to see if this sequence could be the output of the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary split, meaning each step of the derivation processes two symbols at a time. This suggests that a bottom-up or top-down parser with lookaheads (like CYK) could be used. But I'm more comfortable with top-down methods for this kind of analysis.\n\nLet me break down the grammar. The starting symbol is S, and the initial productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, the first step from S would be to split into two parts, each of which must be an NT production, leading to more splits. But since the string is given as a sequence of terminals, I need to see if it can be derived by expanding S step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT symbol eventually reduces to a terminal or another NT. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t5, etc. So, perhaps the entire string is built up by successively replacing NTs.\n\nLet me see the string again: t3 t5 t3 t1 t2 t2 t3 t2 t3 t4 t5 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3. That's 16 symbols. Since each production splits into two, the number of symbols doubles at each step, but since the grammar allows for left and right recursion, it's possible but not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be seen as a concatenation of certain NT productions. Let me check if the entire string corresponds to one of the initial productions or can be broken down accordingly.\n\nThe initial productions from S are:\n1. NT68 NT63 \u2192 t3 followed by the expansion of NT63, which is t5. So S directly becomes t3 t5 if NT68 and NT63 each reduce directly to terminals. But the string starts with t3 t5, so that's promising. But then, the rest of the string is t3 t1 t2 t2 t3 t2 t3 t4 t5 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3. That would imply that after t3 t5, another split occurs.\n\nWait, but S starts as NT68 NT63 (which is t3 and t5). Then, each of those NTs can lead to more NTs or terminals. So after the first split, we have t3 and t5, but then each of these could potentially split into more, but since the rest of the string is also terminals, perhaps each NT must directly go to a terminal. But looking at the grammar, some NTs go to other NTs, so this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string can be generated by a longer chain of splits. For example, if S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then NT68 splits into NT48 NT0, which then splits into NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT78, and so on, until we reach terminals. Similarly for NT63.\n\nThis could get quite involved, but let's try to see if the string can be built from the start symbol. Let me consider the string as a series of terminals, each corresponding to an NT.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the CYK algorithm, which parses strings for CFGs. Since the grammar is in CNF, CYK is applicable. So the steps would involve creating a table where each cell contains the NTs that can derive the substring from row i to j, and check if S is in cell (0, n-1).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed without writing down all the steps. Since the grammar is quite extensive, maybe it's better to look for any patterns or see if all the symbols in the string are covered by the possible terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the terminal mappings:\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs map to 't0' up to 't9'. For example:\n- NT0 \u2192 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT5 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 t3\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT10 (if any) but I don't see NT10 here. Wait, in the grammar, NT0 is present but others like NT10, NT11, etc., are not.\n\nBut the given string has all these 'tX's, and the only 'tX's present are some of these, but do all the Xs in the string correspond to existing NTs in the grammar? Let's check.\n\nThe string is: t3, t5, t3, t1, t2, t2, t3, t2, t3, t4, t5, t5, t2, t5, t5, t3.\n\nLooking at each 'tX':\n\nt3 appears multiple times: positions 0, 2, 6, 7, 9, 15.\nt5 appears in positions 1,4,8,10,11,12.\nt1 appears in position 3.\nt2 appears in positions 5,6,8.\nWait, no, t2 is at 5,6, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, do any NTs map to 't1' or 't2'?\n\nLooking at the mappings:\n- Yes, NT9 \u2192 t2 (from the list, NT9 \u2192 't5', no.

No. Wait, checking the mappings, it's not listed. Wait, in the provided mappings, looking for 't2' and 't1':\n\nLooking through all the lines under '\u2192':\n\nYes, multiple entries have specific terminals:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't1'\n- NT18 \u2192 't3'\n- NT45 \u2192 't3'\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT66 \u2192 't3'\n- NT62 \u2192 't2'\n\nSo, looking for 't1' and 't2' in the mappings:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't4'\n- NT19 (but it's mapped to 't5')\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT62 \u2192 't2'\n\nAh, so:\n\n- t1: NT24 \u2192 t1\n- t2: NT62 \u2192 t2\n\nSimilarly, 't3' is mapped to several NTs.\n\nBut looking back at the string: it contains 't1' at position 3 and 't2's at positions 5,8, etc.\n\nSo, the important thing is whether each 'tX' in the string is generated by some NT in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, 't1' is mapped only to NT24, and 't2' is mapped to NT62.\n\nSo, the string will be valid only if each 'tX' is indeed one of these NTs mapped to that terminal.\n\nWait, no.

It seems to be in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), where each non-terminal (NT) expands into exactly two non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals seem to expand into terminal symbols, indicated by the presence of 't' followed by a number, like 't5', 't3', etc. For example, NT75 can produce 't3'. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals, so I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar has two initial productions: S -> NT68 NT63 and S -> NT64 NT78. So, I'll need to see if the string can be broken down starting from either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t5 t5 t3 t5 t4 t1 t2 t5 t3 t2 t5 t4 t3 t2 t3. That's 16 symbols long. Since the grammar uses two symbols per production (CNF), I know the number of steps needed to derive the string should correspond to its length. However, the number of steps isn't as important as the structure of the tree and the terminal sequence.\n\nI'll start by checking if the initial symbols in the string correspond to the start symbols' expansions. S can produce NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. Let me look at what NT68 and NT63 expand into.\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n- NT68 -> NT45 NT47\n- NT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the grammar, NT63 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal? Looking back, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014that can't be. Wait, the grammar provided is perhaps a mix between terminals and non-terminals, but in CNF, each production has two non-terminals. Wait, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the grammar.\n\nLooking again: No, each production is non-terminals on the left, and on the right, it's either terminals or non-terminals. But in CNF, productions should be non-terminals expanding into two non-terminals. Wait, that doesn't seem right because terminals don't expand further. Hmm, maybe the grammar has both terminals and non-terminals, but some are written as non-terminals. This is confusing.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, many of the rules end with 't' like 't5', which I think are terminals. So, for example, NT75 -> 't3' is a production where NT75 is a non-terminal that expands into terminal t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT62 -> NT48 NT0, which are two non-terminals. NT0 is another non-terminal. Wait, but some non-terminals expand into terminals, others don't. So for example, NT75 -> 't3' is a terminal, while others produce two NTs.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, all productions must be two non-terminals on the right.

{"custom_id":"request-278","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to figure out if the string `t3 t5 t3 t5 t0 t2 t5 t2 t2 t5 t5 t3 t4 t2 t5 t3 t3` is generated by it. Hmm, let me see.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal on the left side expands into two non-terminals on the right side. So every production is of the form A \u2192 BC.\n\nThe start symbol in this grammar is S. The two productions for S are `S \u2192 NT68 NT63` and `S \u2192 NT64 NT78`. So, S can derive two sequences: one starting with NT68 and NT63, and another starting with NT64 and NT78.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's a sequence of t-scores. I see four 't's and several others. I think each t corresponds to a terminal derived from a specific production.\n\nLet me break down the string: it's 17 tokens. Let me count: t3, t5, t3, t5, t0, t2, t5, t2, t2, t5, t5, t3, t4, t2, t5, t3, t3. So 17.\n\nEach production either introduces two terminals or non-terminals. Since the string is made of t's, which must be terminals, I need to see if each t corresponds to a production that's completely terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I need to map the NTs to the t's. For example, NT68 seems to translate to 't3' somewhere. Let me check some rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that NT68 \u2192 't3' (multiple times, like in NT68 \u2192 t3). Similarly, NT63 \u2192 't3', NT65 \u2192 't5', NT52 \u2192 't2', NT26 \u2192 't2', NT97 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, but the grammar also has longer productions. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So if S expands, it will produce two NTs, which in turn expand further.\n\nSince the string is long, I think it's helpful to try to parse it using the grammar. Let me try to see if I can build the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which branches into NT68 and NT63.\n\nFirst, NT68 \u2192 t3, so that's the first token.\n\nThen, the second part is NT63. Let me see what NT63 does.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT28 NT42. So NT63 splits into NT28 and NT42.\n\nNow, NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT69. So NT28 becomes NT60 and NT69.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18. So NT60 splits into NT68 and NT18.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3, which is the second token in our string, but wait, we were on the second part of S, which is NT63. Hmm, no, wait, the first expansion is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so the first t3 is from NT68, then we have NT63.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire string is a single sequence, so maybe the parsing is more about how the NTs split into other NTs until they produce terminals.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: each production in CNF is binary, so each step either introduces two NTs or a terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if it can be generated by starting at S and expanding it until all are terminals.\n\nGiven that, the length of the string is 17 tokens. Each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by 1 because each production is binary (replaces one non-terminal with two). So the number of symbols increases exponentially.\n\nWait, actually, for a binary grammar, the number of symbols after n steps is 2^n. So starting from S, the first step gives two symbols, the next step can give up to four, and so on. So for a string of length 17, which is 2^4 = 16, so 5 steps would give up to 32 symbols, but 17 is an odd number, which complicates things a bit because each production is binary. So perhaps the string's length has to be 2^n -1, but 17 is 16+1, which is 2^4 +1, but 17 is 2^4 +1, which is 17. Wait, 2^4 is 16, so 16+1=17. But in binary derivations, the number of symbols should be 2^n, so maybe the string has a length that's not compatible. Hmm, that might be an issue, but maybe not. Or perhaps some NTs produce terminals, so the count could vary.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the string is a sequence of terminals derived directly from NTs, I need to see if the sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token: t3. Let me see where that comes from.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3 (multiple times). So after S \u2192 NT68 (t3), we need to derive the rest of the string from NT63.\n\nSo the entire string is t3 [from NT68] followed by t5, t3, t5, t0, t2, t5, t2, t2, t5, t5, t3, t4, t2, t5, t3, t3.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire string is a sequence of terminals generated from S. So it's the entire string as a single sequence, meaning that when I split S into NT68 and NT63, the NT63 part needs to generate the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no. Since S \u2192 NT68 NT63, the entire string would start with the two NTs expanding into terms.\n\nBut let me try to parse the string as if it's a derivation starting from S.\n\nThe string is: t3, t5, t3, t5, t0, t2, t5, t2, t2, t5, t5, t3, t4, t2, t5, t3, t3.\n\nSo the first symbol is t3. Let's see which NTs produce t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules: NT68 \u2192 t3 (e.g., NT68 \u2192 t3; multiple rules). Similarly, NT34 \u2192 t3? Wait, no, looking back, I see NT44 \u2192 t5, NT47 \u2192 t5, etc., but NT34 is only listed as producing NT1 and NT78, which might not go directly to a t.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see lines like NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78, but then I don't see NT34 directly mapping to a t. So maybe NT34 can't produce a terminal on its own; perhaps it requires further expansion.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the given rules again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT68 \u2192 t3, so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT63 also leads into t3.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I think NT63 \u2192 NT28 NT42, which then can expand further.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a series of steps in the derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63: so the string would be the concatenation of the expansions of NT68 and NT63.\n\nBut the string starts with t3. So S \u2192 NT68 (t3) and then NT63.\n\nSo the string continues from NT63, which expands into a sequence of terminals and NTs. Let me think about NT63 \u2192 NT28 NT42.\n\nNow NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT69, which would expand nt60 and nt69.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18, so nt60 becomes t3 and nt18.\n\nWait, no. NT60 \u2192 t5? Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any direct nt60 \u2192 t, but line 12: NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18, and later, NT18 \u2192 t etc.\n\nWait, let's correct this. For NT60, it doesn't directly produce a terminal. It needs two expansions.\n\nWait, for NT60, in the rules, I see multiple lines:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18 (earlier),\nand NT18 \u2192 many rules, but NT18 eventually leads to t1, t4, etc. For example, NT18 \u2192 t1 or t4, etc.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's get this straight.\n\nEach non-terminal must expand into two non-terminals, except when a rule for a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nSo, in our case, NT68 \u2192 t3, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S \u2192 NT68 NT63,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-280","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string we need to check is `t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t2 t0 t1 t3 t1 t3 t3 t1 t3 t1 t1 t3`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form is a specific structure where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or S \u2192 \u03b5, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So, all productions are two-symbol right-hand sides. This means that any string generated by such a grammar can be broken down into a sequence of these productions. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to have a mix of non-terminals on the left-hand side (like S, NT62, NT81, etc.) and several productions that result in terminal symbols. Each production either consumes two non-terminals or eventually leads to a terminal like 'tX', where X represents a specific token (like t0, t1, t2, etc.).\n\nThe string to evaluate has several 't' tokens: t3, t4, t2, t0, t1, etc. My goal is to see if these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it's useful to model the derivation as a step-by-step expansion. Each step either consumes two non-terminals or produces a terminal. Since the string is entirely terminal symbols, each symbol in the string must correspond to a production rule that directly results in that symbol.\n\nI start by looking at the first symbol, 't3'. I scan through the grammar rules to find which non-terminals can directly produce 't3'. Looking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT89 \u2192 t5\n- NT47 \u2192 t5\n- NT85 \u2192 t2\n- NT34 \u2192 t1\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n- NT48 \u2192 t3 (Wait, no, NT48 is a non-terminal on the left-hand side, and its rule is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or others. I need to check each rule ending with a terminal.)\n\nWait, I need to check each production where the right-hand side is a terminal. So looking for rules like NT... \u2192 tX.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t15 NT77, wait no, some rules have 't' as the result. Let me list the rules that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81 was a non-terminal rule. Wait, hold on, I need to find rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. Wait, in the initial part of the rules, I see a lot of NTs on the left and some have terminals, but actually, each production ends with either another NT or a terminal.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily the case. Let's read the rules carefully.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t5\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking through the rules, they don't all have non-terminals. Some rules, like NT82 \u2192 NT48 NT1, end with NTs. However, some rules may directly produce terminals. Wait, looking at the initial part:\n\nWait, the problem statement shows the grammar with rules; the first few are S \u2192 NT68 NT63, S \u2192 NT64 NT78, etc. Then, later, some rules produce 't' followed by numbers. For example, there's a line: NT8 \u2192 t5. So that is a production rule where NT8 is replaced by the terminal 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, other rules may have 'tX'. So I need to find which non-terminals produce which terminals. \n\nI can create a mapping of non-terminals to their possible terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through each rule, wherever the right-hand side is a terminal string (i.e., a single terminal like tX), that non-terminal can produce that terminal.\n\nWait, actually, some rules may have two non-terminals on the right, e.g., NT8 \u2192 t5, that's a single terminal, so NT8 \u2192 t5. Another example: NT69 \u2192 't2' is another production: NT69 \u2192 t2.\n\nWait, so each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 tX, where BC are non-terminals, or A directly produces tX.\n\nSo for each terminal tX in the string, I need to see if it can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t3, t4, t3, t3, t3, t2, t0, t1, t3, t1, t3, t3, t1, t3, t1, t1, t3.\n\nLet's index these for clarity:\n\n1: t3\n2: t4\n3: t3\n4: t3\n5: t3\n6: t2\n7: t0\n8: t1\n9: t3\n10: t1\n11: t3\n12: t3\n13: t1\n14: t3\n15: t1\n16: t1\n17: t3\n\nI need to see if each tX can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the t3 symbols. Looking at the rules that produce t3, I need to find which non-terminals have a production to t3.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT47 \u2192 t5 (no, that's t5)\nWait, wait, looking for each rule that produces 't3':\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT65 \u2192 t5\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT74 \u2192 t3\nOthers:\n\nLooking again through the rules I see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t3 (multiple times)\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n\nSo non-terminals that can directly produce t3 are NT38 and NT1.\n\nSimilarly, let's find t4 and t2 and t0:\n\nt4: Looking for rules that produce 't4'. I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t1\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- So NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT39 \u2192 t0\n- NT50 \u2192 t4 (I think, let's check the rules)\n\nWait, let me re-examine the rules step by step.\n\nWait, I think I need a better approach. To make it manageable, I'll list all non-terminals and their possible productions that result in terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar rules, wherever the right-hand side is a single 'tX', note that.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT68 \u2192 t3 (from line: NT68 \u2192 t3)\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81\n- NT31... Wait, let me parse each rule:\n\nWait, no. The entire set of rules is provided, but perhaps it's better to identify all the rules that have terminals.\n\nThe rules seem to be grouped as follows, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar defines a fixed set of terminals, and each non-terminal can produce exactly one terminal or is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. Let's scan through the rules to see which ones end with t.\n\nLooking at each rule line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n...\nEach of these is a production where the right-hand side is two non-terminals, as all starting rules have two NT on the right.\n\nBut then, looking further down, I see rules like:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't2' (last part of this string)\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't1' (multiple times)\n- NT85 \u2192 't2'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT97 \u2192 't5'\n- NT45 \u2192 't5'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' (wait, here: NT26 has two rules, one to NT39 NT81 and another to 't1' and 't4'?)\nWait, no\u2014looking at the given rules line by line:\n\nLooking through each rule, I noticed some have 't' on the right. For example:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t1\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\nWait, that can't be\u2014it must be either a non-terminal on the right or a terminal.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all right-hand sides are non-terminals except for the terminals. So, in the grammar given, each rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal. So, looking for rules with 't' as a terminal.\n\nFrom the given rules, I can extract all possible non-terminals that directly produce a 'tX':\n\nLooking through the entire list, I spot the following:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 t3 (Wait, no\u2014looking at line: NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81; that's two non-terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that most of the non-terminals (NT) produce pairs of other NT's or terminals. For example, S -> NT68 NT63, which means S must be followed by NT68 and then NT63. Then each NT has its own production, either to other NT's or to terminals like 't' and numbers which I assume represent the 't' tokens with specific indices.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of t tokens with numbers: t3, t4, t5, etc. My goal is to see if these terminals can be generated by the grammar.

Let me check the possible derivations:\n\nCase 1: S -> NT68 NT63\n\nNT68's production: Looking at the rules, NT68 -> 't3'. So the first part would generate t3. Now, the next part is NT63. Let's see what NT63 can produce.\n\nNT63: From the grammar, NT63 can go to NT84 NT62 or 't3'. Wait, no, looking more carefully: Actually, looking at the provided rules, NT63 -> NT84 NT62. So NT63 can only produce two NTs. Hmm, so S -> NT68 NT63 would produce t3 followed by NT84 NT62. So the second part after t3 is NT84 and NT62.\n\nBut the string next is t4, not NT84 or NT62, which are NTs. So the first token being t3 would require the second production to be NT84 NT62, which when expanded would yield two more NTs, but the next token is t4, not an NT. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that S is followed by two NTs. So the entire string should be built by expanding these two NTs each time they appear. So for example, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, which would mean each NT must be expanded into a terminal.\n\nSo let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is t3. Looking at the grammar, possible NTs that can produce t3 are:\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\n- NT68: 't3'\n- NT3: 't3'\n- NT2: 't3'\n- NT24: 't3'\n- NT8: 't3'\n- NT1: 't3'\n- NT75: 't3'\n- NT62: 't3' (Wait, no, NT62's productions are to NT48 NT0, NT0 is 't48 NT29' or something? Wait, let me check the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, each rule is given as \"NTx -> ...\", and sometimes a terminal, e.g., NT75 -> 't3'. So let me list all the NTs and their productions:\n\nI'll need to go through each non-terminal and note which can produce a terminal token.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT2 -> 't3'\n- NT24 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't3'\n- NT1 -> 't3'\n- NT75 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> 't3'\n\nOkay, those are all the NTs that can directly produce a 't3'. So when parsing, any time a 't3' appears, the parser can choose one of these NTs to expand.\n\nNow, let's parse the string step by step. The string is: t3 t4 t3 t4 t5 t3 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t2 t4 t4 t2 t3 t3 t3.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. The first token is t3. So the first NT must be one of those that can produce t3. Let's pick NT68, which directly gives t3.\n\nNow, the remaining string is: t4 t3 t4 t5 t3 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t2 t4 t4 t2 t3 t3 t3.\n\nAfter t3, the next token is t4. So the next NT must produce t4. Let's see which NTs can do that.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\n- NT45 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT26 -> 't4' (Yes, NT26 -> 't4')\n- NT55 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT38 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT18 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT77 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT97 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT99 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT47 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT74 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT33 -> 't0' (no)\n- NT81 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT26 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT12 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT48 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT75 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT52 -> 't2' (no)\n- NT9 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT85 -> 't2' (no)\n- NT32 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT60 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT99 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT20 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT74 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT9 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT84 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT44 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT58 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT45 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT26 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT39 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT47 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT89 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT34 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT42 -> 't1' (no)\n- NT60 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT93 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT52 -> 't2' (no)\n- NT26 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT39 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT9 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT8 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT2 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT84 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT75 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT33 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT94 -> 't2' (no)\n- NT1 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT24 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT55 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT84 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT44 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT58 -> 't1' (no)\n- NT62 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT23 -> 't2' (no)\n- NT9 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT85 -> 't2' (no)\n- NT32 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT26 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT17 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT81 -> 't2' (no)\n- NT97 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT33 -> 't3' (no)\n- NT94 -> 't2' (no)\n- NT72 -> 't0' (no)\n- NT58 -> 't1' (no)\n- NT34 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT42 -> 't1' (no)\n- NT60 -> 't5' (no)\n- NT99 -> '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is a non-terminal generating two non-terminals or a terminal. The string to test is `t5 t3 t3 t4 t3 t3 t4 t1 t2 t5 t5 t4 t3 t5 t0 t3 t5 t3 t3`.\n\nFirst, I should note that the grammar has several productions that directly produce terminals, which are the 't's and some numbers. For example, NT69 -> 't2', NT38 -> 't3', and so on. These are leaf nodes in the parse tree and correspond to the terminals in the string.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens. So, the parse tree should have 18 production steps because each step breaks down a node into two. Since each production starts with a start symbol S, which eventually splits into the terminals. The length of the string minus one should equal the number of productions, but let's keep that in mind.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production from S is either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, the first step is either S -> NT68 NT63 or S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't5'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't5'. Looking through the grammar, NT39, NT94, NT97, and NT33 all have 't5'. So, which one does it pair with?\n\nWait, in the string, the first two tokens are 't5 t3', so the first S production would split into two NTs. But since S is rewritten into two non-terminals, the string starts with two terminals, so we need to see what NTs can produce those.\n\nLooking back, the first production of S is either two NTs, which then break down further. Each NT will eventually produce some terminals. So the sequence 't5 t3' at the beginning suggests that the two NTs from S first step produce 't5' and 't3' in that order.\n\nLooking for an NT that can produce 't5' and another that can produce 't3'. Let's see:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT3 -> 't4' (Wait, no, NT3 is actually a non-terminal, right? Wait, checking the grammar again: NT3 is not terminal; the production is NT3 -> 't4'. So that's a terminal.)\n\nSo, NT9 -> 't5' is a production. So that's one possibility. The other NT should produce 't3'. Which non-terminals produce 't3'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, several have 't3' as a terminal:\n- NT2 -> 't3'\n- NT75 -> 't3'\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT98 -> 't3'\n- NT65 -> 't5' (so that's not it)\n- NT22 -> 't3' (wait, no, NT22 -> 't5')\nWait, let me check each production.\n\nYes, looking again, NT2 -> 't3', NT85 -> 't2' (no), NT52 -> 't2' (no), NT74 -> 't3', NT67 -> 't2' (no), NT44 -> 't4' (no), NT19 -> 't5' (no), NT18 -> 't5' (no), NT85 -> 't2' (no), NT34 -> 't1' (no), NT75 -> 't3', etc.\n\nSo possible NTs that produce 't3' include NT2 and NT74 and NT50?

{"custom_id":"request-318","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. First, I need to understand what the grammar is all about. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right. Some of these non-terminals, called terminals, seem to be actual tokens like 't3', 't5', and others. Others look like non-terminals, as they start with uppercase letters like S, NT62, etc. \n\nWait, actually, looking closer, many of them are non-terminals because the right-hand sides are non-terminals separated by spaces. For example, S -> NT68 NT63. So each non-terminal on the right can be expanded further, except some that have terminal tokens like 't3', 't5', etc. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t3 t5 t5 t4 t3 t5 t0 t2 t3 t4 t1 t3 t5 t3 t5 t5 t3 t2 t3. It's 19 tokens long. The grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT68 NT63. So the string must start with the expansion of NT68 and NT63.\n\nLet me start by looking at how NT68 and NT63 can produce sequences. NT68's production seems to be split, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT65 -> NT97 NT65\nNT69 -> NT26 NT42\nNT72 -> NT9 NT85\n...\nWait, not sure. Maybe I should look for the rules that produce each of the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me list out the string tokens: t3, t5, t5, t4, t3, t5, t0, t2, t3, t4, t1, t3, t5, t3, t5, t5, t3, t2, t3.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a production rule where the non-terminal expands into that token or further non-terminals. I need to see if the sequence can be generated step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So first, I need to expand NT68 and NT63 into the string.\n\nLet's see what NT68 can produce. Looking through the grammar, I can't find any rule where NT68 is on the left. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe NT68 is an abbreviation for something else. Wait, looking again, perhaps I missed it. Or perhaps the initial expansion is that S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which might produce sequences starting with NT68. But if NT68 doesn't have any production, that might be a problem. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides are split by spaces, so for example, NT68 might be a non-terminal, and its expansion is to other non-terminals or the terminal tokens.\n\nWait, actually, the initial grammar rules don't include NT68 as a non-terminal on the left. That means maybe NT68 is a dead end, as there's no production rule for it. Similarly, looking at NT63, it's not on the left of any rule either. That's a problem because that would mean NT68 and NT63 cannot be expanded further, but they are on the right side of S's production. So, how can the string start with t3, which is a terminal, but NT68 and NT63 cannot produce a terminal? Unless there's an error in how I'm interpreting the grammar.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe the right-hand sides are not necessarily two non-terminals separated by spaces. Wait, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are also non-terminals. But in the given grammar, some rules have a space between two non-terminals, which I think indicates that each rule is A \u2192 B C, with B and C as non-terminals. So, for example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would expand NT68 and NT63 each to other non-terminals until hitting terminals.\n\nBut if NT68 and NT63 are starting symbols and have no production rules, that means they can't be expanded, which would mean they produce themselves, leading to infinite loops. But in practice, this would mean that the grammar can't produce any terminal strings if S is always trying to expand into NT68 and NT63. That can't be right because the string provided does have terminal tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure. Let me re-examine. Each production is written as A \u2192 B C, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals, which themselves can be either terminals or non-terminals. For example, 'NT60 -> NT68 NT18' means NT60 can be expanded into NT68 and NT18. But when these non-terminals are themselves in the right-hand side, their own rules apply.\n\nBut if NT68 has no production rules (i.e., it's a terminal), but in the grammar as provided, NT68 is on the right side of S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then, the grammar as is can't produce any terminal string because S would expand into NT68 and NT63, which don't have further rules, leading to S being stuck, thus the language is empty. But that's not possible because the string provided is a 19-tokens long string of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check each line carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most lines are like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0. So NT62 can expand into NT48 and NT0. NT0 can expand into NT48 and NT47. NT48 can expand into NT1 and NT78. So that's a chain of expansions. But NT68 is on the right side of S, but there's no production rule for NT68.\n\nSo if NT68 has no rules, it's a terminal, which is not allowed because in CNF, all terminals must be single symbols, but you can't have non-terminals being terminals. So this seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the grammar is invalid or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals but without production rules, which would mean they produce themselves, but that's not allowed in CNF because the left-hand side must be a non-terminal, not a terminal. So, that suggests that S can't produce a terminal string, which would mean the language of the grammar is empty. But the given string is not empty, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nHowever, that might not be the case because perhaps somewhere in the expansions, the rules for NT68 and NT63 are defined. Let me scan all the rules again to see if any of the non-terminals expand to NT68 or NT63.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65\n- NT69 \u2192 NT26 NT42\n- NT72 \u2192 NT9 NT85\n- NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT85 \u2192 NT18 NT8\n- NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT78\n- NT69 \u2192 NT26 NT42\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9\n- NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\n- NT98 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n- NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90\n- NT90 \u2192 NT2 NT60\n- NT88 \u2192 NT45 NT47\n- NT96 \u2192 NT97 NT33\n- NT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94\n- NT13 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\n- NT75 \u2192 't0'\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> 't2'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT81 -> 't3'\n- NT97 -> 't5'\n- etc.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. I didn't properly note which non-terminals expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, going back to the grammar, some rules have a space, such as S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is a production. So S is a non-terminal, and the rules for NT68 and NT63 are in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking for NT68 and NT63 in the list of rules:\n\nLooking at all the lines:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- Other rules: for example, NT97 \u2192 't5' etc.\n\nSo, looking for NT68:\n\nLooking through all the grammar entries, do any of them start with NT68?\n\nYes, line 23: NT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nAh, okay, so NT68 is a non-terminal that can expand into the terminal token 't3'. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT66 \u2192 't3', NT62 \u2192 't2', etc., are terminating rules.\n\nSimilarly, NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-336","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the grammar is provided, and it's in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. That's helpful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t5 t5 t3 t3 t1 t5 t0 t3 t4 t0 t5 t1 t3 t3 t5 t5 t3 t5 t0 t3`. It looks like it's a sequence of tokens, possibly derived from terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a method like the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but maybe I can approach it more manually since it's a small string.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules and see which terminals are present. The string has tokens like t0, t1, t2, etc., so I should check if these terminals are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- There are several productions that result in terminals. For example:\n  - NT75 \u2192 't1'\n  - NT12 \u2192 't5'\n  - NT45 \u2192 't5'\n  - NT69 \u2192 't0'\n  - NT97 \u2192 't3'\n  - NT18 \u2192 't5'\n  - NT62 \u2192 't3'\n  - NT38 \u2192 't5'\n  - NT44 \u2192 't4'\n  - NT26 \u2192 't4'\n  - NT9 \u2192 't5'\n  - NT48 \u2192 't3'\n  - NT33 \u2192 't0'\n  - NT94 \u2192 't2'\n  - NT74 \u2192 't3'\n  - NT1 \u2192 't3'\n  - NT24 \u2192 't1'\n  - NT39 \u2192 't0'\n  - NT47 \u2192 't5' (appears in multiple places)\n  - NT2 \u2192 't3'\n  - NT85 \u2192 't2'\n  - NT32 \u2192 't4'\n  - NT55 \u2192 't4'\n  - NT63 \u2192 't3'\n  - NT99 \u2192 't5'\n  - NT84 \u2192 't3'\n  - NT45 \u2192 't5' (duplicate)\n  - NT18 \u2192 't4'\n  \nWait a second, looking at NT18. In the initial productions, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, etc. But in the grammar rules, NT18 is defined as NT67 NT28, which in turn is NT26 NT42, etc. But I don't see any production for NT18 that ends with a terminal like 't4'. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through each production, I see tokens like 't0', 't1', etc., but some non-terminals seem to lead to terminals. For example, NT75 \u2192 't1', NT69 \u2192 't0', NT97 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, but the initial productions S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78 might be the start. So, S is derived from two non-terminals. Let's see what those non-terminals produce.\n\nNT68 and NT63: Looking at the grammar, NT68 isn't directly defined as a terminal, so it must be derived from non-terminals. Similarly, NT63 is defined as NT84 NT62, which further breaks down.\n\nThis seems a bit complex, but maybe I can approach it by trying to trace backward from the string to see if it can be built up using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens: t5 appears 7 times, t3 appears 7 times, t1 appears 3 times, t0 appears 2 times, t2 appears 1 time.\n\nLet me check each token:\n\n- The first token is t5. From the grammar, several non-terminals produce t5. For example, NT3, NT89, NT26 (with some rules), NT9, etc.\n\n- The second token is t5 again.\n\n- Third is t3: produced by NT62, NT74, NT18, others.\n\n- Fourth is t3.\n\n- Fifth is t1: produced by NT9, NT24, NT1, etc.\n\n- Sixth is t5.\n\n- Seventh is t0: produced by NT69, NT33, etc.\n\n- Eighth is t3.\n\n- Ninth is t4: produced by NT39, NT26 (some), etc.\n\n- Tenth is t0.\n\n- Eleventh is t5.\n\n- Twelfth is t1.\n\n- Thirteenth is t3.\n\n- Fourteenth is t3.\n\n- Fifteenth is t5.\n\n- Sixteenth is t5.\n\n- Seventeenth is t3.\n\n- Eighteenth is t5.\n\n- Nineteenth is t0.\n\n- Twentieth is t3.\n\nThis is a lot, but perhaps I can construct an expansion step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nSuppose S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Let's see what NT68 and NT63 can produce.\n\nNT68: From the grammar, NT68 is defined as NT64 NT14. So S would be NT64 NT14 NT63.\n\nNT64 is defined as NT60 NT14. So now, S becomes NT60 NT14 NT14 NT63.\n\nNT60 is defined as NT68 NT18. But wait, NT68 is an issue because we already have NT68, which is getting more complex. Hmm, maybe this path is getting too deep. Alternatively, let's try another initial production.\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 is NT60 NT14, and NT78 is NT33 NT66.\n\nSo S becomes NT60 NT14 NT33 NT66.\n\nNT60 is NT68 NT18.\n\nNT14 is NT1 NT98.\n\nNT33 is NT13 NT94.\n\nNT66 is NT99 NT86, but wait, NT86 isn't defined here. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT66 is defined as NT62 NT44. NT62 is NT3 NT93, and NT44 is NT89 NT38.\n\nWait, this is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for known sequences generated by the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, I notice that NT18 is defined as NT26 NT42, which then breaks down, but I don't see a terminal in there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the grammar can produce a sequence of t's that add up correctly. Let's see, each non-terminal when expanded adds two symbols (if they're non-terminals) or a terminal. So the number of symbols in the derived string should be 2^N, where N is the number of non-terminals' steps.\n\nBut wait, the string length is 20. 2^N =20: N is approximately 4 (since 2^4=16, 2^5=32). So maybe around 5 steps.\n\nBut perhaps I should think about the count of each terminal.\n\nBut this might not be the most efficient way. Maybe instead, I'll try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t5 t3 t3 t1 t5 t0 t3 t4 t0 t5 t1 t3 t3 t5 t5 t3 t5 t0 t3.\n\nLet me try to group them.\n\nPerhaps look for parts that could be the result of a production rule. For example, t5 t5 could be from a non-terminal that expands to two t5s. Or maybe one non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nWait, another thought: in the grammar, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which could produce symbols. Looking at the string, t5 t5 t3 t3 ... Maybe I can see certain substrings.\n\nWait, another angle: The string has several t5's. Looking at the grammar, there are multiple non-terminals that produce 't5', like NT3, NT89, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find a way to break the string into sub-strings each corresponding to a production.\n\nAlternatively, I'll try to write the string and see if it can be divided into parts that correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, the string:\n\nt5, t5, t3, t3, t1, t5, t0, t3, t4, t0, t5, t1, t3, t3, t5, t5, t3, t5, t0, t3.\n\nLet me try to match from the beginning:\n\nStart with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string provided is a series of 't's and numbers, like \"t3 t3 t3 ...\". \n\nFirst, I recall that CNF is a specific way of writing grammars where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal. Or wait, no, in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can have a production to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the rules are indeed in the form of two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which means each step replaces a non-terminal with two others. So, the grammar is definitely in CNF.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is \"t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t4 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t3 t4 t1 t4 t2\". I notice that each token in the string is either a 't' followed by a number or the number itself. Wait, actually, all of them have a 't' except... Wait no, looking back, every symbol in the string is like 't3', 't5', etc. So, each element is a terminal symbol with a two-digit number? Or perhaps it's a single symbol consisting of 't' followed by a number? Oh wait, the grammar's right-hand sides are all combinations of non-terminals, and the terminals are those that appear on the right side as actual terminal symbols. Looking through the grammar, I see symbols that end with 't', like NT62 -> NT48 NT0, but wait, that's a non-terminal; no, wait, is any of these terminal?\n\nWait, the grammar rules are all of the form NTx_y \u2192 NTa NTb, except for those that end with 't', which might be terminals. Looking at the rules, I see NT62 -> NT48 NT0 and NT0 -> NT48 NT47. Hmm, but some symbols like NT62 have a 't' in the production as a terminal or not? Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, the right-hand sides seem to consist of non-terminals and some end with 't's. For example, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT69 -> 't2', NT74 -> 't3', etc. So, symbols like 't2', 't3', etc., are terminals. The other symbols, like NT62, NT48, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nSo, to process the string, each element is a terminal symbol that matches one of these 'tX' symbols. The string given is a sequence of such terminals, so we need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children, corresponding to the two symbols on the right-hand side of each production.\n\nSince the string has 20 symbols, which is even, that makes sense because each production step doubles the number of symbols, but in this case, since it's in CNF, each step increases the number by one. Wait, no, that's for derivations. Each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time. So starting from S, a single non-terminal, the first step has two symbols, then three, then four, and so on. But the string length is 20, which is odd, so that doesn't make sense. Wait, 20 is even, but considering the starting point, it's 1, then 2, 3, etc. So 20 would require 19 steps, which is fine.\n\nBut more importantly, to parse the string, I need to find a way to derive it using the grammar. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to find the structure step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t4 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t3 t4 t1 t4 t2\"\n\nEach symbol is a terminal, so each must correspond to some production in the grammar. Let's see what each 't' corresponds to. For example, t3 is a terminal. In the grammar, where does 't3' appear? Looking through the right-hand sides, I see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 't4'\n- NT95 \u2192 't5'\n- NT84 \u2192 't3'\n- NT47 \u2192 t5\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT69 \u2192 t2\n- NT74 \u2192 t2\n- NT85 \u2192 t2\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT62 \u2192 t3\n- NT97 \u2192 t3\n- NT81 \u2192 t4\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT98 \u2192 't2'\n- NT12 \u2192 't5'\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the terminals and their corresponding positions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, any non-terminal ending with 't' is a terminal. Let's list them:\n\n- 't2' appears in NT62 \u2192 't2', NT74 \u2192 't2', NT85 \u2192 't2', NT66 \u2192 't3', NT62 \u2192 't3', NT97 \u2192 't3', NT81 \u2192 't4', NT26 \u2192 't4', NT44 \u2192 't4', NT98 \u2192 't2', NT12 \u2192 't5', NT67 \u2192 't2', NT74 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, actually, the terminals are the symbols that are terminals, so looking at the right-hand sides, any symbol that ends with 't' is a terminal. For example:\n\n- 't3' appears in NT47 \u2192 't5', NT89 \u2192 't5', NT42 \u2192 't1', NT60 \u2192 't3', etc. Wait, no, the productions end with terminals like 't3' when they have a rule that ends with that. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should note which production rules result in these terminals. For example, NT47 \u2192 't5', NT50 \u2192 't4', NT75 \u2192 't3', etc. So each 'tN' corresponds to a specific non-terminal that is expanded into that terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each symbol must correspond to the production rules that generate those terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't3'. So one of the productions must generate 't3'. Looking through the grammar, NT68 \u2192 't3' (since S \u2192 NT68 NT63, but S is the start symbol, which is a non-terminal, so I'm confusing something here).\n\nWait, no. Let me look through the right-hand sides for each non-terminal:\n\nLooking at NT47: NT47 \u2192 't5', NT47 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nWait, no, in the right-hand sides, the terminals are specific. For example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't2'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT85 \u2192 't2'\n- NT66 \u2192 't3'\n- NT62 \u2192 't3'\n- NT97 \u2192 't3'\n- NT81 \u2192 't4'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n- NT98 \u2192 't2'\n- NT12 \u2192 't5'\n- ... etc., but actually, it's better to find a mapping from terminal symbols to non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each terminal is a two-character string like 't3', 't5', etc. So each terminal can be mapped to the non-terminal that produces it. For example, 't3' is produced by NT47, NT74, NT62, NT66, NT97.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't5', so that's 't5'\n- NT89 \u2192 't5'\n- NT42 \u2192 't1'\n- NT60 \u2192 't3' \u2192 't3'\n- NT99 \u2192 't5'\n- NT20 \u2192 't5'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT9 \u2192 't1'\n- NT8 \u2192 't3' \u2192 't3'\n- ... and so on.\n\nSo, the terminals are the two-character strings starting with 't', followed by a number. Each of these terminals is the result of a specific non-terminal. So, for example, 't3' is produced by NT60, among others.\n\nBut to parse the given string, I need to see if the sequence"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string we're checking is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, any string generated by S must start with either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's check the given string: it starts with t3, t5, t2, t4, t3, etc. Wait, no, the string is \"t3 t5 t2 t4 t3 t1 t2 t2 t3 t5 t5 t4 t0 t4 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t1 t3\", which actually starts with t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT68 and NT64 are non-terminals. I need to see which of these can produce a string that starts with t3. Let me see the productions for NT68 and NT64.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT84\n- NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\n\nSo, both NT68 and NT64 produce two non-terminals. Let's look at their children.\n\nFirst, for NT68:\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT84\nNow, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62 (according to the given productions). So NT63 is NT84 NT62.\n\nWait, this seems a bit cyclic. Let me try to follow this step by step.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider that each non-terminal on the right side of the rules needs to be expanded until we get terminals or reach the base case where a non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nWait, some of the non-terminals are actually terminals because they have productions that include 't' and numbers.\n\nLooking at the rules, some NTs have terminals like t0, t1, etc. For example:\n- NT69 \u2192 t2\n- NT75 \u2192 t5\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT84 \u2192 t3\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n- NT34 \u2192 t1\n- NT45 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t2\n- NT76 \u2192 t2\n- etc.\n\nSo, the strategy is to take each production and see if, through a series of steps, it can derive the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string represents a step-by-step expansion from the start symbol.\n\nBut this might take a while, but let's try. The string has 21 tokens, so it's a moderately long string. Maybe I can break it down into parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see which parts correspond to possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be efficient, but since the grammar isn't given as a table (it's more like a list of productions), it might be complicated.\n\nBut perhaps I can approach it by seeing if each token in the string can be matched by a production.\n\nWait, the string we have is t3 t5 t2 t4 t3 t1 t2 t2 t3 t5 t5 t4 t0 t4 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t1 t3.\n\nEach token is either a t followed by a number. So, to generate this string, each token is a terminal produced by each non-terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is a concatenation of productions.\n\nBut another approach is to consider that every time a production is used, it's replaced by two non-terminals, so the number of symbols doubles, but some non-terminals are terminals.\n\nBut maybe I can check the initial steps.\n\nWait, the given string starts with t3.

So, could NT68 and NT63 produce this?\n\nLet me check NT68:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT84.\n\nSo, the first symbol comes from NT63, which we'll need to expand.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t3, which matches the first token.\n\nThen, the second part comes from NT62.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93.\n\nNT3 needs to produce t5, as the next symbol is t5.\n\nLooking at NT93, it's in our rules: NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66.\n\nSo, NT93 \u2192 NT39 NT66.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT27 NT97.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT24 NT17.\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT60 NT9.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18.\n\nSo, this seems too complex, but perhaps I can map tokens.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\nt3, t5, t2, t4, t3, t1, t2, t2, t3, t5, t5, t4, t0, t4, t3, t5, t3, t3, t3, t1, t3.\n\nLooking at the start with t3, which would be NT68's first symbol (from NT84), then perhaps NT63's symbol.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.

Let's focus on the first symbol t3.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t3, which must come from NT68, because NT68's production is NT63 NT84, and NT84 is t3.\n\nSo, in NT68, the first part is NT63, which may produce the subsequent symbols.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nSo, the output is (NT68's string) followed by (NT63's string).\n\nThe first token in the string is t3, so that comes from NT84, which is the right-hand side of NT68.\n\nSo, as NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT84, the first symbol is from NT84, which is t3.\n\nThen, NT63 in NT68's production would generate the remaining symbols starting from NT63's next part.\n\nWait, so after NT84 produces t3, the next symbol comes from NT63's production.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo, NT63 produces t3 from NT84 and then NT62.\n\nSo, after t3, the next symbol should come from NT62.\n\nLooking at the string: after t3, it's t5.\n\nSo, NT62's first symbol should be t5.\n\nLooking at NT62's productions: NT62 \u2192 NT3 NT93.\n\nSo, NT3 would need to produce t5.\n\nLooking at NT3's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT47 -> NT89 NT38. Wait, but we have to see where 't5' comes from. Looking through the 't' token rules:\n\nLooking at the definitions, I see NT45->t5, NT55->t4, NT47->t5 in some cases. Oh, wait, looking through the rules, some non-terminals are productions that result in a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLet me go through the non-terminals and their possible 't' outputs:\n\n- NT45 -> t5\n- NT55 -> t4\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT58 -> t3, t4, etc.\n- NT15 -> t3\n- NT39 -> t0, t2\n- NT19 -> t3\n- NT60 -> t5, t3, etc.\n- NT22 -> t3\n- NT9 -> t5\n- NT85 -> t2\n- NT3: NT23 -> t2, etc.\n\nWait, let's look at all 't' rules:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT45 -> t5\n- NT55 -> t4\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT58 -> t3, t4, t5?\nNo, looking again: NT58 isn't listed. Let's recheck:\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT44 -> t4\n- NT15 -> t3\n- NT39 -> t0, t2\n- NT94 -> t2\n- NT60 -> t5, t3, etc.\n- NT1 -> t3, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem is that in the provided rules, some 't' tokens have multiple possibilities. Wait, the user provided a list of rules with the non-terminals and their possible expansions.\n\nLooking through the rules more carefully:\n\n- NT33 -> t0, t3 etc.\n- NT45 -> t5\n- NT55 -> t4\n- NT24 -> t1\n- Others: Looking for 't' expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules that have 't' as the first token:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT26 -> t4\nWait, no:\n\nWait, looking at each rule:\n\nNT75 -> 't0' \u2192 but that's when NT75 expands to 't0'\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for NT rules that produce 't' tokens.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT45 -> t5 \u2192 so when NT45 is expanded, it produces 't5'\n- NT55 -> t4\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT15 -> t3\n- NT39 -> t0, t2\n- NT94 -> t2\n- NT60 -> t5, t3, t0\n- NT1 -> t3, etc.\n- NT27 -> t5\n- NT89 -> t5\n- NT99 -> 't5'? No, NT99->t5. Wait, looking back: Wait, the last rule in the provided list is NT99 -> t5.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the user's provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT45 -> t5\n- NT15 -> t3?\nWait, let me parse each rule correctly.\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT45 -> t5 \u2192 so expansion is 't5'\n- NT55 -> t4 \u2192 't4'\n- NT24 -> t1 \u2192 't1'\n- NT15 -> t3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT39 -> t0, t2 \u2192 't0' or 't2'\n- NT94 -> t2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT60 -> t5, t3, t0, t7 (?), etc. Let me check: NT60 is defined as producing 't5', 't3', 't0', etc.\n\nOh wait, looking back, for example:\n\n- NT63 -> 't3' \u2192 't3'\nWait, but none of these directly produce the 't5' as the first token, except NT68 and maybe some other NT that produce 't5' early.\n\nLooking through the top-level productions:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63. So the first step is S produces NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, what is NT68? From the given rules, I don't see NT68 defined, but maybe it's part of another production. Wait, looking through the rules, I see each line starts with a non-terminal. So perhaps I'm looking at the rules as the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Wait, let me clarify: the grammar is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, S \u2192 NT64 NT78, and other rules define the production for each NT.\n\nWait, so for example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, and so on. So each non-terminal is defined by the rules, and when they appear, they expand further.\n\nSo S starts as NT68 NT63. What do NT68 and NT63 produce?\n\nLooking through the rules, I need to find the productions for NT68 and NT63.\n\nFrom the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 is not directly listed, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each line to see if any NT68 is listed. Wait, looking:\n\n- The first line is S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nWait, so the NT68 and NT63 would be part of S. But NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals, so they must have their own productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see, for example, NT68 is not present as a rule; perhaps it's part of another production. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the provided rules are from NT62 to NT99 and also some NT* to t tokens.\n\nWait, in the list:\n\nAfter the first line (S \u2192 NT68 NT63), the next lines are the productions for each NT. For example:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 (line: NT62 -> NT48 NT0),\n- NT63 -> something? Wait, looking through the list, I don't see NT63 -> ... in the user's data. That must be incorrect; perhaps there was a formatting issue.\n\nWait, the user's input starts with:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\nS -> NT64 NT78\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\nNT63 -> NT48 NT18? Or does it have a rule?\n\nWait, in the user's input, the lines after S are:\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\n...\nThen NT65 -> NT96 NT65\n...\nFinally, the last lines are:\n\n...\nNT99 -> NT72 NT55\nNT69 -> NT26 NT42\nNT77 -> NT33 NT97\n...\n\nWait, I don't see a production for NT63, except for NT62 and others. So that's a problem; perhaps they included only some rules. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and missed some lines. For the purposes of this analysis, I'll try to go step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can proceed by considering whether the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-381","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like `t5 t5 t0 ... t3`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for some rules that end up producing terminal symbols or the string is built from terminals. The grammar seems to have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, where the terminals are the 't' followed by a number, like 't5', 't0', etc. \n\nSince the string consists entirely of these 'tX' symbols, I suspect that the grammar must have rules where these terminals are produced. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example, S -> NT68 NT63, but NT68 and NT63 seem to produce other non-terminals until eventually, maybe there's a chain to a terminal. Wait, but in the given string, the only terminals are 't5', 't3', etc., so the grammar must derive the string from the start symbol S by fully expanding into these terminals.\n\nLet me see the steps. The string starts with t5, t5, t0, and so on. So I need to see if each of these 't's can be generated by the grammar. Each 'tX' corresponds to a specific non-terminal that is directly producing that terminal. For example, if NT38 -> 't3', then using this rule would produce 't3'.\n\nI should probably build a parse tree for the given string to see if it can be derived from S. Let's break down the string into its components:\n\nt5 t5 t0 t4 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t5 t4 t1 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3 t5 t5 t3 t4 t3.\n\nSo, 21 symbols in total. Each symbol is a terminal, which means each must be produced by a rule that terminates. The grammar has many rules, so I need to see how to break down each part.\n\nBut this seems complicated because the grammar is extensive, and I might need to do a lot of work. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be constructed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the string is of a certain length or structure that matches the grammar. Looking at the starting rules, S is defined as NT68 NT63. So S is two non-terminals, NT68 and NT63. Both of these must be expanded into terminals. Let's check NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT68 is defined as NT75 NT65. NT75 becomes 't1' (from NT75 -> 't2') and NT65 becomes 't5' (from NT65 -> 't5'). Wait, actually, in the grammar, some rules are defined as 'tX' for non-terminals. For example, NT75 -> 't1' is not a rule, but looking back, some rules are like NT97 -> 't5' and others.\n\nWait, no, the grammar list shows for example:\n\nNT19 -> NT1 NT66\n\nNT65 -> NT96 NT65\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the rules. Let me parse the grammar correctly. Starting from the top:\n\nThe production rules are listed as, for example:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\n\n...\n\nLooking at these, I see that most rules are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, except for some that end with a terminal. For example, NT88 -> NT45 NT47, but then NT45 and NT47 might expand further. Then, at some point, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT97 -> 't5', or NT23 -> 't2', etc.\n\nSo the plan is: to derive the given string, we need to expand S into NT68 NT63, then each NTX needs to expand into terminals or non-terminals, which further expand until all are terminals.\n\nSince the given string starts with t5, t5, t0, etc., let's check if these correspond to the terminals that can be produced from S's components.\n\nFirst component: t5. So, which non-terminal produces 't5'? Looking at the list, several nt's produce 't5'. For example:\n\nNT1 -> 't3'\n\nNT65 -> 't5' (Wait, looking at the grammar, does any rule produce 't5'? Let me scan the list.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't5'\n\nNT18 -> 't5'\n\nNT26 -> 't4'\n\nNT33 -> 't0'\n\nWait, let me go through each production:\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the production rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT1 -> 't3'\n\nNT2 -> 't3'\n\nNT3 -> 't4'\n\nNT4 -> 't3'\n\nNT5 -> 't4'\n\nNT6 -> 't5' (Wait, is that correct? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT2 -> NT67 NT20 (no terminal)\n\nNT20 -> 't5'\n\nAh, okay, NT20 -> 't5'. That's one that produces 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT33 -> 't0'\n\nNT44 -> 't4'\n\nNT52 -> 't2'\n\nNT97 -> 't5'\n\nNT38 -> 't5' (Wait, what's NT38's production? Looking back:\n\nYes, NT38 has several productions. For example, NT38 -> NT12 NT44 \u2192 So that's more about expanding into non-terminals. But also, NT38 can produce 't5' in some cases. Wait, no, in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see NT38 -> 't5' directly, unless I'm missing some.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nYes, looking through the NTx rules, I see that NT38 is present in several productions, but only some of them. For example:\n\nNT38 -> 't3' (looking again, no. Wait, no, the listed rules don't show NT38 -> any terminal. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking at the entire grammar list, I see:\n\nWait, for NT58 -> 't3' but NT58 is a different non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should not try to find each nt leading to terminals, but instead think of the entire derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a recursive descent approach, starting from the start symbol S and expanding it step by step.\n\nGiven the string is in length 21, let's count the 't's and see how the grammar can generate such a string.\n\nEach 't' is a terminal symbol, and each 'tX' must be produced by expanding a non-terminal to that terminal.\n\nSo, the string is made up of 21 terminals.\n\nLet me consider that S -> NT68 NT63. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT68 and NT63. Each of these must expand into sequences of terminals (and possibly more non-terminals).\n\nSo, if I can derive each of these, then the entire string is possible.\n\nFirst, NT68: Looking back, NT68 is defined as NT75 NT65.\n\nNT75 -> 't1', and NT65 -> 't5' (checking the grammar: NT65 -> NT96 NT65 \u2192 Wait, no, that's a rule but NT65 also is defined as NT97 NT62? Wait, no, looking back, I think I have a list.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. The grammar is as follows, but it's quite long. Maybe I can find how NT68 and NT63 derive into the required terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: see if the first few symbols can be generated and then proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if the given string is of the correct format based on the grammar's production rules.\n\nWait, I might be missing something. Perhaps I can look at how S branches down. Let's try to see:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nEach of these, let's see NT68 and NT63.\n\nNT68: From the grammar, looking at the production rules for NT68. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, looking back, the production rules are listed as:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo, S can be NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nWait, then for each case, I need to see if the string can be generated from one of these.\n\nLet me first consider S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nSo NT68 must expand to something that starts with t5, t5.\n\nNT68 is defined as NT75 NT65.\n\nSo NT75 and NT65 must each"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-377","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t2 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t4 t5`. That's a bit long, so I need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF structures each production rule as having exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly one non-terminal, terminal, or a concatenation of non-terminals on the right. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's written in a way where the productions are all in CNF. Each rule has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is a production with two non-terminals, and other rules like NT38 \u2192 't3' are productions where a non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nNow, the given string is in terms of these terminals: t3, t5, t2, etc. So, to check if this string is in the language, I need to see if it can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions until I reach the string.\n\nLet me write down the start symbol S and think about what it can produce. The initial productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, the start symbol can produce two different sequences of two non-terminals each. That means the first step is to expand S into one of these two options. Each of these options has two non-terminals, NT68 and NT63, or NT64 and NT78. So, we need to check if these can lead to the given string.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long, so expanding S might require multiple steps, possibly a binary tree-like expansion. Since the given grammar is in CNF, the derivation would be a leftmost derivation, and the number of steps would correspond to the length of the string divided by the average number of symbols per production. But let's see: each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (thus increasing the string length by 1 each time) or with a terminal (keeping the length the same).\n\nFor example, a production like NT68 \u2192 t3 would directly produce a terminal, but others like NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT63 would produce two non-terminals, each of which would likely be expanded further.\n\nBut the given string is of length 21. Let me count the tokens: the string is \"t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t2 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t4 t5\". Wait, that's 21 tokens. So, starting from S, each step either adds one token (if a production results in a terminal) or adds one token (since two non-terminals would each expand into one symbol each time, but when combined, they could build up. Hmm, maybe the derivation can be represented as a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal and has two children. The leaves would be terminals.\n\nWait, but in a leftmost derivation, each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal. So, starting with S, first expand S to either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's pick one, say NT68 NT63, and then expand NT68 and NT63 one by one.\n\nWait, but each production for a non-terminal is in CNF, so each production on a non-terminal either replaces it with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, each non-terminal in the string would correspond to a node in the parse tree, and the number of leaves would be the length of the string. But wait, the number of leaves in a binary tree with n internal nodes is n+1. So, the length of the string should be equal to 2^k where k is the number of expansions. But in this case, the string is 21 tokens, which is not a power of two minus one, which complicates things. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to parse the string by checking each production step, seeing if the first symbols can be matched by the leftmost applicable production.\n\nLet me list out the productions for the non-terminals in the grammar. For example, looking at NT68, it produces NT68 and NT63, but wait, no. Wait, NT68 is a specific non-terminal. Let me check the production rules for all non-terminals up to the terminals.\n\nWait, this seems quite involved. Perhaps another approach is to model this as a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser, but manually tracing this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, since each production either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals, the string must consist of sequences that can be built by replacing non-terminals step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me think about the number of non-terminals involved. Starting from S, which can be NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me take the first option: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, to process NT68 and NT63.\n\nWhat does NT68 produce? Looking at the grammar, NT68's productions are:\n\nLooking through the given rules: I see NT68 appears in some productions. Wait, let me search the grammar for NT68 as a left-hand side.\n\nWait, the first few lines of the grammar are:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\nS -> NT64 NT78\n... and so on.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT68 doesn't have any rules except perhaps in the middle. Wait, wait, the grammar is in a specific structure, perhaps a mapping. Wait, I need to look at each line, each being a production of the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking back, here's the list again:\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT68 NT63\nLine 2: S -> NT64 NT78\nLine 3: NT62 -> NT48 NT0\nLine 4: NT81 -> NT78 NT97\nLine 5: NT47 -> NT85 NT13\nLine 6: NT94 -> NT75 NT49\nLine 7: NT38 -> NT99 NT81\nLine 8: NT47 -> NT28 NT22\nLine 9: NT47 -> NT0 NT52\nLine 10: NT28 -> NT60 NT69\nLine 11: NT60 -> NT68 NT18\nLine 12: NT34 -> NT1 NT78\nLine 13: NT38 -> NT12 NT44\nLine 14: NT19 -> NT1 NT66\nLine 15: NT65 -> NT96 NT65\nLine 16: NT23 -> NT18 NT8\nLine 17: NT2 -> NT67 NT20\nLine 18: NT85 -> NT18 NT8\nLine 19: NT52 -> NT19 NT63\nLine 20: NT78 -> NT33 NT66\nLine 21: NT22 -> NT62 NT74\nLine 22: NT74 -> NT34 NT85\nLine 23: NT33 -> NT13 NT94\nLine 24: NT18 -> NT50 NT38\nLine 25: NT98 -> NT58 NT65\nLine 26: NT1 -> NT88 NT90\nLine 27: NT90 -> NT2 NT60\nLine 28: NT88 -> NT45 NT47\nLine 29: NT62 -> NT3 NT93\nLine 30: NT65 -> NT97 NT62\nLine 31: NT99 -> NT72 NT55\nLine 32: NT85 -> NT58 NT28\nLine 33: NT74 -> NT0 NT50\nLine 34: NT64 -> NT60 NT14\nLine 35: NT19 -> NT34 NT9\nLine 36: NT14 -> NT1 NT98\nLine 37: NT69 -> NT26 NT42\nLine 38: NT0 -> NT48 NT47\nLine 39: NT9 -> NT15 NT77\nLine 40: NT45 -> NT89 NT38\nLine 41: NT26 -> NT60 NT9\nLine"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That's quite a long string with 22 tokens. Each token represents a terminal in the grammar.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing can be done using the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for context-free grammars. However, doing that manually would be time-consuming, and I might make errors. Alternatively, I can simulate the process by trying to find a derivation path from the start symbol S that results in the given string.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nLet me consider both options and see if either can generate the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t3 t3. Let's see what the first two symbols tell us.\n\nFirst, consider production S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Let's see what NT68 and NT63 can produce.\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n- NT68 \u2192 t3 (from NT60 -> t5, but wait, looking at the rules, I see NT68 -> t3, which is a terminal. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\nNT68 is transformed into t3. So, NT68 \u2192 t3.\n\nSimilarly, check NT63. Looking up, NT63 is transformed into t3 because in the rules, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Then, NT84 \u2192 t3, and NT62 \u2192 t3. So, NT63 \u2192 t3 t3.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t3. So, if S \u2192 NT68 NT63, NT68 goes to t3, and NT63 goes to t3 t3. So, the first three symbols would be t3 t3 t3, but the actual string starts with t3 t3. That's a discrepancy because the string's first two symbols are t3 t3, but the production S \u2192 NT68 NT63 would give t3 followed by t3 t3, making three symbols. So that's a mismatch unless the second t3 is consumed, which would mean that the NT68's t3 is the first symbol, and NT63 starts producing the next symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t3, t3, t5, etc.\n\nWait, the string is: [t3, t3, t5, t3, t2, t4, t3, t3, t1, t3, t3, t5, t3, t5, t4, t5, t5, t4, t3, t2, t5, t0, t3]. Hmm, actually, I should note that the string is longer than 22 tokens? Let me count: I see 23 tokens. Wait, the user wrote it as `t3 t3 t5 t3 t2 t4 t3 t3 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t5 t4 t5 t5 t4 t3 t2 t5 t0 t3`. So that's 23 symbols. Okay, 23 symbols. So it's a string of length 23.\n\nNow, the grammar's S can expand into two non-terminals, each of which can produce terminals or non-terminals. Starting with S, we can choose NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLet me first check both options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3 (terminal)\n- NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNow, NT84 \u2192 t3 and NT62 \u2192 t3 t3.\n\nWait, so NT63 would lead to t3 t3. So, putting it together: S \u2192 NT68 (t3) * NT63 (t3 t3). So, the first three symbols would have to be t3 t3 t3. But the actual string starts with t3 t3, which is only two symbols. Hmm, that doesn't align because the first production would require three symbols right away. Unless, perhaps, NT68 is followed by NT63, which would require more steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should try this using the CYK algorithm.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Let's build a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t3, t3, t5, t3, t2, t4, t3, t3, t1, t3, t3, t5, etc.\n\nWait, let's try to match the first part.\n\nIf I suppose the first S \u2192 NT68 NT63:\n\n- NT68 yields t3. So the first symbol is t3 (matches the string).\n- Then we have NT63, which is NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, NT84 \u2192 t3, and NT62 \u2192 t3 t3.\n\nSo, NT63 would yield t3 t3 t3. Wait, that's three symbols. But the string's first two symbols are t3 t3. After the initial t3 from NT68, the next symbols from NT63 would be three, so the entire first three would be t3 t3 t3. But the string has t3 t3, so that's a mismatch. So, maybe it's better to try the other production for S.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me check what NT64 and NT78 produce.\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14.\n- NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98.\n- NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18.\n- NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38.\n- NT50 \u2192 NT58 NT65.\n- Wait, this is getting too nested. Let me see the terminals first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go step by step:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\n- NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38\n- NT50 \u2192 NT58 NT65\n- NT58 \u2192 NT58 cannot, but wait, NT58 \u2192 t3? Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT58 \u2192 t5? Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at NT58: the rule is NT58 \u2192 t5? Wait, no, in the given rules, I see:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT60\nNT58 \u2192 t3\nWait, looking back:\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\nIn the grammar, some of the rules are:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t0\nNT65 \u2192 t5\nNT18 \u2192 t5\nNT55 \u2192 t4\nNT75 \u2192 t1\nNT27 \u2192 t5\nNT47 \u2192 t5\nNT85 \u2192 t2\nNT34 \u2192 t1\nNT94 \u2192 t4\nNT72 \u2192 t0\nNT52 \u2192 t2\nNT89 \u2192 t5\nNT62 \u2192 t3 (Wait, no, in the rules, NT62 has multiple productions. Let me check more carefully.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of the terminal strings each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe grammar is provided in a list of rules. Let's go through them to map each non-terminal to their possible terminal sequences.\n\n1. NT68 \u2192 t3\n2. NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62; NT84 \u2192 t3; NT62 \u2192 t3 t3. So NT63 \u2192 t3 t3\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-416","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t5 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t5 t3 t5 t4 t5 t5 t3 t3 t3` is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier because the structure is straightforward.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial productions are S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the string must start with either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nThe string starts with t3. I need to check which NT symbols can produce t3. Looking through the grammar rules, I notice NT1 is defined as \u2192 t3, and NT2, NT4, NT8, etc., all have specific t's. So NT1 is one possibility.\n\nNext, I see that NT68 and NT64 can produce t3? Wait, no. Looking back, NT68 \u2192 t3, yes. Because in the grammar, I see NT68 is one of the rules for t3. Similarly, NT64 \u2192 t3? Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So after S, it's NT68 and NT63. So the first symbols after S would be the first symbols generated by NT68 and NT63.\n\nBut looking at the given string, the first token is t3. So let's see, if the first production of S is NT68 \u2192 t3 and NT63 \u2192 t5, would that work? Or wait, looking back, I see NT63 \u2192 t5 because in the grammar, NT63 is the NT rule that produces t5.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar has NT63 \u2192 t5 (from the lines: NT63 -> NT84 NT62, and further down, looking for t5): Oh, wait, in the given grammar, under NT62, there's a rule NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT63, and so on, but importantly, looking for t3, t4, etc., I need to see which NT symbols produce those.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut this is a bit complex because the string is 24 tokens long, and the grammar has many non-terminals and rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too short for certain paths. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for each token and see which NT can produce it, then track the non-terminals that are generated.\n\nWait, the string is: t3, t4, t5, t5, t3, t5, t5, t3, t3, t4, t4, t5, t5, t3, t5, t5, t3, t5, t4, t5, t5, t3, t3, t3.\n\nThat's 24 tokens. Let me count the positions:\n\n1: t3\n2: t4\n3: t5\n4: t5\n5: t3\n6: t5\n7: t5\n8: t3\n9: t3\n10: t4\n11: t4\n12: t5\n13: t5\n14: t3\n15: t5\n16: t5\n17: t3\n18: t5\n19: t4\n20: t5\n21: t5\n22: t3\n23: t3\n24: t3\n\nSo the string is long, so perhaps a bottom-up approach would be better, constructing a parse table and checking if the string can be reduced.\n\nBut with 24 tokens, that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps looking for certain patterns.\n\nWait, another approach is to check step by step:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nThe string starts with t3, which would have to come from NT68, because looking at the NT rules, only NT63 and a few others produce t3.\n\nWait, let me check which NT rules produce t3.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT18 \u2192 t3\n- NT48 \u2192 t3\n- NT24 \u2192 t1, so no\n- NT42 \u2192 t1\n- NT60 \u2192 t5\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT75 \u2192 't3' (as in, not a terminal, but perhaps a typo here because in the rule it's 't3' under NT75, which is a terminal. Wait, no, the NT75 has a rule NT75 \u2192 't3'? Or is it part of another rule?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT75 \u2192 't3'? Or is it that NT75 is one of the production that includes a terminal. Looking back:\n\nNT75 -> 't3' \u2014 so that's a production where NT75 directly produces t3. Similarly, NT68 is another NT rule that produces t3. So when S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then the first token is t3 (from NT68) and the second is what NT63 produces.\n\nLooking at NT63's productions: Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT63 having a production that starts as a terminal. Wait, no. Wait, NT63 is defined in the grammar as:\n\nNT63 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT63 isn't a terminal, it's a non-terminal. So the initial step would be S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then, the first token is t3 (from NT68). The next token is t4, which is from NT63.\n\nBut wait, NT63 is NT84 NT62, so both of those are non-terminals. So how do we get t4 as the second token?\n\nThis seems contradictory because NT63 cannot produce a terminal symbol directly. So perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps S cannot start with NT68 and NT63 because NT63 is a non-terminal which needs to expand into terminals. So perhaps the first production, S\u2192 NT68 NT63, would have the initial symbols as t3 (from NT68) followed by whatever NT63 produces. But NT63 cannot produce anything until it's expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is that the entire string must be generated by the grammar, so we need to parse it step by step, reducing the string as we go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to try to reconstruct a parse tree.\n\nLet me try to start:\n\nThe string starts with t3. So it must come from a non-terminal that produces t3. Possible NTs producing t3 include NT3, NT68, and NT18, NT60? Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nWait, NT3 \u2192 t3, and others like NT60 \u2192 t5, NT48 \u2192 t3, etc. So NT68 \u2192 t3, NT39 \u2192 t0, no. Wait, the NT rules for t3 are:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT18 \u2192 t3\n- NT48 \u2192 t3\n- Similarly, NT something else...

{"custom_id":"request-419","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string provided is `t3 t3 ... t2` (I count 23 tokens here). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This makes it easier for certain parsing methods, but for our purposes, it might help in constructing the derivation tree.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, I notice that all the productions start with capital letters (non-terminals) on the left, and the right-hand side is a combination of non-terminals and terminals. Some rules end with a terminal, like S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which seems to produce two non-terminals. Eventually, some non-terminals directly expand to terminals, such as NT75 \u2192 't1', which is a single terminal.\n\nThe string we're checking consists entirely of 't' tokens (t3, t4, t2, etc.) but let me look more carefully. Each token in the string is a 't' followed by a number, which I think represents a specific production rule that results in that terminal.\n\nI think the key here is to build the parse tree step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation should produce exactly two non-terminals, and the end of the process should result in the entire string being generated from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The initial rule for S is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So, every derivation must start with NT68 expanding into some terminal and NT63 expanding into another terminal, or something that eventually leads to them.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first three are t3, t3, t3. So perhaps that's the first few steps. Let me see where NT68 and NT63 expand.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT68 has two rules:\n1. NT68 \u2192 NT75 NT62\n2. NT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nSimilarly, NT63 has a rule:\n1. NT63 \u2192 NT81 NT78\n\nBut according to the string, the first token is t3, which would imply that S eventually expands to S \u2192 NT68 \u2192 't3'. So the first t3 is generated by NT68 expanding directly to 't3'.\n\nBut then, how do we get multiple t3s in a row? Let's think about the structure of the grammar.\n\nThe grammar likely requires that each step in the derivation only produces two non-terminals, and each of those can further branch. So to generate the string, each 't' must result from either a direct production of that rule or from expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nLooking deeper, I can check whether each 't' in the string corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. Each t token (t3, t4, t2, etc.) corresponds to a specific non-terminal that directly produces that token.\n\nFor instance:\n- t3 could come from NT68 \u2192 't3'.\n- t4 might come from NT58 \u2192 't4' or similar.\n- t2 could come from NT69 \u2192 't2'.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the string as a whole can be constructed by branching the productions correctly.\n\nThe string is: t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t1 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t2.\n\nI see that the first six t3s could potentially each be a direct production from NT68 \u2192 't3'. But each NT68 would require another symbol, which in this case is NT63.\n\nWait, no. The initial S is S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the first step is to have two symbols: NT68 (which can produce 't3' or more), and NT63 (which goes to NT81 NT78). So in the string, the first token is t3, which should come from NT68 \u2192 't3', and the second token comes from NT63.\n\nBut looking at NT63's productions, the only rule is NT63 \u2192 NT81 NT78. So NT63 doesn't expand to a terminal directly; it must go through NT81 and NT78. Therefore, the initial expansion of S would not produce a t3 and a bunch of other non-terminals, but rather more non-terminals.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the initial string because the first token is a t3. So perhaps NT68 is expanding to 't3' in the first step, and then NT63 is expanding further down the line.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with several t3s from NT68 expanding to 't3', but each expansion of NT68 \u2192 't3' would only contribute one t3 to the string. However, the string has six t3s in a row at the beginning. That would require that each of those t3s comes from NT68 expanding, but since NT68 must expand to two non-terminals each time, that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each step in the derivation produces two symbols (since the grammar is in CNF), so the string is built by expanding these step by step.\n\nLet me try to think of the parse tree for the string. The string is 23 tokens long, which suggests a certain structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first rule is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which gives two symbols. Then, each of these NT68 and NT63 would expand further.\n\nEach NT in the grammar, depending on the rules, can eventually produce a terminal or a combination. So the string must be built by recursively expanding these non-terminals.\n\nLet me see if each token in the string is a terminal that can be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. From the given grammar rules, we can see that many non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 't1'\n- NT69 \u2192 't2'\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2', 't4'\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT94 \u2192 't1' or 't2' or 't3' via rules\n- NT24 \u2192 't0' or 't1'\n\nWait, but the string only has 't3', 't4', 't2', etc. Maybe each t corresponds to a specific non-terminal, like 't3' is the result of a particular rule in the grammar.\n\nI think the way to proceed is to parse the string step by step, applying the grammar rules to see if each token can be generated, starting from the beginning.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n   Now, we have NT68 and NT63. We need to expand each.\n\n2. Expand NT68: possible rules:\n   - NT68 \u2192 't3' (directly)\n   - NT68 \u2192 NT75 NT62\n\n   Since the first token is t3, let's choose the second rule: NT68 \u2192 NT75 NT62.\n\n   So now, the string starts with t3, and the next part is NT75, NT62.\n\n3. Now, expand NT75: NT75 \u2192 't1', so the next token is t1. But in the string, after the first t3, the next is t3, not t1. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, that means my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe NT68 expanded to 't3' directly, without going through NT75 and NT62.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n   - Expand NT68 \u2192 't3' (so the first token is t3)\n   - Now, we have to expand NT63.\n\n2. NT63 \u2192 NT81 NT78\n   So now, the second token would come from NT81 and NT78.\n\n   Let's look at NT81: NT81 \u2192 't3'\n   So the next token after the first t3 is t3 from NT81.\n\n3. So now, after the first two t3s, we need to expand NT78.\n\n   NT78 \u2192 't3' (directly)\n   So the third token is t3.\n\n4. Now, we have expanded S as 't3' (from NT68) followed by 't3' (from NT81) followed by 't3' (from NT78). But the string has six t3s in a row, not just three.\n\nHmm, that suggests that each expansion of NT81 and NT78 is also contributing multiple t3s, perhaps recursively.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each expansion must split into two symbols each time. So the NT63 must expand into NT81 and NT78, each of which could then expand into terminals or other non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t3 t2 t2 t5 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t2 t3 t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3` and there's a pretty lengthy grammar with a bunch of productions leading to terminal symbols (like 't0', 't1', etc.) and non-terminals (S, NT62, etc.).\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given here seems to fit CNF since all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can approach this with a parsing method suitable for CNF, such as the CYK algorithm, but given that the string isn't too long, maybe a more manual approach is feasible.\n\nLet me look at the structure of the string. The string consists of a sequence of t's with numbers from 0 to 9. The terminal symbols in the grammar point to specific t's. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3, and some others lead directly to t0, t1, etc. So each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe string has 25 symbols. That's a fairly long string, but let's think about the grammar's structure. Starting from S, which can produce NT68 and NT63. So the first step is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nSo, whatever the string is, it must originate from one of these initial productions. Let me check the string. The first token is t3. Looking at the grammar, NT68 \u2192 t3, which matches. So if the first part is NT68 (t3), the rest should be NT63.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so the entire string would be generated by NT68 producing t3 and NT63 producing another sequence.\n\nSo, the string should start with t3, followed by whatever NT63 produces. Let me extract the rest after the first t3: the remaining tokens are t2 t2 t5 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t2 t3 t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire string is a single unit. So when the first production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then the entire string is the concatenation of NT68's derivation and NT63's derivation. So after the first t3 from NT68, the rest of the string should come from NT63.\n\nSo, the rest of the string after the first t3 is `t2 t2 t5 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t2 t3 t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3`.\n\nWait, but that's 24 symbols, but the original string has 25, which would mean NT68 producing t3 and NT63 producing 24 symbols. But I think that's not correct because S's production is two non-terminals, so each would produce sequences that when combined give the main string. So actually, the first symbol is t3 (from NT68), and the rest should form the string from NT63.\n\nBut wait, the original string is 25 symbols. If the first symbol is t3, then the remaining 24 should be generated by NT63.\n\nSo let's see what NT63 produces. Looking at the grammar, NT63 can be derived as follows: NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT0. So NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT0.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT1 NT78, and NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. Wait, let me look up the productions for NT48 and NT0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT78, NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47.\n\nSo starting from NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT78, then NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90, and so on.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this by building a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire process can be broken down symbol by symbol, considering that each step consumes a certain number of symbols.\n\nBut considering the string length, maybe I can look for patterns or sequences that match known productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent parser approach would help, though it might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t3, which is produced by NT68. So that's the first step. Now, the rest of the string after t3 is 24 symbols, which should be generated by NT63. Let's see.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT48 NT0.\n\nSo, after the t3, we have t2, t2, t5, etc. The first symbols after t3 are t2 t2 t5...\n\nLooking at the productions, NT48 produces a series of symbols. Let me see: NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT78. NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90. NT88 \u2192 NT45 NT47, and NT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be determined by checking whether the string is a possible concatenation of the derivations from NT68 and NT63.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a parse tree. Let's start:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- NT68 \u2192 t3 (so first symbol is t3)\n- NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n- Now we parse the remaining 24 symbols starting with t2.\n\nSo, after t3, the next symbols are `t2 t2 t5 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t2 t3 t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3`.\n\nSo the second symbol is t2. Let's see which NT can produce t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26 \u2192 t2. Also, looking at the productions, NT26 can be NT62 NT74, etc.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol after the initial t3 is t2, which would come from a non-terminal that directly produces t2. Let me check which non-terminals produce t2.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT98 \u2192 't4' (no)\n- NT62 \u2192 't2' (from NT62 \u2192 't2')\n- NT22 \u2192 't5' (no)\n- NT74 \u2192 't3' (no)\n- NT26 \u2192 't2' again.\n\nWait, from the grammar, NT26 has two productions: NT26 \u2192 NT62 NT74 and NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17.

{"custom_id":"request-461","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t5 t5 t3 t2 t1 t1 t0 t2 t3 t3 t2 t3 t4 t0 t4 t5 t3 t1 t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3 t0 t3`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Since it's in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that B and C can't be the start symbol. Also, the start symbol S has two productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, the starting point is S, which branches into these two options.\n\nThe string provided is a series of terminal symbols (t0 to t5) separated by spaces, which means each token is a terminal. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the approach here is to use a parsing method suitable for CNF, likely the CYK algorithm, but since I'm more comfortable with a top-down approach, maybe I can perform a derivation step by step.\n\nBut manually doing a full derivation for a string of 27 tokens might be tedious. Instead, perhaps I can build a parse tree or try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals (NT) are things like NT62, NT68, NT97, etc. Each has multiple production rules, some leading to other non-terminals, and some directly to terminals (t0 to t5). So, during the parsing, whenever I encounter a terminal, it has to match one of the productions for a non-terminal.\n\nI remember that in CNF, the leftmost derivation is used, so I start with S and expand the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nThe first step is to see if the first part of the string matches any production from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol S has two rules:\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, the string starts with 't5 t5 t3 t2 ...'. Wait, no\u2014the string is `t5 t5 t3 ...`, but I need to think about how the terminals are matched.\n\nWait, the first token is 't5'. So perhaps the first part is checking if the first two symbols match a production.\n\nWait, no\u2014because in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, so when deriving, each step produces two symbols. So for S \u2192 NT68 NT63, the first step would generate two non-terminals, which then each expand into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I need to look for sequences that can be produced starting with 't5', which would require that the initial symbols are generated by a non-terminal that can produce 't5'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, several NT have productions that include terminals. For example, NT65 \u2192 NT96 NT65, and later NT65 \u2192 't5'. So NT65 can produce 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, and then NT9 \u2192 't5'. Wait, no\u2014the productions are such that for example, NT9 \u2192 't5', NT45 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the first part of the string can be generated by one of the non-terminals. The first token is 't5', so looking for a non-terminal that can produce 't5' as the first symbol. For example, NT9 \u2192 't5', NT34 \u2192 't1', but that's not helpful. Wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, several produce to t3, t5, etc. For instance:\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n- NT12 \u2192 't5'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't1' under some productions\nWait, I need to list out the productions that end with terminals only.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to note all non-terminals that have a direct production to a terminal.

Let me check.)\n\nLooking back at the given rules, the rule for NT2 is: NT2 \u2192 NT67 NT20 and one of the terminals is 't5'? Yes:\nNT2 \u2192 't5'.

Each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which only has one non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two non-terminals: NT68 and NT63. So that's correct for CNF.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens, each of which must match the corresponding rule in the grammar. In this case, the string consists of tokens ending with 't', which suggests that each token represents a terminal. So, I'll need to check if each token in the string is the result of substituting a production that ends in the corresponding 't' version.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce a 't' with a digit. For example:\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT63 -> t3 (wait, no, checking the rules, looking at NT63 production: let me check the list again.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, some non-terminals produce specific t's:\n- NT65 -> t5\n- NT75 -> t5\n- NT1 -> t3\n- NT2 -> t3\n- NT48 -> t3\n- NT75 -> t3\n- NT9 -> t5\n- NT75 -> t1\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT66 -> t3\n- NT62 -> t2, but wait, looking again: NT62 -> NT48 NT0. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the tokens in the string are t3, t4, t5, etc. So each t in the string must correspond to the result of a production that directly ends with a 't' token.\n\nLet me list the rules that produce 't' tokens:\n\nFrom the grammar, here are the ones that produce 't':\n\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT69 -> t0 (Wait, no, looking at the rules, some produce 't':\nWait, re-examining the grammar, I see that some rules have an arrow to 't' followed by a number, but looking at the rules, it's more about how the non-terminals expand, but some directly produce terminal 't's. Wait, the problem seems a bit clearer.\n\nWait, actually, the way the grammar is written, the non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, and some rules produce terminals. But looking at the grammar, only the rules where the right-hand side is a terminal (without other non-terminals) would produce a single token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Looking again, the non-terminals are those with -> followed by another non-terminal or a terminal and possibly a number. For example, some rules look like:\n\n- S -> NT68 NT63\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT69 -> t0\n- NT60 -> t5\n- NT75 -> t1\n- NT77 -> t3\n- NT38 -> t3\n- NT81 -> t3\n- NT26 -> t4\n- NT28 -> t1\n- NT18 -> t4\n- NT98 -> t5\n- NT1 -> t3\n- NT2 -> t3\n- NT67 -> t2\n- NT66 -> t3\n- NT62 -> t3 (Wait, no: NT62 has a rule -> NT48 NT0. So it doesn't directly produce a 't' but goes to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps each production ends with a terminal, either as a single symbol or as a production to a 't' followed by a number. But that would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't' followed by a number in the production represents a terminal symbol with that number as its value. But the string given is just a sequence of 't's with numbers as arguments, like t3, t4, etc.\n\nWait, no. The string is a sequence of tokens like t3, t4, etc., each being a separate element. So in the string, each element is a production of NT->tX, where X is a number.\n\nSo for example, when the string has t3, that would correspond to a production like NT68 -> t3. Similarly, a t4 would correspond to some NT expanding into t4.\n\nSo each token in the input string represents a production path from the start symbol down to that terminal.\n\nFirst, the string is length 27, which would correspond to 27 productions. But in a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, each expansion increases the length by one, so the number of steps from S to the string is n-1, where n is the length of the string.\n\nWait, the initial grammar has S, and then S expands into two non-terminals, which in turn expand, etc. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with something, but since this is CNF, each non-terminal must be replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each non-terminal can only expand into two non-terminals (or a terminal). So each production is either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal.\n\nIn the given grammar, all rules are of the form A->BC, except for those that end with a terminal, but looking at the rules, it seems that most of them go from a non-terminal to two non-terminals, like S->NT68 NT63, which are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the last part, I see rules like NT38 -> t5, which is a production to a terminal. So these would be leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nTherefore, the string given is a sequence of terminal symbols, each of which must correspond to the leaves of the derivation tree, starting from S.\n\nTo validate whether the string can be derived, I need to see if there's a way to expand S into the given string according to the grammar.\n\nOne way to do this is to construct a parse tree, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can attempt to find a leftmost derivation path.\n\nThe string is `t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t4 t0 t4 t5 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t4 t3 t3 t5 t5 t3`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the start symbol S produces NT68 and NT63, which are two non-terminals. Each of these, in turn, must expand into other non-terminals, until the leaves are terminals.\n\nSo the first step is S => NT68 NT63. Now, each of NT68 and NT63 must expand into a sequence of non-terminals until they reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, we need to find if there's a way for NT68 and NT63 to derive a series of non-terminals that, when expanded, result in the given string.\n\nLet me first analyze NT68.\n\nNT68 -> NT69? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, I see that some of them are A->BC, so for NT68, possible rules:\n\nWait, checking the list again:\n\n- NT68 -> NT63 NT44\n- NT63 -> NT68 NT18\nWait, but according to the original grammar, the lines are:\n\nLooking at the provided rules, let's spot where NT68 is defined.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- S is defined first.\n- Then S -> NT68 NT63\n- Then a list of rules involving NT68, NT69, etc.\n\nWait, I'm looking for NT68's production.

{"custom_id":"request-483","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I'll take a deep breath and break down the problem.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. That's helpful because it means each production either is a terminal or two non-terminals. But wait, in the provided grammar, I notice there are a mix of productions that might have terminals or non-terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, most are in the form S \u2192 NT X, where NT is a non-terminal. There are some that seem to produce terminals, like NT62 \u2192 't' something or other. So, the grammar includes both terminals and non-terminals, so it's in CNF with some terminals at the base.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t5 t5 t2 t5 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t3 t2 t3 t3 t1 t3 t2 t1 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4 t3.\n\nThat's quite long. I think the approach is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe string seems to be a concatenation of 't's followed by numbers, so each 't' corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. The numbers are probably non-terminals that eventually derive into those terminals.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to build a parse tree for the string, starting from the beginning. Alternatively, since it's in CNF, we can process it step by step, checking if the string can be produced by the grammar using the given rules.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Maybe another way is to check for the number of symbols. Each production in CNF either produces one terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So for a string of length n, the derivation would have n-1 steps because each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nIn this case, the string has 30 symbols. So the derivation would have 29 steps. But going through each step manually would be too tedious. Perhaps I can look for patterns in the grammar or the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar's rules. Let me list out the possible non-terminals that derive into these terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, certain non-terminals are associated with specific terminals. For example:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't5' (appears in multiple rules)\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT69 \u2192 't4' or 't0'\n- NT75 \u2192 't1' or 't3'\n- NT81 \u2192 't2' or 't3'\n- NT60 \u2192 't3' or 't5'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2' or 't4' or others, like 't1' in some rules but also in others.\n  \nBut wait, looking at some rules more carefully, I see that NT0 is defined as NT48 NT47, and NT48 is t3, and NT47 is sometimes 't5' or other things. Wait, in the grammar, NT47 has multiple productions, including some that result in 't5'.\n\nWait, actually, let's look at NT47:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13\n- NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n- NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52\n- NT47 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52\n- etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I realize that some non-terminals may derive into t's. For example, NT38 can become 't3' or 't5' based on the rules. Similarly for others.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to find the starting symbol S and see what it can derive.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5, so perhaps it comes from one of these productions.\n\nLooking at NT68: from the rules, NT68 is part of several productions. Looking at NT68, I see it's in the production:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, NT68's production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78, so in general, NT68 as a non-terminal can only be part of those S productions?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar is given as a set of productions. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 B C or similar, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63. This is a production for S, which is the start symbol. So S directly can produce by these rules, but NT68 and NT66 may have other productions.\n\nWait, but to get down to terminals, perhaps I need to see if the given string can be built up using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a top-down parsing problem, but given the complexity, maybe I can look for patterns or repeated elements.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the string can be broken down into parts that align with the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t5 t2 t5 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t3 t2 t3 t3 t1 t3 t2 t1 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4 t3.\n\nHmm, that's 30 symbols. Let's see if I can group them in a way that matches some production rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nFirst two symbols: t5 t5. So maybe this corresponds to a non-terminal that produces t5 and t5. Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT65 \u2192 't5' or something like that, but wait:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I realize that NT38 \u2192 't3' or 't5', and NT45 \u2192 't5', etc. Hmm, perhaps the 't5's come from certain non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the grammar, NT94 sometimes produces 't1' or 't2', depending on the production. For example, NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49 or NT75 NT49 or something else. Wait, let's check NT94:\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT94 has:\n- NT94 \u2192 NT75 NT49\n- NT94 \u2192 NT18 NT8\n- NT94 \u2192 NT23 NT38\n- etc.\n\nBut in the string, we have t5 appearing multiple times in a row. Maybe those t5s come from a sequence of non-terminals that each produce a t5.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try to see if the entire string can be matched by some sequence of productions. Since it's in CNF, each step applies a rule that replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols (could be non-terminals or terminals). The top-down approach would start with S and try to expand it step by step to match the string.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to reverse the process, converting the string into a parse tree. But that might be complex without a parser.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a table of which terminals can be produced by each non-terminal and then check if the string matches any production sequence.\n\nBut since the grammar has a lot of non-terminals, this might be challenging. Alternatively, I can look for a possible parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me assume that the string starts with t5, which may be produced by NT68 or another non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT68 is part of S but not directly defined. Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me try to list all the productions that generate each terminal.\n\nLet me create a list of which non-terminals can derive into 't5' or other terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, any non-terminal that can produce 't5' would include NT47 (several rules produce 't5'), NT50 (NT58 \u2192 't3', but perhaps others), NT26 (several rules produce 't1' or other), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for a sequence of non-terminals that can produce the string. But this might take a long time.\n\nAnother approach: Notice that the string starts with multiple t5's. Let's see if t5 can come from NT47, which has some rules:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22 (but I'm not sure what those produce)\nNT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52 (if NT0 and NT52 produce t5, then yeah)\nNT47 \u2192 NT2 NT2 (but NT2 may not produce t5 directly)\nWait, looking up NT2:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT2 \u2192 NT67 NT20 or NT26 NT27 or NT17 NT24, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is not leading me anywhere.\n\nMaybe I can think recursively. For example, the first t5 must"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-474","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which makes it a bit clearer, but it still isn't too straightforward. The string we're looking at is a series of 't's followed by numbers, like \"t3 t1 t3 t3 t3 t2...\" and so on. Wait, actually, looking closer, I notice that each part after the 't's seems to be a single token, so the input string is a sequence like t3 t1 t3 etc. \n\nFirst, I need to parse each token to see if they match any of the production rules or terminals in the grammar. The grammar's terminals are the ones that directly produce the symbols, and everything else are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals (those that produce strings of digits) are things like 't0', 't1', up to 't9', but in the given grammar, some of them like 't0', 't1', etc., are defined further down. Wait, no\u2014terminals in the grammar are symbols that don't have production rules, so checking the grammar, I can see that any symbol on the right-hand side that is not a non-terminal is a terminal.\n\nFor example, in S -> NT68 NT63, S is a non-terminal. NT68 is a non-terminal because it has a production, but looking deeper, I see that NT68 and NT63 themselves point to other non-terminals: NT68 goes to S, which is already defined. Hmm, wait, no, hold on\u2014NT68's production is S, so that's cyclic. Similarly, NT63's production is also S. So this grammar is recursive and might have cycles. \n\nBut let's get back to the string. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, each starting with 't'. For example, the first token is 't3', second is 't1', then 't3', and so on. Each 'tX' seems to be a terminal because in the grammar, 't' followed by a number is a terminal. For example, 't0' is a terminal because it's defined as the terminal symbol. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I made a mistake. The grammar doesn't actually have any explicit terminal symbols except where it's defined. Wait, no, some of the productions end with a letter, like NT26 -> 't2'.\n\nSo I need to first identify all the terminal symbols in the grammar. Terminals are the leaves in the parse tree, meaning they don't have production rules. They are only the basic symbols, which in this case are the 't' followed by a number. For example, 't2' is definitely a terminal because it's produced by NT26, as per the grammar rules.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I have to see if each token is generated by some production. Let's break down the string token by token:\n\n1. t3: Is there a production for NT3 that produces 't3'? Looking through the grammar, I see NT38 -> 't3', but that means NT38 is a non-terminal that can produce 't3'. But wait, I don't see an NT3 production. Looking back at the grammar, there's an NT3 production? No, I don't see anything. Wait, no, let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 is mentioned in NT99 -> NT72 NT55, but none of these seem to directly produce 't3'. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT75 -> 't3', but NT75 is a non-terminal. Wait, actually, under NT18, it says NT18 -> 't1', so t1 is directly produced by NT18. Similarly, under NT65, it's written as NT65 -> 't5'. Hmm, wait a second\u2014probably each NT's productions end with a terminal, except for the non-terminals.\n\nLooking again, the non-terminals have production rules that split into other NT symbols, and terminals are those that directly produce numbers. For example, NT26 -> 't2', so 't2' is a terminal. Similarly, NT45 -> 't4', etc.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try to map out which NT's produce which terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT62 -> NT48 NT0 \u2192 so both NT48 and NT0 are non-terminals that lead into this production, but they themselves have their own contributions.\n\n- NT64 -> NT60 NT14. NT14 is another non-terminal, but NT60 leads to 't5' perhaps?\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me make a list of all the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each production on the right-hand side is either a non-terminal (NT##) or a string like 't3' or 't0' etc.\n\nSo 't0', 't1', 't2', up to 't9' are the only possible terminals. Other symbols like NT1, NT2, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, wait a second\u2014the right-hand side can sometimes have numbers as part of the production. For example, NT84 -> 't4', so 't4' is a terminal. Similarly, other NT symbols have production rules that result in these terminals. So each 'tX' is a terminal symbol.\n\nTherefore, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols (t3, t1, etc.), and the grammar must generate this sequence starting from S.\n\nSo now, I need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step. \n\nBut given the string is quite long, I should try to find a way to break it down. Maybe I can parse the string backward, starting from the right, using the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's see: the last token is 't3'. Which NT can produce 't3'? Looking through the grammar, NT38 -> 't3', so NT38 can produce 't3'. But does NT38 have a production rule? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, under NT38: NT38 -> 't3' \u2192 So yes, NT38's production can give 't3'. Then, the previous token is 't2' (second to last). What NTs can produce 't2'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT74 -> 't2'\n- NT94 -> 't2'\n- NT77 -> 't3' (so not for 't2')\n- NT88 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't1'\n- NT75 -> 't3'\n- NT1 -> 't3'\n- NT24 -> 't1' (wrong)\n- NT72 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't1' (wrong)\n- NT49 -> 't1' (wrong)\n- NT20 -> 't5' (wrong)\n\nSo, 't2' can come from NT26, NT74, or NT94.\n\nSo, let's see. Starting from the end:\n\n- The last symbol is 't3', so it's produced by NT38.\n\nThen, before that, 't2', which could be produced by NT26, 74, or 94. Let's assume it's NT26. So the part before NT38 must end with NT26.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can go deeper. Let's try to reconstruct a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, another approach is to build a parse table using the grammar, possibly using the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm trying to understand, maybe looking for a way to match the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each token can be matched by a terminal in the grammar and followed by a production.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to note that each symbol in the string is a terminal, so each must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. So, for each 'tX' in the string, there must be some NT that can directly produce 'tX'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can make a list:\n\n- 't0' is produced by NT96, NT26, NT33, NT65, NT74, NT99, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT72 -> 't0'\n\nSo 't0' is directly produced by NT72. Also, in other productions, for example:\n\nNT18 -> 't1'\n\nSo, to match 't3' at the end, I can see that NT68 and NT63 produce the start symbol S. But perhaps that's too far.\n\nWait, the initial step is S, which is in the string? Wait, no, the given string doesn't involve S. So, perhaps the string is generated by some derivation starting from S.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think recursively.

For example, from the grammar, terminal symbols like 't0', 't1', 't2', etc., are produced by certain non-terminals.\n\nI should check each 't' in the string and see if there's a production that outputs it. \n\nLet's list the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\n- 't0' \u2192 NT69, NT74, NT98\n- 't1' \u2192 NT75, NT94, NT99, NT18, NT51 (Wait, looking back, I see NT69 \u2192 't0', NT26\u2192't2', etc. Hmm, maybe I should make a map of each terminal to its possible sources.)\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't0', NT74 \u2192 't3', NT18 \u2192 't1', NT50 \u2192 't4', NT38 \u2192 't3', NT81 \u2192 't3', NT26 \u2192 't2', NT97 \u2192 't5', NT15 \u2192 't3', NT90 \u2192 't2', NT24 \u2192 't1', NT47 \u2192 't5', NT39 \u2192 't0', NT94 \u2192 't2', NT72 \u2192 't0', NT17 \u2192 't4', NT74 \u2192 't3', NT99 \u2192 't5', NT20 \u2192 't5', NT75 \u2192 't1', NT89 \u2192 't5', NT24 \u2192 't1', NT39 \u2192 't0', NT42 \u2192 't1', NT60 \u2192 't3', NT99 \u2192 't5', NT20 \u2192 't5', NT74 \u2192 't1', NT9 \u2192 't5', NT8 \u2192 't5', NT2 \u2192 't3', NT84 \u2192 't4', NT42 \u2192 't1', NT62 \u2192 't3', NT26 \u2192 't4', NT12 \u2192 't5', NT48 \u2192 't3', NT75 \u2192 't1', NT12 \u2192 't2', NT67 \u2192 't2', NT45 \u2192 't5', NT1 \u2192 't3', NT24 \u2192 't0', NT55 \u2192 't4', NT84 \u2192 't3', NT97 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't3', NT60 \u2192 't6' Wait, NT60 \u2192 't5'? I think I missed some.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nTerminals are the 't's and possibly others, but looking at the productions, it seems all terminals are 't0' to 't97', but the string only contains 't3' to 't5' and a few more. Let me focus on the ones in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t3, t5, t3, t5, t2, etc.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- t3 appears multiple times. Looking through the grammar, which NTs produce 't3'?\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 (I don't think this is relevant)\n- NT81 \u2192 NT78 NT97, and NT78 is further broken down.\n- NT47 \u2192 several rules. Looking for 't3':\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13, which produces 't5' and 't3'. So NT47 can produce 't5' and 't3'.\n\nWait, let me check each production for 't3':\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 \u2192 maybe leads to 't0' or other symbols. Not relevant for t3.\n- NT81 \u2192 NT78 NT97; both NT78 and NT97 produce t3 and t5. So NT81 could produce t3 or t5.\n- NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13: Both produce 't5' and 't3'. So NT47 can produce t3 and t5.\n- NT74 \u2192 NT34 NT85: NT34 is t1, NT85 is t2.\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9: NT60 is t3? Wait, NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18: which may lead to t3 or t1, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar, seeing if each symbol can be derived.\n\nGiven that the string is long, maybe it's easier to see if there's a pattern or if any part of the string can't be derived.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to count the number of NT symbols and see if it matches what's expected.\n\nWait, let's see how the start symbol works.\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nEach of these breaks down further. The first rule, for example, breaks into NT68 and NT63.\n\nNT68 can break down into NT94 and NT65 (from the rule NT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38; wait, actually, looking through the grammar, NT68 is broken down as NT64 NT14 \u2192 wait, maybe I need to correct this.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me see: The provided grammar has NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT47.\n\nYes, under NT68: NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT47.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 NT45 NT47 NT84 NT62.\n\nThen each of these can break down further.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38, so NT45 \u2192 t5 and NT38 \u2192 t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT47 can break into multiple options. Let's try to see.\n\nSo, from S, we have four NT symbols: NT45, NT47, NT84, NT62.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38: which is t5 (from NT89) and t3 (from NT38).\n\nNT47 can break into various options. For example, if we take NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13, then NT85 is t2 and NT13 is t3.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the entire string can be built this way. It might be getting too deep. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can simulate the leftmost derivation of the string, checking each step.\n\nBut this might take a lot of time, so perhaps I can look for any inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t3, t5, t3, t5, t2, etc.\n\nLet's see where each t could come from.\n\n- First symbol t3: So looking for where a non-terminal produces t3.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT26 can produce t5 and t4, so that's not it. NT47 can produce t3 via NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13 (t2 and t3). Wait, NT85 \u2192 t2, NT13 \u2192 t3. So NT47 \u2192 t2 t3? Or is it t3 t2? Wait, NT13 is t3 and NT85 is t2.\n\nWait, NT47 can produce t5 (if NT85 is t2 and NT13 is t3, then maybe not directly). Alternatively, NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22.

Each production rule has two non-terminals, and the terminal symbols include a bunch of 'tX' where X ranges from 0 to 99 and some single characters like 't' maybe. But wait, in the rules, I see 't0', 't1', ..., up to 't99', so I think the terminals are 't0', 't1', ..., 't99'. Additionally, the start symbol is S, which expands into combinations of NT (non-terminal) symbols followed by numbers, and some rules also have non-terminals like NT62, etc.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminal symbols. I need to see if this string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S according to the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nTo analyze the string, I'll write it down step by step and see if it can be built up by the grammar. Alternatively, I can consider the reverse: derive the string starting from S.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each 'tX' is a terminal, so each corresponds to a single production rule that ends with that terminal. For example, 't3' corresponds to any production rule ending with NT33 or similar? Wait, looking at the grammar, for each terminal like 'tX', there are multiple production rules that can produce it. \n\nLet me see an example: 't3' can come from NT38 (as in NT38 \u2192 t3) or NT47 (since NT47 can be t3), and so on. Similarly, each 'tX' has several possible origins.\n\nSince the string is a series of terminals, I can model this as a parsing problem where each step in the derivation corresponds to consuming two of these terminals as if they are produced by a production rule. But since the grammar is context-free, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of steps where each step combines two elements.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for a string of length n, the derivation would have n-1 steps, combining pairs of symbols each time.\n\nWait, let me think. The string has 30 't's. Let's count the number of terminals in the given string: Let's see, the string is `t3 t5 t5 t0 t3 t3 t5 t2 t4 t0 t3 t5 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t5 t4 t3 t3 t1 t4 t3 t3 t0 t3`. That's 30 terms. \n\nIn Chomsky normal form, each expansion step takes a symbol (non-terminal) and replaces it with two symbols (non-terminals or terminals). So, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each step adds one symbol, so the number of symbols increases by one each step. Therefore, to derive a string of n terminals, the number of steps required is (n-1). So, the initial S is one symbol. Then, after 29 steps, we have 30 terminals.\n\nBut it's not so straightforward because some of the non-terminals can only produce two non-terminals, which would then each eventually become terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a tree where each node is a non-terminal, and each step splits a node into its two children, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string by trying to find the possible production rules that could have been used to generate it. Let's look at the string and see if it can be split into pairs that match the possible production rules.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into possible pairs. The string is: t3 t5 t5 t0 t3 t3 t5 t2 t4 t0 t3 t5 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t5 t4 t3 t3 t1 t4 t3 t3 t0 t3.\n\nI'll list the positions:\n\n1. t3\n2. t5\n3. t5\n4. t0\n5. t3\n6. t3\n7. t5\n8. t2\n9. t4\n10. t0\n11. t3\n12. t5\n13. t5\n14. t3\n15. t4\n16. t5\n17. t3\n18. t3\n19. t5\n20. t4\n21. t3\n22. t3\n23. t1\n24. t4\n25. t3\n26. t3\n27. t0\n28. t3\n\nI need to see if this can be built by combining pairs that correspond to production rules.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. The first two symbols are t3 and t5. So I need a production that produces t3 followed by t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which production rules end with t3 and t5? Hmm, each production leads to two non-terminals or terminals. So to get t3 and t5, perhaps the rule that ends with a t. Alternatively, maybe the two symbols t3 and t5 can be part of a production.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is to see what production leads to two symbols that are the first two terminals in the string. But since the string is a sequence of terminals generated by the non-terminals, perhaps I should look for the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree from the bottom up would help, but that could be complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that each non-terminal production either generates two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, the string should be a leftmost derivation where each step consumes a non-terminal and replaces it with its two children.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can work backward by building a parse tree and see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the grammar is a right-linear grammar (each production has one terminal followed by a non-terminal, except some) but no, actually, the grammar seems to have two non-terminals on the right side of each production.\n\nWait, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, they all seem to consist of two non-terminals on the right side except for the ones that end with a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT62 -> NT48 NT0: both are non-terminals, so this is a A->BC production.\n\nAnother rule: NT64 -> NT78 NT76: same.\n\nThen there are rules that end with a terminal. For example, NT75 -> 't0', so this is a production A->a.\n\nSimilarly, NT38 -> 't3'.\n\nSo, these are the only productions that produce terminals. All others produce two non-terminals.\n\nSo, to generate a string of terminals, at each step, you must have a non-terminal that can produce a terminal, which would terminate that path, while other non-terminals still need to be expanded.\n\nTherefore, the string can be thought of as a series of terminals resulting from the derivation of the initial non-terminals.\n\nSo, let me attempt to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by a rule that has a production A->a, and these terminals should appear in the correct order.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt3 t5 t5 t0 t3 t3 t5 t2 t4 t0 t3 t5 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t5 t4 t3 t3 t1 t4 t3 t3 t0 t3.\n\nI need to find a way to split this into a tree where each split corresponds to a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be viewed as a series of binary decisions, each choosing a production rule that splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut given the length is 30, it's a lot to do manually. However, perhaps I can look for the positions of the terminals that can only come from certain production rules.\n\nFor example, the last symbol is t3. From the grammar, NT75 -> 't3', so that must come from NT75. Similarly, NT81 -> 't3', etc.\n\nBut in the string, the last t3 could be from NT75, which is a terminal. So, perhaps the last symbol in the string is the last step from NT75 -> t3.\n\nBut to have NT75 appear, then we need to expand it somewhere in the string before.

The production rules are all in CNF, meaning each production has either two non-terminals or two terminals.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: all t3, t5, t2, etc. It's a long string, 35 tokens to be precise. So the first thought is, can this string be derived from the grammar by expanding the non-terminals until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals?\n\nBut doing this step-by-step for such a long string manually would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way. Perhaps we can see if the grammar allows any rules that produce these terminals and if the structure of the string aligns with the possible derivations.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules and see how each non-terminal can produce the given terminals. For example, some of the non-terminals directly produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT64 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> NT48 NT0 \u2192 both NT48 and NT0 produce terminals, so this would be 't3' 't5'? Or wait, NT62 breaks down into NT48 (t3) and NT0 (t5), so it would produce 't3t5'.\n- NT63 -> 't3'\n\nWait, but the string starts with t3 t5, so maybe something like NT62 contributes that. Let me check the production rules to see what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- S produces NT68 NT63 \u2192 which would be 't3' 't3' \u2192 't3t3'.\n- The string starts with t3 t5, which is different. So S directly would produce 't3t3', not 't3t5'. Therefore, the initial step must involve some other production rules.\n\nWait, maybe I need to expand S into other non-terminals. S has two options: NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at NT68: NT68 -> 't3'. NT64 -> 't3'. So NT68 NT63 would be 't3' 't3' \u2192 't3t3'.\nNT64 NT78: both produce t3 and ... Let's see, NT78 can produce t3 or t5. Wait, looking back:\n\nNT78 -> NT33 NT66, which is t3 t3.\n\nWait, so NT78 -> 't3t3'. Therefore, NT64 NT78 would produce 't3t3t3' \u2192 but S is a combination of two non-terminals, so NT64 NT78 would be 't3t3', but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: each non-terminal in the production of S is replaced by whatever it produces. So S's right-hand side consists of two non-terminals. So, for example, if S picks the first production, NT68 and NT63, each would need to expand into a terminal or non-terminal sequence.\n\nWait, but in CNF, everything is two symbols. So perhaps the starting point S must expand into NT68 and NT63, which each are single symbols. Wait, no, NT68 is a non-terminal that produces a terminal. So NT68 -> 't3', and NT63 -> 't3'. So S's first option would produce 't3t3'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't3t5', which isn't 't3t3'. Therefore, S must choose the second production: NT64 NT78.\n\nWait, NT64 -> 't3', and NT78 can produce two things: either NT33 NT66 (which is 't3t3') or NT78 can produce t2 or t5? Looking back:\n\nWait, from the grammar, I think I might have misread some rules. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking at NT78: \n\nNT78 -> NT33 NT66: which is t3 t3.\nBut looking also:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see NT78: The rules listed for NT78 are NT33 NT66 and others, but in the initial list, NT78: \n\nWait, let's see: in the given grammar, under NT78, it's NT33 NT66 \u2192 t3 t3. Also, looking further:\n\nWait, at the end, under NT78, is there any production other than NT33 NT66? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> NT62 NT74\n- NT74 -> NT34 NT85\n- NT34 -> NT1 NT78\n- NT85 -> NT18 NT8\n- NT33 -> NT13 NT94\n- NT18 -> NT50 NT38\n- NT94 -> NT75 NT49\n\nWait, maybe that's not relevant. Wait, looking at the provided rules, after NT22: \n\nI see entries like NT68-> t3, NT64->t3, NT22->NT62 NT74, and so on. Back to NT78.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, under NT78: only NT33 NT66 \u2192 t3 t3. So NT78 can only produce t3 t3, or maybe is there another rule?\n\nWait, looking again: in the grammar, under NT78, the lines are:\n\nNT78 -> NT33 NT66\nBut perhaps that's all? Or am I missing something. Hmm, no, looking through the rules, I don't see any other productions for NT78 beyond that. So NT78 can only produce a single sequence: t3 t3.\n\nBut then, if S expands to NT64 NT78, that would be 't3' from NT64 and 't3t3' from NT78, making the production 't3t3t3t3', but as the string we're checking starts with t3t5, which isn't possible with that.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps NT78 can produce more than just t3 t3. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, under NT78, the lines are:\n\nNT78 -> NT33 NT66\nNT78 -> ... Is that all? Or is there a rule NT78 -> 't5'? Let me check the full list. Wait, in the grammar, the lines include:\n\n- NT81 -> NT78 NT97\n- NT74 -> NT34 NT85\n- NT97 -> 't5'\n- NT85 -> NT58 NT28\n- NT28 -> NT60 NT69\n- NT69 -> 't0' ... and so on.\n\nWait, I think earlier I may have missed a production for NT78. Let me scan through the entire grammar again.\n\nLooking for NT78:\n\nWait, yes, in the grammar, under NT74, 74: NT74 -> NT34 NT85.\n\nWait, but looking back, under NT78, the only rule is NT33 NT66. So no, NT78 can only produce 't3t3'.\n\nWait, that complicates things because S's second production (NT64 NT78) would be 't3' and 't3t3' \u2192 't3t3t3t3', which doesn't match the string's start of 't3t5'.\n\nHmm. So perhaps there's a different path. Alternatively, maybe the string starts with a longer sequence.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps S can't produce 't3t5' directly with either of its two options. So maybe I need to look deeper into the grammar to see if any other non-terminals can produce 't5' and fit into the required sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t5?\n\nLet me see: each non-terminal and its production rules.\n\nLooking through, I find:\n\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT39 -> 't0'\n- NT34 -> 't1'\n- NT47 -> 't5'\n- NT48 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no, actually CNF allows each production to have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal as the single symbol, but since the start symbol S can produce NT68 NT63, which are non-terminals, that's fine.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t symbols, which are terminals, each taking one production. Since the string is a series of terminals, the derivation has to go through the productions step by step, each time replacing a non-terminal with a sequence that ends in terminals.\n\nLet me look at the string again: it's a series of 27 't's, each with values 3,4,0,4,2,5,1,3,5,5,1,3,... all the way to the end. The key here is to see how each of these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think it's helpful to reverse-engineer this. Starting from the start symbol S, which branches into NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Both NT68 and NT64 are on the left, so each of these can be part of the derivation.\n\nLet me see the productions for NT68 and NT64. \n\n- NT68: from the list, I see NT68 -> NT61 NT96.\n\nWait, I need to check all the production rules for NT68. Looking through, I see NT68 has several productions, but the relevant one for NT68 is likely to be ones that lead to terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT68's productions, I see:\n\n- NT68 -> NT61 NT96\n- Also, I think there's another production for NT68 that's not shown here, but according to the initial problem statement, the grammar is complete as provided. So I have NT68 -> NT61 NT96 and possibly another one. Wait, the initial user might have only provided a subset, but in the given grammar, under NT68, there's NT68 -> NT61 NT96, but no others. So maybe that's the only production for NT68, meaning that we have to see if NT61 and NT96 can produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking back at the given grammar, under NT68, the only production is NT68 -> NT61 NT96.\n\nSimilarly, NT64 is another non-terminal in S -> NT64 NT78. Checking NT64, I see:\n\nWait, the initial string provided is S->NT68 NT63 and S->NT64 NT78. So S can go to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, I need to see what NT63 and NT78 produce.\n\nLooking up NT63: in the given grammar, NT63 has the production NT63 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nAnd NT84 has production NT84 -> NT63 NT86. Hmm, but NT63's production leads back to itself via NT84, which is a problem because that could lead to infinite loops. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing some other productions for NT63. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking through, I find NT63 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nThen NT84 has several productions:\n\n- NT84 -> NT63 NT86\n- NT84 -> NT25 NT29\n- Also, looking further, NT63's production is NT84 NT62, which would lead to NT84 and NT62.\n\nWait, then to derive a terminal, we need to have a production that directly converts a non-terminal to terminals.\n\nLooking deeper into NT84's productions:\n\n- NT84 -> NT25 NT29\n- NT25 -> NT85 NT38\n- NT29 -> NT72 NT55\n\nSo NT25 and NT29 each produce a combination of non-terminals. Let's check NT85 and NT38.\n\nNT85 has productions:\n\n- NT85 -> NT58 NT28\n- NT58 -> NT18 NT8\n- NT28 leads to: NT60 NT69.\n\nWait, but NT28 in the grammar is NT28 -> NT60 NT69. So NT60 and NT69.\n\nLooking back at NT60, which has production NT60 -> NT68 NT18.\n\nThis is getting quite tangled. Maybe I should approach this differently by analyzing the given string step by step.\n\nThe string is t3 t4 t0 t4 t2 t5 t1 t3 t5 t5 t1 t3 t3 t3 t1 t1 t5 t3 t3 t1 t3 t4 t2 t5 t0 t4 t2 t0 t3.\n\nLet's break it down into indices: positions 0 to 26, each a terminal.\n\nEach step in the derivation would produce two terminals or more, but given the string is a single sequence of terminal symbols, the derivation must follow a path where each step produces exactly the terminals in the order of the string.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the leftmost derivation would replace a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals, and thus the number of symbols increases by one each time. However, in our case, since the string is entirely terminals, the derivation must ultimately exhaust all non-terminals into terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, each production produces two non-terminals, so each step would increase the number of symbols by one. Starting from S, we have two non-terminals. Each derivation step would replace one of them, increasing the count. To reach 27 terminals, starting from two, we'd need 25 steps, each replacing one non-terminal each time.\n\nBut let's think about how each non-terminal can derive into just terminals. For example, NT33 has production NT33 -> NT13 NT94, but NT94 -> t2. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT94 -> NT75 NT49, but wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check again.\n\nNo, actually in the given grammar, NT94 is listed as NT94 -> NT75 NT49. But then NT49 is NT49 -> t1. NT75 -> t1 as well. So NT94->t1 t1. So NT94 can terminate as t1 t1.\n\nWait, but to get a single terminal symbol, like t3, each non-terminal in the derivation must eventually resolve into a single terminal. However, in the given grammar, many non-terminals have productions that result in two non-terminals, so each step increases the count until it finally resolves to a terminal.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to note that the string consists of a sequence of t's that must correspond to the terminals produced by the non-terminals in a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps we can try to see if the grammar can produce such a sequence by checking if each terminal can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string:\n\nThe string is:\nt3 t4 t0 t4 t2 t5 t1 t3 t5 t5 t1 t3 t3 t3 t1 t1 t5 t3 t3 t1 t3 t4 t2 t5 t0 t4 t2 t0 t3.\n\nThat's 27 t's. Let's see the count of each type:\n- t0 occurs: positions 2,17,26: 3 times.\n- t1 occurs: positions 5,9,10,11,12,13,16,22,25: 9 times.\n- t2 occurs: positions 4,18,23,26: wait, 4,18,23,25: 4 times.\n- t3 occurs: positions 0,7,14,15,19,20,21,24: 8 times.\n- t4 occurs: positions 1,3,16: 3 times.\n- t5 occurs: positions 6,12,13,17,21,24: 6 times.\n\nWait, but each production in the grammar leads to two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly leads to a terminal, but in the given grammar, all the productions seem to lead to two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules, most of them are e.g., NT68 -> NT61 NT96, which produce two non-terminals each.

Scanning the rules, I see:\n\n- NT47 -> NT85 NT13\n- NT81 -> NT78 NT97\n- NT18 -> NT50 NT38\n- NT45 -> NT89 NT38\n- NT19 -> NT1 NT66\n- NT94 -> NT75 NT49\n- NT67 -> NT27 NT94\n- NT27 -> NT97 NT97\n- NT72 -> NT9 NT85\n- NT97 -> 't3'\n- NT38 -> 't3'\n- NT81 -> 't3'\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- NT77 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't0'\n- NT44 -> 't4'\n- NT3 -> 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT55 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't3'\n- NT97 -> 't3'\n- NT13 -> 't3'\n- NT60 -> 't3'\n\nSo, there are multiple ways to get 't3'. For example, NT97, NT38, NT81, NT47 (if the other part is 't0'), or others. But since 't0' is a terminal, I can't have that unless it's directly allowed. So, I can start with, say, NT97, which directly gives 't3'. So the first symbol matches NT97, and I can proceed.\n\nNow, after 't3', the next symbols are 't4', 't3', etc. But wait, after 't3', I have to look at the grammar to see what can follow. For NT97, the production is either 't3' or NT75 NT49. NT75 is 't1', and NT49 is 't1'? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking back, NT75 -> 't1', and NT49 -> 't1'? Or is it 't1' somewhere else? Wait, let me look again. Ah, in the grammar, NT75 is: `'t1'`. So, NT75 is 't1', and any production that goes through NT75 will have 't1' as one of the terminals. So NT75 NT49 would be 't1' followed by whatever NT49 produces.\n\nBut in the first symbol, I used NT97 -> 't3', so the first 't3' is consumed, and now we have to parse the rest starting from NT97 again or a different non-terminal. Wait, that might not be the right approach. Maybe I should consider that after the initial NT97, the next symbols can be generated by other rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial string can be split into parts that match the grammar. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe string is: t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t4 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t2 t3 t3 t4 t3 t1 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t4.\n\nThis is a long string, so it might help to parse it from left to right, trying to match the start symbol S and its productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S -> NT62 NT63, or S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part of the string is t3 t4 t3... Let's see if S can start with NT62 or NT64.\n\nNT62 can be broken down into NT62 -> NT48 NT0. So that would be a non-terminal NT62 followed by NT48 followed by NT0. But NT48 and NT0 don't directly produce terminals, though NT48 can be broken down further.\n\nWait, but let me check NT62's productions. Wait, in the grammar, looking again, I see:\n\nNT62 -> NT39 NT39\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT62 -> NT39 NT39\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the provided grammar.\n\nYes, looking through the list, I see NT62 -> NT39 NT39.\n\nBut what does NT39 produce? Checking the list, I don't see NT39 in the provided rules. Wait, perhaps it's a mistake. Looking again, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me look again for NT39. Scanning the list, I see rules like 'NT33 -> NT13 NT94', 'NT44 -> 't4'', etc. I don't see an NT39 rule in the provided list. That could be a problem. Because if NT39 doesn't exist, then any production leading to NT39 is invalid.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, NT62 is given as:\n\nNT62 -> NT39 NT39\n\nBut since NT39 isn't in the rules, that production is impossible. So wait, that might mean that the provided grammar is incorrect because NT39 is missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list, under NT62, it says: NT62 -> NT39 NT39. So unless that's a typo, and the correct production is NT62 -> NT39 NT39, but NT39 isn't present. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar provided by the user is incomplete. Because if NT39 isn't defined, then that production rule would be invalid. So the grammar as given doesn't have a definition for NT39, making any string that needs ND62 -> NT39 NT39 invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user made a mistake in writing NT39. Maybe it's NT33? Looking back, let me check.\n\nLooking at the provided list, I see NT33 -> NT13 NT94, which is a valid rule. So perhaps the user intended to type NT39 as NT33. But that would still be an issue because NT33 is different from NT39.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is different, and NT39 is defined as something else that I'm missing. Let me check the list again carefully.\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT33 -> NT13 NT94\n\nThat's it. So NT39 is not there. Therefore, the NT62 production I've mentioned can't exist because NT39 is undefined. Therefore, the parser can't proceed with that. Hmm, so this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the initial problem. Let me double-check. The user provided the grammar as:\n\nThe grammar is as given, but let me recount the rules starting with the top.\n\nS -> NT62 NT63\n\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT18 -- Is that correct? Wait, in the initial list, I think I might have misread it.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nThe initial grammar as provided by the user includes several rules, starting from S.\n\nBut when I start scanning, it's important to get the numbers right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the rules:\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS -> NT62 NT63\n\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nThen NT61? Or perhaps I miscounted. Wait, looking at the provided list, the first few rules are:\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT18\n\nNT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nWait, I might have misread NT62 and NT63.

{"custom_id":"request-534","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the top-level production is S, which splits into NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So S produces two non-terminals each time. My string starts with 't3 t5 t2...', so maybe we'll have to derive through these non-terminals and check if we can get to terminals.\n\nI think the best way is to build a parse tree starting with S. Let's see:\n\n1. S can become NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Let's pick the first option for now: NT68 and NT63.\n\nLooking at NT68, I don't immediately recognize it as a terminal, so I need to see its production. Scanning through the rules, I see NT68 -> NT26 NT42. So NT68 becomes two non-terminals.\n\nBreaking down NT68 into NT26 and NT42. Now, looking at NT26: it can be 't4' or be NT32 NT17 or other options. But since the string starts with 't3', maybe NT68 needs to produce a different path.\n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. Maybe the first step is S -> NT68 NT63, and NT68 has a production that eventually leads to a 't3'. Let me see.\n\nNT68 -> NT26 NT42. Suppose NT26 is a terminal. Checking the rules, NT26 has 't4', 't2', or others. If NT26 is 't4', then that's not 't3'. Maybe NT42 can contribute a terminal? NT42 has a production 't1' or other non-terminals. Hmm, not 't3' either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S should branch into the other option: S -> NT64 NT78. Let's check that.\n\nNT64: Let's see its production. Scanning, I find NT64 -> NT60 NT14. So NT64 becomes NT60 and NT14. NT60 can be 't5' or other things. And NT14 -> NT1 NT98, which then might go to terminals.\n\nWait, but our string starts with 't3'. Let me see if NT64 can produce a 't3' eventually.\n\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14. So let's see NT60 and NT14.\n\nNT60 can be 't5' (from its rules), or it can be NT68 NT69. But if NT60 is 't5', then that's a terminal, but the string starts with t3, so not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, NT60 -> NT68 NT69. Now, NT68 as discussed earlier might not directly give t3. Let's look at NT69: NT69 -> NT26 NT42. Again, same issue. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should look for parts of the string and see if each pair of non-terminals can produce the observed sequences.\n\nThe string is: t3 t5 t2 t5 t3 t4 t0 t4 t5 t3 t3 t5 t3 t1 t1 t3 t3 t5 t2 t3 t3 t4 t1 t5 t4 t5 t3 t3 t5 t3.\n\nWait, maybe I should split it into pairs of steps. Each step in the derivation would consume two non-terminals, right? Because each production has two non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals generated by each production step. Let's see:\n\nStarting with S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 -> NT26 NT42. If NT68 leads to t3, then perhaps the first two symbols t3 t5 come from NT68 and NT63? But wait, NT68 leads to NT26 NT42, which then need to produce 't3 t5...'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is a sequence of terminals generated at each step. Let's map each terminal to the corresponding rule.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe I should try to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is long, and the grammar has multiple paths, so I should look for possible substitutions. But without writing out the entire parse tree, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for the first occurrence of 't3' in the string. The string starts with t3, so the first step must produce t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t3 is generated by some NT. Let's check where t3 is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see several NTs ending with 't3':\n\n- NT33 -> 't3'\n- NT44 -> 't3'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT64 -> 't3' (Wait, no, NT64 leads to NT60 and NT14, which don't directly produce 't3' but let me check NT64 itself. Actually, looking through the rules, I don't see NT64 producing a 't3' directly. It goes to NT60 and NT14.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's check each production with a terminal:\n\nLooking for any NT -> 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\n- NT47 -> NT85 NT13. Then NT85 -> 't2' from NT58 -> 't3'? Wait, no, looking at NT58: NT58 -> NT23 NT38. Then NT23 -> 't2' and NT38 can produce 't3' or other things.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the first t3 can be traced back to the productions.\n\nLooking for NT that can produce 't3' directly:\n\n- NT33 -> 't3'\n- NT44 -> 't3'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT3 (as in NT3) -> 't4'\n- NT64 -> 't3'? Wait, no. Let me check the rules. NT64 has a production NT60 NT14, which aren't terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\n- NT38 -> 't3'\n- NT85 -> 't2'\n- NT39 -> 't0'\n- Other NTs: NT33, NT44, NT49, etc.\n\nSo t3 is generated by NT33, NT44, and NT49.\n\nNow, in the first step, S -> NT68 NT63. Suppose one of these NTs produces 't3'.\n\nLet's see:\n\nNT68 can go to NT26 NT42. NT26 can be 't4' or other things. But 't3' isn't an option. So maybe the other alternative for S: S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14. NT60 can be 't5' or other things. But 't3' is not direct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire string. Since the string is long, I might not be able to track each step, but perhaps I can count the number of symbols.\n\nWait, the string has 30 symbols. Since each production step adds two symbols, starting from S (which has two symbols), each step would double the number of steps, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a CYK parsing algorithm approach, but without going into that detail, maybe I can see if each terminal appears in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each t in the string: t3, t5, t2, etc.\n\nAre all of these terminals present in the grammar? Let's check.\n\nLooking at all the NTs and their productions:\n\n- All ts are followed by numbers, like t3, t5, t2, etc.\n\nFrom the production rules, all terminals are followed by numbers, such as 't3', 't5', etc.\n\nEach terminal like 't3' is assigned to a specific NT. For example, NT33 is 't3', NT44 is 't3', etc.\n\nTherefore, all terminals in the string are present in the grammar, but the question is whether the non-terminals can be derived to produce these in sequence.\n\nBut just because all terminals are present doesn't mean the string is derivable. So I need a better approach.\n\nPerhaps I can approach this by building a parse table or attempting to derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a CNF grammar, each production step replaces two non-terminals with other symbols. The string's length must be 30, which comes from the initial S, which is two symbols.\n\nEach step replaces two symbols with a pair of symbols, but may or may not produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no.

So, the process should replace NTs with their productions until only terminals remain.\n\nI need to determine if the string can be derived by replacing the NTs according to the grammar.

Let me think about it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if each 't' in the string corresponds to a production rule. For example, t3 is produced by NT5, as I see in the productions.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, each NT has specific productions. For example:\n\nNT9 -> NT15 NT77\nNT15 -> NT1 NT68\nNT77 -> NT39 NT25 (Wait, I don't see NT77 in the full list, but from the initial list, maybe I missed it. Wait, no, in the full grammar list, after NT65, I see NT1 -> 't3', and others, but perhaps I need to look through all the NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t in the string corresponds to a certain NT that produces that t. So, for each t symbol, we can find which NTs produce them.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\nNT9 -> 't5'\nNT1 -> 't3'\nNT2 -> 't3'\nNT85 -> 't2'\nNT45 -> 't5'\nNT12 -> 't5'\nNT48 -> 't3'\nNT75 -> 't3'\nNT19 -> 't3'\nNT65 -> 't5'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT18 -> 't5'\nNT98 -> 't5'\nNT90 -> 't2'\nNT62 -> 't0' or others, like NT62 -> NT3 NT93\nWait, but when replacing NTs, any production that results in a t would contribute to the string.\n\nWait, maybe I can work backwards. Starting from the string, I can group the t's into pairs since each NT production in CNF produces two symbols. So, the string must have an even number of t's to start with, but my string here has 30 t's, which is even, so that's okay. \n\nWait, let me check. The string is 30 tokens long, which is 15 pairs. So, from the start S, which splits into two NTs, each of those would generate two more NTs, and so on. So, each step doubles the number of NTs, leading to 2^k NTs after k steps until we reach the terminal string.\n\nBut since the string is 30 tokens, which isn't a power of two, it might not be possible, but perhaps the grammar allows for it through other branches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string requires a specific sequence of productions. Let me try to group the t's into possible NTs.\n\nLooking at the string: t3 t4 t0 t4 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t0 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3 t5 t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t4 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3.\n\nLet me split it into pairs starting from the beginning:\n\n1. t3 t4\n2. t0 t4\n3. t3 t5\n4. t3 t3\n5. t2 t4\n6. t0 t3\n7. t3 t5\n8. t0 t3\n9. t5 t5\n10. t3 t4\n11. t3 t5\n12. t5 t3\n13. t4 t4\n14. t5 t5\n15. t0 t3\n\nWait, but this might not be the correct grouping. Alternatively, maybe the order is important, and the entire string must be grouped as consecutive pairs in a consistent order.\n\nWait, perhaps I should group the string into 2^k segments where k is the depth. Alternatively, maybe it's better to attempt a parse tree.\n\nGiven that S -> NT68 NT63, and both NT68 and NT63 must produce sequences of t's. Let's explore the possible derivations.\n\nFirst, NT68 and NT63.\n\nNT68 -> NT64 NT78 (from the initial productions)\nSo, NT68 produces NT64 and NT78.\n\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14\nNT60 -> NT68 NT18\nSo, NT64 can go to NT60 and NT14, which in turn need to be expanded.\n\nWait, but this could go into cycles. For example, NT60 -> NT68 NT18, and NT68 again expands to NT64 NT78, which leads back to NT60. So, maybe the production after a certain number of steps.\n\nThis seems getting too tangled. Maybe another approach: look for the t's that require specific NT production.\n\nFor example, t3 appears multiple times in the string. Let's see which NT's produce t3.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT75 -> 't3', NT18 -> 't3', NT18 also leads to 't3' in other productions. Similarly, other NTs may produce t3.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, each NT production that results in a 't' does so if the right-hand side contains that terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT68: NT64, NT78 \u2192 So, NT64 and NT78's generated tokens are used here.\n\nBut NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, so NT60 and NT14, etc.\n\nThis is getting too deep. Maybe it's better to write down all the NTs and their possible productions that result in terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that each t is a result of a specific production.\n\nFor example, let's identify which NTs produce each t:\n\nt0: NT26, NT38, NT62, NT69, NT90, NT98, NT52 via NT52->NT19 NT63 (but that's 't9' and 't3', so not directly t0. Wait, looking for t0 in the productions:\n\nLooking through the full list, t0's are produced by:\n\n- NT62 -> 't0'\n- NT26-> 't0' (wait, looking at the full grammar, under NT26: NT26 -> NT60 NT9 \u2192 but in the provided grammar, no, looking at the initial list, NT26 only has a production for 't0'? Wait, no, let me scan all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT62 -> NT3 NT93\n- NT69 -> 't0'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT48 -> 't3'\n- NT60 -> 't5'\n- NT96 -> 't5'\n- NT73 \u2192 't2'? Wait, no, perhaps I need to list all terminal symbols and their corresponding NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all the NT productions that result in a terminal:\n\nFrom the full list:\n\n- NT9 -> 't5'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-554","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a specific string that I need to determine if the grammar can generate. The string is: `t3 t3 t3 t4 t2 t1 t3 t3 t3 t2 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t1 t4 t3 t2 t5 t3 t1 t2 t5 t3 t3`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A grammar is in CNF if every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit this structure, with all productions either combining two non-terminals or ending with a terminal.\n\nThe task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. Given that the grammar is in CNF, we can approach this problem using a top-down parsing method, such as the CYK algorithm, or by attempting to derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the productions, the start symbol is S, which produces either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, the first step would involve either of these two combinations. Let's consider how the string starts with t3 t3, so perhaps one of these is involved.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT68 and NT64, I should check if any of them can lead to a terminal t3 or t2 or t1, etc. Wait, but in the given grammar, many of the productions for the non-terminals lead to terminals (e.g., NT26 -> 't2'). So, perhaps the first step is to see which non-terminals can produce t3.\n\nLooking at the initial productions:\n\n- S -> NT68 NT63\n- S -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo, let's see what NT68 and NT64 produce.\n\nLooking into the given grammar, I need to find the productions for NT68 and NT64.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3' (Ah, so NT68 produces 't3')\n- NT64 -> NT60 NT14 (So NT64 depends on NT60 and NT14)\n\nNow, since NT68 directly leads to 't3', that's helpful. So if the string starts with t3, maybe the first part involves NT68 producing 't3'.\n\nThe string starts with t3 t3, so perhaps NT68->'t3' and then another production.\n\nWait, but the first production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so if NT68 produces 't3', then NT63 needs to produce the next part. Let's check what NT63 does.\n\nLooking at NT63: it's defined as NT63 -> NT84 NT62. Both of these are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT84: NT84 -> 't3'\nAnd NT62: NT62 -> NT39 NT75. Wait, but let's check NT62's definition.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has entries:\n- NT62 -> NT39 NT75\nWait, no, the given grammar says: NT62 -> NT39 NT75. Hmm, but looking further, we can go deeper.\n\nBut wait, maybe my approach is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down by looking at the structure.\n\nAnother approach is to list the steps needed to derive the string from the grammar. Starting from S, we can think of S \u2192 NT68 NT63. NT68 is 't3', so that takes care of the first t3. Then NT63 is NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and so on. But perhaps that's too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using CYK would be more efficient. Let's outline the steps.\n\nThe string is 32 tokens long (from t3 to t0, counting each ti). Wait, let me count: the given string is `t3 t3 t3 t4 t2 t1 t3 t3 t3 t2 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t1 t4 t3 t2 t5 t3 t1 t2 t5 t3 t3`. That's 31 tokens? Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the string written is:\n\nt3 t3 t3 t4 t2 t1 t3 t3 t3 t2 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t1 t4 t3 t2 t5 t3 t1 t2 t5 t3 t3\n\nWait, let me count: starting from t3, it's 31 tokens? So n is 31.\n\nFor the CYK algorithm, we'll create a table of size 31x31. Each cell (i,j) represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Initialize: For single characters, determine which non-terminals can directly produce them.\n\n2. Fill the table in a bottom-up manner, considering all possible spans.\n\nBut given the time and the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to look for possible productions that lead to the initial part of the string.\n\nSince the string starts with t3 t3, and S \u2192 NT68 NT63, with NT68 producing t3, the first NT68 gives us the first t3. Then, the second symbol is t3, which comes from NT63 producing t3.\n\nSo, NT63 must have a production that directly leads to t3. Looking back at the grammar, I search for NT63's productions.\n\nLooking in the grammar, NT63 seems to have a production NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nWait, more accurately, the given grammar has:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nHmm, but then how do we get from that to 't3'? Because both NT84 and NT62 are non-terminals, unless one of them directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking into NT84: Is there a production for NT84 that leads to a terminal? Checking the list:\n\nLooking for NT84, I see:\n\n- NT84 -> 't3'\n\nYes! So, NT84 directly produces 't3', which would fit the second t3.\n\nSo, putting that together: S \u2192 NT68 NT63. NT68 produces t3, and NT63 \u2192 NT84 't3'.\n\nWait, but NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. How do we resolve that? Because then we have NT84 producing t3 and NT62 needs to produce something. Wait, but if in the string the second t3 is followed by another t3, perhaps.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that after NT68 produces t3, NT63 must produce the next part of the string, which starts with t3 t3.\n\nWait, no, because the string is t3 t3 t3 t4... So first t3 (from NT68). Then, the next part must come from NT63, which is followed by another t3.\n\nBut let's see: NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 is 't3', so that gives us t3, then NT62 needs to produce something else.\n\nLooking at NT62's productions: NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT75. Both are non-terminals. So we have to break those down further.\n\nWait, this is getting too nested. Maybe the CYK approach is necessary, but perhaps the string is too long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can't be generated because some part can't be matched.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the initial part is correct up to a point, but then at some point, a non-terminal can't produce the necessary terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing fails at some step.\n\nWait, let's try a step-by-step approach.\n\nThe string starts with t3 t3. So the first symbol is t3, which comes from NT68. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Then, the next symbol is t3, which must come from NT63. But NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So, do both NT84 and NT62 produce terminals?\n\nWe see that NT84 \u2192 't3', so that's good. Now, NT62. Let's see if NT62 can produce a terminal. Looking for NT62's productions: NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT75. Both are non-terminals, so we need to see if they can produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT39: It has a production NT39 \u2192 't5'. So NT39 is a terminal, producing 't5'.\n\nNT75: It has a production NT75 \u2192 't1' and NT75 \u2192 't3'. So NT75 can produce 't1' or 't3'.\n\nWait, so if NT62 \u2192 't5' and 't1' or 't3', but that would require"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-581","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and from what I remember, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). That means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most symbols (like S, NT62, NT38, etc.) are non-terminals, and some appear on the right side of these productions. The leaves of the grammar, which are terminals, are the 't' followed by numbers, like t0, t1, t2, etc. So my task is to parse the given string using this grammar and see if it can be derived.\n\nThe string is: `t3 t4 t5 t5 t5 t1 t5 t0 t4 t5 t3 t5 t3 t4 t0 t4 t5 t5 t3 t1 t1 t3 t2 t1 t0 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t5 t3`.\n\nFirst, I should check the structure of the grammar to see how these terminals are derived. Each rule starts with S, and from the provided rules, S has two options: either NT62 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So the string should start with two non-terminals that expand into these.\n\nLooking at the given string, it starts with t3. Wait, no\u2014the string is a list of tokens, so the first element is t3. But the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals. So unless one of these non-terminals produces a t3 directly, the first token might not be t3.\n\nWait, no\u2014the grammar is in CNF, so each production for a non-terminal is two non-terminals, not terminals. Terminals are only at the leaves. So to get t3, there must be a production where a non-terminal expands into t3. Looking at the provided grammar, some of these terminals are leaves, like NT33 -> t0, but wait, actually, I need to check which of these rules lead to terminals.\n\nWait, I think I need to parse the string as a sequence of terminals. Each production in CNF can only produce two non-terminals, so the overall structure will involve a parse tree where the leaves are the terminals in the string.\n\nBut in this grammar, some non-terminals directly expand into a single terminal. For example, NT8 -> t5, NT69 -> t0, NT75 -> t1, etc. So each time we have a production where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals derived from the grammar's productions. So the task is to see if this string can be generated by combining the starting symbol S into two non-terminals, which then expand according to the grammar to produce the given terminal sequence.\n\nSince the string is 33 tokens long, and each step in the grammar increases the length by a factor, but since it's CNF, each step can at least stay the same or increase the length by one. But given the grammar allows multiple steps, I might need to think about how the string could be broken down.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to check if the given string can be seen as a result of S expanding step by step. Let's see: S produces two non-terminals. Each of those can then produce two more, recursively, so the total number of terminals should be 2^n, but the given string length is 33, which is not a power of two. Hmm, that's a problem because Chomsky Normal Form typically results in derivations that result in the length being a power of two, unless the grammar is extended. Wait, no\u2014in CNF, each production is two symbols, so the overall number could vary, but typically, with left or right recursion, you can get more flexibility. However, perhaps the grammar allows for the possibility of the string having a certain structure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see if the string can be parsed step by step. Let me try to parse it.\n\nThe string is:\nt3, t4, t5, t5, t5, t1, t5, t0, t4, t5, t3, t5, t3, t4, t0, t4, t5, t5, t3, t1, t1, t3, t2, t1, t0, t5, t3, t4, t5, t3, t5, t3.\n\nI'll denote it as a list: tokens = [t3, t4, t5, t5, t5, t1, t5, t0, t4, t5, t3, t5, t3, t4, t0, t4, t5, t5, t3, t1, t1, t3, t2, t1, t0, t5, t3, t4, t5, t3, t5, t3].\n\nFirst, considering the start symbol is S, which can expand into either NT62 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nSo the initial derivation would produce two non-terminals, A and B. So the string must be the concatenation of A's production and B's production.\n\nBut let me think in terms of the parse. The first two symbols must derive from one of these production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to see if the entire string can be split into a structure where each non-terminal's production can derive a portion of the string.\n\nSince the given grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals, so each step either combines or splits things accordingly.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern or a way to reduce the string.\n\nWait, maybe using memoization or recursive descent parsing, but that might take time. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't3', which could correspond to a specific non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which terminal starts with 't3'? Let's check some rules. For example:\n\n- NT89 -> t5\n- NT85 -> t2\n- NT75 -> t1\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT69 -> t0\n- NT38 -> t3\n- NT26 -> t1\n- NT33 -> t0\n- NT47 -> t5 (multiple rules, like NT47 -> NT85 NT13, then NT85 -> t2, and NT13 -> t3. So NT47 in that case would produce t2 and t3.\n\nWait, but I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to check each terminal in the string and see if they can be generated by some rule.\n\nt3: Let's see, which non-terminals produce t3.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I notice:\n\n- NT89 -> t5\n- NT3 -> t4\n- Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT89 is mentioned in one of the rules? Let me check.\n\nWait, I'm looking through the provided grammar and see that NT89 is not present. So perhaps other rules produce t3.\n\nLooking for any rule that directly produces t3.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT47 -> NT85 NT13 (this leads to t2 and t3)\n- NT34 -> NT1 NT78 (I don't think that leads directly to t3)\n- NT38 -> t3 (Wait, in the provided rules: yes, NT38 is directly t3. Same with NT47->multiple ways, but perhaps one way leads directly. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the provided rules list multiple for each non-terminal, but for t3, looking through:\n\n- NT33 -> t0\n- NT26 -> t1\n- NT38 -> t3 (Yes)\n- NT89 -> t5\n- NT47 -> several rules, all leading to non-terminals except one that may produce t3 (like NT47 -> NT28 NT22, NT28->NT68 NT69, etc.)\nWait, maybe I should get back to the string.\n\nThe first token is t3, which must come from a production that yields t3. Looking through the provided rules, NT38 -> t3 is one such option. So perhaps the start symbol S first expands into NT38 NT... something else. But S expands into either NT62 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So that can't directly produce t3.\n\nWait a minute, S is the start symbol and it's in CNF, so S can generate a pair of non-terminals. So the overall string must be the concatenation of the derivations of these two non-terminals. So the first two symbols must be generated by one of the production rules from either NT62 or NT63 (if S expands into NT62 NT63), or NT64 NT78.\n\nSo the first two tokens in the string must be the result of the production of NT62 and NT63.\n\nBut the first token is t3. So let's check: if, for example, NT62 produces a t3 in the first step, then the second non-terminal (NT63) would produce another symbol, but I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-578","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to figure out whether this string can be produced by the given grammar. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are defined by a set of production rules. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar given has a bunch of these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see symbols like S, NT62, NT81, etc., on the left side of the arrows, and on the right side, they're split into pairs of NT (non-terminals) and some that are terminals, like 't0', 't1', up to 't9'. So each production either combines two non-terminals or connects to a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nThe string given is: `t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t4 t0 t2 t4 t1 t2 t5 t5 t1 t5 t3 t2 t3`\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string and check if it's in the language. But I'm not very familiar with the CYK algorithm, so maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trace the possible derivations step by step, starting from the start symbol S. But considering the complexity, maybe a better approach is to analyze the string and see if each token can be matched with the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t symbols: t5, t3, t2, t1, etc. The grammar seems to have several rules that produce t's. The first thing I notice is that the start symbol S produces either NT68 NT63. So the initial expansion would involve deriving from S into NT68 and NT63. Then each of these non-terminals would be expanded further.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see that NT97 can produce 't5'. Similarly, NT3 can produce 't4', and so on. So each NT can expand into either two non-terminals or a terminal. I need to see if the string can be constructed by combining these expansions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parsing problem, using the given rules to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar. Each rule has to be applied in such a way that the string is completely consumed.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the string: t5, t3, t3, t3, t3, t3, t5. That's quite a long initial segment. I need to find a way that this can be derived.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT97 can produce 't5'. Then, looking at NT97 in the productions, I don't see it as a producer of anything else; it seems to only produce 't5'. Wait, in the given productions, some NTs produce terminals. So for example, NT97 \u2192 t5. So if a NT97 is in the string, it can be replaced by t5.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs produce 't's:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 t0\n- NT44 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t3\n- NT84 \u2192 t4\n- NT55 \u2192 t4\n- NT12 \u2192 t5\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT58 \u2192 t3\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT77 \u2192 t3\n- NT93 \u2192 t3\n- NT63 \u2192 t1 (Wait, no, looking back, NT63 might produce something else. Wait, let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see NT63 \u2192 NT97 NT62. Hmm, that's two NTs on the right. So NT63 can be split into NT97 and NT62. Then, each of those can be expanded further.\n\nWait, let me outline the strategy:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, so the first expansion is S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n2. NT68 can produce 't3' according to the rules. So the first token is t3. That matches the first token of the string.\n3. Now, the remaining part after NT63 would be the other part derived from NT68. Since the next token is t5, but perhaps I'm mixing up. Wait, no: the string is a series of tokens, each being either NT expansions or terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire string as consisting of terminals, each of which is emitted during the derivation.\n\nWait, no. Each rule either emits two NTs or one terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, and each step in the derivation appends a terminal or a combination of two NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a sequence of productions that can be applied step by step.\n\nLet's think step by step:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3' (I think looking at the productions, NT68 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal that can split into other symbols?)\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nYes, in the productions listed, for NT68, the only production is:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nSo NT68 is a non-terminal that directly produces terminal t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 \u2192 NT97 NT62.\n\nSo S \u2192 t3 (NT68) and NT63 (which is NT97 NT62). So the initial expansion after S is 't3' plus whatever is generated by NT63.\n\nSo the first token is t3, which matches the first token of the string. So that's correct.\n\nNow, after S, we have the next part from NT63. Let's expand NT63.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT97 NT62.\n\nSo, NT63 expands into NT97 and NT62. Now, each of these can be handled.\n\nNT97 \u2192 t5 (from the productions, looking back, NT97 is a rule that produces 't5'.\n\nSo NT97 is 't5'.\n\nThen, NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT48. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT39 NT48.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, let me find NT62:\n\nYes, NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT48.\n\nHmm, so NT62 expands into NT39 and NT48.\n\nBut wait, NT39 is another non-terminal. Let me check its productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT39 as a primary rule; perhaps it's defined somewhere. Wait, some non-terminals only have one production as a rule. Let me try to check for NT39.\n\nLooking through the productions again, I see:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65, which seems recursive, but perhaps that's a rule for another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me list out the rules for each non-terminal:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n- and so on for all the others.\n\nHmm, but I don't see any rules for NT39, so perhaps NT39 is a non-terminal that might be part of some other rule's decomposition. Alternatively, maybe NT39 is undefined unless it's part of a production. Looking through the list, I don't see NT39 being defined as a non-terminal in any production. Wait, am I misremembering?\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nNT39 appears on the right side of a production: NT99 \u2192 NT74 NT62, etc.\n\nBut I don't see a production where NT39 is on the left side. So perhaps NT39 is actually a terminal, but that seems unlikely because other terminals like t3, t5, etc., are specified.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules. Let's think again.\n\nWait, looking back at the productions, I see many rules like:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38\n\nSo, perhaps some of these are meant to produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, the rule for NT89:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT89 \u2192 t5? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nYes, NT94 \u2192 t1, NT89 \u2192 t5, because I see the line:\n\nNT89 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo, NT89 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT33 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-596","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is a sequence of tokens: `t5 t5 t0 t4 t4 t3 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3 t4 t0 t3 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3`. The grammar itself is provided with a lot of production rules, each starting with a non-terminal symbol on the left and right-hand side being combinations of other non-terminals or terminal symbols (t0, t1, etc.). \n\nFirst, I need to recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing, and the way it's structured can help in determining the possible derivations of a string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to consist of multiple production rules for various non-terminals, all either producing two non-terminals or a single terminal symbol. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which means the start symbol S is replaced by the combination of NT68 and NT63. Similarly, NT68 is also a non-terminal that can be replaced by other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nOne approach to determine if the string is in the language is to reconstruct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the leaves correspond to the given string. However, the string is quite long, and the grammar seems extensive, so this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by checking if the string can be generated step by step using the given grammar. Each step involves replacing non-terminals with their possible expansions until only terminals (t0-t5) are left, matching the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t5 t5 t0...`. So the first thing to notice is that terminals are atomic and correspond to specific productions. For example, 't5' is a terminal symbol, so it must be produced by a rule like NT33 \u2192 't5', NT34 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nI should check if the start symbol S can produce a string that starts with 't5 t5 t0'. Since S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78, I need to see which of these can lead to a 't5' start.\n\nLooking at NT68 \u2192 't3' according to one rule, but elsewhere it's defined as NT68 \u2192 NT48 NT18. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I notice that some non-terminals have multiple production rules. For example, NT62 can be NT48 NT0 or NT39 NT97, and others similarly. However, each production is either a pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t5, which is a terminal. So the first symbol must come from a production rule that directly gives 't5'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT33 \u2192 't5', NT34 \u2192 't5', NT3 \u2192 't4'\u2014no, that's not 't5'. NT23 \u2192 't2', NT39 \u2192 't0', etc. So 't5' must come from a rule like NT33 \u2192 't5' or NT52 \u2192 't5', but checking the grammar, I don't see NT33 or NT52 directly producing 't5' except through their rules.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. The grammar has NT33 \u2192 't5'? Yes, NT33 is defined as NT13 NT94 and also as NT47 NT85. But then NT13 is another non-terminal. So to get 't5' as the first symbol, we might have to go through a longer derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with two 't5's, which could correspond to two different non-terminals expanding to 't5' each.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parse tree. The string has 35 symbols, and each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols (since each non-terminal typically expands into two other symbols). Starting from S, which would expand into two non-terminals, each of which might do the same. The total number of symbols after each expansion is 2, 4, 8, etc. Wait, 2^5 is 32, which is less than 35. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps that approach isn't directly useful.\n\nAlternatively, each production step could produce a certain number of terminals, but in this grammar, each expansion either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So it's more like a binary tree structure. Therefore, the string length might correspond to a certain number of expansions. Let me think: starting with S, we have two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal. So the number of terminals would be the sum of the number of non-terminals at each step that are expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, but this can be complex. Let me try another approach: trying to see what the string represents. It has 35 symbols, each being a t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, or t5. Each t corresponds to a specific production rule.\n\nSince each step in the grammar can only produce two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals), the length of the string must be 2^n - 1 for some n. Let's check: 2^6 -1 is 63, which is more than 35. 2^5 -1 is 31, which is less than 35. Hmm, 35 is not of the form 2^n -1, which is a problem because context-free grammars in CNF typically produce strings of length 2^n, but here each step could produce one terminal or two non-terminals, complicating it.\n\nWait, but each expansion step could produce a terminal or two non-terminals, so the total length can vary. The start symbol S is two non-terminals. Each of them can either produce a terminal (adding one to the length) or two non-terminals (adding two). But building the string requires all non-terminals to expand into terminals, so overall, the total number of terminals must be the sum of the expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built by the start symbol expanding into NT68 and NT63, each of which may expand further. Let me try to see what NT68 and NT63 are.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 \u2192 't3' or NT48 NT18. But in the string, the first symbol is 't5', so perhaps we need to see if NT68 can expand into a terminal that starts with 't5', but in the rules, NT68 only expands to 't3' or NT48 NT18. None of these directly give 't5'. So perhaps this path is not starting with NT68.\n\nLooking at the other production starting with S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Let's see what NT64 and NT78 expand into. NT64 \u2192 't3' or NT46 NT54. Again, no direct 't5' from NT64.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the NTs expand in a way that leads to 't5'. Maybe through NT62, which can be 't6' or more.\n\nWait another approach: each symbol in the string corresponds to a specific production that produces that terminal. So the first two 't5's suggest that from NT68 and NT63, or other non-terminals, we get 't5's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT32 \u2192 't4', NT39 \u2192 't0', NT47 can be 't3' or 't5', but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first 't5' comes from NT33 \u2192 't5', but then NT33 is recursively defined through other non-terminals. So, for example, NT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94, and then each of those would expand further.\n\nBut this could take a very long path, and I'm not sure how to model it for 35 symbols. Maybe it's better to look for a specific pattern that can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the string can be broken into parts that match the production rules.\n\nThe string is: t5 t5 t0 t4 t4 t3 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3 t4 t0 t3 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3.\n\nLet me count the length: 35 symbols.\n\nStarting from the beginning: first two 't5's. Suppose these come from two expansions into 't5', so maybe NT33 \u2192 't5' twice"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-594","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure will help because it simplifies parsing and understanding how the derivations happen.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that many non-terminals on the left (like S, NT62, etc.) have productions that either break down into other non-terminals or produce terminals. The terminals end up being 't' followed by numbers, from t1 to t97 or so. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terminals with numbers: t5, t5, t3, t3, t3, t3, t1, t3, t4, t3, t3, t3, t1, t3, t2, t3, t3, t1, t3, t5, t3, t2, t4, t1, t2, t5, t5, t2, t1, t5, t5, t5, t3.\n\nSo, the string is all about these 't' steps, each being a terminal symbol. My aim is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the grammar's start symbol is S, and according to the initial rules, S can produce either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So, any string generated starts with two non-terminals: either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t5. So, I need to see if the initial productions can lead to t5. Let me check the productions for NT68 and NT64.\n\nFrom NT68, I look for possible productions. Wait, in the given grammar, NT68 is a non-terminal. Checking the rules, I don't see any production for NT68 that directly gives a terminal. The rules start with NT68 -> NT68 NT63, which might be an error because that leads to infinite recursion. Wait, no, let me check the actual rules provided.\n\nWait, the initial rules provided are S -> NT68 NT63, S -> NT64 NT78, and many others. So, looking for NT68: in the given rules, I see NT68 -> NT68 NT63. Wait, that seems odd because it would create infinite recursion. So, perhaps it's a typo, maybe it's supposed to be another production, like NT68 -> some terminal. Because otherwise, NT68 would recursively produce more NT68s, which never end. That doesn't make sense for generating a finite string.\n\nHmm, that seems strange. Let me double-check the rules provided. The first rule is 'S -> NT68 NT63', then for NT68: 'NT68 -> NT68 NT63'. That's definitely problematic because it would lead to an infinite loop. Similarly, for NT64, maybe it's okay, but NT68 is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe it's possible that the user made a mistake in copying the grammar. Because if the grammar has NT68 producing NT68 NT63, then the derivation could go on forever, never producing a terminal. So, perhaps the user intended another production for NT68. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be something else, like NT68 -> NT63 or another terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the grammar is ill-formed, but assuming it's correct, maybe it's supposed to produce t3 or some other terminal, but not t5, right?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should ignore that rule because it's a mistake and proceed with other productions. But that would complicate things. Since the user provided it, I have to work with it.\n\nWait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me see if I can find anywhere else where NT68 is defined. Looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nNT68 doesn't appear again except as a production for NT68. Wait, no, actually, the rule is S -> NT68 NT63, which is a production for S. There's no line for NT68 defining it. Wait, no, no: looking back, the user provided a list of productions, each line starting with a non-terminal name followed by -> and the productions, or a terminal if it's a terminal production. Wait, no\u2014 Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals, so each line must be of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, looking again: The productions start with S->NT68 NT63, which would be a production for S, consuming S and producing NT68 and NT63, which are both non-terminals. But then for NT68, there's a production NT68 -> NT68 NT63, which is again two non-terminals, which is okay.\n\nWait, but that would cause a problem if the entire derivation needs to terminate. So, for example, if NT68 produces NT68 NT63, and NT63 might produce another pair, but in this case, NT63 is on the right side of some rules. Wait, I'm confused. Let me list all the rules for each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a way to parse the string and see if each 't' can be matched starting from S.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this using a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is fairly long, that might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree, step by step.\n\nBut first, considering the problem is about whether the string can be generated, I need to confirm if each 't' in the string can be produced by some sequence of productions starting from S.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string matches any of the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions. Or perhaps use a parser generator. But since I'm supposed to simulate this in my mind, let's try.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. So, the first step is to find which non-terminals can produce t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to look for all non-terminals A where A \u2192 t5. Scanning through all the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for any production of the form A \u2192 t5.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see a rule: NT90 -> NT2 NT60.\n\nNT90 also: look further.\n\nWait, checking each line:\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the production rules that involve terminals.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT26 -> 't2' (terminal)\n- NT39 -> 't0' (terminal)\n- NT48 -> 't3' (terminal)\n- NT58 -> 't3' (terminal)\n- NT65 -> 't5' (terminal)\n- NT73 is not present; wait, NT62 etc.\n\nWait, looking for any production that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't2'\nNT39 \u2192 't0'\nNT48 \u2192 't3'\nNT58 \u2192 't3'\nNT65 \u2192 't5'\nNT69 \u2192 't2'\nNT97 \u2192 't5'\nNT45 \u2192 't5'\nNT27 \u2192 't5'\nNT47 \u2192 't5'\nNT89 \u2192 't5'\nNT34 \u2192 't1'\nNT94 \u2192 't4'\nNT72 \u2192 't0'\nNT81 \u2192 't4'\nNT19 \u2192 't3'\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT39 \u2192 't0'\nNT58 \u2192 't3'\nNT62 \u2192 't3'\nNT12 \u2192 't5'\nNT67 \u2192 't2'\nNT45 \u2192 't5'\nNT17 \u2192 't4'\nNT49 \u2192 't1'\nNT15 \u2192 't3'\nNT27 \u2192 't5'\nNT47 \u2192 't5' (multiple times)\nNT89 \u2192 't5'\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT39 \u2192 't0'\nNT34 \u2192 't5'\nNT42 \u2192 't1'\nNT60 \u2192 't5'\nNT99 \u2192 't5'\nNT20 \u2192 't5'\nNT74 \u2192 't1'\nNT9 \u2192 't5'\nOthers: some have 't3', 't4', etc., but the only ones that directly produce terminals are:\n\nWait, let me list each production that produces a 't' symbol:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT39 \u2192 't0' (twice)\n- NT48 \u2192 't3'\n- NT58 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT65 \u2192 't5' (many times)\n- NT97 \u2192 't5' (twice)\n- NT45 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It seems that all non-terminals (like S, NT62, NT81, etc.) are defined with productions that either produce more non-terminals or terminal symbols ('t0', 't1', etc.).

The string starts with 't3 t1', so maybe it's using the first production, but let me look at the first symbol of the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't3 t1 t5 t5...'. So if the first part comes from NT68 (t3), then the next symbol must come from NT63. Do I know what NT63 produces?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT63 is defined as NT97 NT81. Let's check the productions for those. NT97 is 't5', and NT81 is 't3'. So NT63 -> t5 t3, so after 't3', the next would be 't5 t3', which would make the string start with 't3 t5 t3', but the given string starts with 't3 t1 t5...'. Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps the initial production is the other option: NT64 (t1) and NT78 (t4). Wait, the string starts with 't3', which doesn't match 't1 t4'. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. The string is: t3 t1 t5 t5 t3 t5 t2 t4 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t3 t1 t4 t1 t2 t5 t3 t4 t2 t1 t5 t5 t0 t3.\n\nThe first symbol is t3. So according to NT68, which produces t3, it must have come from that. So NT68 is one part, which is t3, so the next part must come from NT63. Let's see what NT63 produces.\n\nLooking again, NT63 is defined as NT97 NT81. NT97 is t5, and NT81 is t3. So NT63 -> t5 t3. Therefore, after 't3' (from NT68), the next two symbols would have to be 't5 t3'. But in the string, after the initial t3, it's t1. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the initial production is different. Let me check the possible first steps. S can produce NT68 NT63 (t3 t5 t3) or NT64 NT78 (t1 t4). The string starts with t3, so it can't have started with the second production (t1 t4), because that would require the string to start with t1, not t3.\n\nTherefore, the first production must be NT68 NT63, giving 't3 t5 t3'. But the string starts with 't3 t1 t5...'. That's a conflict because after 't3', it should have 't5', not 't1'. So, is this string even possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the productions. Let me double-check. NT68 is defined as: let me look at the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 is not directly given, but in the grammar, NT68 is likely a terminal because in the string, the first symbol is t3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the grammar, are the non-terminals like NT68 actually terminals?\n\nWait, hold on. In the grammar, all the symbols like S, NT68, NT63 are non-terminals (they have production rules). The terminals are the 't0', 't1', etc. So, in the given string, all symbols are terminals.\n\nSo the initial production from S is non-terminals, which must produce sequences of terminals. So S directly produces either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Therefore, the first two symbols in the string must come from these.\n\nSo S -> NT68 NT63: first symbol is NT68's production. Let's check NT68's production.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. I need to list all the productions of each non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT68: let's see. Wait, in the given grammar, S is rewritten as NT68 NT63, and S also as NT64 NT78. So I need to see the production rules for each NT symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\n\nNT81 -> NT78 NT97\n\nNT47 -> NT85 NT13\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find what NT68 produces. Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see NT68 having a production. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me go through each non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking for NT68 in the productions:\n\nWait, the grammar as provided is a list of rules. Let's reorganize them:\n\nLooking for NT68:\n\nI don't see NT68 defined in any production. Similarly, NT64, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nHere are some from the given grammar:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\n\nNT81 -> NT78 NT97\n\nNT47 -> NT85 NT13\n\nNT94 -> NT75 NT49\n\nWait, this is getting too long. Maybe a better approach is to realize that since this is a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo each non-terminal either expands into two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nGiven that, any string in the language must have a length that's 2^k for some k, because each application of a production on non-terminals replaces one non-terminal with either one (if it produces a terminal) or two non-terminals (if it produces two). So starting from S, which at some point may produce a mix of terminals and non-terminals. When all non-terminals are eliminated, the string is formed.\n\nBut let's check the length of the given string: Let me count the tokens.\n\nThe string is split into 37 tokens: t3, t1, t5, t5, t3, t5, t2, t4, t3, t4, t3, t3, t3, t3, t5, t4, t4, t1, t4, t0, t3, t1, t4, t1, t2, t5, t3, t4, t2, t1, t5, t5, t0, t3.\n\nWait, that's 37 symbols. For a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, each step doubles the number of symbols (if all non-terminals produce two non-terminals) until terminal production replaces them.\n\nThus, the total number of symbols in the string must be 2^n, but 37 is not a power of two. The closest powers are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). 37 is between them, so it's not a power of two, which suggests that the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-623","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It's a bunch of productions from the start symbol S down to various non-terminals, and some non-terminals are tied to terminal symbols 't' followed by a number, which I assume represent terminal tokens. The string to evaluate is a series of these 't' terms, and I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string given is: t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t3 t5 t2 t3 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t0 t3 t3 t5 t1 t4 t0 t2 t5 t3 t4 t3 t1 t5 t3 t3.\n\nThe first thing I need to do is understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the productions in the grammar are either generating two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. So S has two options. NT68 and NT64 are non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nEach of these non-terminals seems to be part of a chain that eventually leads down to a terminal symbol 't' followed by a number or sometimes 't3', 't4', etc. I notice that many of the non-terminals are defined recursively, such as NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT69, NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18, and so on.\n\nThe string starts with t3, which should be derived from a production that ends with a terminal t3. I need to trace back from the given string to see if it's a possible derivation.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol t3. According to the grammar, which non-terminals produce t3? Looking through the productions, I see NT3 \u2192 't4', NT6 \u2192 't5', NT8 \u2192 't5', NT2 \u2192 't3', NT33 \u2192 't3', NT47 \u2192 sometimes 't5' or 't3', NT28 \u2192 't5', etc. Hmm, wait. The string starts with t3. So I need a production where a non-terminal directly produces t3.\n\nWait, I'm looking through the productions, but it seems that many of them produce other non-terminals, not the 't' terminals. So perhaps t3 is produced by a non-terminal that eventually reduces to that. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT2 \u2192 't3', so if a production leads to NT2, then that would give t3. Similarly, NT33 \u2192 't3' (from NT33 \u2192 NT72 NT55, and NT72 \u2192 NT9 NT85, etc.), so that might eventually lead to t3. Alternatively, NT47 can produce t3 in some cases, like NT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22, but NT28 and NT22 might lead to other terms. Wait, but looking at the string, the first symbol is t3. So perhaps a production like NT2 \u2192 't3' is involved.\n\nBut let's think about how the string is derived. The first symbol is t3, so the leftmost symbol must come from a production that includes a terminal t3. But the way Chomsky Normal Form works, each production either is a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, a production can only produce terminals directly if it's an A \u2192 a rule, or else A \u2192 BC. So in the given grammar, any production that ends with 'a' on the right-hand side would correspond to a terminal a.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I don't see that; all the RHS seem to involve non-terminals. The only terminals are tied to the productions that have a single 'a' or multiple non-terminals. Wait, actually, the productions don't have any single terminal symbols, except for 't0' to 't9' appearing as the terminal results. Wait, no, the productions are written as, for example, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, and '0' is a terminal? But looking back, the string is like t3 t4 t5 t5..., so maybe the terminals are 't' followed by a number, meaning the 't0', 't1', etc., are actual terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpret. In the grammar, each production's RHS is a sequence of non-terminals or terminals. The terminals seem to be the 't' followed by numbers, like t0, t1, t2, etc., which are individual terminals. So, for example, a production like NT65 \u2192 't5' would mean that NT65 produces terminal 't5'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, most productions seem to be non-terminals on both sides, like NT68 \u2192 NT75 NT65, so that's a production from NT68 to two non-terminals. But I also see some productions that end in a terminal, like NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14, where I think NT14 \u2192 't0' or something like that. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14 (so NT60 and NT14 are both non-terminals)\n\nNT14 \u2192 't4'\n\nSimilarly, NT75 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but in the given string, I don't see 't4's until later, but let's see.\n\nWait, but perhaps each terminal in the string must correspond to one of the terminals in the grammar. So, each 't' term in the string is generated by a production that directly expands to that terminal.\n\nSo, for example, t3 could be generated by NT2 \u2192 't3', NT33 \u2192 't3', etc. Similarly, t4 could be generated by NT15 \u2192 't3', NT24 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nGiven that, the first symbol in the string is t3. So, to get t3, we need a production that either directly outputs t3, or, through some chain, outputs up to t3.\n\nBut in the given grammar, it's written as right-hand sides, but I think each production is in the form of A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I see many entries like NT68 \u2192 NT75 NT65, which are A \u2192 BC, and some have a mix like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which again is a non-terminal followed by a terminal.\n\nWait, but does NT0 \u2192 't0'? Yes, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n\nWait no, looking back: the user listed many rules, but each is a production, e.g., NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. So NT0 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal because it's on the left of the '\u2192'. But that production is from NT0 to NT48 and NT47, which are non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. In the context of the provided grammar, all the RHS are combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The user's provided grammar is written as:\n\n``` S -> NT68 NT63\nS -> NT64 NT78\nNT62 -> NT48 NT0\nNT81 -> NT78 NT97\n...\n```\n\nBut in each of these, the left side is a non-terminal, and the right side is a sequence of non-terminals. But some of these RHS have 't' followed by numbers. Wait, that can't be, because in Chomsky Normal Form, productions can only be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Each line in the grammar is a production, like A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0: non-terminals on RHS, so this is A \u2192 BC.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT69: another A \u2192 BC.\n\nThe line: NT38 \u2192 't3': that can't be, because the RHS is a terminal 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, NT19 \u2192 't5' is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals, or a single terminal. So perhaps I'm incorrect and some of these productions do have a terminal on the RHS. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't3'\n\nwhich would mean that NT38 \u2192 terminal 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, NT19 \u2192 't5', so NT19 \u2192 terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-637","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is useful because it has specific rules: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the target string. The grammar has a start symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So, any valid string derived from this grammar must start with either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Each of these NT symbols is a non-terminal that can produce other NT symbols or terminals, which correspond to the 't' tokens in the string.\n\nThe target string is `t3 t5 t5 t5 t3 t3 t5 t2 t1 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t2 t3 t3 t3 t1 t0 t3 t1 t1 t4 t3 t5 t3 t5 t3 t4 t3`. It only contains the terminals t0 to t5, but in the grammar, these 't' symbols seem to correspond to specific productions. Wait, no, actually looking again, some of the terminals in the grammar are like 't0', 't1', etc., which are the same as in the string. So, for example, NT69 \u2192 't2', which matches the terminals in the string.\n\nTo parse the string, I can use a recursive descent approach, starting from S. The string must be split into components that match the start symbol. Let's consider S as producing either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Both NT68 and NT64 are non-terminals, so each must expand further.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 has productions. From the grammar, I see NT68 \u2192 NT62 NT69, and NT66 \u2192 NT33 NT66, but perhaps that's not the right path. Alternatively, looking at the list, NT68 might have a production. Wait, let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT62 NT69 (since NT68 appears in several productions, but looking for those where NT68 is a left-hand side). Wait, in the provided grammar, NT68 is on the left-hand side of some productions, but looking at the list:\n\nWait, no, the grammar is provided with each line as grammar rules, each line has a non-terminal on the left and right.

Similarly, NT68 might have its own productions elsewhere in the grammar.\n\nLooking through each line, I need to find rules where NT68 is on the left.

{"custom_id":"request-642","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at the rules, I notice that most of them are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz, breaking down into two non-terminals. The terminals like 't0', 't1', etc., appear on the right side of some rules. For example, NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT77 would produce 't3' and 't5', so 't3 t5' would be part of the string from this rule.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t3 t5 t5 t4 t3 t3 t2 t4 t2 t4 t5 t5 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t3 t4 t2 t5 t3 t4 t1 t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t0 t3`.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule either produces two symbols or a terminal. So, the string can be divided into chunks of two symbols for context-free grammars, but sometimes a production can directly produce a terminal, so a single symbol might be part of the string.\n\nLet me start by looking for the terminals in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with 't3 t5 t5 t4 t3 t3 t2 ...'. Let me see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n- NT68 \u2192 NG68 NG63, but that's non-terminal. Looking at the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 't3' is in some cases. Wait, NT68 \u2192 't3' appears under NT68: NT68 \u2192 't3': From the given rules, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't3', NT68 \u2192 't3' (multiple rules), NT65 \u2192 't5', NT2 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nLooking at NT68 \u2192 't3', so if the first symbol is 't3', it could come from NT68.\n\nBut the string starts with 't3 t5 t5 t4 t3...'. Let's assume the first two symbols 't3 t5' come from a production that breaks down into 't3' and 't5'. Looking for a rule that produces 't3' and 't5':\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT68 \u2192 NG68 NG63, and from NT63, it eventually becomes 't3' after some steps. Or perhaps another non-terminal that directly produces 't3' and 't5'.\n\nWait, looking in the rules, I see NT73 is a non-terminal, but I don't see the rule for NT73. Alternatively, maybe NT68 can produce 't3' and something else. Wait, in the rules, there's NT68 \u2192 't3' in a rule? No, looking back, I think I only see NT68 -> NT63 NT68 (line 1), so it's a recursive rule. Maybe that's used for generating the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the top-level production. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 (two rules). So the top-level is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which would produce two symbols: the first from NT68, the second from NT63.\n\nGiven the string starts with 't3 t5...'. So if S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then NT68 must produce 't3' and NT63 must produce 't5'.\n\nWait, checking the production rules:\n\nLooking at NT68: The rule is NT68 -> 't3' is one possibility. Let me check under NT68 in the provided rules:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, under NT68: In production 1, NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT68. Not helpful. In production 2, I don't see NT68 \u2192 't3'. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT68 appears in multiple places:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT68 NT63\n\nLine 22: NT63 -> NG63 NG62\n\nLine 26: NT26 -> NT60 NT9... etc.\n\nLooking for where NT68 produces a terminal. Let me see:\n\n- On line 64: NT64 \u2192 NG64 NG78\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, I don't see NT68 directly producing a terminal except for a possible line missing. Wait, in the provided rules, under NT68, I don't see a rule where NT68 \u2192 't3', but wait looking at line 12: NT12 \u2192 NG12 NG44. Line 33: NT33 \u2192 NG33 NG66. Hmm, maybe I\u2019m missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me start at the beginning of the string. The first symbol is 't3', which should come from some non-terminal. Looking through the rules, NT68 can produce 't3' in some way. Or perhaps another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at line 2: S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Could the initial 't3' come from NT64 and NT78? Not likely, because NT64 starts with 't3' in its production. Wait, looking at NT64 \u2192 't3' as per line 7: NT64 \u2192 't3'.\n\nOh, wait, yes! On line 7, NT64 \u2192 't3' is present. Because the rules under NT64 are:\n\nLooking through all the NT64 rules:\n\nLine 7: NT64 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo S \u2192 NT64 NT78 (line 2). Therefore, the start symbol S can produce 't3' from NT64 and 'something' from NT78. But our string starts with 't3 t5', so after 't3' (from NT64), we need the symbol after that from NT78 to be 't5'. So can NT78 produce 't5'?\n\nLooking at NT78, in which production rule? Looking through line 18, for example:\n\nWait, line 17: NT78 \u2192 NG23 NG78.\n\nLooking further:\n\nLine 26: NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9.\n\nHmm, let me check every rule for NT78:\n\nLooking through provided rules:\n\n- Line 7: NT64 \u2192 't3'.\n\nWait, looking for NT78 rules:\n\n- Line 22: NT78 \u2192 NG33 NG66.\n\n- Line 26: NT26 \u2192 NG60 NG9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing NT78's production. Maybe looking back, perhaps line 7 is for NT64, but let's search for NT78.\n\nLooking back through the provided rules:\n\nAh, line 24: NT78 \u2192 NG74 NG78. So maybe the NT78 rule is NT78 \u2192 NT74 NT78, which is recursive. That's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at lines wrong because the user listed several rules for each NT. Let me go through each NT for NT78:\n\nLooking through each line, I see:\n\n- Line 22: NT78 \u2192 NG33 NG66\n\n- Line 26: NT98 \u2192 NG33 NG77\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Since S \u2192 NT68 NT63, maybe the start is producing 't3' and something else.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't3 t5', so perhaps NT68 produces 't3' and NT63 produces 't5'. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63, producing 't3' and 't5' as the first two symbols.\n\nLet me check if NT63 can produce 't5' as its first symbol.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT63:\n\nLine 26: NT26 \u2192 NG60 NG9\n\nLine 22: NT63 \u2192 NG18 NT68\n\nLine 20: NT63 \u2192 NG03 NT68\n\nWait, looking more precisely:\n\nEach NT has multiple rules, like NT68 has:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT63 NT68\n\nNT68 \u2192 NG68 NG63\n\nand others. Wait, perhaps I should find if NT63 can produce a 't5' symbol.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nLooking for where 't5' is on the right-hand side.\n\nCheck the rules:\n\n- Line 44: NT12 \u2192 NG12 NG44\n\n- Line 24: NT24 \u2192 NG12 NG44\n\n- Line 2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-656","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t3 t4 t3 t3 t5 t4 t4 t1 t3 t3 t3 t2 t3 t4 t1 t5 t1 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t3 t5 t0 t2 t1 t3 t5 t5 t3 t1 t3 t2 t1` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. It looks like every non-terminal symbol (like S, NT62, etc.) has productions that break it down into other non-terminals and sometimes terminals. Some symbols like T0, T1, etc., seem to be terminals because they have direct rules mapping to them, like 't0', 't1', etc. Wait, looking closer, some entries have the rule NT32 -> 't4', which is a terminal. So the grammar has both non-terminals and terminals as possible productions.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step. Since the length of the string is 38 tokens, I need to see if the grammar can generate such a long string.\n\nI'll try to parse the string to see how it fits into the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens like t3, t4, etc. Each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So the task is to find a derivation path where each step corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The grammar has two top-level productions for S:\n\n1. S -> NT68 NT63\n2. S -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo any string generated by the grammar must start with either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78, where each NT is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t3. Let's see which NTs can produce 't3'. Looking through the grammar rules, several NTEs have rules ending with 't3', like:\n\n- NT47 -> t5\n- NT94 -> t2\n- NT74 -> t3\n- NT99 -> t5\n- NT85 -> t2\n- NT38 -> t3\n- NT81 -> t3\n- NT26 -> t2\n- NT77 -> t3\n- NT33 -> t0\n- NT44 -> t4\n- NT2 -> t3\n- NT52 -> t2\n- NT69 -> t0\n- NT9 -> t5\n- NT8 -> t3\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking for NTs that can produce 't3', let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT38 and NT81 both have -> t3. Also, NT2 and some others. So NT38 -> t3 and NT81 -> t3.\n\nLooking at the first token 't3', which could come from NT38 or NT81. Let me assume the start could go either way, but I'll pick one path. Let's try the first option: S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nSo NT68 and NT63. Now, I need to see which of these can produce the first t3.\n\nLooking up NT68. Checking the grammar rules for NT68, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT68 -> t3. Yes, so NT68 can produce t3. That's good.\n\nSo after S -> NT68 NT63, the first token is t3 from NT68.\n\nNow, the second part is NT63. Looking at NT63's productions in the grammar. Let's check the rules for NT63. In the given grammar, NT63 has a production: NT63 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo, the next step is to produce NT63 into NT84 NT62. So now, the current string starts with t3 (from NT68), and then we have to process NT84 NT62.\n\nThe current string is:\n\nt3 followed by whatever comes from NT84 and NT62.\n\nNext tokens are t4, t3, t3, t5, etc.\n\nSo after the first 't3', we have 't4', 't3', etc., which need to come from the next parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to break it down step by step, but given the string length is 38, it's a bit tedious. Maybe I can look for the possible ways to generate the string by breaking it into chunks that match the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be a better approach. But since I'm supposed to think through it, maybe I'll take another approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nGiven the string is a sequence of terminals, we can try to see if the entire string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n\n1. S -> NT68 NT63\n2. S -> NT64 NT78\n\nWe'll need to see which path can produce the entire string.\n\nLet's try the first option: S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 -> t3, as we saw. So the first token is t3.\n\nNow, the remaining part is the string after t3, which is the rest of the tokens. Let's denote the string as t3 followed by the rest.\n\nNext, NT63 must derive the rest of the string. From the grammar, NT63 has only one production: NT63 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo after t3, the next part is derived from NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, the second token in the string is t4. So let's see how t4 can be generated.\n\nLooking at NT84, in the grammar, NT84 appears in a production: NT84 -> NT62 NT69. So NT84 can become NT62 NT69.\n\nWait, that would mean that after t3 (from NT68), the next part is NT84 NT62, which would generate something like (t3 followed by whatever NT84 and NT62 generate).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me structure this as a parse attempt.\n\nLet me see if the string starts with t3 t4 t3 t3 t5 ... and so on.\n\nAnother way is to consider that the process of generating the string involves breaking it into chunks that match the grammar's productions.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, and each step may involve several symbols, perhaps it's better to see if we can find a way to split the string into a series of productions that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be considered as a series of symbols that match the productions, so we can try to find a sequence of non-terminals that can produce that string.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each non-terminal in the grammar can only produce certain sequences, so perhaps we can see what languages each non-terminal can represent.\n\nFor example, NT68 can only produce 't3' since from the grammar, NT68's only production is -> t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT64's only production is -> t3, so NT64 -> t3.\n\nNT78 has two productions: NT78 -> NT34 NT66 or NT78 -> t3.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT78 has two rules: NT78 -> NT34 NT66 and NT78 -> t3.\n\nBut in our initial step, S can go to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nWe considered S -> NT68 NT63. So the first part is t3 (as NT68->t3), then NT63->NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84's production is NT62 NT69, so that would become t3 (from NT68), then (NT62 NT69) which is NT63->NT84 NT62, but wait, no, that's getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of the CYK algorithm. To apply CYK, I need to know all the non-terminals and their possible productions. But since I can't compute it step by step here, maybe I can find the patterns.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t3. We've seen that NT68 and NT81 and a few others produce t3.\n\nBut S's first production is NT68 NT63. So the next non-terminal is NT63, which only goes to NT84 NT62.\n\nThen NT84 -> NT62 NT69.

{"custom_id":"request-674","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex with multiple production rules, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the grammar and see the production rules. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so the entire string must be derived from S. That means the string should be a series of terminals that are the result of expanding S and its non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2\". It's a sequence of t's followed by numbers like t3, t4, etc. My initial thought is that each t is a terminal symbol, and the numbers are non-terminals that can be expanded into other symbols.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its components. Each token is either 't' followed by a number or a number alone. Wait, no, the string seems to be a series of 't' followed by a number, except some are just numbers. Wait, the actual string is \"t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2\".\n\nHmm, no, that's a single string without spaces. Let me recheck: \"t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2\". I think I misread it. So it's each token is a 't' followed by a number, like t3, t4, etc. So each t is just a prefix, so the string is t3, t4, t3, t3, etc., which I think means the string is built by concatenating all these t... tokens.\n\nWait, maybe not. Looking at the grammar rules, some of the non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number, like NT68 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t2, etc. So perhaps each 't...' is a terminal symbol where t is followed by a digit. So in the string, each 't3' would be a terminal symbol representing 't3', similarly for others. But I'm not sure; maybe the numbers indicate something else.\n\nWait, the grammar defines some non-terminals as producing 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT63 \u2192 t2, etc. So each 't...' could be a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of these terminal symbols.\n\nBut let me check the grammar rules again. The rules start with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the start symbol S is producing two non-terminals: NT68 and NT63. Each of these must be expanded to produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many non-terminals are defined as pairs of other non-terminals, like NT68 \u2192 NT64 NT78. So it's a recursive structure where each non-terminal expands into two others until we reach a production that produces a 't' followed by a number, which would be the terminal.\n\nSo the end of the recursion is when a non-terminal produces something like NT100 \u2192 't1', which would be the terminal terminal symbol for that.\n\nSo to verify if the string is generated, I need to see if it's a sequence of such expansions starting from S.\n\nBut the string is quite long, 36 tokens. Parsing such a large string manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me first list out the productions that produce terminals (i.e., those ending with 't'...):\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\nNT63 \u2192 t2\nNT78 \u2192 t3\nNT81 \u2192 t3\nNT26 \u2192 t2\nNT22 \u2192 t2\nNT72 \u2192 t3\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT75 \u2192 t3\nNT94 \u2192 t2\nNT18 \u2192 t1\nNT12 \u2192 t5\nNT48 \u2192 t3\nNT75 \u2192 t3\nNT12 \u2192 t2\nNT67 \u2192 t2\nNT45 \u2192 t5\nNT24 \u2192 t0\nNT55 \u2192 t4\nNT84 \u2192 t3\nNT97 \u2192 t5\nNT13 \u2192 t3\nNT60 \u2192 t5\nNT96 \u2192 t5\nNT33 \u2192 t0\nNT8 \u2192 t5\nNT65 \u2192 t5\nNT2 \u2192 t3\nNT52 \u2192 t2\nNT69 \u2192 t0\nNT38 \u2192 t5\nNT45 \u2192 t3\nNT50 \u2192 t4\nNT75 \u2192 t1\nNT68 \u2192 t3\nNT66 \u2192 t3\nNT62 \u2192 t2\nNT17 \u2192 t4\nNT81 \u2192 t2\nNT97 \u2192 t3\nNT33 \u2192 t3\nNT94 \u2192 t2\nNT74 \u2192 t3\nNT94 \u2192 t1\nNT18 \u2192 t4\nNT58 \u2192 t3\nNT81 \u2192 t4\nNT34 \u2192 t1\nNT94 \u2192 t4\nNT72 \u2192 t0\nNT18 \u2192 t4\nNT49 \u2192 t1\nNT15 \u2192 t3\nNT1 \u2192 t5\nNT27 \u2192 t5\nNT47 \u2192 t5\nNT89 \u2192 t5\nNT24 \u2192 t1\nNT39 \u2192 t0\nNT34 \u2192 t5\nNT42 \u2192 t1\nNT60 \u2192 t3\nNT99 \u2192 t5\nNT20 \u2192 t5\nNT74 \u2192 t1\nNT9 \u2192 t5\nNT8 \u2192 t3\nNT2 \u2192 t5\nNT84 \u2192 t4\nNT44 \u2192 t4\nNT58 \u2192 t1\nNT62 \u2192 t3\n...\n\nSo each of these non-terminals eventually leads to a terminal like t1, t2, etc.\n\nNow, the string given is:\n\nt3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2\n\nI think each of these is a terminal symbol, right? So each 't3' is a single terminal, etc.\n\nSo the first thing I'll do is check if the entire string can be parsed from S by breaking it down according to the grammar.\n\nBut given the length, it's impractical to do a full parse manually. Instead, I might look for patterns or see if any of the production rules can generate parts of the string.\n\nWait, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the terminals. So all non-terminals produce two other symbols.\n\nWait, no, the grammar includes productions that produce terminals as well. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3, which is a terminal. So Chomsky normal form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So perhaps the given grammar was derived from that, but some rules may have terminals, which would not fit strictly. Hmm, but the user said it's in Chomsky normal form, so that might mean all productions are to two non-terminals except terminals as leaves.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the definition again. Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So actually, the grammar does include terminal productions, so it's in CNF.\n\nSo to parse a string in CNF, we can use leftmost derivation, reducing symbols step by step.\n\nGiven the string, I need to see if it can be generated from S by expanding S into NT68 and NT63, then each of those can be broken down into smaller non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the string that can be broken down using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start at the beginning:\n\nt3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t3 t4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which simplifies things a bit because each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The initial productions from S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nBoth of these are two non-terminals, so the string has to expand from both NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nI look at the string given: it's a series of t0 to t5, which from the grammar look like terminal symbols. So each tX must be generated by a production that directly outputs that terminal.\n\nNow, I need to check the grammar to see what terminals are present as direct productions. Looking through the rules, I see that several non-terminals expand into a single terminal:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n- NT2 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't3' (Wait, no, looking back: NT3\u2192t4, NT4\u2192t5, NT5 isn't directly in the provided rules.

Wait, in the provided grammar, looking through the rules, there's NT9 \u2192 't5', NT8 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't3'? No, looking through the rules, I think I might have confused the NT numbers.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. Each rule has a left-hand side (NTx) and a right-hand side. The right-hand side can be either another NT or a terminal (indicated by an apostrophe followed by a number). The string is a sequence of terminals, so every symbol in the string must be matched by a production that directly outputs that terminal.\n\nSo, for each tX in the string, I need to find a rule where NTx \u2192 'tX'.\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' (from rule: NT68 -> 't3')\n- NT63 \u2192 't5' (from rule: NT63 -> 't5')\n- NT64 \u2192 't3' (from rule: NT64 -> 't3')\n- NT78 \u2192 't3' (from rule: NT78 -> 't3')\n\nSo, the initial two non-terminals (NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78) each expand into 't3'.\n\nNow, looking at the string: the first two t's are t3 and t3. But the string starts with 't3 t2 t4 t5 t5...'.\n\nWait, the first element is t3, which matches NT68 \u2192 't3' and NT63 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no: looking again, the rule for NT63 is \"NT63 -> 't5'\", so if S expands into NT68 NT63, it would produce 't3 t5'.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. This makes parsing and understanding the grammar a bit easier.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems to have a start symbol S which branches into various combinations of NTs (non-terminals) and terminals. Each of these NTs eventually leads to a terminal symbol like 't0', 't1', up to 't7'. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms separated by spaces.\n\nThe string is: `t3 t1 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t0 t2 t3 t5 t2 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t0 t4 t1 t3 t4 t1 t5 t3 t2 t2 t3 t5 t3 t2 t3`.\n\nI'm thinking about how to approach this. Since it's a context-free grammar, maybe a recursive descent parser would work, or perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm for parsing in CNF. But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps simulating the parsing process would be better.\n\nLet me first note down all the production rules for better clarity.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two main productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT68, NT64, NT63, NT78) has their own productions leading to further non-terminals and eventually terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first step is to see which non-terminals can produce the first token of the string, which is 't3'. So I need to find all NTs that have 't3' in their productions.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 \u2192 Doesn't end with 't3'.\nNT68 \u2192 Let me check, but wait, in the rules provided, NT68 isn't explicitly shown. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the productions start with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. But then other NTs like NT68, NT64, etc., are defined with their own rules. For example, NT21 might be somewhere, but perhaps I should list all the NTs with their respective rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should compile a dictionary where each NT points to its possible productions, and see which ones can eventually produce the given string.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to think about the string and see how it can be parsed step by step. Each token in the string needs to be matched from the grammar.\n\nThe string has 35 tokens, which is quite long, so manually doing this might be time-consuming, but let's try breaking it down.\n\nLet me see the first few tokens: t3, t1, t3, t3, t5, t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals that can produce 't3' include:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has multiple production rules starting from the start symbol S. The string in question is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t1 t0 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t0 t4 t0 t3 t3 t2 t2 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t1 t1 t3 t2 t2 t5 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, every production rule seems to either produce a terminal or two non-terminals, which fits CNF. So, that's a good start.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to derive the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree for any string would be a binary tree, and the number of symbols in the string (excluding spaces but in this case, they are part of the string) would be 2^n + 1, where n is the number of productions. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, every production is binary, so the derivation of a string of length L would require L-1 steps. Each step increases the length by one, so starting from S (1 symbol), after k steps, the string length is 1 + k. So, for a string of length M, the number of steps needed is M - 1. \n\nLet me count the tokens in the given string: Let's see, the string is `t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t1 t0 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t0 t4 t0 t3 t3 t2 t2 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t1 t1 t3 t2 t2 t5 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3`. Counting these: 1,2,...,30. So 30 tokens. Using the formula, the number of steps needed is 30 - 1 = 29. That means there would be 29 productions needed to derive the string. That seems doable, but parsing manually would be time-consuming. Perhaps there's a pattern or a way to backtrack.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal symbols are things like t0, t1, t2, etc. Each production either stops the derivation with a terminal or continues with non-terminals. The key is to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals. Let's examine some of the productions:\n\nFor example, S -> NT68 NT63, so NT68 and NT63 must produce some terms. NT68 -> NT68 NT61 or 't3' (I see NT68 -> 't3' is listed?), wait checking:\n\nLooking back, NT68 is one of the non-terminals, and there's a production NT68 -> 't3'. Similarly, NT63 -> 't3'. So if S can be split into NT68 and NT63, each of which produce 't3', then S would produce 't3 t3'. But the given string starts with t3 t4, so that might not be the case here. Alternatively, maybe S is split into different non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. The first two rules are S -> NT68 NT63 and S -> NT64 NT78. So S can produce either of these pairs. Let me see where these lead:\n\nNT68 -> 't3', and NT63 -> 't3' (from the list, looking for NT63):\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar list:\n\nNT68 -> 't3' \u2013 Yes, because in the list, under NT68: 't3' is listed.\n\nSimilarly, NT64 -> 't3' as NT64's production is NT64 -> NT60 NT14, and looking further, NT60 -> 't5' and NT14 -> 't5', so NT60 NT14 would be 't5 t5', but wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, NT68 is 't3' because looking up:\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT68: I see a production NT68 -> 't3' (from the list, the entry: NT68 -> 't3'). Similarly, NT63 is in the grammar: Let me find NT63. Checking the provided rules, I see NT63 -> 't3' (from the list: NT96 -> 't5', but looking for NT63, I see under the list, 'NT69 -> 't0'; but searching the entire list, I think NT68 and NT63 both have 't3'. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, I have:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nAfter S, the rules are NT68, NT63, etc. Let's scan for NT68 and NT63.\n\nFound NT68 -> 't3'\n\nFound NT63 -> 't3'\n\nSo S can be NT68 + NT63, each producing 't3' leading to the string 't3 t3'. But our string starts with t3 t4. Therefore, S must be expanding into another pair.\n\nNext, the other S production is S -> NT64 NT78. So let's see where NT64 and NT78 lead.\n\nLooking for NT64, I see in the grammar, NT64 -> 't3' Wait no, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar rules are:\n\nLooking for NT64 and NT78.\n\nI found NT64: checking the list, yes, NT64's production is NT64 -> 't3' (looking for NT64 -> 't3'). Similarly, NT78's production: looking through the list, I see NT78 -> 't3'. So NT64 NT78 would lead to 't3 t3' as well, which again doesn't match the start of the string.\n\nWait, but that would mean the initial S expansions into NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78 both produce 't3 t3', but the input string starts with t3 t4. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe NT64 doesn't produce 't3' but something else.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Looking at NT64: in the grammar, under NT64, I see the production NT64 -> NT60 NT14, which leads further to NT60 -> 't5' and NT14 -> 't5', making NT60 NT14 produce 't5 t5'. So NT64 would produce 't5 t5', making S -> NT64 NT78 would produce 't5 t5 t5 t5' (wait, no, because NT78 -> t3).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check each NT symbol and see what they generate.\n\nLet's build a mapping of each non-terminal to their terminal or non-terminal productions:\n\nI'll go through the list line by line:\n\n1. S -> NT68 NT63 : So S starts with NT68 and NT63.\n2. S -> NT64 NT78\n3. NT62 -> NT48 NT0\n4. NT65 -> NT97 NT65\n5. NT38 -> NT85 NT13\n6. NT94 -> NT75 NT49\n7. NT38 -> NT28 NT22\n8. NT47 -> NT85 NT38\n9. NT94 -> NT28 NT22\n10. NT47 -> NT0 NT52\n11. NT47 -> NT0 NT52\nWait, multiple entries for NT47: lines 9, 10, and 11 are all for NT47, with same right-hand sides. Hmm, a typo perhaps, but perhaps in the actual CNF, each production is unique, so maybe some are duplicates. I'll need to make sure each NT has distinct productions.\n\nContinuing:\n\n12.

{"custom_id":"request-719","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. My goal is to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, all productions follow that structure, so it's definitely in CNF. The terminals are the tokens separated by spaces: t0, t1, t2, etc., up to t3. The non-terminals are the other symbols, which look like various N, T, and P symbols (like NT68, NT63, etc.), but the exact count isn't necessary right now.\n\nI don't know the exact approach here, but I can think of a few methods. One way is to use a parsing algorithm, like the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. But since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a series of t tokens, I think that each 't' is a terminal symbol. So the string is composed of these t's, and I need to see if their sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the number of tokens can help. The string has 39 tokens. Each production either increases the number of symbols (from A \u2192 BC, which adds one non-terminal) or terminates (A \u2192 a, which removes a non-terminal). Starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, the number of symbols in a derivation can be found using the relation: if there are k non-terminals, the minimum and maximum number of symbols after k steps are certain values. But tracking this for 39 steps seems complicated.\n\nWait, each production of the form A \u2192 BC increases the total number of symbols by 1, while A \u2192 a removes one symbol. So starting from 1 (S), each step either adds 1 or subtracts 1. To get to 39, we have to have a net increase of 38. So the number of production steps would be more than 38, but I'm not sure how that helps directly. Maybe it's not the most straightforward approach.\n\nMaybe I should look at the structure of the string. The string is long, so perhaps breaking it down into smaller parts would help. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a series of rules applied step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a tree. The start symbol S branches into either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Each of those non-terminals then branches into their own productions. I can think of each step as choosing one production and replacing the non-terminal with the corresponding symbols.\n\nGiven the string has 39 tokens, each 't' is a terminal, so each must be produced by some rule A \u2192 a, where a is the 't' in the string.\n\nBut how do I see if it's possible? Manually checking each step is impractical, but maybe I can use the CYK algorithm idea. The CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell (i, j) represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j.\n\nBut without knowing the grammar's details, especially the production rules for each non-terminal except the terminals, it's hard to proceed. Wait, actually, the grammar is provided, so I should look at the right-hand sides of each production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that the right-hand sides (RHS) have various non-terminals and symbols. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n- NT81 \u2192 NT78 NT97\n- etc.\n\nAnd for the terminals:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't2' in two places\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'\n- NT45 \u2192 't5'\n- and so on.\n\nSo each production either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so at each step, I must have a production that ends with a terminal.\n\nBut since in CNF, each production that produces a terminal does so in one step, the parser must apply a series of productions that ultimately result in t's.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure. Maybe the string is constructed in such a way that it can be traced back through the productions. Alternatively, perhaps the number of 't's is correct, but that's not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, let's count how many times each terminal appears and see if they align with the productions. But that might not be enough either because the order matters.\n\nWait, perhaps I can note the 't's in the string and see if each t can be produced by some rule, and their sequence can be derived from the grammar. Let's list the t's in order:\n\nt3, t4, t0, t4, t4, t5, t5, t3, t1, t3, t5, t3, t2, t2, t2, t3, t3, t3, t2, t1, t1, t0, t2, t3, t3, t5, t0, t3, t4, t4, t2, t5, t3, t2, t0, t4, t4, t5, t3.\n\nSo 39 t's. Each must be generated by a production that ends with a terminal. Let's think about the order.\n\nBut without a structured approach, this is too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a known example, but I don't recall that. So, I think I need to systematically approach this.\n\nIn the given grammar, the non-terminals are combinations like NT62, NT63, etc. Each of these non-terminals has their own productions. For example:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\nNT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47\n\nSo NT62 can produce NT48 and NT0, and NT0 can produce NT48 and NT47, and so on.\n\nThis seems to form a complex tree of possible derivations, but I can try to see if the string has a pattern that can follow such a tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is being generated in a way that's too long or has a structure that the grammar can't produce.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string counts the number of a certain production, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken into segments where each segment is a certain non-terminal's expansion. For example, starting with S, which can go to NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nSo let's imagine we start with S. Let's pick the first rule: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nThen we have NT68 and NT63. Let's look at their production rules:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nSo now we have NT66, NT18, NT84, NT62.\n\nLooking at these:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT33 NT3 (wait, looking back, NT66 isn't directly listed; perhaps it's another symbol?)\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT66 as a non-terminal. Wait, let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT66 isn't listed as a non-terminal in any production. Hmm, that might be a problem. So maybe NT66 doesn't have a production, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT66 is a mistake? Or perhaps I misread. Wait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\nHere are a few:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT62 NT74\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT34 NT85\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78\n\nWait, no, I don't see NT66 as a non-terminal. So perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe NT66 is a terminal? But terminals are single characters like t0, t1, etc. NT66 would be a non-terminal unless it's one of the RHS terminals, but in this case, it's not. But looking through the RHS, the only terminals are things like t0, t2, t3, etc.\n\nSo in the first step: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nBut NT66, NT18, NT84, NT62 are all non-terminals. Now, let's see their productions.\n\nLooking for NT66: Hmm, I don't see NT66 in any RHS of a production. So either this path is blocked or I made a mistake.\n\nAh, looking again: the given grammar might have some errors or maybe I'm missing it. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible that NT66 is a terminal, but looking through the RHS, the only terminals are '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-718","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. That means the string must start with a combination of these two NTs. \n\nThe string to evaluate is `t3 t4 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t5 t1 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t3 t1 t3 t2 t3 t2 t5 t3 t4 t5 t2 t4 t3 t3 t4 t2 t5 t5 t4 t5 t3 t3 t3`. I need to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI notice that the grammar's non-terminals are replaced by sequences of t's, where each t corresponds to a terminal symbol. The production for NT74 is `-> NT33 NT66`, which are t3 and t3, so NT74 is t3t3. Similarly, other NTs have their own t sequences.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to use a parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for CNF grammars. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll need to check the string step by step, breaking it down into chunks that match the productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which splits into either [NT68, NT63] or [NT64, NT78]. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, for NT68: Looking at the grammar, NT68 appears in S \u2192 NT68 NT63. Now, what can NT68 produce? In the given rules, I see NT68 -> t3. So NT68 produces t3. Therefore, the first part of the string should start with t3.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t3, which matches NT68's production. So the first split is S \u2192 NT68 (t3) followed by NT63, which is another NT.\n\nNow, looking at NT63: It appears in S \u2192 NT68 NT63. What does NT63 produce? Checking the rules, I don't see NT63 as a terminal, so it must be a non-terminal that expands further. Looking through the rules, NT63 is defined as NT84 NT62, which are both NTs. Let's break that down.\n\nNT84: From the rules, NT84 \u2192 NT63 NT62. Wait, that's a cycle because NT63 and NT62 are non-terminals that reference each other. Hmm, that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe there's a direct production for NT63 somewhere. Looking at the list, I don't see a direct production for NT63 except as part of other NTs. So I have to see if it can eventually reach terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. The initial split S \u2192 NT68 NT63 gives us t3 and NT63. If NT63 is to be further expanded, it's part of a cycle, so perhaps I should look for a different starting point. Alternatively, maybe the initial split is not the right way.\n\nLet me try another approach. Look for the start symbol S and see what each of its productions can generate. If the string starts with t3 t4..., maybe the production S \u2192 NT68 NT63 isn't the right path because NT68 is t3, and the next NT63 would have its own expansion, which might not fit the t4 at the second token.\n\nWait, the first token is t3, so if S splits into S \u2192 NT68 (t3) and NT63, then the next part after t3 should be what NT63 produces. Let's try that.\n\nSo after t3, the next token is t4. So NT63 must produce something that starts with t4. Let's find what NT63 can produce. From the rules, NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT63 splits into NT84 and NT62.\n\nNow, NT84 is NT63 NT62 again, which seems like a cycle. That's a problem because that would infinitely loop. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion order. Let's see if there's another way to expand NT63.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the rules for NT84 and NT62 to see if they can produce any terminals. Looking at NT84, it's NT63 NT62. So both are non-terminals. NT62 is NT39 NT81, both non-terminals again. This doesn't seem to resolve to a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because if NT63 can only produce more non-terminals, then the string starting with t3 and then another non-terminal expansion might not fit the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S splits into the other option, S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Let's see how that would work.\n\nNT64 is, from the rules, NT66 NT14. Wait, no, looking back: The grammar has NT64 \u2192 NT66 NT14. So NT64 produces NT66 (which could be a terminal or another non-terminal) and NT14. Now, NT14: From the rules, NT14 \u2192 NT1 NT98. Both are non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's look for the entire string and see if it can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nThe string is: t3 t4 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t5 t1 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t3 t1 t3 t2 t3 t2 t5 t3 t4 t5 t2 t4 t3 t3 t4 t2 t5 t5 t4 t5 t3 t3 t3.\n\nThis is pretty long, so I'll try to segment it into chunks that match the possible expansions.\n\nStarting with the first token t3. Looking for where t3 is a terminal. From the rules, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT74 \u2192 t3t3, NT75 \u2192 t4, NT62 \u2192 t6... Wait, let me go through each rule to find where the terminals are.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nNT3 (from the end of the given grammar) \u2192 t5\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78. Not a terminal.\n\n- NT47 \u2192 several NTs.\n\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n\n- NT55 \u2192 t4\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminal t sequences:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT75 \u2192 t3\n\nNT69 \u2192 t0\n\nNT38 \u2192 t3, t5, t5.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, some NTs expand into sequences of terminals. For example:\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66 \u2192 t3 t3 (from NT33 is t3, NT66 is t3). So NT78 produces t3t3.\n\nAnother one is NT75 \u2192 t3. Wait, no: Looking at the rules, NT75 is replaced by NT18 NT65. Checking NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38. Both are non-terminals. Wait, no, perhaps I missed where t1, t2, etc., are assigned.\n\nActually, the rules are structured such that many non-terminals directly produce a sequence of terminals. For example:\n\nNT75 \u2192 t3\n\nLooking through the end of the rules:\n\nNT75 \u2192 't3'\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nNT38 \u2192 t5\n\nNT94 \u2192 t2\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo each rule where the right-hand side is just a string of t's is a terminal production.\n\nSo for example, several rules in the grammar have non-terminals on the left, but when the entire right-hand side is terminals, that's a terminal production.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can split the string into parts that match these terminal productions.\n\nThe problem is that the grammar is a binary tree of NTs each of which may expand into one or more terminals. Without knowing all the possible expansion paths, it's challenging.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to see if the string can be constructed by expanding the start symbol according to the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a top-down parsing approach.\n\nAnother idea is to see if the string can be broken down into the S productions.\n\nS can be NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nLet's see which one fits the start of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t3, which matches NT68.\n\nSo the first part is NT68 (t3), and the next part needs to be NT63.\n\nLet's look at NT63's expansion:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT63"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which makes it easier in a way because each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. But I'm a bit rusty on how exactly to approach this. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. It seems like a lot of the non-terminals (like NT62, NT81, etc.) map to specific terminal symbols like 't0', 't1', etc. Some of them map to a combination of two non-terminals. For example, S can go to NT68 NT63, which then presumably go on to produce terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of t's followed by numbers. Each 't' is followed by a number, like t3, t5, etc. So the string is broken down into these tokens: t3, t3, t3, and so on.\n\nI think the approach here is to construct a parse tree that starts from the start symbol S and uses the grammar rules to derive the given string. Each step should either expand a non-terminal to two non-terminals or to a terminal.\n\nWait, but let me check the grammar rules again. The rules for NT68 go to t3, which is a terminal? Or is that a typo? Because in the rules, NT68 doesn't have a production, it's probably a terminal. Let me confirm: looking through the rules, some non-terminals directly go to a terminal, like NT68 -> t3, which means whenever I see NT68 in the string, it corresponds to 't3'.\n\nSo the string starts with t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t5 t3 t4... So let me think about how the grammar can generate these t's.\n\nGiven that S -> NT68 NT63, each of these will produce t3 (since NT68 is t3) and NT63. I need to figure out what NT63 does. Looking at the rules, NT63 -> NT84 NT62. Okay, so that's two non-terminals. Then NT84 is t3, and NT62 is another non-terminal. NT62 has a rule that goes to NT3 NT93, and NT3 is t4. Wait, no, looking back: NT62 -> NT3 NT93. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list out the rules for non-terminals starting with NT:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S -> NT68 NT63\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT63 -> NT84 NT62\n\nThen, NT84 is t3. NT62 has two rules: \n\n1. NT62 -> NT3 NT93\n2. NT62 -> NT39 NT97\n\nWait, but in the string, I see t3, t3, t3... So let me see. For the first t3, it's NT68, which is directly t3. Then the second t3 could be from NT63, but wait, NT63 -> NT84 NT62, and NT84 is t3, so that gives me t3. Then the third t3: that could come again from NT84, since NT84 is directly t3.\n\nWait, no, NT84 is a terminal, so in the string when it appears, that's just 't3'. So, the first three t3's could all come from NT68 and NT63 expanding via NT84.\n\nBut wait, the fourth symbol is t3 again, then t5, t5, etc. Hmm. Let me think about the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT68 NT63 \u2192 t3 NT63.\n\nThen, NT63: NT63 -> NT84 NT62 \u2192 t3 NT84.\n\nBut wait, no, wait: S -> NT68 (t3) and NT63. So the first t3 is from NT68. Then NT63 produces something. If NT63 goes to NT84 NT62, then NT84 is t3, and NT62 could produce something else.\n\nSo the next symbols are t3 (from NT84), then what? Then comes t5, t5, t3, etc.\n\nSo after the first t3 from NT68, we have t3 from NT84. Then, in the string, after that, the next symbol is t3 again, but in the string it's t3, then t5, t5, t3, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should break down the string into chunks that must come from the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the string: t3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t3 t5 t5 t5 t2 t5 t5 t3 t3 t1 t3 t1 t4 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t1 t5 t3 t3 t2 t3.\n\nSo the first thing is that the string starts with multiple t3's. Each time, the grammar can produce t3 from NT68 or NT84.\n\nWait, NT68 is t3 directly, and NT84 is t3 directly. So when either of those non-terminals appear, they produce a 't3'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, after the initial t3s, there are t5s. Let's see, which non-terminals produce t5?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT18 -> NT50 NT38 \u2192 but NT50 isn't a terminal, so that's two non-terminals, which would expand further. Wait, NT50 is a rule: NT50 -> t4.\n\nWait, no, looking here:\n\nNT17 -> t4\nNT18 -> t1\nNT50 -> t4\n\nWait, but in the rules, NT9 -> t5, NT45 -> t3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of which non-terminals directly produce t's and which go further.\n\nLooking through the rules, some non-terminals go directly to terminals like:\n\n- NT48 -> t3\n- NT75 -> t3\n- NT62 -> NT3 NT93 (both non-terminals)\n- NT63 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT64 -> NT60 NT14\n- NT65 -> NT97 NT65 (wait, that's a loop, but probably that's a typo, maybe NT65 -> NT97 NT56 or something else, but assuming it's correct)\n- NT60 -> NT68 NT18\n- NT67 -> t2? Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT67 isn't a terminal, it has a production to NT65 NT94. Hmm, but in the given grammar, wait, do any non-terminals directly produce 't's?\n\nWait, I'm seeing rules like:\n\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT63 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT84 -> t3\n- NT62 has multiple rules, but none are terminals except if any of the components lead to terminals.\n\nSo all non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals via some expansion. Therefore, the string must correspond to an expansion starting from S, applying the rules, and ending with all terminals.\n\nSo perhaps each t in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that eventually becomes that t.\n\nTo verify, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be split into chunks that match the possible derivations from S.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nSo the first symbol will be from NT68, which is t3, and the second from NT63.\n\nBut NT63 can go to NT84 NT62, which means the second symbol is t3 (from NT84), and the third and fourth symbols would come from NT62.\n\nNT62 has two options:\n\n1. NT62 -> NT3 NT93\n2. NT62 -> NT39 NT97\n\nNT3 is t4, NT93 is something else, maybe t3. Let me check the rules for NT93.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT93 is not a terminal. Wait, but in the string, after t3 t3 t3..., there's a t5. So perhaps the next part involves NT26 or something that becomes t5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find a production sequence that can generate the first few t3's.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst token: t3 \u2192 NT68 (produced by S's first part).\n\nSecond token: t3 \u2192 NT84 (produced by NT63's first production).\n\nThird token: Could come from NT62. Let's say it's NT62 -> NT39 NT97.\n\nThen, NT39 -> t0 and NT97 -> t1, but wait, in the string, the third token is t3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

NT38 is rewritten to 't3' (wait, no, checking the rules, one of NT38's productions leads to 't3', but does any NT38 lead directly to a 't5'?)\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT38 -> 't3' and also NT38->NT12 NT44, which may produce something else. So if S -> NT66 NT18, that becomes 't3' (from NT66) followed by NT18, which is NT50 NT38. So 't3' NT50 -> 't4' and NT38, which is 't3' or further. But our string starts with 't5', so maybe this path is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S should be taking the other production: S -> NT64 NT78. Let's see. NT64 is a rule: NT64 -> NT60 NT14. So NT64 is rewritten to NT60 and NT14. NT60 is a terminal, 't5'. Because NT60 -> 't5'.\n\nSo S -> NT64 NT78: NT64 is 't5' and NT78 is rewritten as NT33 NT66. NT33 is a terminal, according to the rules, NT33->'t0'. NT66 is 't3'.\n\nSo the first two terminals would be 't5' (from NT64) followed by 't3' (from NT33, since NT33->'t0'? Wait, no, NT33 is 't0', so NT78 would produce 't0' and 't3'. So the first two 't5's would come from NT64 and NT60, which is from another production, right?\n\nWait, wait. Let me try to parse the string starting with 't5 t5' using S's production S->NT68 NT63. NT68 is NT66 NT18, as we saw. So that would produce 't3' followed by NT18. But the string starts with 't5 t5', so maybe that's not the correct path.\n\nAlternatively, S->NT64 NT78. NT64->NT60 NT14. NT60->'t5', so that's 't5'. Then NT78->NT33 NT66. NT33 is 't0' and NT66 is 't3', so that's 't0 t3'. So the first two symbols would be 't5 t0 t3', but the string starts with 't5 t5', so maybe this isn't the right path either.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the entire string can be derived step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see that the first 't5' could be from NT50, but looking at the rules, NT50->'t4'. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the production NT97->'t3', NT65->'t5', so maybe there's a path where a NT rule leads to 't5' before the string progresses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent parser would help, but that might be time-consuming. Maybe the best way is to see if the string can be formed starting with the possible S productions.\n\nSince S has two options, S->NT68 NT63 or S->NT64 NT78. The string starts with 't5 t5', so let's check both options.\n\nFirst option: S->NT68 NT63. NT68 is NT66 NT18, which is 't3' and NT18, which is NT50 NT38. So NT68 gives 't3' and then NT18. Then, NT63: looking at NT63's rule, NT63->NT84 NT62. NT84 is a terminal, 't3', and NT62 is NT39 NT77. But NT39 is a terminal? Let's check: NT39->'t0' and NT77->'t3' (maybe). Or is NT39 something else. Wait, NT39 is a rule that produces 't0'? Let me confirm.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-760","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). First, I should recall what CNF looks like. It's a form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can have a single non-terminal. Also, all production rules can't have epsilon as a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to have rules that lead to various terminals: 't0', 't1', 't2', and 't3' are in the grammar. These must be the terminals, as they don't have further productions. The string provided consists of these terminals, so the grammar is capable of generating such a string if the structure is right.\n\nSo, the approach is to parse the string using the given grammar. Parsing context-free grammars can be done using various methods, such as recursive descent, Pratt, or the CYK algorithm. However, since the grammar isn't provided in a readily parseable form (like as a list of production rules), maybe it's easier to reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nFirst, the string length is 41 tokens. Each production rule in CNF produces two non-terminals, but when the string is to be generated, it's built up from left to right, non-terminals breaking into smaller parts until all are terminals. However, since the grammar is CNF, each step either splits a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or into a terminal and a non-terminal (since CNF requires productions with two non-terminals only, but here, in the provided grammar, I see some rules with a terminal on one side, like NT68 -> t3). Wait, actually, looking back, I see that some rules are of the form A -> a B or B -> A a, which is allowed in CNF because it's still two symbols on the right-hand side, one being a terminal and the other a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in CNF, productions can be of the form A -> BC, A -> B, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. But the provided grammar has rules like NT68 -> NT66 NT65. But also, some rules have terminals on the right, like NT8 -> t5. That's allowed because it's a production where a terminal is either the left-hand side or part of the right-hand side. Wait, though, in CNF, the productions are either A -> BC, A -> B, or A -> a. But in the given grammar, we have a mix. Some rules produce two non-terminals, others produce a non-terminal and a terminal, and even terminals can be productions (like the terminals 't0' to 't5' on the right-hand side of some rules, which I think are terminals because they are the results of the productions.\n\nSo, the grammar as given is a mix of CNF productions, some producing terminals and non-terminals, but perhaps not. Wait, in the initial problem statement, it's mentioned that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. So maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, no\u2014the given grammar seems to have rules like NT68 -> NT66 NT65 or perhaps other combinations, and others have terminals like 't3' as part of the production. Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT68 NT63, and includes other S rules. Then, later on, there are rules like NT68 -> NT66 NT65. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the rules are all of the form NT_X -> NT_Y NT_Z or NT_X -> 'tN', where N is likely a number.\n\nWait, no, some rules have both NT and 't' on the right-hand side, like NT94 -> NT75 NT49, and others have just NT parts, but I also see rules like NT2 -> t3. So these terminal productions are possible. Thus, perhaps some rules have two NTs, others have one NT and a terminal, and even rules with two terminals (but since it's in CNF, that's not allowed, as CNF must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS).\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, do any rules have two terminals on the RHS? Looking through the grammar, I see NT2 -> t3, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT8 -> t5, NT9 -> t5, etc. So, in this context, the grammar includes both two NTs on the RHS and an NT and a terminal. That means it's not strictly in CNF because CNF requires exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. However, the terminal can appear alongside an NT, which is allowed in an extended version of CNF where productions can also be A \u2192 a B, where a is a terminal. So perhaps this grammar is in a slightly different form but still can be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar was correctly provided, and I'm just supposed to assume it's in CNF, even though some rules produce a terminal plus an NT. But in that case, during parsing, when a non-terminal appears in the RHS, it requires further expansion, and when a terminal is produced, it's part of the string.\n\nBut let's not get stuck on that. The next step is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt3 t3 t5 t2 t4 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t0 t4 t0 t3 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t3 t1 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t5 t5 t2 t5 t4 t3 t2 t3\n\nSo, let's count the tokens: 41.\n\nTo parse, I think I can use a recursive descent approach, building the string from the top down, but given the string's length, that's impractical manually. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or some properties of the grammar that can help me quickly determine if the string is possible.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if each token in the string can be matched by directly deriving from the grammar. Since the string only has 't3's and a few 't0', 't1', 't2', and 't4's, I can look for where these terminals appear in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can make a list of which terminals are produced:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT2 -> t3\n- NT3 -> t4\n- NT4 -> t5\n- NT6 -> t5? Let me check the grammar:\n\nWait, let me go through each production rule and note which produce which terminals:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n3. NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n4.

The string is composed of tokens like 't0', 't1', etc., and I have to analyze how they connect based on the grammar rules provided.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a grammar in CNF has each production rule producing exactly two non-terminals. The given grammar has rules like S -> NT68 NT63, S -> NT64 NT78, and so on, with various non-terminals (NT) on the left and more specific symbols on the right.

Wait, looking again, NT93 -> NT39 NT66, and NT39 -> t0, and NT66 -> t3. Wait, actually, the rule for NT39 is NT39 -> t0, and NT66 -> t3. So NT93 would produce t0 followed by t3, but in the string, we have t3 followed by others. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, let me clarify. NT93 is defined as NT39 NT66, and NT39 -> t0, NT66 -> t3. So NT93 produces t0 t3. Similarly, other NT rules might produce sequences of t's.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t3.

The string is quite long, consisting of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I need to recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the production rules either have two non-terminals or a terminal, except for the one where NT75 -> 't3'\u2014wait, that's a terminal symbol on the right-hand side. So that's acceptable because in CNF, single terminals are allowed; the important part is that left-hand sides are non-terminals, and right-hand sides can be either terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, almost all the right-hand sides are two non-terminals except for a few, like NT75, NT12, etc., which have a single terminal. That's fine.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t3 t3 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t1 t5 t1 t3 t4 t2 t1 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t1 t2 t5 t1 t3 t0 t3 t0 t1 t3`. \n\nI'll note that this string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, probably corresponding to terminal symbols. The grammar has rules that eventually lead to terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. I need to figure out if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, decoding might involve looking for the way terminals are produced by non-terminals. Each non-terminal can be expanded into either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, to generate a string, we can start from the start symbol S and apply the productions, possibly non-deterministically, until we get a string of terminals.\n\nBut manually going through the entire process for such a long string would be tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the start symbol S. The grammar has two initial rules for S:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\nS -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT68 followed by NT63 or NT64 followed by NT78.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t3, t3.

{"custom_id":"request-779","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens, and each token seems to correspond to a production rule in the grammar. The grammar consists of multiple rules where non-terminals (like S, NT62, etc.) can produce pairs of other tokens or other non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals produce terminal tokens represented by 't' followed by a number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's given in a format where each line is a production rule for a non-terminal, and on the right-hand side, it's either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, which is appropriate for our string.\n\nThe string provided is `t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t3 t1 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t0 t3 t3 t5 t5 t2 t2 t4 t1 t2 t5 t3 t4 t3 t4 t3 t5 t5 t1 t3 t5 t0 t3`. That's 39 tokens. Each token is a terminal symbol, either t3, t4, etc.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the grammar is context-free and in CNF, I can use a method like the CYK algorithm or generate all possible derivations step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two production rules:\n1. S -> NT68 NT63\n2. S -> NT64 NT78\n\nSo, any string generated by the grammar must start with exactly two symbols derived from these rules. The given string starts with t3, t3, t3, etc., so the first two symbols must be t3 and t3 if it's derived from the first rule, or t3 and t3 if from the second rule again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, let's check the right-hand sides of S:\nNT68 is in the grammar. Checking the rules for NT68, it's defined as NT0 NT39. So, NT68 -> NT0 NT39.\n\nSimilarly, NT63: Looking at the rules, NT63 is NT97 NT65. NT97 is defined as 't5', and NT65 is 't5' as per the rules.\n\nSo, the first production for S is S -> NT68 NT63, which translates to (NT0, NT39) and (NT97, NT65), which are NT0 -> NT48 NT47, NT39 -> NT27 NT97.\n\nSo, the start symbol S would derive into the two symbols from NT68 and NT63, which are t3 (since NT97 is 't5' but wait, wait\u2014no, NT97 is a non-terminal, which is defined as 't5' as per the rules? No, wait. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the rules have NT75 -> 't3', NT69 -> 't0', NT38 -> 't3', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals. So for example, NT75 -> 't3', so if a non-terminal NT75 is in a derivation, it becomes 't3'.\n\nBut looking at S's production:\n\nS -> NT68 NT63\n\nSo NT68 is NT0 NT39, and NT63 is NT97 NT65.\n\nWait, so NT68: NT68 -> NT0 NT39, which themselves are non-terminals. NT0 is defined as NT48 NT47, which are non-terminals, and NT39 is NT27 NT97. NT27 is a non-terminal, NT97 is a terminal 't5' according to the rules. Similarly, NT65 is 't5' as per NT65 -> 't5'.\n\nWait, so let me break this down.\n\nStarting from S, expanding it as S -> NT68 NT63.\n\nSo, the first part is NT68, which becomes NT0 NT39.\n\nThen the second part is NT63, which is NT97 NT65, which are terminals 't5' and 't5'.\n\nSo, the entire string derived from S using the first production would start with NT68 NT63 -> (NT0 NT39)(NT97 NT65) -> which is four symbols. But wait, in the string given, the first token is t3, but NT97 produces 't5' and NT65 produces 't5', so the initial two tokens would be 't5' and 't5', but the string starts with t3, t3, t3, etc.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to the first production of S, the first part NT68 would expand to NT0 NT39, which are both non-terminals, and then the second part is NT63 which is two terminals. So the first step in the derivation would produce four symbols: two non-terminals followed by two terminals.\n\nThat seems off because the given string starts with t3, t3, t3, t3. So the first two symbols should be non-terminals. Let me see if I can reconcile this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the entire string is built by concatenating the symbols from each production as they are expanded. So let's consider the first symbol of the string.\n\nIn the first production S -> NT68 NT63, NT68 expands into NT0 and NT39, which are non-terminals, and NT63 expands into NT97 and NT65, which are terminals 't5' and 't5'. So combining these, the initial part would be NT0 (which would expand further) and NT39, followed by 't5', 't5'.\n\nBut the given string starts with t3, t3, t3, t3. That would mean that the first production S -> NT68 NT63 would generate a string that starts with 't5' and 't5', but here we have 't3's. So perhaps the start symbol S is being expanded via the second production, which is S -> NT64 NT78.\n\nLet me check that. S's second production is NT64 and NT78. So NT64 is a non-terminal, and NT78 is another.\n\nLooking up NT64: NT64 -> NT60 NT14.\n\nNT14 is a non-terminal which also expands. Let's see: NT14 -> NT1 NT98.\n\nWait, NT98 is a terminal 't2'? Or is it 't2' or another? Wait, in the rules, NT98 is defined as 't2'? Wait, NT98 is a non-terminal: looking at the rules, I see that NT98 -> NT58 NT65. Wait, but NT98 is a terminal? Or no, because NT58 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking for NT64 and NT78.\n\nNT64 -> NT60 NT14.\n\nNT60 is defined as NT68 NT18.\n\nWait, no, looking again: NT68 is defined as NT0 NT39. NT60 must be checked.\n\nWait, looking at the rules for NT60: yes, I see NT60 -> NT68 NT18.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps instead of expanding everything, I can try to see what the initial steps would produce.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t3, t3, t3, ... maybe looking for a production where the first symbol is t3.\n\nLooking at the rules, which non-terminals produce 't3'? Let's see:\n\nNT34 -> NT1 NT78, but I don't know what NT1 or NT78 produce.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, some non-terminals are defined as terminals. For example, NT38 is defined as 't3', NT45 -> 't5', NT47 -> 't5' in some cases, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking for non-terminals that directly produce t3 in the right-hand side of a production.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT38 -> 't3'\n- NT85 -> 't2'\n- NT94 -> 't2'\n- NT33 -> 't0' (t33)\n- NT47 -> 't5' in some cases, but I think earlier ones are 't5'\nWait, looking again, maybe NT38 is 't3', but wait, in some rules it's 't3' and in others it's 't5'? Let me check:\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\n- NT38 -> NT12 NT44: that's two non-terminals\n- NT38 -> NT1 NT66: Also two non-terminals\n- NT38 -> 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-802","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string, and I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Hmm, CNF is a specific form where each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, right? That usually makes parsing easier, but I'm not too familiar with the details, so I'll have to think through it.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It seems to consist of multiple production rules for various symbols, ending with some terminal symbols 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5'. Each rule is either S \u2192 NT X Y, where X and Y are non-terminals, or directly producing a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which I think means that S non-terminals NT68 and NT63 produce t3 each, because looking further down, NT68 \u2192 t3, and NT63 \u2192 t3. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nActually, looking at the rules, many of the NT symbols produce various other NT symbols until they eventually stop, replacing with 't' and numbers. So for example, NT68 \u2192 t3, so when you parse a terminal, you look for the rules that produce it directly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by a number, like t5, t2, etc. The string is: `t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t1 t1 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t3 t5 t2 t5 t3 t2 t1 t3 t1 t3 t2 t2 t5 t5 t2 t3 t5 t3`. That's a lot of tokens, but each one is directly given.\n\nNow, how to approach this? Well, since CNF has non-terminals producing two non-terminals, I guess we can model this as a decision process where each step replaces two non-terminals with their productions. But since the string is given, perhaps I should try to parse it step by step, making sure that the entire string is covered and that the replacement rules match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a parse tree. Each node in the parse tree corresponds to a non-terminal symbol, and the leaves are the terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children, corresponding to the two symbols on the right-hand side of each production rule.\n\nSo, starting with S, which produces NT68 and NT63. The first symbol in the string is t5. Let's trace through:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. The first token is t5. So looking at NT68, it has a rule: NT68 \u2192 t3. But the first symbol is t5, so that doesn't match. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I got the order wrong. NT68 is the first non-terminal, and NT63 is the second. So perhaps I need to split the string into two parts and see which non-terminal corresponds to each part.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look at each token as being generated by a production. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces two non-terminals, and each non-terminal ultimately produces a terminal.\n\nSo, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, which means each must be the result of a production chain starting from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can think of the string as being divided into pairs, each pair being the two symbols produced by a non-terminal in a production. But that might not necessarily be the case because the non-terminals can be nested, leading to more than two symbols at each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the parsing as a recursive descent approach, where each production step consumes two symbols and produces a terminal.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the first token: t5. So, which non-terminals produce t5? Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t5\n- NT5 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 t5 (Wait, looking back, I don't see NT7, but check the list: Oh, right, NT1 is t5, NT24 is t1, NT26 is t4, NT27 is t5, etc.)\n\nWait, actually, let's go through all the end rules to see which produce t5. From the rules provided:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t5\nNT45 \u2192 t5\nNT18 \u2192 t5\nNT24 \u2192 t1\nNT39 \u2192 t0\nNT44 \u2192 t5? Wait, looking for t5: \n\nLooking back, NT45 \u2192 t5, NT27 \u2192 t5, NT39 \u2192 t0, etc.\n\nWait, it's a bit confusing. Let's make a list:\n\nAll rules ending with a terminal:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t5\n- NT5 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 Hmm, maybe I missed some.

{"custom_id":"request-815","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what I have here.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that there are a lot of non-terminals (like S, NT62, NT63, etc.) and several terminals represented by 't' followed by a number. These terminals are the actual output symbols that make up the language.\n\nThe string to evaluate is long, but I notice that it's composed entirely of t-something, which matches the structure of the grammar's productions. Each 't' is followed by a number, so I'm guessing each terminal is a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol, S. The grammar has two productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo whatever string is generated must be the result of these two non-terminals expanding. Each of these is a two-symbol NT followed by another NT or letter.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t3. So I need to find how these NTs expand.\n\nLet me build a parse tree starting from S. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if it can be generated by expanding S step by step.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT68 and NT63. Let me check what each NT68 and NT63 produces.\n\nLooking at NT68, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nSo NT68 directly becomes 't3'. That's good because our string starts with 't3'.\n\nNow, NT63: according to the grammar, NT63 is one of the productions, but looking through all the productions, I don't see NT63 directly. So perhaps NT63 expands to something else. Wait, I should double-check the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar initially was provided a bit confusingly with the NTs listed. Let me search for NT63 in the productions.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nSo NT63 is replaced by NT84 and NT62.\n\nNow, I need to expand NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT44 NT47\n\nSo NT84 is replaced by NT44 and NT47.\n\nLooking at NT44: according to the grammar, NT44 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo NT44 becomes 't5'.\n\nNT47: according to the grammar, NT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13.\n\nSo NT47 becomes NT85 and NT13.\n\nNow, NT85: checking the grammar, it's replaced by NT18 NT8.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should track each part step by step.\n\nLet me think again. The initial expansion is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 t3 NT63.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 (NT44 NT47) (NT60 NT69).\n\nSo far, the string is t3, followed by NT84, NT62.\n\nExpanding NT84: t5, and NT62: wait, NT62 is another non-terminal.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT34 NT93.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78.\n\nSo NT62 is NT1 NT78.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT45 NT47.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38.\n\nSo NT1 becomes NT88, which becomes NT45 NT47.\n\nNow, this is getting too deep. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to each production.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to use the fact that each production is two non-terminals or a terminal, and the string is built by left or right expansion.\n\nSince the string starts with t3, that must come from NT68, as S \u2192 NT68 NT63, and NT68 \u2192 t3.\n\nThen, the next symbol after t3 is t1, which should come from NT63's expansion.\n\nWait, earlier I saw that NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 \u2192 t5, and NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT93, etc.\n\nBut in the string, after t3 comes t1. Hmm, that might not fit because NT63 expands to NT84 NT62, which would be t5 followed by something else, but the string after t3 is t1, not t5.\n\nWait, that suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong because the first part is t3 t1, but NT63's expansion starts with t5. Alternatively, maybe I misread the NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. S starts with NT68 and NT63. Does the order of expansion matter? Because context-free grammars can derive in any order, but for this string, perhaps we need to see if the entire string can be built by expanding S correctly.\n\nWait, let's see: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 t3 (NT63).\n\nBut the string starts with t3 t1, so after t3, the next symbol is t1. So perhaps NT63 is not NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62, but another production.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out all possible productions for each NT to see how they expand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to represent the string as a sequence and see which NTs can produce each part.\n\nThe string is: t3 t1 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t1 t2 t3 t3 t0 t3 t3 t5 t0 t3 t1 t3 t1 t3 t4 t5 t3 t0 t3 t3 t3 t2 t1 t3 t2 t3 t1 t3.\n\nLet me list the terminals and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nt3: can come from NT62 (since in the grammar, NT62 \u2192 NT34 NT93, but looking for t3, perhaps another NT.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, do any NTs directly produce t3? Looking through all the NTs, I see:\n\nNT97 \u2192 t5\nNT69 \u2192 t0\nNT34 \u2192 t1\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT81 \u2192 t3\nNT26 \u2192 t2\nNT74 \u2192 t3\nNT9 \u2192 t5\nWait, NT26 \u2192 t2, not t3. So where do t3s come from?\n\nLooking at NTs, I see:\n\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT81 \u2192 t3\nNT74 \u2192 t3\nNT62 \u2192 t3? Wait, I think earlier I made a mistake in NT62. Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, looking for NT62:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT34 NT93\n\nSo NT62 doesn't directly produce t3, but from NT62's expansion, it's possible that via the steps, we might get t3.\n\nBut in the string, the first t3 is okay as it comes from NT68 \u2192 t3. Then, the next t1.\n\nHmm, let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT68 NT63 \u2192 t3 NT63.\n\n2. Now, the next part is t1, but NT63's expansion is NT84 NT62. As per the grammar, NT64 is another option for S, but I'm on the NT63 path.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string can arise from either the S \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78 path.\n\nLet me check the second option:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT33 NT66\n\nFirst, NT64 \u2192 t60 t14.\n\nThen NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18.\n\nBut t60 would be 't3' perhaps? Wait, looking back, NT68 \u2192 t3, yes.\n\nWait, checking NT60, but in the grammar, BTW, looking through the NTs, does NT60 directly produce a terminal or is it another non-terminal? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n\nSo NT60 is a non-terminal that itself expands into two non-terminals.\n\nThis is getting too recursive. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to check if the string can be split according to the grammar's productions.\n\nGiven the string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, perhaps each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol. So the string is 35 terminals long.\n\nSince S produces two non-terminals, the string must be the concatenation of two parts, each derived from the two"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it constraints the production rules to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar.

Let me list all rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\nNT75 \u2192 t1\nNT69 \u2192 t0\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT81 \u2192 t3\nNT26 \u2192 t2\nNT18 \u2192 t1\nNT49 \u2192 t1\nNT84 \u2192 t3\nNT97 \u2192 t3\nNT19 \u2192 t2 (from NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, and perhaps NT66 \u2192 t3, but no. Wait no, in the rules listed, I see NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, but then where does NT1 go? Let me check the rule NT1: from the list, NT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90, and then NT88 \u2192 t4, NT90 \u2192 NT2 NT60. NT2 \u2192 t3, and so on. Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, I think I should create a mapping from each non-terminal to the terminals they can produce. For example, NT68 produces t3, NT69 produces t0, NT38 produces t3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if each step in the string can be associated with a production rule's right-hand side.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t3 t5 t3 t5 t5 t5 t3 t5 t5 t3 t5 t2 t3 t2 t5 t3 t2 t3 t1 t0 t3 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t3 t4 t2 t5 t3 t4 t4 t5 t5 t3 t3 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t0 t3.\n\nGiven the length is 57 symbols, which would require 56 production steps since each production step in CNF replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time. Starting from 1 symbol (the start symbol S), after 56 steps, we'd have 57 symbols.\n\nBut since the start symbol S \u2192 NT68 NT63, perhaps S is expanded early in the process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived as a sequence of replacements. But without knowing the exact steps, it might be easier to check if each production rule can be applied correctly.\n\nBut given the number of steps, it's quite long. Perhaps another approach is to see if all the terminals can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to note that in CNF grammars, the structure of the string must correspond to a binary tree where each node has exactly two children, and each terminal corresponds to a leaf. The structure should match the grammar's rules. Therefore, the number of terminals should be a power of two? Wait, not exactly. The number of leaves in a binary tree is (number of nodes) + 1. Wait, for n levels, the number of leaves is 2^n. Wait, for example, height 2: 4 leaves. But in this case, the string length is 57, which is more than a power of two, but not exactly. Actually, perhaps it's not necessary; the key is that the derivation must correctly match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for certain patterns. For example, the start symbol S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so the entire string must eventually derive from these two non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is to check each terminal and see if their parent in the tree is correctly defined in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for each pair in the string and see if their production rules exist.\n\nLet's list the possible two-symbol pairs and see if each can be derived from a production rule.\n\nBut given that there are 56 pairs in the string (since 57 symbols), this might take too long. But perhaps I can look for the known productions that can generate 't's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each 't' symbol can be produced by some non-terminal. For example, 't0' is produced by NT47. 't1' by NT75, 't2' by NT69, NT62, NT97, NT19, etc. Let's see.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can list all the rules that produce each terminal:\n\n- 't0': NT47 \u2192 t0\n- 't1': NT75 \u2192 t1, NT62 \u2192 t2? Wait, no. Wait, I need to check each rule that ends with t0, t1, etc.\n\nLooking back, for example:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT88 NT90 \u2192 t3? Let me see:\n\nWait, the rules:\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 t4\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT18 \u2192 t1\n- NT38 \u2192 t3 (from NT38 \u2192 t3)\n- NT75 \u2192 t1 (from NT75 \u2192 t1)\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT49 \u2192 t1\n- NT97 \u2192 t3\n- NT19 \u2192 t2 (from NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66; but then NT1 is t4, and NT66 is t3, so NT19 is t2 because of NT19 \u2192 t2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to create a dictionary mapping each non-terminal to the possible terminals it can produce based on the given rules. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from the given rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT75 \u2192 t1\n- NT69 \u2192 t0\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT47 \u2192 t3?\nWait, no. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at each rule, I see:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0\n\nThen NT48 may produce some terminal. Looking for all rules where the right-hand side ends with t.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT81 \u2192 t3\n- NT26 \u2192 t2\n- NT60 \u2192 t5\n- NT34 \u2192 t1\n- NT58 \u2192 t3\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT94 \u2192 t2\n- NT19 \u2192 t2?\nWait, but NT19's rule is NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT66, so it doesn't directly produce a terminal, it's another non-terminal split.\n\nAh, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see if I can create a list of all non-terminals that can produce each terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t0: NT47 \u2192 t0\n- t1: NT75 \u2192 t1, NT47 \u2192 t1? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-843","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. First, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar provided has S and several NT (Non-Terminals) with productions. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like 't3 t1 t5 ...'.\n\nI think the best approach is to use the CYK algorithm because it's designed for CNF grammars and can efficiently determine whether a string is in the language. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so I'll try to walk through it mentally.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by parsing the string in a dynamic programming table where each cell Mi,j represents whether the substring from position i to j can be generated by the non-terminal at that position. The algorithm starts by initializing the table based on single characters and then builds up to longer substrings.\n\nFirst, I need to note the grammar rules to set up the table. The start symbol is S, so I need all productions that expand S. Looking at the grammar, S can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78.\n\nSo, the first pass is to map the terminals to their positions in the string. The string is 43 characters long, so the indices are from 1 to 43. I'll need to split the string into the correct tokens: each token is either 't' followed by a number or maybe just a number? Wait, looking at the grammar, the terminals are 't0', 't1', ..., 't9', so each 't' followed by a single digit. So the string is a sequence of these.\n\nWait, the string is given as a list of 't's and numbers, like \"t3 t1 t5...\" which are separate tokens. So the first step is to split the string into individual terminal tokens, each corresponding to a single character after 't'. For example, 't3' is one token, 't1' is another, etc. The string provided has 43 characters, so let's count: each token is either 't' followed by a digit, so each token is two characters except for the 't's. Wait, no\u2014the entire string is a sequence separated by spaces, so each token is \"t...\" with varying digits. Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, the string is: \"t3 t1 t5 t5 t2 t4 t4 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t1 t1 t2 t5 t5 t5 t3 t1 t3 t3 t2 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t0 t3 t3\".\n\nLet me count the number of tokens here. Each 't' followed by a digit is one token. Let's see: I'll list them:\n\n1. t3\n2. t1\n3. t5\n4. t5\n5. t2\n6. t4\n7. t4\n8. t3\n9. t3\n10. t4\n11. t5\n12. t4\n13. t1\n14. t1\n15. t2\n16. t5\n17. t5\n18. t5\n19. t3\n20. t1\n21. t3\n22. t3\n23. t2\n24. t5\n25. t3\n26. t4\n27. t5\n28. t3\n29. t5\n30. t3\n31. t3\n32. t3\n33. t3\n34. t3\n35. t2\n36. t3\n37. t3\n38. t2\n39. t4\n40. t5\n41. t3\n42. t4\n43. t4\n44. t0\n45. t3\n46. t3\n\nWait, that's 46 tokens, but the length is 46, but the string as written is actually: Let me recount, maybe I'm miscounting. The given string is a single string with spaces. Let me see: It starts with \"t3 t1 t5 t5 t2 t4 t4 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t1 t1 t2 t5 t5 t5 t3 t1 t3 t3 t2 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t0 t3 t3\". Let me count the 't's: Each 't' is a separate token except for the multi-digit, but from the grammar, the terminals are 't0' to 't9', so each 't' followed by a single digit is a token. So each token is a single 't' plus one digit, so each token is two characters except where the 't' is alone? Wait no, because in the grammar, the terminals are 't0' etc., which are two-character strings. So in the string, each 't' is part of a two-character terminal token. But looking at the string provided: it's \"t3 t1 t5 t5 t2 t4 t4 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t1 t1 t2 t5 t5 t5 t3 t1 t3 t3 t2 t5 t3 t4 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t0 t3 t3\".\n\nWait, each token is either two characters, 't' followed by a digit, so each token is two characters long. Let me count how many tokens that would make in the given string. The string as written is 43 characters, so if each token is two characters, that would require 44 characters (since it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the tokens are each two characters, and the entire string includes the spaces. So the length including spaces is 46 (43 tokens and 45 spaces?), but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the given string is a list of tokens separated by spaces, each token being like \"t3\", \"t1\", etc. So the number of tokens is 43, each taking up two characters in the string. So the total length would be (43 * 2) + (42 spaces) = 86 + 42 = 128 characters? But the given string is written as a single line that's much shorter than that. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should just take the string as a list of tokens, each being a two-character string like \"t3\", \"t1\", etc. So the string is split into tokens as follows:\n\nEach token is two characters: the 't' followed by a digit. So the string, when split on spaces, gives a list where each element is \"t3\", \"t1\", etc.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the string into tokens. Let me try that.

The problem is whether this sequence can be generated by the grammar, not just each symbol. So I need to see if there's a way to derive this sequence by starting from the start symbol S and expanding according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63\nS \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, the first step is that S must produce two non-terminals, either NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78. Then each of those needs to be expanded, and so on until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me list the NTs and their terminal productions. It might be helpful to map each NT to its possible 'tX' or further non-terminals. \n\nFor example, NT68 \u2192 't3', so any node that produces NT68 will directly give 't3'. Similarly, NT64 \u2192 't3', so if S goes to NT64 NT78, then the first part is 't3' and the second must lead to the rest of the string.\n\nBut wait, the given string is 't3 t5 t3 t1 t5 t3 t5 t5 t4 t3 t3 t3 t4 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t0 t1 t3 t1 t1 t3 t1 t3 t3 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t3 t4 t0 t3 t3 t1 t1 t3'.\n\nThat's a long string with multiple branches. I'm not sure how the NTs would expand, but I think the key is to check whether each 'tX' in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each 'tX' in the string, I'll see if the grammar has such a production.\n\nt3: NT48 \u2192 t3, NT58 \u2192 t3 (is that correct?), NT62 \u2192 t3, NT66 \u2192 t3, NT75 \u2192 t3, NT78 \u2192 t3, NT81 \u2192 t3, NT85 \u2192 t3, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, I can see NT68->'t3', NT64->t3, NT62->t3, NT66->t3, several others as well. So t3 has multiple sources.\n\nt5: Similarly, NT69->t2, etc., but let's check what gives t5. Maybe NT45->t5, NT52->t2, NT98->t5, etc. I need to check if each tX exists as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of tX, each as separate symbols. For example, t3 followed by t5, etc. So I need to check each of these.\n\nBut perhaps not all tX are defined in the grammar. Let me look at each symbol in the string:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt3, t5, t3, t1, t5, t3, t5, t5, t4, t3, t3, t3, t4, t1, t3, t3, t3, t3, t2, t0, t1, t3, t1, t1, t3, t1, t3, t3, t4, t0, t3, t3, t4, t5, t5, t3, t5, t3, t4, t0, t3, t3, t1, t1, t3.\n\nSo each of these is a terminal in the string. I need to check if each exists in the grammar. But looking through the grammar rules, many symbols are non-terminals, and only some are terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar productions, some NTs produce a terminal like t0, t1, etc. For example, NT18 \u2192 t5, NT26 \u2192 t4, NT38 \u2192 t3, NT85 \u2192 t2, and so on. So I need to check if each t in the string is defined as a terminal in any production.\n\nLooking at each symbol:\n\nt3: Yes, NT48\u2192t3, NT68\u2192t3, etc.\n\nt5: Do any non-terminals produce t5? Let's look.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT85\u2192t2, NT52\u2192t2, etc. But how about NT75\u2192t3, NT69\u2192t2, etc. Hmm, not seeing t5. Wait, maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, let's search for all NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules, the right-hand sides are 'tX's. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nNT64 \u2192 t3\n\nNT18 \u2192 t5\n\nNT98 \u2192 t5\n\nNT50 \u2192 t4\n\nNT52 \u2192 t2\n\nNT26 \u2192 t4 (two times)\n\nNT34 \u2192 t1 (appears twice)\n\nNT47 \u2192 t5 twice\n\nNT39 \u2192 t0 (twice)\n\nNT3 \u2192 t4\n\nNT23 \u2192 t2\n\nNT9 \u2192 t5\n\nNT85 \u2192 t2\n\nWait, wait. So are there any 't5's in the grammar? Let me list all the possible tX:\n\nt0: NT60\u2192t5, NT0\u2192t47, NT68\u2192t3, NT64\u2192t3, NT18\u2192t5, NT98\u2192t5, NT50\u2192t4, NT52\u2192t2, NT26\u2192t4, NT34\u2192t1, NT47\u2192t5, etc. So, the NTs that produce t5 are:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT98 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT47 \u2192 t5 (appears in rules for NT47\u2192NT85 NT13 and others, but in the end, NT47\u2192t5?)\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some NTs produce a terminal, and others produce non-terminals. For example, NT47: the rules show NT47\u2192NT85 NT13, which are both NTs, and sometimes NT47\u2192t5. Wait, no: looking back, actually, in the provided grammar, I saw:\n\nLooking for 't5', the grammar has:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 t5\n\nWait, no, looking again: From the given grammar, the productions for NT47 are:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT85 NT13\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT28 NT22\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT0 NT52\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT18 NT97\n\nWait, that's four rules where it combines NTs, but I don't remember seeing a rule where it goes to 't5' directly. Let me check the initial list provided:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules:\n\nLooking for any rules where the left side is NT47 and the right side is 't5':\n\nNo, in the provided list:\n\nAfter NT85 \u2192 t2, I see NT23\u2192t2, NT9\u2192t5. Hmm, perhaps I need to check each line carefully.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nYes, for example:\n\nNT47 \u2192 t5?\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, I have the line NT47\u2192 t5 is not listed because all the lines for NT47 are combinations of NTs, except perhaps one. Wait, the provided rules for NT47 are lines like NT47\u2192t5 are only present in the initial part, but in the given context, I see NT52 \u2192 t2, NT26 \u2192 t4, etc., but no t5. Wait, actually, looking at the initial provided grammar, I don't see NT47\u2192t5 as a production rule. All NT47 rules are combinations.\n\nSo perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe none of the NTs directly produce t5 in the given grammar. So if the string contains any 't5', the grammar cannot produce it, which would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, in the initial grammar, I think I might have missed some rules where NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-860","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is pretty complex with many non-terminals, and the string is a sequence of 't' followed by some numbers. \n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF looks like. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can be a terminal as the base case. All productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right, or a single terminal. So, each step of derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, until we reach terminals, which then form the string.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that each production seems to split into two non-terminals except for some that directly produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which splits S into two non-terminals NT68 and NT63. These non-terminals then further expand, sometimes down to terminals. So this seems to align with CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t5 t5 t1 t2 t4 t0 t3 t5 t3 t3 t5 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t4 t3 t3 t1 t3 t3 t3 t1 t5 t3 t1 t3 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t2 t2 t5 t3 t5 t3`\n\nThis string is a sequence of 37 elements, all combinations of 't' followed by numbers, which correspond to specific terminals in the grammar. The task is to determine if this string can be generated by expanding the start symbol S according to the given rules.\n\nTo approach this, I can think about the steps from the top (start symbol S) and see if I can split the string into parts that match the terminals produced by S's expansions. Alternatively, since the string is given, perhaps I can work backwards, starting from the terminals and seeing if I can build up the string by matching the reverse of the grammar's expansions.\n\nLooking at the grammar's productions for S, there are two main rules:\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, the string must split into two parts, one part generated by NT68 and the other by NT63, or vice versa for the second option (NT64 and NT78).\n\nI'll need to check if the entire string can be divided into such a structure.\n\nBut wait, each of these non-terminals can themselves expand. For example, NT68 can expand into more NTs, and each of those can do the same until they reach terminals. So, effectively, the string is built by recursively expanding S and its components until we reach terminals, which form the 't's with numbers.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the structure of the grammar. The grammar seems to be built with specific non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals and eventually terminals. Each production rule is in CNF, producing two non-terminals, no more.\n\nGiven the string, perhaps the best approach is to check if it can be split into two parts according to one of the S productions. Let me look at the string and see if it can align with such a split.\n\nThe first two elements after S's initial split would need to come from NT68 and NT63, or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT68 NT63 first.\n\nNT68: Looking at the grammar, NT68 can produce NT66 NT68. Wait, no, let me check the grammar rules. Looking back, I see NT68 \u2192 NT63 NT64.\n\nWait no, looking at the initial grammar provided, I think I might have misread. Let me go through the production rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT68 is defined as:\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT68. Or is that correct? Let me check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT68: \"NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT68\" \u2014 but that's a left-recursive rule. Wait, context-free grammars can have recursive rules, but in CNF, they should be simplified to eliminate left recursion. So, perhaps the actual rules are non-left-recursive.\n\nWait, the grammar given in the problem may have some left-recursive rules, which would need to be transformed into CNF, but since it's already in CNF, perhaps those rules are written differently.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, some rules are in the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, which is fine for CNF. However, other rules might have more complex structures. Let me check if any rules have more than two symbols on the right-hand side, which they don't, except for the start symbol possibly.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, every rule is either a terminal or splits into two non-terminals, except perhaps the start symbol S, which may split into two non-terminals. So, that fits CNF.\n\nBut for example, looking at the grammar, NT68 is defined as: `NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT68`, which is a recursive definition that could cause an infinite loop. But since it's in CNF, perhaps that's handled through the derivation.\n\nWait, but in CNF, non-terminals can only expand into two non-terminals at a time, so any recursive rules must be in the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, in that case, NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT68 is another form of A \u2192 BC, just with a loop. So that's fine.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to apply the productions recursively, starting from S, expanding it into NT68 and NT63, then each of those can split further, and so on, until we reach the given string.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, it might be impractical to do this manually. So perhaps we can find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string corresponds to a derivation starting from S, splitting into two parts, each part being a concatenation of the expansions of NT68 and NT63, for example. \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the string as a tree. Each node represents a non-terminal, and each edge represents a production rule. The root is S, and the leaves are the terminals that form the string. But since the string is pretty long, building such a tree is not feasible manually.\n\nAnother idea is to model this as a context-free parsing problem, where we try to parse the string into the grammar. If the string can be successfully parsed, then it is generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that all productions are in CNF, so the grammar is a right- or left-factored grammar. But without knowing the exact form, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in the grammar splits into two, perhaps the string can be seen as a series of splits, each corresponding to a production step. The string's length is 37, which is an odd number, so perhaps this can be modeled as a binary tree with 37 leaves, which isn't possible since 37 is not a power of two minus one.\n\nWait, wait, the number of symbols in a derivation starting from S using binary productions (each production producing two symbols at each step) leads to a number of leaves equal to 2^n, where n is the number of splits. But 37 is not a power of two, so perhaps that indicates a specific way of splitting.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look for certain terminals that can only result from specific non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: start with t3, t4, t5, etc.\n\nLet me look at the rules for each non-terminal. For example, the first non-terminal in the string is t3. Looking at the grammar, where can t3 come from? Looking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT85 NT13, which further splits, but then looking for terminals, perhaps NTx \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce t3. For example, NT33 \u2192 t3, NT39 \u2192 t0 (wait, wait no, looking again, for example:\n\nLooking through the terminal productions, each non-terminal can produce certain 't' values. For example:\n\nNT38 \u2192 t3 (from NT38 \u2192 t3 in the grammar)\n\nSimilarly, NT39 \u2192 t0, but in the given grammar, looking for t3, I see NT33 and NT77, etc., produce t3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that produce t3 as their terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-863","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but I remember CNF has specific rules about the production rules\u2014like each production should have two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one non-terminal on the right, and the left-hand side can't have epsilon. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see all the production rules are in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which has two non-terminals, so that fits. Each rule either splits two non-terminals or a terminal (like 't1', 't2', etc.) into two parts. So the structure seems to be correct, which is good because CNF makes things a bit more predictable in terms of parsing.\n\nNow, the string we need to check is a sequence of these 't's and numbers, like 't3 t3 t3 ...' and so on. My first thought is that each token in the string corresponds to a production rule. So for the grammar to generate the string, each part must match exactly what's produced by the rules.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into tokens. The string is:\n\nt3 t3 t3 t3 t5 t2 t3 t1 t5 t1 t4 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t5 t3 t3 t4 t5 t5 t0 t2 t1 t5 t1 t4 t4 t0 t3 t5 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t3 t5 t3 t5 t5 t0 t3.\n\nEach of these is a single token, perhaps corresponding to a single production step. So, for the string to be generated, each token must match what a production can generate directly. But wait, in CNF, productions have two non-terminals on the left, so each step of a derivation would replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals. However, in this case, the tokens seem to represent the final symbols when the derivation reaches a terminal.\n\nSo, maybe each 't' is a terminal symbol, so the grammar starts from S and eventually produces a string of terminals. Each production step produces non-terminals, and when a non-terminal can't be split anymore, it produces a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, and it directly produces two non-terminals, like NT68 NT63. So, to get the string, the derivation would start with S \u2192 NT68 NT63, then each of those NTs would split further. It's like a binary tree where each node splits into two until we reach the leaves, which are the terminals (like t3, t5, etc.).\n\nSo, the approach is to see if each token can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals into their respective replacement terms.\n\nLet me try to see if each token corresponds to a production. For example, if S can produce the first token 't3', but wait, S is a non-terminal that produces NT68 NT63. So for the first token, we need NT68 to produce 't3' and NT63 to produce 't3', or some combination where each part can produce the respective token.\n\nWait, no, because the entire string is a single production that must be built up step by step. Each step replaces non-terminals with other non-terminals until all leaves are terminals. So each token in the string must correspond to a path in the grammar tree.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is to reverse the process: instead of expanding S, I can reduce the string to S using the inverse of the production rules.\n\nThat's a method called \"top-down\" for parsing, but in this case, it's more about seeing if each token can be matched by the right-hand side of a production.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar again. The non-terminals are things like NT68, NT63, etc. Each production for a non-terminal is a pair of non-terminals, except when a rule has a terminal on the left, like NT97 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo each non-terminal is defined as producing exactly two non-terminals, except the terminals which have only the terminal token.\n\nSo, to get the string, each non-terminal must be replaceable by a pair of terminals or non-terminals, ultimately building up to produce the string.\n\nBut wait, the string we have is a series of tokens, so each of these is either a terminal or a non-terminal from the grammar's productions.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to check each position in the string against the possible terminals derived from the grammar.\n\nBut since each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, and each of those can also expand, this seems like a binary tree structure. However, the provided string is quite long, so it's impractical to do step-by-step expansion manually. Maybe I can look for repeating patterns or check if the string can be constructed by combining the terminals from the expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' is derived from a non-terminal that directly maps to 't' somewhere in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see productions like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, and some of these terminals are 't3', 't5', etc. For example, NT1 \u2192 't3', NT2 \u2192 't3', NT9 \u2192 't5', NT8 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nWait, let's list out all the terminals and their corresponding nt's:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't3'\nNT75 \u2192 't3'\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\nNT62 \u2192 't2'\nNT17 \u2192 't4'\nNT34 \u2192 't1'\nNT94 \u2192 't2'\nNT72 \u2192 't0'\nNT55 \u2192 't4'\nNT84 \u2192 't3'\nNT44 \u2192 't4'\nNT3 \u2192 't4'\nNT24 \u2192 't0'\nNT55 \u2192 't4'\nNT85 \u2192 't2'\nNT18 \u2192 't1'\nNT50 \u2192 't4'\nNT75 \u2192 't1'\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\nNT62 \u2192 't2'\nNT17 \u2192 't4'\nNT81 \u2192 't2'\nNT97 \u2192 't3'\nNT33 \u2192 't3'\nNT94 \u2192 't2'\nNT74 \u2192 't3'\nNT39 \u2192 't0'\nNT47 \u2192 't5'\nNT89 \u2192 't5'\nNT24 \u2192 't0'\nNT34 \u2192 't1'\nNT47 \u2192 't5'\nNT58 \u2192 't3'\nNT75 \u2192 't1'\nNT81 \u2192 't4'\nNT97 \u2192 't3'\nNT33 \u2192 't3'\nNT44 \u2192 't4'\nNT34 \u2192 't5'\nNT75 \u2192 't3'\nNT50 \u2192 't4'\nNT77 \u2192 't3'\nNT73 \u2192 'Hmm, I think a typo in the grammar?

Let me scan again: NT62, NT63, NT64, etc., but I don't see NT73. Maybe it's a typo and should be NT74? Or perhaps it's okay because in the string, there's 't3' but the grammar doesn't have an NT73 rule. Hmm, maybe that's not relevant now. Let me focus on the tokens we have.\n\nOkay, let's note that each 't' in the string corresponds to a specific production. For example:\n\n- 't3' could come from several Nts, like NT68, NT66, NT48, NT62, etc.\n- 't5' could come from Nts like NT78, NT26, NT47, NT9, etc.\n\nSo the question is whether, by expanding the initial S, all the terminals in the given string can be generated.\n\nBut manually expanding would take too much time, so maybe a better approach is to see if the count of non-terminals in the string is compatible with the grammar's production rules.\n\nWait, in context-free grammars, especially in CNF, each production splits a symbol into two, so starting from S (a single symbol), after one expansion, we have two symbols. After each step, the number of symbols doubles. But in reality, since some productions may lead to terminals, the number of non-terminals may vary.\n\nBut in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals, so the initial S must eventually derive into the given string. However, each expansion step adds non-terminals until we reach terminals. So the number of non-terminals must be compatible with the length of the string.\n\nWait, more accurately, the derivation goes S \u2192 ... \u2192 string of terminals. So the number of symbols needs to match the product of the splits.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string to be parsed: `t3 t1 t5 t3 t5 t0 t3 t3 t3 t5 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t3 t3 t3 t2 t2 t0 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t0 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t4 t2 t3 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t1 t5 t4 t0 t3 t5 t3`. That's a long string with multiple 't's and three-digit combinations. \n\nI recall that parsing context-free grammars can be done using methods like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing. Since this is Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I notice that most non-terminals on the left produce two non-terminals on the right, except where they produce a single terminal like NT62 \u2192 't3' or similar.\n\nThe goal is to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT68 NT63, so all valid derivations must start with NT68 producing something and NT63 producing something else.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Since this is a bit complex, I'll look for patterns or known sequences that might help.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So the string starts with NT68 (which should produce 't3' as per NT68 \u2192 't3'), then NT63 (which, looking at the grammar, NT63 is a non-terminal. Wait, checking the rules: looking for NT63, I see NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62. Oh, but wait, that might not be correct; looking back, the grammar includes NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62? Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT63, yes, I see:\nNT63 -> NT68 NT62\nSo NT63 goes to NT68 and NT62.\n\nSo for S \u2192 NT68 NT63, the first step is NT68 \u2192 't3' and NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62. Then, the string must start with 't3' followed by whatever NT63 produces.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't3'. That matches NT68. Next, the second token is 't1'. Wait, but NT63 should produce something. Let's see, NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62, which is 't3' followed by whatever NT62 produces. So the string after 't3' would be 't1 t5 t3 t5 t0 t3 t3 t3 t5 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t3 t3 t3 t2 t2 t0 t3 t3 t3 t4 t3 t0 t4 t0 t3 t3 t4 t4 t2 t3 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t1 t5 t4 t0 t3 t5 t3'. Wait, that's a lot. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a stack-based approach for parsing. Let's think of the string as tokens and check if they can be formed by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can map the string to the corresponding non-terminals and see if each part can be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to work backwards or look for specific rules that can match parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't3 t1 t5...'. Let's see if there's a rule that starts with 't3 t1'. Looking at the grammar, for NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, which might not help. Alternatively, NT68 \u2192 't3', so perhaps the start is NT68. So the string starts with 't3', which is good.\n\nNext, after 't3', the next token is 't1'. That would imply that the second part of the start production (NT63) starts here. NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62, so after 't3', we expect another 't3' and then NT62. But in the string, after 't3', the next is 't1', which is not 't3'. So that suggests that maybe I'm wrong about how the productions are structured.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for NT63 \u2192 something else. Wait, the grammar for NT63 is only rule: NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62. So after S, the first token is 't3' (NT68), then the next part is NT63, which is 't3' followed by NT62.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to structure this step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with 't3 t1...'. The first token is 't3', which comes from NT68. So S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n2. The next part is 't1', which would be the first part of NT63's production. But NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62, so after 't3', the next tokens should be the production of NT63, which starts with 't3' followed by whatever NT62 produces.\n\nBut in the string, after 't3', the next is 't1', not 't3'. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me look at the grammar again. S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So after S, we have NT68 \u2192 't3' followed by NT63. So the first token is 't3', and the next is the entire NT63 production.\n\nTherefore, after 't3', the next tokens should follow NT63's production. NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62, which is 't3' 't3' 'something'. So the string should be: 't3' (from NT68), followed by 't3' (from NT68), 'something' (from NT62).\n\nBut the string after the first 't3' is 't1', which is not 't3'. So that suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NT63 production again. In the grammar: NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT62. So it's definitely 't3' followed by NT62. So after the initial 't3' from NT68, the next part must start with 't3' from NT68, then whatever NT62 produces.\n\nIn the string, the sequence after the first 't3' is 't1 t5 t3...'. So it's 't3' followed by 't1', which is not matching NT63's start.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, unless there's another way. Let me think: maybe I can have a different start. Is S the only start symbol? Yes. So the derivation must start with S.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the string can be broken down differently, but I can't see any other way to start because S only has those two productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a short parser, but given the complexity and the length of the string, it's impractical to do here manually.\n\nBut given that the second token after the initial 't3' is 't1', which doesn't fit NT63's structure (which starts with 't3'), I think the string is invalid.

That must be a mistake. Probably, the grammar has both terminals and non-terminals, but some non-terminals are reduced to terminals. So, for example, NT38 might have a production that reduces to 't5', but that would mean it's a terminal. Hmm, that's conflicting because in the rules, NT38 is a non-terminal with multiple productions, so if it has a terminal, it's because one of its productions is a terminal. But in CNF, a terminal should be a single symbol. Wait, but in this grammar, NT68 may reduce to a terminal, but let me see. \n\nWait, looking through the rules, some rules like NT38 \u2192 't5' would mean that NT38 is a terminal. But in the grammar, NT38 is defined with other productions. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe some of the non-terminals have rules that reduce to single terminals, which may or may not be allowed in CNF. In Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. So for a non-terminal, all its productions must have either one terminal or two non-terminals. So, if a production has a terminal, it's allowed if it's a single terminal. However, in this case, some non-terminals have productions like NT38 \u2192 't5', which is a terminal. So that indicates that NT38 is a terminal, which is fine. But wait, that can't be because in the grammar, NT38 has several production rules, some leading to other non-terminals. So perhaps the rules presented are conflicting, meaning that in the grammar, some non-terminals have both terminals and non-terminals in their productions, which is allowed as long as each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut to clarify, for a given non-terminal, all its productions must be either terminals (single) or non-terminals combined. So, if a non-terminal has a production to a single terminal, that's fine. So for example, if NT38 has a rule NT38 \u2192 't5', that's acceptable, but it can't have a production to two non-terminals at the same time. So I need to check whether the grammar is in CNF, but the user says it is, so perhaps some non-terminals have single terminal productions. Wait, but in the given rules, NT38 has a production to 't5', which is a terminal. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the NT's that produce t's are as follows:\n\nLooking for 't' in NT productions:\n\nIn the given list, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT75 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT94 \u2192 't2'\n\nAlso, NT39 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, so each of these would only produce terminal tokens, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with `t3 t4 t3 t5 t0 t2...`. So the first token is t3. Looking at the productions, NT1 and NT2 and NT48 produce t3. Similarly, t4 is produced by NT3, NT17, NT44, etc.\n\nSo, the approach is to build the parse tree for the given string, starting from S, and see if it can derive the string.\n\nHowever, since the string is quite long, it would be tedious to do it manually. So I can look for patterns or perhaps find that certain sequences cannot be derived, which would lead to the string not being generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for whether the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nAnother approach might be to note that in CNF, each production step introduces exactly one non-terminal at a time, reducing the depth of the parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation would be such that each step increases the length by one (since all productions are of the form A\u2192BC, and each step could potentially increase the string length by two, but eventually, non-terminals are replaced by terminals.)\n\nBut to actually process the string, perhaps it's better to look for possible splits into substrings that could be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, another point is that the grammar is a context-free grammar, so it's either ambiguous or not, but since it's in CNF, each production is of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, so for any string, we can attempt to see if it can be split into a sequence of such steps.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best way is to look for sequences in the string that match the possible first steps.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to notice any inconsistencies, like the presence of a terminal that isn't produced by any non-terminal, which would immediately result in 'No'.\n\nLooking at the string, for example, the token 't0' occurs early on. Looking at the productions, does any non-terminal produce 't0'? Yes: NT39 \u2192 't0'. So that's acceptable.\n\nAnother point: in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals (A\u2192BC) or a terminal (A\u2192a). So to generate a string of terminals, we need to have a derivation that eventually eliminates all non-terminals through these productions. So perhaps we can start from the string and try to parse it.\n\nWait, maybe try to walk through the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t3, t4, t3, t5, t0, t2, t3, t3, t3, t3, t5, t2, t5, t5, t2, t5, t3, t3, t4, t3, t3, t3, t3, t2, t1, t1, t5, t2, t4, t3, t1, t3.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how the starting symbol S expands.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. I notice that most of the rules are two non-terminals, and some terminals are present on the right side of the rules. \n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: `t3 t3 t3 t0 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t1 t2 t2 t3 t4 t1 t5 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t0 t4 t5 t5 t3 t1 t2 t2 t5 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t3 t3 t4 t5 t3 t3 t5 t5 t3`. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two other symbols. The initial step would replace S with one of its productions. Looking at the grammar, S can be replaced by either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So the first two symbols of the string must come from NT68 and NT63 or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLet's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n- So, the first symbols would be NT68 \u2192 t3 and NT63 \u2192 t3, which matches the start of the string: t3 t3.\n\nSecond possibility: S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n- NT64 might produce t3, and NT78 might produce t3. So again, the first two symbols are t3 t3.\n\nEither way, the string starts correctly. Now, let's track how each symbol is derived.\n\nI'll try to process the string step by step, using the relevant productions.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT68 NT63. So NT68 \u2192 t3 and NT63 \u2192 t3. So the first two symbols are t3 t3. \n\nNow, for NT68 (t3), maybe it's a terminal, so we can check if NT68's productions include t3. Looking at the grammar, I see NT75 \u2192 't3', but NT68's productions:\n\nNT68: \nLooking through the rules, none directly. Wait, maybe through production NT66 \u2192 NT68 NT18 but NT68 itself doesn't have a production. Hmm, perhaps NT68 is a terminal. But in the grammar, NT68 is on the left side of some rules, but only as part of NT75, which is a non-terminal. Wait, I might be missing something.\n\nWait, the grammar as given has rules like NT68 \u2192 't3', but looking through the list provided, I don't see that. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, in the list of productions, I can see:\n\nNT68 might be defined in some way. Wait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n- NT66 \u2192 NT60 NT69\n- NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT18 (Wait, no, looking back, I don't see NT68 having a production except as part of other non-terminals. Hmm, maybe NT68 is a terminal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps NT68 is a non-terminal that eventually produces 't3'.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\n- NT68 is not a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal. The only place where NT68 appears on the right is in NT75's production: NT75 \u2192 NT18 NT65. So maybe NT68 is a terminal, but in the string we have 't3' at the beginning, which might correspond to a non-terminal that eventually produces 't3'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the entire derivation tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider that the string is a sequence of terminals. Each terminal in the string must come from a production rule where that non-terminal is directly transformed into that terminal.\n\nSo let's try to parse the string step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nStart with S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, NT68 and NT63 are non-terminals that each need to derive to their respective terminal symbols.\n\nLooking for NT68 \u2192 t3. Checking the grammar rules for NT68: I don't see any rule where NT68 directly produces a terminal. All rules for NT68 seem to be producing other non-terminals or a combination. For example, NT68 is on the right side of NT75's production: NT75 \u2192 NT18 NT65.\n\nSo maybe NT68 is a non-terminal that must be further expanded. But without a direct rule to a terminal, unless through some chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a rule for NT68. Let me recheck the grammar list carefully.\n\nGoing through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT68: I don't see a rule where NT68 directly produces anything except as part of other non-terminals, like NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65, which doesn't help.\n\nHmm, maybe NT68 is a terminal that directly results from a production. Let's double-check the string. The first symbol is t3, which is 't3'. So NT68 must be a non-terminal that produces 't3' somewhere. But looking through the productions, I don't see any rule where NT68 \u2192 't3'. So maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT64 NT78 is the correct first step. Let's try that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNow, NT64 and NT78 need to produce 't3' each.\n\nLooking for NT64: Do we have a production that leads to 't3'? It seems NT64 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Let me check the rules for NT64.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14.\n\nNow, NT60 is a non-terminal. So NT64 leads to NT60 (which might produce 't5') and NT14 (which might produce 't98' or so). This could get complex quickly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT68 NT63 is better, but then without a direct t3, it's hard to start.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try to see if any NT can directly produce 't3'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT75 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT62 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't3'? Wait, no, in the given rules, I don't see a production where NT37 is a terminal. Instead, NT33 might produce t3, as NT33 is a non-terminal that goes to NT26 (t6) and NT34 (t9?), so perhaps that's not it.\n\nWait, another thought: The grammar seems to have many NTs that eventually derive to terminals, perhaps with 't's. But without a rule where an NT directly maps to 't3', it's challenging.\n\nWait, maybe 't3' is a terminal that is produced by some NT. Let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar rules, NT62 \u2192 't2' and NT66 \u2192 't3', right? Let me check: Yes, in the initial list, NT66 \u2192 NT60 NT9. But then NT9 has a rule: NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT77. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's see if 't3' can be part of the derivation. For example, S can produce NT68 NT63. If NT68 \u2192 't3' and NT63 \u2192 't3', then the first two symbols would be t3 t3, which matches the string.\n\nBut in the grammar, I don't see a direct rule for NT68 \u2192 't3'. Hmm, perhaps that's an issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol is expanded differently. Let me consider another possibility: S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nIf NT64 \u2192 't3' and NT78 \u2192 't3', then the first two symbols are t3 t3, which matches. But do any rules for NT64 or NT78 directly produce 't3'?\n\nLooking at NT64's production: NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14.\n\nLooking at NT60: NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT18.\n\nLooking at NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT38.\n\nNT50's production: NT50 \u2192 NT58 NT65.\n\nNT65's production: NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is great because each production is either a single symbol or two symbols. I'm a bit new to this, so let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S and produces NT68 NT63 and another NT64 NT78. So, the string must expand from S. Each of these symbols (NT68, NT63, etc.) are production rules, and their right-hand sides are other symbols until they reach terminal symbols 't0', 't1', up to 't34', and some are variables.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5 t3 t3 t3... and ends with t4 t5 t3... The string is pretty long, 48 tokens, so I have to check if each production leads to the correct terminals.\n\nI know that in Chomsky Normal Form, each step replaces non-terminals with two non-terminals, so the derivation builds up the string from top-down. Since the grammar is CNF, the length of the string should be 2^n where n is the number of steps, but the string has a length not matching 2^n, which might make it invalid from the start, but perhaps I should verify that.\n\nWait, the string's length is 48. Let's see: the initial production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63, which is two symbols. Then each symbol can be replaced by two, so the next step would have four, then eight, 16, 32, 64. So 64 would be too long, 32 is possible. But the string is 48, which doesn't fit into 2^n, so maybe it's invalid. But wait, maybe the string is a mix of different derivations. Alternatively, perhaps the string was constructed using multiple variables at different levels.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the grammar uses different levels. Let's see: for example, NT68 could produce t3 or something else. Similarly, other NTs produce either terminals or other NTs. So the string is a sequence of terminals, so each non-terminal must eventually derive into one of the terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal leads to one or two terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3 or something that leads to a terminal. So each symbol in the string must correspond to the terminal production.\n\nWait, to better approach this, perhaps I can try to parse the string backward using the grammar, checking if each terminal corresponds correctly.\n\nLet me take the last symbol: t3. Which NT produces t3? Looking through the productions:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78, and then NT1 goes to t3, which is correct. So NT34 can produce t3.\n\nSo the last symbol is t3, which comes from NT34. Now, before that, the symbol is t5. Let's see: which NT can produce t5? Looking through the terminals:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t5, so NT18 can produce t5.\n\nSo the last two symbols are t5 t3, which would come from NT18 producing t5, and NT34 producing t3. But in the grammar, NT18 has the production NT58 \u2192 t5 and also NT58 is used in other places. Wait, no, earlier I saw that NT18 is derived from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up. Let me check which NT can produce t5:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t5, so yes, NT18 can produce t5. But in the string, the last symbols are t5 and t3. So those two must come from a production where the left-hand side is some NT that produces t5 and t3.\n\nLooking at the productions, which NTs produce two terminals? For example, does any NT produce t5 and t3 directly? Wait, the productions are all to non-terminals except for the ones that lead to terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again:\n\nLooking for NT -> t5 t3. Are there any productions where a non-terminal is replaced by t5 and t3? No, because all the non-terminals either produce a terminal or two non-terminals. So to get t5 followed by t3, that would have to come from two separate non-terminals: one that produces t5 and another that produces t3.\n\nBut in the string, each symbol is placed sequentially, so perhaps the last two tokens are from two NTs.\n\nSo, ending with t5 t3 would mean the last step in the derivation is S \u2192 NT18 NT34 because NT18 \u2192 t5 and NT34 \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol and production is S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the initial derivation starts with either NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. So the string must start expanding from those. Let me see what NT68 and NT63 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT66 NT65, right?\n\nSo NT68 is replaced by NT66 and NT65. Now, NT66 \u2192 t3, and NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62, which is a two-step.\n\nNT97 \u2192 t5, and NT62 \u2192 NT39 NT81, each leading to:\n\nNT39 \u2192 t0, NT81 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo combining, NT65 \u2192 t5 and t3.\n\nWait, so NT65 \u2192 t5 t3. So the initial production is NT68 \u2192 t3 (from NT66) and NT65 \u2192 t5 t3.\n\nThus, S \u2192 NT68 NT63 becomes NT66 NT55 after first step.\n\nWait, let me correct that:\n\nWait, NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT65. So the first expansion would be NT66 followed by NT65.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT66 \u2192 NT97 NT97, wait no:\n\nLooking back, NT97 \u2192 't5' is one of the rules, but also NT97 \u2192 NT18 NT74. So, NT97 can produce either t5 or two symbols.\n\nWait this is getting complicated. Let me try to parse the string from the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps going symbol by symbol to see if each can be matched by the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nBut given the length of the string, 48 symbols, it's a bit time-consuming, but let's try.\n\nFirst symbol is t5. Which non-terminal can produce t5? Many NTs: NT34, NT18, NT26, NT55, NT58, etc. Let's see which are the immediate parents.\n\nLooking for a two-symbol production that starts with t5.\n\nWait, no, because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a single symbol or two symbols. So t5 is a terminal, so to get t5 as the first symbol, it must come from a non-terminal that can produce t5. Let's see which NTs have t5 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78, NT18 \u2192 t5, NT26 \u2192 t2 t1? No, let's check each rule:\n\n- NT34 -> NT1 NT78: not a terminal, so it's internal.\n\n- NT18 -> t5: so NT18 can produce t5.\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9: both are NTs, so not a terminal.\n\n- NT72 \u2192 t3 NT15: not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check each NT to see if they have a terminal as a production.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t5 directly.\n\nNT26 \u2192 t1 NT1? Or was it NT26? Wait, checking the initial rules:\n\nLooking at the detailed productions, under NT26: it has two productions: NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9 and another NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17. So both are non-terminals, thus producing two NTs. So the initial NT26 doesn't produce a terminal; it only produces combinations of NTs, except for another rule? Wait, no, because all the initial rules are either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for NTs that have at least one terminal in their RHS.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t1 NT1? Or is that separate?\n\nWait, no, for NT26, looking at the initial list: NT26 \u2192 NT60 NT9 and NT26 \u2192 NT32 NT17, so NT26 doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT1 t1? Checking: 't1' is under NT24: NT24 \u2192 t1.\n\nWait, looking through all the NT's:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t5\n\nNT34 \u2192 t1? No, NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT78.\n\nWait, sorry, not all NTs produce t's. Only some NTs produce a terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-915","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I have this set of production rules that define the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that each production rule be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that the start symbol can also produce a single terminal. Oh wait, no, actually, in some definitions, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So I need to check the grammar to see if it follows this structure. Looking at the given rules, each production seems to be of the form Nonterminal \u2192 two Nonterminals except for some where a terminal is produced, like NT75 \u2192 't0'. So yes, it fits CNF as some non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't3 t4 t5 ...'. Each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers indicate the specific terminal token. So the string is a series of terminal symbols from the grammar.\n\nI remember that to check if a string is generated by a grammar, especially in CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm. CYK stands for Cocke-Younger-Kasami, and it's a dynamic programming algorithm used to parse strings in context-free grammars. The algorithm works by constructing a table where each cell represents whether a certain production rule can derive a substring of the input.\n\nBut wait, given that the grammar has 47 nonterminals and a lot of production rules, the CYK table might get quite large. However, the string provided is 75 tokens long. Maybe I can try a more manual approach, building the grammar up step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use recursive decimation, breaking down the string into parts that match the rules in the grammar. Each rule has two nonterminals on the left, and I can try to find pairs of nonterminals that can produce the sequence of tokens.\n\nLet me start by looking for the longest possible matches. The entire string is 75 tokens, which is a lot, so maybe I can look for the start symbol S and see if it can produce the entire string. S has two productions: NT68 NT63 and NT64 NT78. So the string must start with either NT68 and NT63 producing the first two tokens, or NT64 and NT78. \n\nLooking at the string: first token is 't3', so I need to see if either NT68 or NT64 can generate 't3'. Let me look at the productions for NT68 and NT64.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT68 produces nt63 (Wait, no, let me check: The rules are in terms of NT68 \u2192 NT63, but wait, looking more carefully, NT68's productions aren't listed directly here. Wait, no, the first few rules show S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. Then subsequent rules like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0, and so on. \n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the notation. The productions are written as S -> NT68 NT63, which I think means S can be replaced by NT68 followed by NT63. Each NT is a nonterminal, so I should look at each NT's productions.\n\nWait, that's the key. Each NT (like NT68, NT62, etc.) is a nonterminal that can produce certain sequences of other nonterminals or terminals. So the first step is to build a list of all nonterminals and their possible productions.\n\nLet me list all nonterminals first. From the given grammar, the nonterminals seem to be:\n\nNT62, NT48, NT0, NT68, NT78, NT38, NT12, NT44, NT47, NT19, NT65, NT23, NT74, NT34, NT13, NT60, NT96, NT52, NT78, NT22, NT74, NT33, NT18, NT98, NT90, NT88, NT62, NT65, NT99, NT85, NT18, NT81, NT97, NT33, NT94, NT19, NT14, NT69, NT9, NT45, NT26, NT72, NT52, NT26, NT18, NT98, NT39, NT93, NT63, NT75, NT69, NT38, NT81, NT26, NT77, NT99, NT20, NT74, NT9, NT8, NT2, NT48, NT75, NT45, NT1, NT24, NT55, NT84, NT97, NT13, NT60, NT96, NT39, NT44, NT3, NT23, NT9, NT85, NT45, NT1, NT24, NT55, NT84, NT97, NT13, NT60, NT96, NT39, NT44, NT3, NT23, NT9, NT85, NT45, NT1, NT24, NT55, NT84, NT97, NT13, NT60, NT96, NT39, NT44, NT3, NT23, NT1.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nLet me write down the tokens of the given string:\n\nt3, t4, t5, t3, t5, t5, t5, t1, t3, t3, t5, t4, t1, t3, t3, t5, t3, t3, t0, t3, t1, t2, t5, t3, t1, t5, t3, t4, t5, t1, t1, t3, t3, t3, t3, t2, t3, t1, t5, t3, t4, t1, t5, t4, t5, t5, t3, t3, t3.\n\nThat's 75 tokens. The first step is to see if the top-level symbol S can generate the entire string. S has two productions: S \u2192 NT68 NT63 and S \u2192 NT64 NT78. So the first two nonterminals in the string would have to come from NT68 and NT63, or NT64 and NT78.\n\nLooking at the first token, t3. So I need to see if either NT68 or NT64 can produce t3 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nWait, NT68's productions aren't listed here. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the initial rules given, S is defined as S -> NT68 NT63 and S -> NT64 NT78. So the immediate next step for the start symbol is two nonterminals. Each of these nonterminals can generate a sequence of nonterminals and terminals.\n\nBut looking at the first few rules, the NT2's production is NT85 NT20, and NT85 is defined to produce 't2'. So perhaps NT85 -> 't2'. Similarly, other NTs may produce specific terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build a list of all NTs that produce a single terminal. From the given rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that directly produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 't0'\n- NT68 \u2192 t3? Wait, no, checking: NT68's rules aren't directly shown, but from another rule, I see NT68 \u2192 't3' because the production NT33 \u2192 NT13 NT94, and NT94 \u2192 't1'. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me look for terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 't0'\n- NT38 \u2192 't3'\n- NT68 \u2192 wait, no, NT0's rule is NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. So no. Let's check each rule:\n\nFrom the given rules, for example:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't3', yes. NT38's production rule is given as: NT38 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT99 \u2192 't5'\n- NT33 \u2192 't0'\n- NT44 \u2192 't5'\n- NT12 \u2192 't5'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT18 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't1'\n- NT94 \u2192 't2'\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I think I'll approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT68 NT63 or NT64 NT78. Those are the first two options. Since the string starts with t3, I need to find which production could lead to t3. Let me check NT68 in the rules. NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT65. Then NT66 \u2192 NT45 NT89, and NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62. Wait, but in the given rules, NT65 is directly producing t5 via NT97 and NT62. Wait, no, looking back: NT65 is 't5', right? Let me check the provided rules.\n\nYes, under NT65, the production is 't5'. So NT65 is a terminal, right. So when you have S \u2192 NT68 NT63, NT68 leads to NT66 NT65. NT66 is another non-terminal leading to NT45 NT89, and NT65 is 't5'. But our string starts with t3, so maybe S shouldn't produce the first option? Alternatively, maybe we took a different path.\n\nWait, maybe S uses the second option, NT64 NT78. Let's see, NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14. NT60 is 't5', and NT14 is 't2' because in the rules, NT14 is assigned 't2'. But the first element of the string is t3, so that also doesn't match. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the initial productions again.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the string using the reverse approach, seeing where the terminals come from. Alternatively, think about the possible sequences that can lead to this.\n\nWait, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would help. But since this is a single string, I might not have to write the entire table, but it might take some time.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be represented as a series of productions. Let me consider the start symbol S.\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63 or S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nEach of these options could lead to sequences in the string. Since the string starts with t3, I need to find a production that leads to t3 somewhere.\n\nWait, looking deeper into the rules, I see several non-terminals that produce terminals. Let's list them:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 t5\n- NT78 \u2192 t3? Wait, no. Looking back, NT78 \u2192 NT74 NT37? Wait, no, looking back, the rules have:\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules:\n\nI see:\nNT90: no, that's 't2', but let's list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals (t) are assigned specific values. Let me list them:\n\nNT65 \u2192 t5\nNT26 \u2192 t2\nNT48 \u2192 t3\nNT38 \u2192 t3\nNT47 \u2192 t5 (there's multiple rules for NT47 leading to t5 in some cases)\nNT99 \u2192 t5\nNT97 \u2192 t3 (I think; in one rule, NT97 is produced from NT1 and NT52, then NT52 from others, but in the rules provided, NT97 is part of the NT list. Wait, perhaps more accurately, some rules have terminals like:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT65 \u2192 t5\nNT26 \u2192 t2\nNT77 \u2192 t3\nNT24 \u2192 t1\nNT48 \u2192 t3\nNT75 \u2192 't3'\nNT1 \u2192 t3\nNT2 \u2192 t3 (I think, as some production ends with 't3')\nLet me check:\n\nNT65 \u2192 t5\nNT9 \u2192 t5\nNT0 \u2192 t4\nNT23 \u2192 t2 (since in rules I see NT23 \u2192 NT18 NT94, but in the provided rules, NT22 is t2, etc.)\nWait, perhaps it's better to map all the terminal strings to their corresponding terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules, each terminal (t0 to t9) is assigned a specific t.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t4\nNT2 \u2192 t3\nNT4 \u2192 t4?\nWait, no, in the provided rules, for NT2, I see \"NT2 \u2192 NT67 NT20\", but also NT2 appears in other places. Wait, no, looking through each:\n\nI think the best approach is to create a mapping of all the terminals in the rules.\n\nLet me list each rule that ends with a terminal:\n\n- S \u2192 NT68 NT63: both non-terminals, so no terminal.\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT78: both non-terminals.\n- NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0: ends with NT0, which is 't4'.\n- NT68 \u2192 NT66 NT65: ends with NT65 which is t5.\n- NT63 \u2192 NT84 NT62: ends with NT84 (which is a non-terminal leading to 't3') or NT62 (ends with t4).\n- NT64 \u2192 NT60 NT14: ends with NT14, which is t2.\n- NT78 \u2192 NT74 NT38: ends with NT38, which in some rules produce t3, but in others produce terminals. Hmm.\nWait, NT38 is present in multiple rules, including ones that produce t3 and others that produce terminals like NT99. Let me see: looking through all the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT99 NT81 (both non-terminals)\nNT38 \u2192 NT12 NT44 (both nt)\nNT38 \u2192 NT1 NT66 (nt ends with t3)\nNT38 \u2192 t3. There it is! So NT38 can be t3.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking back:\n\nYes, in the rules, NT38 is produced as t3 once. So NT38 \u2192 t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT47 is in several rules including some that produce t5. So NT47 \u2192 t5 in some cases.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t3, so perhaps at some point we need to produce a t3.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nThe string begins with t3, so perhaps we can have a production that ends with t3. Let's see where t3 is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, the non-terminals that produce t3 are:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t3\n- NT47 \u2192 t5 (in case any; but looking for t3)\nWait, other non-terminals:\n\nWait, in the given rules, for NT81: in one rule, NT81 \u2192 NT78 NT97. Then NT97 is 't3'.\n\nSo NT81 \u2192 NT78 (maybe t3) and NT97 \u2192 t3. So NT81 can produce 't3 t3', which is t3 t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT81 is another option for t3.\n\nWait, but perhaps more accurately, perhaps I should build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build the possible sequences.\n\nWait, but given the complexity, maybe it's better to attempt a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me try:\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S can split into NT68 and NT63. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, NT68 can split into NT66 NT65. NT66 is a non-terminal and needs to be split.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT45 NT81. NT45 \u2192 NT89 NT38. NT89 is a non-terminal and would split into something.\n\nNT89 \u2192 NT44 NT47.

{"custom_id":"request-936","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar consists of several production rules, mainly starting with S and NT62 and ending with various terminating symbols like 't0', 't1', etc. \n\nThe string given is quite long, consisting of a series of these 't' tokens. Let me write it down to visualize it better: \n\n`t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t3 t4 t5 t1 t3 t4 t2 t2 t1 t3 t5 t5 t2 t4 t4 t3 t3 t4 t1 t3 t3 t0 t4 t4 t3 t3 t2 t4 t1 t3 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t3 t4 t1 t4 t0`.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure. Each rule on the left side starts with 'NT' followed by two other parts (like NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0), and some produce terminals directly (e.g., NT2 \u2192 't3').\n\nTo analyze the string, I can approach this as a parsing problem. Starting from the initial symbol S, the derivation should produce this string by expanding S according to the grammar until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, matching the given sequence.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm for parsing. However, the string is quite long, so doing it manually would be time-consuming. Another approach is to break down the grammar's structure and see how the terminals can be generated in the correct order.\n\nLet's look at the production rules for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n2. S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nSo, the start symbol S expands into two parts. Each of these parts must, in some way, generate the beginning of the string. Let's see the first option: NT68 \u2192 NT74 NT97. Then, NT97 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't3 t4 t3...'. So, if I look at the first part, NT68 is being replaced by NT74 NT97, and NT97 is a terminal 't5'. That would contribute 't5', but the string starts with 't3'. So perhaps the other production of S might be better.\n\nLet me check the alternative S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64 has a production: NT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65. NT96 \u2192 't5', NT65 is a bit complex. Looking at NT65: NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT65. Wait, that looks like a recursive production because NT65 appears on both sides. That must be a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62\n\nAh, I see. I misread. So NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62, not NT97 NT65. That's different. So that helps.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nNT64: NT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65. NT96 \u2192 't5', NT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62. NT97 \u2192 't5', NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0. NT48 is a terminal 't1', and NT0 \u2192 NT48 NT47. NT48 is 't1', NT47 can expand into several things.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to track this step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nExpand NT64:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65.\n\nNT96 \u2192 't5' (terminal), so first symbol is 't5'. But the string starts with 't3', so this path doesn't seem to match. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the string is built in the order of the rules. Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is correct, but I have to go deeper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with S \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nLet me check NT68. NT68's productions: NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18. So, it's a recursive production. This would require multiple steps until it terminates.\n\nWait, that's problematic because it's a left recursion, but in CNF, left recursion is not allowed. Therefore, I must have made a mistake because the original grammar is in CNF. Wait, no, looking back at the rules, NT68 has a production NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18, which is a left recursion, which is not allowed in CNF. Therefore, perhaps the grammar needs to be left-factored. Alternatively, maybe the initial input is correct, so I need to reconcile.\n\nWait, perhaps I was too hasty. The user provided a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, but according to my examination, some productions have left recursion, which I thought was not part of CNF. Let me re-examine each rule carefully.\n\nLooking through the rule list:\n\n- For NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT0 (both non-terminals), and NT48 and NT0 have their own rules. NT48 is a terminal 't1', and NT0 is NT48 NT47.\n\nSo, NT62 doesn't have any left recursion. Similarly, NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65, which is non-terminals, no left recursion. Wait, NT96 is a terminal 't5', NT65 is a non-terminal. So NT64's expansion is fine.\n\nWait, I thought earlier that NT65 is a problematic production:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT97 NT62.\n\nHmmm, NT62 is NT48 NT0, which is fine. So, perhaps my earlier thought that NT65's production is recursive was incorrect. It's not; instead, NT65 leads to NT97 and NT62.\n\nWait, another point: Some NT rules produce terminals directly. So, for example, NT38 can go to 't3' or 't5'. Similarly, NT81 can go to 't3' or 't4'.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string can be built by following a certain sequence of these terminal expansions.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step using a top-down approach.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t3 t4 t5 t1 t3 t4 t2 t2 t1 t3 t5 t5 t2 t4 t4 t3 t3 t4 t1 t3 t3 t0 t4 t4 t3 t3 t2 t4 t1 t3 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t3 t4 t1 t4 t0.\n\nWait, but that's a long string. Let's see if the start symbol S can generate this.\n\nLooking at S's options:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT68 NT63\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT64 NT78\n\nWe need to see which option could lead to the string starting with 't3'.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT64 NT78.\n\nThen, NT64 \u2192 NT96 NT65.\n\n- NT96 is a terminal 't5'. So the first part is 't5', but the string starts with 't3'. So this path is not viable.\n\nAlternative, perhaps considering that NT78 is the other part.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT64 NT78, which we tried first. Since that leads to 't5' as the first symbol but the string starts with 't3', perhaps the alternative S \u2192 NT68 NT63 is the right path.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nS \u2192 NT68 NT63.\n\nNow, NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18. So, that's left recursion. In CNF, we have to have productions without left recursion, so perhaps we need to process this as a loop, but that complicates the manual parsing.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar,NT68 has a production NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18, which is a left recursion. However, CNF does not allow left recursion because it leads to infinite loops without ever reaching a terminal. Therefore, perhaps this grammar was not correctly provided or is incorrect because it includes left recursion. But the user stated that it's in CNF, which usually requires no left recursion. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial examination of the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rule. Let me check NT68 again.\n\nLooking through the initial rules, NT68 is defined as:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT68 NT18\n- NT68 \u2192 NT61 NT8\n\nSo, NT68 has two productions: one that's left-recursive and another that leads to NT61 and NT18.
