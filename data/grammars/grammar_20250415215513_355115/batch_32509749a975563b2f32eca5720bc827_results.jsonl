{"custom_id":"request-2","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string `t8` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) defines productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. So all the productions here should fit that structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S. The productions are as follows:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- Then there are multiple productions for NT54: 't19', 't2', 't46', 't2', 't39', 't21', 't10', 't11', 't35', 't13', 't35', 't48'\u2014wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, looking again, the grammar has multiple productions for some non-terminals. For example, NT54 has several options: 't19', 't2', etc.\n\nWait no, that can't be. In CNF, each production should be either two non-terminals or one terminal. So a non-terminal can have multiple productions, each defining a possible replacement.\n\nBut in this case, for NT54, we have multiple options: 't19', 't2', 't46', etc. So when NT54 appears in the RHS of another production, we can choose which replacement to take.\n\nOur goal is to see if starting from S, we can derive the string `t8`.\n\nLet's start by looking at the productions for S: S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So S can only generate strings that are combinations of NT71 and NT73. Each of these is another non-terminal, so we need to expand them.\n\nNT71 is not present again, so looking at the productions, perhaps I misread. Wait, NT71 is part of the expansion for S, but I don't see any productions for NT71 beyond its occurrence in S. Let me check the given productions again.\n\nLooking back, the productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, and so on.\n\nWait, so looking at NT71, it's only present in S, but there's no production for NT71. Hmm, that means S's only production is to two non-terminals, which don't further produce any terminals except through other chains.\n\nWait, but NT73 is part of S's expansion. Let's think about NT73: it goes to NT63 and NT42. Similarly, all other non-terminals lead further down the chain until we hit a terminal symbol.\n\nOur string is `t8`, which is a single terminal. So we need to see if any non-terminal can directly produce `t8`. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'. So that's an option. So if any non-terminals can derive into NT87, then they can produce `t8`.\n\nNow, let's work backwards. We need to find a way for a non-terminal to eventually produce `t8`. The only non-terminal that directly does that is NT87. So for a string to be `t8`, it needs to come from NT87.\n\nSo, for NT87 \u2192 't8', so in the derivation, somewhere, we must have NT87 producing `t8`.\n\nNow, let's see where NT87 appears. In the first given production, NT87 \u2192 't8' is defined. But looking at the grammar, is NT87 produced by any other non-terminal? Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through NT87's productions, it only appears as:\n\nNT87 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo it's a terminal. Therefore, the only way to get `t8` is through NT87 \u2192 't8'.\n\nSo now, to get `t8` in the string, the earlier non-terminals must produce NT87.\n\nSo, let's see from S, we need to go through NT71 and NT73 to reach NT87.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So NT71 and NT73 must derive into some strings that, when combined, produce `t8`. But that's only possible if NT71 \u2192 \u03b1 and NT73 \u2192 \u03b2, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 concatenate to form `t8`.\n\nSo, let's explore what NT71 and NT73 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT71's productions, wait, in the given grammar, there's no production for NT71 except when it's part of S. So NT71 does not have any further productions. That's a problem because that means NT71 cannot produce any terminals except perhaps through some other chain, but given the grammar, NT71 only appears once, so it's a terminal itself? No, because in the Chomsky normal form, each production must have non-terminals on the RHS. Since NT71 only occurs in S, but has no further productions, that might mean it's a terminal symbol. Wait, but in the normal form, a production must have one non-terminal on LHS and either two non-terminals or one terminal on RHS. So if NT71 doesn't have any production, does that mean it's a terminal? Or is it possible that the production is just not present?\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is given with all productions. Let me check: the first production is S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and after that, the NT71 is nowhere else. So that means NT71 cannot be further expanded; it's a terminal. Similarly, NT73 is expanded.\n\nBut if NT71 is a terminal, then the first part of S is a terminal 't71', which is not matching our target string, which is `t8`. So that's a problem. Because then, S \u2192 NT71 NT73 would derive into 't71' followed by some symbols derived from NT73. But 't71' isn't matching `t8`.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Are the non-terminals numbered or letters? No, it's the symbols NT followed by numbers, like NT71, NT73, etc. So NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals. But in the given grammar, NT71 has no productions, meaning it's a terminal. So that would mean that in the only production S \u2192 NT71 NT73, NT71 is 't71' and NT73 is some other non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, and so on.\n\nWait, but then S would be 't71' followed by whatever NT73 produces. So the derived string would start with 't71', but we have `t8` in the string, so unless the first symbol is 't8', this might not be possible.\n\nBut our string is `t8`, which is a single terminal. So for the entire string to be just `t8`, both NT71 and NT73 must somehow derive into `t8`. But wait, S produces NT71 NT73, so the whole string is the concatenation of whatever NT71 produces and NT73 produces. If S is the start symbol, the entire string is two non-terminals concatenated. Unless both of these non-terminals produce a single character each, but then the total string would be two characters, like 'aa', but our target is 't8', a single character.\n\nWait, no, the target is `t8`, which is a single 't' followed by '8'. So let me think: `t8` is two characters, but in this case, the string is shown as `t8`, which could be a single token, but in the grammar, each non-terminal expands into sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express `t8` as a single symbol, but that's unlikely. So maybe `t8` is meant to represent a single terminal symbol composed of 't' and '8' as digits? Or perhaps it's a single symbol 't8'. Well, in the grammar, the production NT87 \u2192 't8' is a single terminal symbol, meaning 't8' is one symbol. So in that case, S would need to produce `t8` as a single symbol.\n\nBut looking at S's production: S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So we have two non-terminals concatenated. So unless both NT71 and NT73 can produce a single symbol, but even then, that would be two symbols. However, our target is just one symbol, `t8`.

I have the grammar rules and the string, so I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol S produces NT71 NT73. So, every derivation starts with NT71 followed by NT73. That means the string should have two parts, each corresponding to NT71 and NT73 respectively.\n\nSo, the string is \"t43 t39\". I think each part corresponds to the expansions of NT71 and NT73. So, the first \"t43\" should come from NT71 and the second \"t39\" from NT73. Now, let's check each part.\n\nStarting with NT71. Looking at the rules, NT71 doesn't have any production in the given grammar. That's a problem because it means NT71 can't be derived into a string of terminals. If NT71 can't be expanded, then the string can't possibly be generated by this grammar. Wait, but did I miss any production for NT71? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only NT71 production I see is in the start symbol: S -> NT71 NT73.

So NT71 can't be further expanded, so whatever follows it in the string must match whatever is in S.\n\nBut our string is \"t43 t39\", so after the start symbol, we have NT71 and NT73. But if NT71 can't be expanded, then the string after S must be whatever it's supposed to be.

No, looking again, rule 13: NT63 -> 't2'\nYes, so NT63 can be 't2' directly.\n\nSame with other NTs.\n\nNow, back to the problem. The string is \"t43 t39\". Let's break it down into two parts: \"t43\" and \"t39\".\n\nLooking at the productions, \"t43\" could come from NT42, because NT42's production leads to \"t46\" (rule 9), but also, looking at rule 20: NT42 -> 't36'?

If NT54 can be 't19' or 't2', and NT4 can be 't22' (rule 11). So NT27 could produce 't19' 't22' or 't2' 't22'.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 is NT63 NT42. NT63 can produce 't2' (rule 13), so NT73 can produce 't2' followed by whatever NT42 can produce.\n\nSimilarly, NT71 is in the start symbol.\n\nBut let's go step by step for the given string.\n\nThe string is \"t43\" followed by \"t39\".\n\nSo, first part is \"t43\", second part is \"t39\".\n\nLooking for possible NTs that can expand to these.\n\n\"t43\" must come from some NT that can produce 't43', but looking at the productions, I don't see any NT producing 't43'. Let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT42 can produce 't36' and 't46'.\n- NT63 can produce 't2', 't10', 't13'.\n- NT54 produces 't19', 't2', 't21'?

{"custom_id":"request-14","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string `t19 t35` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because each rule on the left (like S->NT71 NT73) is a single symbol, and the right sides are either two symbols or a terminal (like NT87 -> 't8').\n\nThe string to check is `t19 t35`. So, I need to see if this string can be derived by applying the production rules starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level production rules. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S expands into NT71 and NT73. So, S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nNow, each of these NT symbols (NT71 and NT73) must be expanded into terminal symbols or further non-terminals. I'll need to parse the string and see if each component can be matched by the possible expanders.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, it's `t19`. Looking at the grammar, NT87 produces `t8`, and NT54 can produce `t19`, as well as other options. Similarly, NT54 also can produce `t2`, `t13`, `t10`, etc. So, NT54 can generate `t19`.\n\nThen, looking at the second part of the string, `t35`. In the grammar, I see NT63 -> 't2', 't6', 't10', etc., and NT90 produces `t35`. So, NT90 can directly produce `t35`.\n\nBut wait, how are NT71 and NT73 involved? Let me check the rules again. NT71 and NT73 each seem to expand further. For example, NT73 -> NT63 NT42, but wait, maybe I should see if NT71 and NT73 can produce the necessary parts.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake. The string is `t19 t35`, which suggests that NT71 produces `t19` and NT73 produces `t35`. But looking at the rules for NT71 and NT73:\n\nNT71's rule isn't explicitly given, but wait, in the provided grammar, the only rule using NT71 is S -> NT71 NT73. So, does that mean NT71 has to be broken down further?\n\nWait, no, the rules listed all are on the left with the single non-terminal on the left. So, the rules are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\n...\n\nSo, each of these NT73, NT27, etc., have their own production rules. So, perhaps I need to see if NT71 can be expanded to `t19` and NT73 to `t35`.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, after S -> NT71 NT73, each NT71 and NT73 must themselves be expanded. So, let's look at the rules for NT71 and NT73.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT71 isn't listed as a non-terminal that expands into terminals. Wait, that can't be right because S is a non-terminal and the right-hand side is NT71 and NT73. But in the given grammar, I don't see any rules for NT71 or NT73 beyond what's provided for others. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the provided grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules clearly. Let me write them out:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87 (repeated)\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27 (repeated twice)\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87 (repeated)\n\nNT42 -> ... etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any rules for NT71 or NT73 beyond what's given. So, how are NT71 and NT73 being expanded into terminals?\n\nAh, wait, maybe the terminals are those symbols that end with 't' and a number, like 't19' or 't35'. But in the grammar, these are treated as terminals because the rules for NT71 and NT73 don't expand into anything else except other non-terminals. So, perhaps NT71 and NT73 are each terminals themselves, but that would be unusual because non-terminals are supposed to expand into other symbols.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, they need to expand into other non-terminals or terminals. But in the grammar, NT71 and NT73 are only on the left side of S, so their expansion must be defined somewhere. But looking at the given grammar, I don't see any rules that start with NT71 or NT73 on the left. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me double-check. The grammar provided is:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\n... (more rules)\n\nWait, so the NT71 and NT73 on the right of S aren't being expanded because there are no rules for NT71 or NT73 in the grammar. So, this grammar may be incomplete because S is a non-terminal that doesn't have any production rules, but wait, no, S is the start symbol but its right side is NT71 NT73, which themselves may need to expand.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse it correctly.\n\nIn the given grammar, the start symbol S has a production rule S->NT71 NT73. So, to derive the string, I need to expand NT71 and NT73.\n\nBut in the grammar, what's the definition for NT71 and NT73? Looking again, the rules given are:\n\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT4 -> 't22', 't35', etc.\n- NT21 -> 't39', 't63'\n- NT33 -> 't11', 't48', etc.\n\nWait, I think I see the issue. NT71 and NT73 don't have their own production rules. So, when we expand S, it becomes NT71 NT73, but these NT71 and NT73 don't expand any further. They must be terminals, but in the grammar, perhaps they produce something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Maybe all the non-terminals are defined with right-hand sides that are either two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, NT71 and NT73 are being used in the production of S but aren't defined further, meaning they must produce terminal symbols.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, NT71 and NT73 are only on the left of S, so they need to expand into something. If they aren't defined, that would mean they produce \u03b5 (epsilon), but that's not the case here because the string has two terminals.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals that each expand into 't19' and 't35' respectively. But where are their production rules defined?\n\nWait, I don't see any rules for NT71 or NT73 that expand into 't19' or 't35'. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT42 -> 't36' as one option, and other options involving NT42 like NT42 -> NT36 NT27.\n\nWait, but the user provided grammar has multiple entries for some non-terminals, like NT54 has multiple production rules. But for NT71 and NT73, I don't see any production rules. So, perhaps that's a typo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no, let me parse that correctly.\n\nWait, no. The productions are all of the form NT \u2192 NT1 NT2 or NT \u2192 a (terminal). So when I parse the possible substitutions, I have to consider each step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string \"t19 t19 t10\" using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a good candidate for a top-down parsing approach, but maybe using the CYK algorithm would be more systematic.\n\nAlternatively, I can see each production step by trying to break down the string.\n\nLet me think of the string as three tokens: 't19', 't19', 't10'.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT71 NT73, the entire string must be derivable from NT71 and NT73. So, each part must come from NT71 and NT73.\n\nLet me see what NT71 and NT73 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\nNT71 \u2192 't48' (from the given, I see NT71 \u2192 't48' via the production NT71 \u2192 't48' \u2014 wait, no. Let me check the given rules. Wait, the user provided for NT71: 't48' is one of the terminals. Yes, from NT71 \u2192 't48'.\n\nSo, NT71 can be replaced by the terminal 't48'. So, the first part of S is 't48'.\n\nNow, NT73: S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the second part is NT73. Let's see what NT73 can be.\n\nLooking at NT73's production: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nSo, NT73 will produce two non-terminals: NT63 and NT42.\n\nEach of these, in turn, have their own productions.\n\nLet me track this step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT71 NT73 \u2192 't48' NT73.\n\nNow, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nNT63 has productions:\n- NT63 \u2192 't2' (from the given, yes: NT63 \u2192 't2'), or another alternative? Wait, in the given, I see NT63 -> 't2' and another production? Let me check the given:\n\nThe user provided NT63 with two productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't2' (from the given as two separate productions? Or is it just one? Wait, in the user's grammar:\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nBut wait, no\u2014looking back: \n\nThe provided grammar has:\n\nNT63 -> 't2' [twice?

Also, I see later: \n\nWait, the user provided:\n\n... \nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nSo, my mistake. So, NT63 \u2192 't2' is an option. So, NT63 can be a terminal 't2'. Similarly, NT87 \u2192 't8'.\n\nSo, getting back: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So, in order for the entire string to be \"t19 t19 t10\", I need these to generate the tokens properly.\n\nBut the given string is 't19 t19 t10'.

So, how can S produce S \u2192 NT71 NT73 \u2192 't19' NT73? Because S starts with 't48', but the string starts with 't19'\u2014unless NT73 starts with 't19' somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express:\n\nS produces NT71 and NT73. The string starts with 't19', which is 't19 t19 t10', so the first symbol is 't19'. Therefore, either NT71 or NT73 must derive into 't19', but NT71 \u2192 't48' (fixed), so only NT73 can contribute the 't19's. So, the first token 't19' has to come from NT73.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the first token is 't48', but the string starts with 't19'\u2014this seems impossible unless I have the NT71 producing 't19', but looking at NT71, I don't see any production where NT71 can be a terminal. The user provided NT71 \u2192 't48' only once. So, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the user provided for NT71:\n\nWait, looking back, the user's grammar is:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nWait, so the user's grammar is:\n\nNT71 \u2192 't48' [Only one production]\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT71 NT73 \u2192 't48' NT73.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has either a single non-terminal on the left or two non-terminals on the right, except possibly the start symbol. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the provided grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the production rules, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the string generated by S should consist of two parts: whatever NT71 generates and whatever NT73 generates, separated by a space.\n\nLooking at the input string, it's `t22 t2 t19`. But wait, that's three tokens: t22, t2, t19. But the start symbol S produces two NTs, so the string should have exactly two parts. Hmm, that might be a problem because the string has three parts. Unless one of the NTs can produce multiple tokens and maybe another rule somehow leads to an extra token.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol S produces NT71 and NT73, and the string has three terminals. So unless there's a mistake in my understanding, this might already be a problem because S should produce two parts, but the string has three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of the NTs can produce more than one token. Wait, no, because in Chomsky normal form, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So, each step in the derivation would split into non-terminals until they can produce terminals.\n\nLet me see. The string has three terminals: t22, t2, t19. Let's see how that could come from the start symbol. S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so we have two tokens: one from NT71 and one from NT73. But the input string has three tokens, so that seems off. Unless one of these NTs can produce more than one token, but in the given grammar, all the rules on the right side have at most two non-terminals, and each of those non-terminals eventually derive a single terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the string. Let me check: the string is `t22 t2 t19`. So that's three separate terminals. If S produces NT71 NT73, then we'd have two terminals. So the provided string has three, which might not align unless one of the NTs can produce two terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar only allows two non-terminals on the right side of each production. So each step of derivation doubles the number of symbols, but each symbol is either a non-terminal or a terminal. So the string length in terms of symbols should be a power of two times the number of symbols generated from the start symbol, but it might not be directly applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol S generates two symbols, each of which can generate more symbols. So the start symbol would generate, for example, NT71 and NT73, each of which can then generate multiple terminals when the process stops.\n\nBut in this case, the string has three terminals, which doesn't match the expected two from S. That might already mean it's not possible. However, maybe one of the NTs can produce two terminals along the way.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules again. Each production seems to terminate in a single terminal or another production. For example, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, and so on, until the non-terminals are replaced by terminals. So each NT eventually produces exactly one terminal.\n\nWait, so in that case, the string from S should have exactly two terminals: one from NT71 and one from NT73.

{"custom_id":"request-41","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t36 t13 t46 t35\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string structure.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is built using non-terminals that eventually reduce to terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's split into four parts: t36, t13, t46, and t35. Each of these is a terminal symbol, meaning each must be derived directly from a production rule where the non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal. Alternatively, they could be part of a larger non-terminal that breaks down into these terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backward from the string and see if I can reconstruct the parse tree step by step, making sure each step follows the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from the first part, t36. Looking at the grammar, I need to find which non-terminals can produce t36. Scanning through the productions:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT63 \u2192 t2, t10, t13, etc.\n\nWait, t36 is a terminal, but in the grammar, only some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals. So I need to see if t36 is a terminal or if it's part of a non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking back, I see that t36 is a terminal symbol, so it must appear as a terminal in some production. Let me look for any production that ends with t36. It seems like NT36 \u2192 t90 t33. So NT36 can derive t90 and t33.\n\nSo for the string, starting with t36, that must come from NT36 \u2192 t90 t33, but wait, t36 is a terminal, so it's produced directly by a production where NT36 produces t36. But looking at the productions, I don't see NT36 \u2192 t36. Instead, NT36's production is NT90 NT33. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the productions for the non-terminals are as follows:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n\nSo to get t36, the non-terminal NT36 would have to be derived into something else. So maybe the string t36 t13 t46 t35 would have to be generated through a series of non-terminals that eventually split into these terminals.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nThe grammar is in CNF, so each production either splits into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal. So the only terminals are the ones listed as results of the productions. So, for example, NT87 \u2192 't8', meaning NT87 can produce t8.\n\nSo, the string \"t36 t13 t46 t35\" consists of four terminals. Each of these must be produced by a non-terminal that only has t as a terminal, or through a chain of non-terminals splitting into terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string is \"t36 t13 t46 t35\" with four spaces. Are they separate tokens? So the string is four tokens: 't36', 't13', 't46', 't35'.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production can only split into two non-terminals or a terminal. So for a string of multiple terminals, each must be directly produced by some non-terminal, and those non-terminals must be connected appropriately.\n\nWait, but in the string, 't36' is followed by 't13', 't46', and 't35'. So I need to see if there's a way to break down each terminal into some non-terminals that can combine accordingly.\n\nLet me try to map each terminal to the corresponding non-terminal.\n\n- 't36' must come from somewhere. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminal directly produces 't36'? Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT90 \u2192 't35' (so NT90 can produce t35)\n- NT54 can produce 't19' or 't2' or 't21'\n- NT42 can produce 't46' because NT42 \u2192 't46', according to NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33, so to get t36, you'd need NT36 to derive something else, but NT36 is split into NT90 and NT33, which could then derive 't35' and another terminal.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's approach this as a parsing problem.\n\nThe string is four terminals: t36, t13, t46, t35. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, any production of a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But for a string of four terminals, the parse tree must have a root that splits into two non-terminals, then each of those split further into two, leading to four terminals.\n\nSo, the root S is S \u2192 NT71 NT73 (from the first production). So S must be split into NT71 and NT73.\n\nNow, let's see if S can produce the string \"t36 t13 t46 t35\".\n\nSo, the leftmost derivation would involve NT71 and NT73. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT71: NT71 \u2192 from the productions, it's in NT63 NT10? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT73 is given as NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nWait, looking back, the production for NT71 is not listed in the grammar, so maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no, the initial grammar provided starts with S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so NT71 and NT73 are both non-terminals. But in the grammar provided, there are no further productions for NT71 or NT73. Therefore, NT71 and NT73 must be leaves, producing terminal symbols.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, so NT73 can only produce two non-terminals splitting, which would require both NT63 and NT42 to produce terminals. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT63: NT63 \u2192 t2, t10, t13, t16, t24, t10 etc. There's NT63 \u2192 t13.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 \u2192 t46, so that's an immediate production.\n\nSo, if NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, and then NT63 \u2192 t13, and NT42 \u2192 t46, then NT73 can produce t13 t46.\n\nBut in our string, the first part is t36 t13, so that suggests that the first part after S would be t36 and then t13. But S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so perhaps NT71 produces t36, and NT73 produces t13 t46. But wait, NT73 can only split into two non-terminals, but in this case, we need NT73 to produce three terminals, which isn't possible. Because each split only produces two non-terminals at a time, and terminals can only be leaves.\n\nWait, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t36 t13 t46 t35. Let's try to build a parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the root splits into NT71 and NT73.\n\nNow, NT71 can only produce a terminal, but is that the case? Let me check the grammar again. S is the start symbol, and NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, but there are no productions for NT71 or NT73 in the given grammar. That's strange. Typically, each non-terminal should have a production. So if NT71 and NT73 don't have any productions, they can only produce a single terminal. Therefore, each of them would correspond to a single terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, but they are used in the production S \u2192 NT71 NT73, but there are no further productions for NT71 or NT73. That suggests that NT71 and NT73 must each be single terminals. But then, S would produce two terminals, but our string is four, so something must be wrong.\n\nWait, no. Maybe I made a mistake in the grammar. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nThe grammar is as follows:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t11 t36 t10 t2 t46`. The grammar provided has several rules, each producing a pair of non-terminals and terminals. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It seems each production starts with a capital letter on the left and a pair of symbols on the right. Each rule splits into two parts, which could be either non-terminals or terminals. Since it's a CFG, I can parse the string starting from the top symbol and see if it can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nThe string is `t11 t36 t10 t2 t46`. I'll need to check each token and see if they can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules so I can reference them:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73  \nNT73 -> NT63 NT42  \nNT27 -> NT54 NT4  \nNT42 -> NT36 NT27  \nNT54 -> NT21 NT87  \nNT36 -> NT90 NT33  \nNT87 -> 't8'  \nNT54 -> 't19'  \nNT42 -> 't46'  \nNT54 -> 't2'  \nNT4 -> 't22'  \nNT21 -> 't39'  \nNT63 -> 't2'  \nNT73 -> 't24'  \nNT27 -> 't11'  \nNT33 -> 't11'  \nNT4 -> 't35'  \nNT21 -> 't43'  \nNT33 -> 't48'  \nNT42 -> 't36'  \nNT63 -> 't10'  \nNT27 -> 't20'  \nNT71 -> 't48'  \nNT63 -> 't13'  \nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, I notice that NT87, NT54, NT42, NT4, etc., have multiple productions. For example, NT54 can be 't2', 't35', 't19', 't2' again, etc. So each of these non-terminals can produce different terminal strings depending on the path taken in the derivation.\n\nThe process should involve trying to parse the string from the top down. Let's start with the start symbol S, which is NT71 NT73. So S must generate two parts: NT71 and NT73. The string length is 5, but S is two non-terminals, each of which can expand into a sequence of tokens. Since the string has 5 tokens, each side of S must contribute a certain number of tokens adding up to 5.\n\nLooking at the string: `t11 t36 t10 t2 t46`. Let's split the string into two parts corresponding to NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, S is NT71 followed by NT73. So to generate the string, each NT71 and NT73 must expand into sequences that combine into the string, but in this case, the string is length 5, so maybe each NT71 and NT73 contribute parts of the string.\n\nBut wait, S produces NT71 followed by NT73, so the string should be NT71's expansion followed by NT73's expansion. Hmm, let me check: the string is `t11 t36 t10 t2 t46`, which is 5 tokens. S is NT71 NT73, so if NT71 expands into some tokens and NT73 into others, the total should add up to 5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT71 is defined as which production? Wait, in the given grammar, are there any productions for NT71 except as part of S? Let me check.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as follows:\n\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n- NT27 -> 't11'\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT21 -> 't43'\n- NT33 -> 't48'\n- NT42 -> 't36'\n- NT63 -> 't10'\n- NT27 -> 't20'\n- NT71 -> 't48'\n- NT63 -> 't13'\n- NT90 -> 't35'\n\nSo NT71 only appears in S as the left-hand side, so S is NT71 NT73. So for S to produce the given string, NT71 must expand into some tokens, and NT73 must expand into the remaining tokens, such that together they make the string.\n\nSo let's think about NT71. NT71 can only come from S, as the input. Wait, but in the grammar, is NT71 ever produced on its own? No, in the given grammar, the only rule involving NT71 is as part of S. So NT71 can only be derived as a terminal, but in the grammar, NT71 seems to be a terminal because S -> NT71 NT73 and the only rule is S. Wait, looking again at the grammar, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to think differently. The grammar has these rules. Each non-terminal can produce a pair of non-terminals or terminals. So, for example, NT73 -> NT63 NT42, which breaks down into NT63 and NT42. Each of those can further break down until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, for S, which is NT71 NT73, we can expand each part as follows.\n\nBut in the given grammar, NT71 is only present in the S rule as the left-hand side component. Is NT71 present as a standing alone non-terminal, or is it only from S?

First, I remember the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should help because we can apply the CYK algorithm or just parse step by step.\n\nSo, looking at the string, it has five tokens separated by spaces: t11, t19, t39, t11, t19. Each is a terminal. Our goal is to see if these terminals appear in the leftmost derivation of the string from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, goes to NT71 NT73. So S = NT71 NT73. Both of these are non-terminals, so the first step is to expand these.\n\nLooking at NT71 and NT73, their productions are limited. Let's see:\n\nNT73 can only produce NT63 NT42. So expanding NT73: NT63 NT42.\n\nSimilarly, NT71 is NT48 NT63. NT63 can go to NT2 NT33 or NT90, but looking at the given grammar, NT63 is not directly producing anything else\u2014it's perhaps a leaf except for NT63 itself. Wait, the grammar for NT63 is given as NT2, so maybe I got that wrong. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar for NT63 is: NT63 -> NT2 NT33. Ah, since NT63 is rewritten into two non-terminals. So I need to expand each of these.\n\nLet me outline the process step by step, perhaps building a parse tree.\n\nThe string is t11 t19 t39 t11 t19.\n\nStarting with S = NT71 NT73.\n\nNT71 = NT48 NT63.\n\nNT73 = NT63 NT42.\n\nNow, we can start breaking down each NT into their components.\n\nFirst, let's look for the lexeme 't11' in the grammar. I need to see if NT48 can produce 't11', NT63 can produce 't11', or any other non-terminals that can lead to 't11'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT48 is 't35' as per: NT4 -> 't35' (Wait, wait, let's check NT4.)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT42, NT4, etc., we need to make sure which NTs produce 't11'.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT27 can produce 't11' because NT27 -> 't20', but wait, NT27's productions are: NT27 -> NT54 NT4, and NT27 can also go to other NTs. Wait, no, I need to check all NT27 productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a clearer way: Let's list all NTTs and their terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT54 -> 't19' (Yes) also NT54 -> 't2' and 't2' is in NT21's production. Wait, no: Looking again, the lines:\n\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT42 -> 't46' (Wait, no.

NT90 -> 't35'\n\nNow, compiling all NTTs and their possible terminals:\n\n- NT54 can produce 't19', 't2', and via NT21 (via NT54 -> NT21 NT87 where NT87 is 't8'; so NT54 \u2192 NT21 t8\u2192 thus, NT21 can be 't39' or 't2' etc. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, NT54 can produce 't19' directly. Additionally, NT54 can produce 't21', which is a non-terminal perhaps?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me instead list for each NTT whether any of their productions lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nBut stepping back, perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if we can expand it into the given string.\n\nThe string is t11 t19 t39 t11 t19.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S = NT71 NT73.\n\nSo, NT71 can expand to NT48 NT63, and NT73 expands to NT63 NT42.\n\nSo S expands into NT48 NT63 NT63 NT42.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to try to match the lexemes from the top down.\n\nLooking at the string, the first lexeme is t11. So we need to find a production starting with NT that can generate 't11' at the top of the string.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\n- NT27 can produce 't20' or 't11' (looking through their productions). Wait, NT27 is NT54 NT4. So NT27's productions: NT54 NT4. So if NT54 is 't19' or other, but I'm looking for 't11'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT33: NT33 can produce 't11' (NT33 \u2192 't11'). So NT33 is one way. Also, NT27 \u2192 't20' (but not t11) or via NTTs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see which NTs have 't11' as a terminal:\n\nFrom above, looking for NTT that can directly produce 't11':\n\nLooking through each NTT:\n\nLooking at NT27 -> 't20', so no. Wait, in the list above:\n\nLooking at all NTT productions for terminals:\n\n- NT54 -> 't19', 't2', and via NT21.\n\nWait, more clearly:\n\nLooking through each NTT:\n\n- NT87: 't8' (produces 't8')\n- NT90: 't35' (produces 't35')\n- NT54: 't19', 't2'\n- NT42: 't46', 't36', 't27', 't3', 't63', etc. Wait, let's list each:\n\nSo, let me check each NTT that can produce a 't':\n\n- NT2: any NT that can become 't2' has it as a terminal. Looking through, for example, NT42 can produce 't46', 't36', 't2' (from NT54 -> 't2'), and 't42' via NT42 NT27 etc.\n\nWait, no, NT42's productions are:\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT42 -> NT54 NT4\n\nBut then, 't42' is in the string? No, but actually, wait, looking at the string again: it's t11, t19, t39, t11, t19. So 't42' isn't in the string, so perhaps that's not relevant.\n\nInstead, let's see which NTTs have 't11' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the NTT productions:\n\n- NT33 -> 't11' (line 13)\n- NT54 -> 't2', 't19', 't2' via NT21\nWait, line 24: NT42 -> 't36'\nLine 13: NT33 -> 't11'\n\nSo NT33 is one that can produce 't11'.

I check the grammar and see that the initial productions start from S and NT73, etc. It seems that NT71 doesn't have any further splits beyond what's given. So probably NT71 is a terminal and produces t48. Because looking back, I see a production like NT71 -> 't48'.\n\nWait, looking again, is there a production for NT71? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT71 -> 't48' \n\nYes, that's line 17: NT71 -> 't48'\n\nSo NT71 produces t48.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT73: NT73 is S's right-hand side, so it produces NT63 and NT42.\n\nNT63: I see in the grammar, NT63 -> 't2' (line 15?), or wait, let me list all productions correctly:\n\nWait, wait, I think I need to be careful.

Is that correct? Or is there a typo? Because NT21 being a non-terminal should have multiple productions, but if both are 't' terminals, then NT21 can only produce 't39' or 't43' but not both. That would make it ambiguous, but in practical terms, the parser would choose one or the other.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 has three productions: -> 't19', 't2', 't21 NT87'?\n\nWait, wait, looking again, some NT54 lines are:\n\nNT54 -> 't21 NT87'?

For example, the line for NT54 could be:\n\nNT54 -> 't21 NT87' meaning 't21' followed by NT87, which is 't8'. Alternatively, perhaps some lines in the grammar have a mix of terminals and non-terminals.

Let's start by understanding the grammar structure.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals or non-terminals on the right. CNF is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze the structure of the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The first production is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the string starts with NT71 and ends with NT73. Let's look at what NT71 and NT73 produce.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.

Let's see if the entire string can be constructed from the start symbols S.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t39. Let's look at the productions that can produce t39. Scanning the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t39\n- NT27 \u2192 t20\n- NT63 \u2192 t63 -> t2 [Wait, the production for NT63 is: NT63 \u2192 NT2 and NTsomething? Wait, let me check again.

From the rules: NT63 appears on the right side of NT73's production (NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42) and also as a terminal in NT54 \u2192 't10' and NT63 \u2192 't10' (wait, no, looking back: the grammar rules include NT63 \u2192 't10'? Let me check: yes, under NT63's productions, there is 't10' as an option. Wait, no, actually looking, the rule is `NT63 -> t10`? No, wait no: in the given grammar, the rule NT63 is defined as:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT2, and then there's another production: NT63 \u2192 t10?\n\nWait, no. Let me list the grammar rules properly:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar as follows:\n\n```\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n```\n\nWait, no. Each line represents a production rule for a non-terminal. So, for example, \"NT27 -> NT54 NT4\" is one rule, and \"NT54 -> 't2')\" is another. Wait, no, the way it's written, for each non-terminal, we have multiple productions.\n\nBut wait, the way it's presented, some lines have non-terminals and others have terminals. So, for example, the first line after S is the production for NT73: `NT73 -> NT63 NT42`. Then, for NT27, the production is `NT27 -> NT54 NT4`. Then each subsequent line is another production for the same non-terminal until all productions for that non-terminal are listed.\n\nWait, but the way the user presented it is as separate lines, but it's a bit unclear. Let me try to reconstruct each non-terminal's productions.\n\nFor example, looking at NT54:\n\n- `NT54 -> NT21 NT87`\n- `NT54 -> 't2'`\n- `NT54 -> 't19'`\n- `NT54 -> 't2'` again? Or is it different?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back: the user's grammar list seems to have multiple entries for some non-terminals, but actually, each grammar rule is a separate line for each production of a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted. For instance, in the grammar, after S, the production for NT73 is `NT73 -> NT63 NT42`. Then, NT27's production is `NT27 -> NT54 NT4`. Then, next line is NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, so that's another production for NT42. Then, the next line is NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, which is another production for NT54. The line after that is NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33 (another production for NT36). Then NT87 \u2192 't8' (a terminal production for NT87). Then NT54 \u2192 't19' is another production for NT54. Then NT42 \u2192 't46' (another for NT42), then NT54 \u2192 't2' (another for NT54), and so on.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. So each line is a separate production for a specific non-terminal. But in the grammar, some non-terminals have multiple productions, while others only have terminal ones.\n\nWait, for example, NT73 has one production: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So that's the only production for NT73. Similarly, NT73's expansion is only one step, producing NT63 and NT42. So when S expands, it becomes NT71 NT73, which is a terminal and two non-terminals. But then each of those non-terminals needs to expand further until all symbols are terminals.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe it's easier to work backwards from the target string.\n\nThe string is `t39 t8 t48 t19 t8 t10 t35`.\n\nLooking at this, it's seven symbols long. Let's see how many symbols a valid derivation would produce.\n\nEach step in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either terminals or other non-terminals. So starting with S, which is two non-terminals (NT71 and NT73), each of those would need to be expanded.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions.\n\nLet's list the string in order: t39, t8, t48, t19, t8, t10, t35.\n\nWe can try to match these from the end, using the rightmost non-terminal.\n\nSo starting from the end of the string, which is t35.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t35 is a terminal produced by several non-terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39' (wait, no, t39 is the terminal). Wait, looking back.\n\nWait, the terminals are: t39, t8, t48, t19, t8, t10, t35.\n\nSo t35 is at the end.\n\nWhich non-terminals produce t35?

That\u2019s a match for the first token.\n\nNow, moving to the second token, t20. Let's see where t20 comes from. Checking the rules, I see NT63 -> 't2' and NT63 appears in other places but mostly t2. So maybe NT63 can't produce t20. Alternatively, looking further, is there a non-terminal that can produce t20? \n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't22' which is t22, not t20. NT21 has t39, t43, t20, t43. Oh, wait, NT21 can produce t43, t20, t43, or t20 again. Wait, NT21 has rules: -> 't39', -> 't43', -> 't43', -> 't20'. So NT21 can produce 't20'. So second token could be NT21 -> 't20'.\n\nBut wait, how is NT42 (which is part of the S expansion) connected to the next parts? Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string is \"t46 t20 t8 t43 t8 t20 t22 t36\", which is 8 tokens. Let me list them: t46, t20, t8, t43, t8, t20, t22, t36.\n\nLooking at S, which starts as NT71 NT73. Each of these needs to expand to some sequence of terminals.\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT73 NT42. NT73 is further broken down: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So combining, the expansion from S would be NT73 (which is NT63 NT42) and NT42.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and NT71 \u2192 NT73 NT42, and NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So S would become NT73 NT42 NT73 NT42. Hmm, but that's more complex. Maybe it's easier to see the entire expansion.\n\nWait, let's think step by step:\n\nEach production can be expanded as follows:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\nNT71 \u2192 NT73 NT42\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\nNT63 \u2192 t2?\nWait, checking NT63's rules: NT63 \u2192 t2 (from NT63 \u2192 't2') and also other paths if needed, but in this case, one of the options is 't2', so maybe that's the one to take.\n\nSo S expands to (NT71)(NT73). NT71 \u2192 NT73 NT42, and NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So S becomes (NT73 NT42) (NT63 NT42). Each NT can be further expanded.\n\nSo, S's expansion will be NT73 NT42 NT63 NT42.\n\nWait, but NT73 is NT63 NT42, so that's (NT63 NT42) NT42 NT63 NT42. Hmm, this might get too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the string step by step, trying to match each token from the start.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string according to the grammar. Let's try to find a leftmost derivation or a parse tree.\n\nThe string is \"t46 t20 t8 t43 t8 t20 t22 t36\". Let me see the tokens in order and try to match them.\n\nThe first token is t46. Looking at the grammar, where can t46 come from? It's produced by NT42 \u2192 't46'. So that must come from NT42.\n\nSo the first part of the string is derived from NT42 \u2192 t46. But wait, NT42 is the right-hand side of a production. Wait, no\u2014in the grammar, NT42 can produce t46 directly as one of its rules.\n\nSo in the S expansion, when we have S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and then each of those non-terminals can expand further. Let's see which places can produce these t's.\n\nLooking back, the production rules:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 t46\n- NT21 \u2192 t20 (among others)\n- NT63 \u2192 t2 (one of the options)\n- NT36 \u2192 t90 and t33\n- Wait, let me list all the non-terminals and their productions to see:\n\n1. NT42:\n   - t46\n   - NT36 NT27\n   - NT63 NT42\n2. NT73:\n   - NT63 NT42\n   - t24\n3. NT27:\n   - NT54 NT4\n3. NT54:\n   - t19\n   - t2\n   - t87\n   - t35\n   - t42\n   etc. (Wait, the rule for NT54 is broken into several lines: it has 't21' as a terminal? Wait looking back, the grammar lists:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't21' NT87\nNT54 \u2192 't2' etc.\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me reconstruct the grammar correctly.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing because some NT rules are written as -> 'something NTsomething'. So some rules produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal, and some produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, hold on, rules like NT54 \u2192 't2' suggest that the non-terminal T54 can produce the terminal t2 directly. But in some cases, like NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, it produces a non-terminal followed by another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, the rules are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, I'm pretty sure that in CFGs, each production is either of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So the grammar as written may have some ambiguities, but perhaps it's written correctly as left-recursive or something.\n\nBut some of the rules seem to have NT54 \u2192 't2' which is a single terminal. So for example, in the NT42's rule, there's NT42 \u2192 't36', which is a direct production, right?\n\nLet me list all the direct productions (terminals):\n\nFrom NT54: 't19', 't2', 't87'\nFrom NT21: 't39', 't43', 't20'\nFrom NT4: 't22', 't35'\nFrom NT71: 't48'\nFrom NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-108","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the target string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand into a terminal and another non-terminal, while others expand into two non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT71 and NT73. NT73 then expands into NT63 and NT42, and so on. The string I need to evaluate is `t2 t24 t48 t2 t39 t46 t2 t43`.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, starting from the start symbol S and breaking down the string according to the grammar rules. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if I can derive it following the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t2`. Let me check the productions that can produce `t2`. From the grammar, NT54 can go to 't19' or 't2'. So if NT54 is used, it can produce a 't2'. Also, NT21 can go to 't39' or 't43', and NT4 can go to 't22' or 't35'. Hmm, none of these produce 't2' except NT54 in one of its productions. So perhaps the first 't2' comes from NT54 -> 't2'.\n\nWait, but there are a few possibilities for NT54. Let me list the relevant productions:\n\nNT54 -> 't2' (yes)\nNT54 -> 't19' (but that's not needed here)\nSo, for the first 't2', I can use NT54 -> 't2'.\n\nNext, the string has `t24`. Looking at NT73, its production is NT63 NT42. So if I can get 't24' from NT63 or NT42. NT73 produces two non-terminals, so perhaps after the first 't2', the next part is from NT63 or NT42. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the entire production.\n\nWait, the string is `t2 t24 t48 t2 t39 t46 t2 t43`. Hmm, that's eight elements. Let me see if the parse tree can generate this.\n\nLet me outline the structure step by step.\n\n1. Start with S -> NT71 NT73. So the string must be split into two parts: one generated by NT71 and the other by NT73.\n\nSo the string should be divided into A followed by B, where A is generated by NT71 and B by NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is `t2 t24 t48 t2` and the second part is `t39 t46 t2 t43`. Wait, but I'm not sure where to split. Alternatively, maybe the split is after a certain point. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, the grammar for S is S -> NT71 NT73, so the entire string is the concatenation of what NT71 produces and NT73 produces. So I can split the string into two parts, the first part from NT71 and the second from NT73.\n\nSo I need to see if the first part can be generated by NT71 and the second by NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, the second part is `t39 t46 t2 t43`. Let's see if that can come from NT73. From the grammar, NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So NT63 and NT42 should produce those tokens.\n\nLet's check NT63. From the rules, NT63 -> 't2' and NT63 can also go to NT10, but in this case, the first token is 't39', which is not 't2', so probably NT63 is 't2', but in this case, it's 't39', which is from NT21 (since NT21 -> 't39').\n\nWait, that doesn't fit because NT63 is supposed to expand into what? Wait, let me look again: NT63 -> 't2' (or maybe not; let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT63 appears as:\nNT63 -> 't2' (in one production)\nWait, but in the grammar, NT63 is defined as NT2, which goes to NT90 NT33 and then to 't35'. Wait, no, wait the given grammar is a bit confusing. Let me list all the productions that involve the non-terminals with 'NT' to get a clearer picture.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT21 -> 't43'\n- NT33 -> 't48'\n- NT42 -> 't36'\n- NT63 -> 't10'\n- NT27 -> 't20'\n- NT71 -> 't48'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar. It seems that some non-terminals like NT54, NT42, etc., have multiple productions. For example, NT54 has several rules:\n\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n\nWait, multiple rules for NT54. So, for example, NT54 can expand into 't2' as a terminal or into other non-terminals.\n\nSo, let me re-examine the target string and see how it can be split.\n\nThe string is t2 t24 t48 t2 t39 t46 t2 t43.\n\nSince S produces NT71 and NT73, I can split the string into two parts: A and B, where A is generated by NT71 and B by NT73.\n\nLet me consider the possible splits.\n\nOption 1: Split after the first token, so A = t2, B = t24 t48 t2 t39 t46 t2 t43.\n\nBut A must be generated by NT71, and B by NT73.\n\nWait, but NT71 -> 't48' according to one of its productions: NT71 -> 't48'. So perhaps the first part is just 't48', then the second part is the rest.\n\nSo if A is 't48', which is generated by NT71, then the second part would be t24 t48 t2 t39 t46 t2 t43, which must be generated by NT73.\n\nWait, no, because S is NT71 NT73, so the entire string is A B where A is produced by NT71 and B by NT73. So if A is 't48' (as per NT71 -> 't48'), then B is the rest, which is t24 t48 t2 t39 t46 t2 t43. But that seems longer, and perhaps more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire string as generated by S, which requires that the entire string is A B, with A from NT71 and B from NT73.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, perhaps I should parse the entire string using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is 8 tokens, so maybe the structure is more complex, but let's try to parse step by step.\n\nI think a better approach is to try to parse the string top-down, starting from S. Let's try to see if each part of the string can be matched by the productions.\n\nLooking at S -> NT71 NT73, so the first part must be generated by NT71 and the second by NT73.\n\nSo let me split the string into two parts: A and B, where A is the part from NT71 and B from NT73. But I'm not sure where to split them yet. Let me try possible splits.\n\nOption 1: A is the first token, 't2', and B is the rest.\n\nSo A = 't2', which is generated by NT21 -> 't2' (as per NT21 -> 't39' and 't43', but wait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-118","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complex with multiple non-terminals, and the string I'm checking is `t11 t43 t24 t2 t2 t43 t48 t36 t2`. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this because each rule on the left side (like S, NT73, etc.) is replaced by two other symbols on the right, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to check consists of a sequence of terminals: t11, t43, t24, t2, t2, t43, t48, t36, t2. So the task is to see if this sequence can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying the production rules until only terminals are left.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the first step is to split the string into two parts corresponding to NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t11, t43, t24, t2, t2. That's five tokens. But according to S's production, it's two parts: NT71 and NT73. So each part must correspond to a separate derivation and then be concatenated.\n\nLet me check each part:\n\n1. NT71 should derive to t11 t43 t24 t2 t2.\n2. NT73 should derive to t48 t36 t2.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because the entire string is nine tokens. So NT71 would take some number of tokens, and NT73 would take the remaining. Let me see how the tokens are split here.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT71 is part of S's production. So NT71 can only derive to certain sequences. I need to see how NT71 can produce a sequence that starts with t11, t43, t24, t2, t2.\n\nLooking at the NT71 rules: Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT71 as a non-terminal. Let's check the rules again.\n\nWait, the initial S rule is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So S splits into NT71 and NT73. Then, each of these non-terminals must produce their own sequences.\n\nLooking at NT71, I don't see any production rules for NT71 in the provided grammar. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Then, each NT... has its own production. But in the list, I can see rules for NT73, NT27, NT42, etc. But no NT71 production. That might be an issue because if NT71 doesn't have a production, then S \u2192 NT71 NT73 can't proceed further, meaning it can't generate any terminal strings. But in our string, there are terminals, so this might be a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe the user made a typo and NT71 was supposed to be another rule. Or perhaps it's a rule that leads to terminals. Let me check if there's a rule for NT71. No, looking through the grammar, I don't see any for NT71. So that suggests that S cannot produce any string because S's rule depends on NT71, which doesn't have a production. Therefore, the grammar can't generate the empty string, let alone any other string, including the given one.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me list all the non-terminals and see if any of them might produce the required tokens.\n\nWait, the grammar as given is:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't46'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT73 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't20'\n\nNT71 \u2192 ?\n\nWait a second, I don't see any rule for NT71 except for S \u2192 NT71 NT73, which suggests NT71 is a non-terminal that must produce some sequence of symbols. But in the grammar, there's no production for NT71, which means NT71 cannot derive any terminal string, only non-terminals. Therefore, S \u2192 NT71 NT73 would produce a sequence where both NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, and since NT71 can't be reduced further, this production is incomplete.\n\nThis leads me to think that the given grammar is ill-formed because a non-terminal (NT71) is used in the start rule but doesn't have a production. Therefore, the grammar can't generate any string, including the one provided.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a rule elsewhere. Let me go through all the rules again.\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't46'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT73 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't20'\n\nNT71 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, the '\u2192' rules for each NT should define how they can be replaced. The absence of a rule for NT71 means that NT71 is a non-terminal that cannot derive any terminal string. So S \u2192 NT71 NT73 can't be resolved because NT71 doesn't have any productions, meaning that the entire production S can't be expanded at the top level. This would make the language of the grammar empty, as all strings derivable from S would require NT71 to produce something, but it can't.\n\nTherefore, the given string can't be generated by this grammar because the start symbol S depends on NT71, which has no production.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems all the productions are in CNF except maybe some, but let me check:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73: This fits because it's two non-terminals.\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42: Same, two non-terminals.\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT42: Two non-terminals.\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27: Two non-terminals.\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87: NT54 can produce either NT21 NT87 or 't19' (from the first line). Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has each production as either a pair or a terminal. Wait, actually, looking again: the grammar seems to have some productions where the right-hand side is a single terminal, like NT54 \u2192 't19', right? Because each production has either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nSo, in the given list:\n\nNT54 has two productions: one to 't19' and another to NT21 NT87. Similarly, others have both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t2 t19 t13 t20 t36 t43 t43 t39 t35`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived by the grammar. Since it's CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm, which parses the string by checking all possible ways to decompose it based on the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, let's list all the non-terminals and their possible terminals they can produce:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't19', 't21' and 't87'? Wait, no, let's see each production line:\n\nWait, the grammar is written as S -> NT71 NT73, etc. Each line is a production, so for example, NT54 has four productions:\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nWait, the way it's written, each production is either A \u2192 X Y or A \u2192 a. So, for NT54, let's see:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT54 \u2192 't19' (this is production line 5)\n- NT42 \u2192 't46' (line 9)\n- NT36 \u2192 't90' (line 12) Wait, no, line 12 is NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33, so the terminal case is line 15: NT39 \u2192 't35'?\n\nWait, no, let's map each production correctly:\n\nEach line is a production for the left-hand side (LHS). So for NT54, the productions are:\n\n1. NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 (production line 5)\n2. NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87? Wait no, looking at each line:\n\nLooking again, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT42\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nWait, no, line 5 and 6 for NT54. So NT54 can be 't19' or NT21 NT87. Similarly, NT87 can only produce 't8'.\n\nSo each non-terminal can produce only the right-hand sides given. So for example, NT54 can either be t19 or the concatenation of NT21 and NT87.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 (production line 7: NT21 \u2192 't39'), so NT21 can produce t39.\n\nWait, but NT21 is written in multiple productions. Let me re-express all the productions clearly:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n2. NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n3. NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT42\n4. NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n5. NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n6.

For example, NT42 appears in production 4, 9, and 14.\n\nFrom this, for each non-terminal, we list their possible productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT42\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, NT21 NT87, or 't46'? Wait no, each line is a separate production. So production line 9 is NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, line 14 is NT42 \u2192 't46', and line 14 may be separate. Wait, actually, looking again, it's perhaps better to group by non-terminals:\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their possible right-hand sides:\n\n- S: NT71, NT73 only\n- NT73: NT63, NT42 only\n- NT27: NT54, NT42 only\n- NT42: NT36, NT27; NT21, NT87; 't46'\n- NT54: NT21, NT87; 't19'; NT63, NT87\nWait, line 5 is NT54 \u2192 NT21, NT87\n\nLine 6 is NT36 \u2192 NT90, NT33\n\nLine 7: NT87 \u2192 't8'\n\nLine 8: NT54 \u2192 't19'\n\nWait, so NT54 can \u2192 NT21 NT87, or can it also \u2192 't19'? Because line 5 says NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, and line 8 says NT54 \u2192 't19'. So NT54 has two productions: NT21 NT87, or 't19'.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 has production line 12: NT21 \u2192 't43' [NT21 is actually another non-terminal? Wait, no, it's a typo. Wait, no: line 12 is NT21 \u2192 NT63, NT33, which may be a typo. Wait, line 12 says \"NT21 \u2192 NT63 NT33\". So that's a production for NT21, which would mean NT21 can't produce 't43' on line 14. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait line 14 says NT42 \u2192 't46'? But the left-hand side is NT21. That might not make sense. Wait, perhaps looking over the entire list:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n2.

So, I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t43 t48 t46 t13 t20 t20 t24 t19 t20 t20` is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. If I remember correctly, it means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, yes, it seems to be in CNF because all productions either replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, my task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string consists of a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be formed by expanding the non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, S expands into NT71 and NT73. Therefore, the string derived from S should be a combination of the strings generated by NT71 and NT73, concatenated together.\n\nNext, looking at NT71 and NT73:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nSo both NT71 and NT73 generate the same two non-terminals, NT63 and NT42, in that order. That means when we start, we'll have to produce a string that starts with whatever NT63 produces, followed by NT42's production, then another NT63, and another NT42, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, does each non-terminal in the production contribute their own strings in order? So S \u2192 NT71 NT73 \u2192 (NT63 NT42) (NT63 NT42). So the entire string should be the concatenation of the strings produced by NT63, NT42, NT63, NT42.\n\nSo, step by step, S produces NT71 and NT73, each of which produces NT63 and NT42. Therefore, the order is NT63 NT42 NT63 NT42, which translates to a sequence of terminals from each of these non-terminals in that order.\n\nNow, looking at each of these NT63 and NT42 productions:\n\nNT63 can produce several non-terminals:\n- nt63 \u2192 nt2 (twice, different productions) or nt63 \u2192 nt2 again in another production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT33\nBut wait, that's for NT27.

So I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t35 t24 t46 t13 t19 t39 t35 t20 t10 t46`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens, but I'll take it one step at a time.\n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky normal form works. Each production rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal and the right-hand side as two non-terminals or a terminal. So, I can use a bottom-up approach to see if the string can be parsed by the given grammar.\n\nThe initial step is to look at the start symbol of the grammar. The start symbol seems to be 'S' because the first production is S -> NT71 NT73. NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, so the string must start as S expanding into these.\n\nSo the string starts as NT71 NT73. Let me look at the productions for NT71 and NT73.\n\nNT71 can expand into NT63 NT33. So, after one expansion, we're looking at NT63 NT33 followed by NT73.\n\nNT73 expands into NT63 NT42.

Let me check what NT63 is.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT63 has multiple options:\n- NT63 -> NT2 t2\n- NT63 -> NT71 t33\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The given grammar has, for example, NT63 -> NT21 NT87, and so on. So, to get t35, maybe I need to see where t35 comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to process the string.\n\nStart with the entire string: t35 t24 t46 t13 t19 t39 t35 t20 t10 t46.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived starting from S. Let's consider the structure.\n\nS produces NT71 NT73. Each of these will need to be expanded into their respective non-terminals.\n\nLet me first check NT71. Its production is NT71 -> NT63 NT33. So, after expanding NT71, we have NT63 NT33.\n\nNow, NT63 can expand into various non-terminals like NT21 NT87, etc. But looking at the string, t35 appears early. Let's see if any of the NT expansions directly lead to t35.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT4 -> t22\n- NT21 -> t39\n- NT33 -> t11\n- NT54 -> t21 (via NT54 -> NT21 NT87?), wait, maybe more directly:\n\nWait, for example, NT4 has productions: NT4->t22, NT21->t39, etc. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to map each non-terminal to their terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list the productions for each non-terminal and their possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT71 -> NT63 NT33\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87, also NT54 -> 't19', NT54 -> 't2', NT54 -> 't21', etc.? Wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, NT54 has two productions that end with a terminal: NT54 -> 't19' and NT54 -> 't2'. Or is it? Looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, some of the NT productions are given as, for example, NT54 -> NT21 NT87, but also NT54 -> 't19', and NT54 -> 't2' and others? No, wait, no. Actually, in the given list, NT54 has the production NT54 -> 't19'. So that's a direct production to 't19'.

So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string \"t10 t36 t19 t36 t11 t22 t48 t48 t2 t48 t43\" is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. This structure should help me parse the string effectively.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see a series of rules where each non-terminal symbol is broken down into two other non-terminals until we reach terminal symbols, mainly 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol S by correctly applying the production rules.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the only production is S -> NT71 NT73. So, the string must start with the concatenation of NT71 and NT73. Let me check the string: the first two tokens are t10 and t36. Now, looking at the rules for NT71 and NT73:\n\n- NT71 can be derived from NT63 and NT33 (since NT73 -> NT63 NT42, wait, no, the original S is NT71 NT73, so NT71 and NT73's production rules need to be checked.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the S rule. Let me check again: S -> NT71 NT73. So both NT71 and NT73 must expand into a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT71's productions. Wait, are there any? In the given grammar, I see that NT73 is defined, but I don't see NT71 in the provided rules. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT71 is mentioned in the production for NT73: NT73 -> NT63 NT42. No, that's for another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all the rules again to make sure.\n\nThe rules given are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, looking at these, I'm confused because S's production is S-> NT71 NT73, but I don't see any productions for NT71 and NT73 beyond that. For example, NT71 doesn't appear in any production except in S. Similarly, NT73 only appears in S and in NT42. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the grammar is structured.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the rules. Oh, I see now: S is defined as NT71 NT73, which are separate non-terminals. But in the given rules, NT71 and NT73 aren't further defined. Wait, that can't be right because in context-free grammars, each non-terminal should have a production rule, either terminal or non-terminal.\n\nWait, so perhaps the given grammar is incomplete. Or maybe the non-terminals are part of a larger structure where NT71 and NT73 are further defined, but in the provided rules, only their direct productions are shown. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT71 is mentioned in the production for NT73: NT73 -> NT63 NT42. But wait, that's probably a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe NT71 and NT73 are leaves, not having any further productions beyond S. But that wouldn't make sense because a context-free grammar with S having no productions would not generate any string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rules provided are incomplete, and I should assume NT71 and NT73 have only the production to S. Or perhaps they are terminal themselves. If so, then S would produce NT71 NT73, which would have to be terminal symbols, but looking at the string, the first token is 't10', which could be a terminal, but I need to see if NT71 and NT73 can derive 't10' and something else, or perhaps 't10' is part of their derivation.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's take a step back. Maybe I should parse the string step by step to see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t10 t36 t19 t36 t11 t22 t48 t48 t2 t48 t43.\n\nI need to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nFirst, S's production is NT71 NT73. So, the first step is to split the string into two parts: the first part must be the expansion of NT71, and the second part must be the expansion of NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, let's try to split it into two parts. Since each production step combines parts into terminals, perhaps the first token is t10, which could be from NT71 or NT73, and the rest would follow.\n\nWait, but without knowing how NT71 and NT73 are structured, it's hard. Maybe we should look for where 't10' appears in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see that NT63 -> 't2' and 't10' (looking again: \"NT63 -> 't2', \"t13\", and so on. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT63 -> 't2' (from the rule \"NT63 -> 't10'\", wait no, let me check again: \n\nWait, the rules provided are:\n\nNT63 -> 't2'= this one\n\nand \n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nSimilarly, NT27 -> 't11', and so on.\n\nWait, so in the given rules, NT63 can produce 't2' or 't13'. Similarly, NT90\u2192 't35'. \n\nAlso, looking at the rules for NT36: NT36\u2192 NT90 NT33 or NT36\u2192 NT10 NT33 perhaps? Wait, I think I need to reconstruct the entire parse tree, which might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to write down the parse steps.\n\nSince S generates NT71 NT73, each of these NT71 and NT73 must derive into something that ends up being sequences of terminals that match the start and end of the string.\n\nWait, but let's check NT71: in the provided rules, I don't see NT71 being defined beyond S. That doesn't make sense. Similarly, NT73 only appears in S's production. So perhaps the grammar is not correctly presented, but I'll have to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial production for S is S -> NT1 NT2, and each NT1 and NT2 then have their own productions.\n\nBut looking at the provided grammar, it's S -> NT71 NT73, and among the given non-terminals, NT71 is defined in which production? Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nBut then again, for NT63: NT63 -> 't2' (from the rule: NT63 -> 't2'), and NT63 also -> 't13'. So, perhaps NT63 can produce 't2' or 't13'. Similarly, NT42 can produce 't46', 't36', etc.\n\nWait, so maybe NT71 and NT73 can be expanded by following these productions. But first, I need to know what NT71 and NT73 expand into. However, in the given rules, I don't see any definitions for NT71 and NT73 beyond being in S's production. So perhaps they are leaves with no further production, but that's not typical. Alternatively, perhaps their expansions are through other non-terminals that are defined.\n\nWait, maybe I'm stuck because the grammar isn't complete.

{"custom_id":"request-137","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm presented with a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string I need to determine if it's generated by this grammar. My understanding is that since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make it easier to analyze, maybe with a top-down approach or by simulating the parse steps.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. There are several production rules for non-terminal symbols (like S, NT71, NT73, etc.) breaking them down into other non-terminals until they eventually resolve to terminal symbols (the 't' followed by numbers). For example, S -> NT71 NT73 means S can be broken down into two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. Then, each of those can further be broken down.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t10 t8 t46 t13 t35 t39 t35 t39 t13 t22 t39`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string length should be equal to the number of productions applied. But I think a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I need to match the non-terminals in the grammar and see if the string can be derived from S. The first step is to look at how S expands: S -> NT71 NT73. That means the string must start with the expansion of NT71 followed by NT73. So, the string should be split into two parts, the first part corresponds to NT71 and the second to NT73.\n\nLooking at the string: `t10 t8 t46 t13 t35 t39 t35 t39 t13 t22 t39`.\n\nWait, but each production is two symbols, right? Because in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, except possibly the start which could have more. Wait no, in CNF, all productions have two non-terminals on the right side except for the start symbol which could have a single terminal, but in this case, S is producing two non-terminals. Let's count the terminals in the string: there are 11 terminals here. Since S is the top symbol, each application of a production would generate more symbols. But in this grammar, each production is two non-terminals. So, the number of steps should generate a string length of (number of productions) + 1. Wait, maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem, using the recursive descent method for CNF grammars, which can be done with a top-down parsing strategy using a stack-based approach.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with S, which is NT71 NT73. So the entire string must be parsed as NT71 followed by NT73.\n\nSo let's split the string accordingly:\n\nLet's see: Does the start of the string correspond to NT71 and the rest correspond to NT73? Wait, but in parsing, it's more about the structure than just splitting. Let me try to parse it.\n\nStart with NT71, which can be NT63 NT42, as per the grammar. So the first part of the string after S will be NT63 followed by NT42.\n\nLooking at the string: `t10 t8 t46 t13 t35 t39 t35 t39 t13 t22 t39`.\n\nSo the first part after S is NT71, which is NT63 NT42.

{"custom_id":"request-153","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me take it step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make parsing somewhat straightforward, but I'm not a parser, so I'll have to approach this differently.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is: t22 t20 t43 t13 t11 t36 t46 t35 t46 t10 t35 t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, which expands to NT71 NT73. So the string under consideration should be a sequence of symbols that can be derived from S.\n\nLet's break down each production step:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So all derivations should start with NT71 followed by NT73. Let me check the string: it starts with t22, which is one of the terminals. Wait, but NT71 and NT73 are not terminals; they need to expand further. So each NT71 and NT73 should produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT71 and NT73:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT20 NT36\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nSo the string should start with NT71's expansion, which is NT20 NT36, and then NT73's expansion, which is NT63 NT42. But let's check the string:\n\nThe string is: t22 t20 t43 t13 t11 t36 t46 t35 t46 t10 t35 t8.\n\nWait, t22 is the first symbol. But according to the grammar, the first thing is NT71, which should expand to NT20 NT36. But t22 is a terminal; looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal NT22. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I mixed up the NTs.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, the non-terminals are: S, NT71, NT73, NT27, NT42, NT54, NT36, NT87, NT4, NT21, NT63, NT73, NT27, NT33, NT4, NT21, NT33, NT42, NT63, NT27, NT33, NT4, NT21, NT33, NT42, NT63, NT27, NT33, NT4, NT21, NT33, NT42, NT63, NT27, NT33.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t22, which might be a terminal. But I don't see any production that directly produces t22. Wait, the grammar has NT4 \u2192 't22', as per the last rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, under NT4, there's a production: NT4 \u2192 't22'. So NT4 can produce t22. But then, how does that fit into S's expansion?\n\nSince S \u2192 NT71 NT73, both NT71 and NT73 need to expand into strings that eventually produce the terminals in the string.\n\nSo let's see: the first term in the string is t22. So maybe the first NT71 expands into something that leads to t22. But looking at the production rules for NT71: NT71 \u2192 NT20 NT36. Neither of these are terminals, so their expansions might produce more non-terminals which themselves expand until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the string step by step. Let me try to see if the string can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to see what the possible sequences are.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT71 NT73, the string must be derived from NT71 followed by NT73. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT71 and the expansion of NT73.\n\nSo, splitting the string into two parts: the first part is derived from NT71, and the second part from NT73.\n\nLooking back, the string is t22 t20 t43 t13 t11 t36 t46 t35 t46 t10 t35 t8.\n\nIf I think about NT71 \u2192 NT20 NT36, then these two non-terminals would need to expand into some sequence of terminals and non-terminals that eventually produce the first two tokens: t22 and t20.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t22, which is a terminal. But NT71 doesn't directly produce t22. Hmm, that's a red flag.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the NTs. Maybe the letters are part of the non-terminals? Or are the numbers indicating the non-terminals? Let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each rule is like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So the left-hand side is a non-terminal (since it's uppercase) and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal (lowercase 't' followed by a number).\n\nSo NT71 is a non-terminal that produces NT20 and NT36. NT20 is another non-terminal. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t22. There's no NT22 in the grammar. So unless NT20 can produce t20, but no, NT20 is a non-terminal that must expand further.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, NT20 isn't a variable; perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all the non-terminals properly.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT21 \u2192 't43'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't10'\n- NT27 \u2192 't20'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT21 \u2192 't43'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the non-terminals are the uppercase letters, but looking at the rules, for example, NT54 \u2192 't2'. So NT54 is a non-terminal that can directly produce the terminal 't2'.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 \u2192 't22' and 't35'.\n\nSo the non-terminals are: S, NT71, NT73, NT27, NT42, NT54, NT36, NT87, NT4, NT21, NT63, NT27, NT33, NT42, NT63, NT27, NT33, NT4, NT21, NT33, NT42, NT63, NT27, NT33.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t22, which is from NT4 \u2192 't22'. But S expands to NT71 NT73, so the first symbol in the string should come from NT71's expansion. But the rules for NT71 and NT73 don't have any terminals, only non-terminals. So how does t22 get introduced?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the string t22 t20... isn't aligned with the grammar, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NTs can expand into the terminals. Let me try to explore this.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into two parts, one generated by NT71 and the other by NT73.\n\nLooking at the string: t22 t20 t43 t13 t11 t36 t46 t35 t46 t10 t35 t8.\n\nMaybe the first part is t22, which comes from NT4, and the second part is... Wait, but S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so it's two parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion of NT71 leads to t22, and then NT73 leads to the rest.\n\nWait, let's see: if NT71 \u2192 NT20 NT36, and those non-terminals expand into something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT71 can expand into a sequence that starts with t22 t20...

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all the production rules are structured as A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of non-terminals like S, NT71, NT73, NT27, and so on, each producing two non-terminals. The terminals are strings of lowercase t followed by numbers. The string I need to check consists of a sequence of these terminal symbols: t2, t10, t36, etc.\n\nFirst, I should try to represent the string as a series of symbols and see how it can be broken down according to the grammar. Each step should correspond to a production rule, either by replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or by a terminal.\n\nLet's write down the string:\n\n1. t2\n2. t10\n3. t36\n4. t10\n5. t35\n6. t13\n7. t2\n8. t19\n9. t20\n10. t46\n11. t19\n12. t43\n13. t39\n\nWait, I think I miscounted. The string is: t2 t10 t36 t10 t35 t13 t2 t19 t20 t46 t19 t43 t39. That's 13 tokens. So, I need to parse this sequence into 13 symbols.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S -> NT71 NT73. So the first step is that S generates two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. So the string starts with the replacement of S with NT71 NT73.\n\nSo the string should start with the symbols produced by NT71 followed by NT73.\n\nLooking at the NT73 productions, it's NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So NT73 replaces into NT63 and NT42.\n\nSo now, our string starts with NT73 being split into NT63 and NT42. So the first part is NT73, which branches into NT63 and NT42.\n\nSo the string becomes: NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So the first few symbols are t2, t10, etc., which correspond to the terminals. Wait, no, the string starts with t2, but NT63 is a symbol that can be further expanded.\n\nWait, actually, the string is the sequence of symbols that S generates. So I need to represent the string as a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal that splits into two subtrees, which are either more non-terminals or the terminal symbols.\n\nSo S starts by splitting to NT71 and NT73. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nTherefore, the string is S = NT71 NT73, which expands to (NT71 expansion) followed by (NT73 expansion).\n\nNow, I need to check if both parts, from NT71 and NT73, when expanded, result in the given string.\n\nLet me first look at NT73. NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So the expansion of NT73 is NT63 followed by NT42.\n\nSimilarly, NT71: Looking at the grammar, NT71 -> NT36 NT13.

Wait, actually, some non-terminals have multiple productions, like NT54 can be NT21 NT87, or 't2', or t19, etc.\n\nWait, actually, each non-terminal has only one production. Let me list each non-terminal and see what they produce:\n\n- S: NT71 NT73\n\n- NT73: NT63 NT42\n\n- NT27: NT54 NT4\n\n- NT42: NT36 NT27\n\n- NT54: NT21 NT87, or 't2', or 't19'\n\nWait, the rule for NT54 is NT54 -> NT21 NT87, or NT54 -> 't2', or NT54->'t19'. So NT54 can expand to either 't2' or 't19' directly, or produce two non-terminals, NT21 and NT87.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has multiple options: it can expand to NT36 NT27, or directly to 't46' or 't36'.\n\nWait, let's clarify each non-terminal's production:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT54 has:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nSo NT54 can be expanded either into 't2' or 't19', or into NT21 and NT87.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has:\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nSo NT42 can expand into 't46', 't36', or into NT36 and NT27.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So for example, NT42 has three possible productions: one that produces 't46', one that produces 't36', and another that produces NT36 NT27.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, I think I misread the grammar before.

{"custom_id":"request-158","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, context-free grammars... let's see. Chomsky Normal Form is where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So all the non-terminals expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it's defined as S \u2192 NT71 NT73. That means S is a combination of two non-terminals, NT71 and NT73. The string I need to evaluate is `t2 t2 t11 t48 t8 t13 t13 t2 t36 t46 t22 t35 t20`.\n\nFirst, I think I should trace backwards from the given string to see if it can reach the start symbol S. Since the string ends with t20, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals can produce terminals. For example, NT87 produces 't8', NT54 can produce 't21', 't2', 't19', 't10', 't13', etc. Similarly, NT42 becomes 't46' or 't36' or others.\n\nLet me break down the string: it's a sequence of 13 terms separated by spaces. Each term is a terminal symbol. The string is t2 t2 t11 t48 t8 t13 t13 t2 t36 t46 t22 t35 t20.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each terminal must come from a production that generates that terminal directly, and non-terminals must combine through productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning, S is NT71 followed by NT73. So the first step is to split the string into NT71's expansion and NT73's expansion, each possibly generating several terminals.\n\nLet's assign the string into two parts. Let's denote the first part as P and the second part as Q. So P is the expansion of NT71 and Q the expansion of NT73. The entire string must be P followed by Q.\n\nSo P is the first few terminals, and Q is the remaining. Let's count the number of terms:\n\nThe string is 13 terms. Let's see: If NT71 produces P and NT73 produces Q, then the total number of terms is |P| + |Q| =13. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each time a production is used, it either increases the count by 1 or doesn't. Wait, maybe thinking in terms of how many steps the derivation can take.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, and so on, until a production leads to a terminal. So the number of terminals in the string corresponds to the number of steps plus one. For example, if a non-terminal A -> B C where B and C produce terminals directly, then A would be two terminals, meaning the derivation starts with A \u2192 B C, then B\u2192 a, C\u2192b, so the string is ab. Similarly, if A \u2192 BC and B \u2192 BC and C \u2192 a, then you have more terms.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the derivation depth. Each production adds another level, and each terminal is generated at the bottom. So the number of terminals in the string will be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is equal to the number of non-terminals expanded to terminals plus one. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each production of a non-terminal either adds another non-terminal or a terminal, the number of terminals is equal to the number of leaves. Let me think about how the expansion would happen. For example, if S \u2192 NT71 NT73, then S's expansion is the combination of NT71's expansion and NT73's expansion.\n\nSo each of NT71 and NT73 would expand into some number of terminals. The key thing is that each non-terminal can only produce a certain number of terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. Each of these non-terminals can further expand into products of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be divided into two parts, each part generated by NT71 and NT73 respectively. So I'll split the string into two sections, P and Q, where P is generated by NT71 and Q is generated by NT73.\n\nGiven the string is 13 terms, the only way to split it is into P and Q with lengths adding up to 13. Since NT71 and NT73 each generate some number of terminals, I need to find a split where the counts match.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT71 has only one production: NT71 \u2192 NT48 NT27. NT48 and NT27 also produce further non-terminals.\n\nWait, that's not right. Wait, NT71 is a non-terminal. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back: grammar is:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT42 -> NT21 NT87\n\nWait, wait\u2014NT42 has two productions: NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 and NT42 \u2192 NT21 NT87. So NT42 can expand into two different trees.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 has multiple productions, like NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, NT54 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nWait, so perhaps each non-terminal can expand into multiple possible sequences, and I need to find a path through the grammar that exactly matches the string.\n\nBut this is complicated. Maybe it's easier to write out the possible sequences generated by NT71 and NT73.\n\nStarting with NT71: according to the grammar, NT71 only has one production: NT71 \u2192 NT48 NT27.\n\nSo S produces NT71 NT73, which is NT48 NT27 NT73.\n\nNow, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, so S \u2192 NT48 NT27 NT63 NT42.\n\nThen, each of those non-terminals can further split.\n\nNT48: Let's see if NT48 has a production. Looking at the grammar, maybe not. Wait, checking:\n\nThe grammar has NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33; NT87 \u2192 't8'; NT54 \u2192 't21', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has specific rules about how the non-terminals can expand. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar given has several non-terminals on the left side of the arrows, and each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals, except for the ones that directly produce terminals. Wait, actually, looking closer, most of them seem to expand into other non-terminals until they reach the terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t46 t36 t24 t39 t48 t20 t2 t13 t20 t22 t2 t24 t13 t20`.\n\nI need to find if this string can be generated by the grammar. That means I need to see if the string can be decomposed according to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT71 NT73. So the first step is that S must produce two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. These must appear in the string in that order. Let me check the given string: it starts with t46, which corresponds to NT71, and then t24, which is NT73. Perfect, that matches the first expansion.\n\nSo the string can be split into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT71, and the second part is the expansion of NT73.\n\nNow, let's take NT71. Looking at the grammar, NT71 -> NT42 NT27. So it must expand into NT42 and NT27 in that order. The string starts with t46 t36... So t46 must be NT42's expansion.\n\nWait, let me list out the grammar for NT42. It has multiple productions:\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT42 -> NT63 NT4\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nSo one of the options is directly t46, which matches the first t46 in the string. That must be the case here. So the first part of NT71, which is NT42, expands into t46. Then the next symbol should be NT27, which is t36. Looking at the string, after t46 we have t36, which fits. So now, we've consumed t46 and t36, and now we're dealing with NT27.\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT42. Wait, no, let me check again. Actually, the production for NT27 is:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nWait, no, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar for NT27 is written as NT27 -> NT54 NT4. Wait, no, I think it's NT27 -> NT54 NT4. Hmm, but in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4.\n\nSo NT27 must expand into NT54 and NT4. Let me see what NT4 does.\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4 -> 't22' and also NT42 -> 't22' and others. Wait, in the grammar, we have several rules for NT4:\n\nNT4 -> 't22', NT4 -> 't35', etc.\n\nWait, looking back: NT4's productions are:\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nSo, in the string, after NT27, which expands into NT54 and NT4, the next symbol should be whatever NT54 expands into, and then NT4's expansion.\n\nAfter t46 t36, we have t24, which is NT39. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts based on the initial split by S: NT71 and NT73. So the entire string is split into two sequences, each producing NT71 and NT73 respectively.\n\nFirst, process NT71: NT71 -> NT42 NT27.\n\nWe have the string starting with t46 t36... So t46 must be the expansion of NT42. Looking at NT42's productions, one option is directly 't46', so that fits. Now, the next symbol after t46 is t36, which should be NT27.\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4.\n\nSo after t46, we have t36, which is NT27, which expands into NT54 and NT4.\n\nSo now, after t46, the parser should split the remaining string into two parts: one for NT54 and one for NT4.\n\nWait, no, not exactly. Because NT27 expands into two symbols, so the string after t46 must start with the expansion of NT54 followed by the expansion of NT4.\n\nWait, so after t46, the next symbols are t36 t24 t39 t48 t20 t2 t13 t20 t22 t2 t24 t13 t20.\n\nWait, that's the remaining string after the first two symbols: t46 t36 t24... So after t46 (NT42), comes t36 (NT27). Now, NT27 must expand into NT54 and NT4.\n\nSo, the production is NT27 -> NT54 NT4.\n\nSo the next two symbols in the string after t36 would be the expansions of NT54 and NT4.\n\nWait, not immediately, because NT54 might expand into other non-terminals. So I need to break down NT54 first.\n\nLooking at NT54's productions:\n\nNT54 -> 't21' (directly to terminal t21)\nNT54 -> 't19' (directly to t19)\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT54 -> NT63 NT13\nNT54 -> NT90 NT35.\n\nSo NT54 can expand into several options.\n\nIn our case, after t46, we have t36 t24... So after expanding NT27 into NT54 and NT4, the next symbol after t36 is t24, which should be the expansion of NT4.\n\nWait, let me think again. After t46 (NT42), comes t36 (NT27). NT27's production is NT54 and NT4. So the first expansion is NT54, the second is NT4.\n\nSo the next symbol after t36 should be the expansion of NT54, but wait, NT54 is a non-terminal, so it must expand into other symbols until it produces a terminal. So after t36, the next part is the expansion of NT54.\n\nBut let's see: the string is t46 t36 t24... So after t46, t36, the next is t24.\n\nWait, that would mean that NT4 (which is the second part of NT27's production) is expanding to 't24', but looking at NT4's productions, it can only directly produce 't22' or 't35'. Hmm, but 't24' isn't a terminal produced directly by NT4. That's a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the order.\n\nLet me double-check: NT27 -> NT54 NT4. So after t36 (NT27), the next symbols are the expansion of NT54 and then the expansion of NT4.\n\nSo the string after t36 is t24 t39 t48 t20 t2 t13 t20 t22 t2 t24 t13 t20.\n\nSo after t36, the next symbols are t24, which would have to be the expansion of NT54. Wait, no\u2014NT54 is a non-terminal, so it should expand into a sequence until it reaches a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the initial thought was wrong. Let me try another approach: maybe the string is the result of the two initial productions, NT71 and NT73, each expanding into their respective sequences.\n\nSo after S, we have NT71 and NT73.\n\nLet me process NT71 first: NT71 -> NT42 NT27.\n\nNT42 can expand to 't46' directly, as per its production. So that would consume the first t46 in the string.\n\nThen, NT27 expands into NT54 NT4.\n\nNow, after t46, the next symbol is t36. So that must be the expansion of NT54's second part, which is NT4.\n\nWait, but NT4's productions don't include 't36'. So this approach is leading to a contradiction. Maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT27's NT4 expands to 't36' instead of being a non-terminal.

Hmm, the grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: t8 t39 t24 t19 and so on.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. The starting symbol is S. So the given grammar starts with S and ultimately should derive into the string provided.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules. Starting from S, it goes to NT71 and NT73. So S -> NT71 NT73. That means for the string to start with, the first part should come from NT71 and the second from NT73. Let's see what NT71 and NT73 expand into.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So the second part is a combination of NT63 and NT42. Similarly, NT71's first step isn't given in the rules; maybe I need to check if there's a rule for NT71. Wait, looking through the rules: I see NT71 is not listed, except in S. That might be a problem because if NT71 isn't defined anywhere else, it can't produce anything. But wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT71 NT73, but in the rules, I don't see NT71 or NT73 being defined anywhere else. The other non-terminals like NT73, NT63, etc., all have rules, but NT71 is only in the start productions. Is that possible? Shouldn't all non-terminals be properly defined? Maybe the user made a mistake, but I'll proceed assuming that.\n\nSo S -> NT71 NT73. Without knowing what NT71 becomes, I can't really proceed. Similarly, NT73 -> NT63 NT42. Let's follow that. NT63 seems to have a rule: NT63 -> t2 or maybe more. Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT63 -> t2. Similarly, NT73 -> t24. So, if S turns into NT71 and NT73, and NT73 is t24, then the second part is t24. But the string starts with t8, which doesn't match t24. That makes me think maybe the string is not generated because NT73 can only produce t24.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The production S -> NT71 NT73 means the string starts with NT71 and ends with NT73? No, in CFG, each production is a sequence, so S produces a pair of NT71 and NT73, which are then sequences of terminals and non-terminals. So when S is expanded, each NT71 and NT73 will be expanded until they become terminals.\n\nSo let's see NT73's possible expansion. NT73 -> NT63 NT42. Now, looking up NT63's rules: NT63 -> t2. And NT42 -> t36. So NT73 would expand into t2 t36, right? Or wait, no, because NT63 could also expand into other non-terminals. Let me check NT63 again: looking at the rules, NT63 -> t2, so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT42 -> t36. So NT73 expands into t2 t36.\n\nPutting that together, S becomes NT71 followed by NT73, which is t2 t36. So the initial part of the string would have t2 and t36, but the given string starts with t8 t39 t24. So that's a discrepancy because the first symbol is t8, which is not t2 or t36.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see: The given string is \"t8 t39 t24 t19 t39 t48 t36 t20 t35 t39 t35 t20 t19 t22\". The first symbol is t8. So if the first NT71 can produce t8, then perhaps.\n\nBut looking back, S -> NT71 NT73. So the first symbol is from NT71. But in the rules, I don't see a production for NT71. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nThe grammar has S -> NT71 NT73, but looking through the other productions, NT71 doesn't appear again. So that means NT71 can only produce itself, which is only possible if it's assigned to a terminal, but the rules don't show that. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is broken, and NT71 doesn't have any further productions. If that's the case, the grammar can't produce any string starting with a terminal other than what NT71 can produce, but since it doesn't have any, S can't produce anything. But that can't be because the string to evaluate is given. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the string doesn't start correctly. The string starts with t8. So for S to produce t8..., the first NT must produce t8. So NT71 must produce t8. But in the rules, looking for NT71, it's only mentioned in the start symbol. So NT71 isn't defined beyond that, meaning it's an undefined production, which would mean the entire grammar can't derive any string. So the answer would be No.\n\nBut wait, the user provided a string that starts with t8, but NT71 isn't in any production except the start symbol. So unless NT71 can be expanded into a terminal, the grammar can't generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar's start symbol. Sometimes rules have multiple right-hand sides. Wait, the start symbol S is the only thing on the left side, so the string must start with S, which splits into NT71 and NT73. If NT71 can't be further expanded into t8, then the string is invalid.\n\nLooking again, S -> NT71 NT73. If NT71 can't expand into t8, then the string can't start with t8. So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, the string given starts with t8, so unless NT71 can be expanded into t8, the string isn't possible. Since I don't see a production for NT71 leading to t8, the answer is No.\n\nI think that's the case.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t19 t22 t46 t43 t2 t13 t24 t36 t48 t24 t20 t19 t43 t39 t46`. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to understand how the string can be broken down. The grammar starts with S -> NT71 NT73, so the entire string should be derived from these two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT71 and NT73:\n\nNT71 can be broken down into NT63 (from the rule NT73->NT63 NT42 and NT63->...). Wait, actually, NT71 is the same as NT73. Let me check: NT73->NT63 NT42, and NT71->NT63 NT42 as per the rules (since NT71 is same as NT63 NT42). So both NT71 and NT73 lead to NT63 NT42.\n\nWait, no, the grammar as given: It starts with S -> NT71 NT73, and both NT71 and NT73 have the same production: NT71 -> NT63 NT42 and NT73 -> NT63 NT42.

So each NT in the grammar either breaks down further into other NTs or eventually produces a terminal.\n\nI need to parse the string step by step, following the grammar. Let's list the string terms in order: t19, t22, t46, t43, t2, t13, t24, t36, t48, t24, t20, t19, t43, t39, t46.\n\nPerhaps it's better to build a parse tree. Start with the root S, which is NT71 NT73. Let's see each NT71 and NT73 must expand into their rules.\n\nLooking at NT71 -> NT63 NT42. So from NT71, we get NT63 and NT42.

Let me check the original grammar:\n\nOriginal Rules (from user):\n\nNT63 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT63 -> NT2 NT13\n\nYes, it's correct. So NT63 can expand into either NT90 NT33 or NT2 NT13.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have their own expansions leading to terminals and other Nts.\n\nSo for parsing, we can choose an order to expand, but to match the string, we need to find a path that leads to the given tokens.\n\nThe string is: t19 t22 t46 t43 t2 t13 t24 t36 t48 t24 t20 t19 t43 t39 t46\n\nLet's see how the string can be grouped into the expansion.\n\nEach NT must produce a sequence of tokens. Let's try to process the string step by step.\n\nLet's imagine the string is a list:\n\n[t19, t22, t46, t43, t2, t13, t24, t36, t48, t24, t20, t19, t43, t39, t46]\n\nLooking for possible starting points.\n\nThe top-level NTs after S are NT63 NT42 and then another NT63 NT42.\n\nWait, no: S \u2192 NT63 NT42 NT63 NT42. So four NTs in total: NT63, NT42, NT63, NT42.\n\nEach of these can eventually expand into a terminal, but they may involve intermediate steps.\n\nLet me process each NT separately.\n\nFirst NT63:\n\nLooking at NT63, which can be either NT90 NT33 or NT2 NT13.\n\nLet's try NT63 \u2192 NT2 NT13. Because if we choose NT63\u2192NT90 NT33, then we need t19 (from NT54\u2192't19') or t8 (from NT87\u2192't8'), but let's see.\n\nWait, the string starts with t19, which is an 't19' token. Looking at the grammar, 't19' is only present in NT54 \u2192 't19' and similarly in NT42\u2192't46'. So 't19' is directly from NT54\u2192't19'.\n\nSo the first NT in the string is 't19', but according to S, the first NT is NT63 NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Hmm, where to start.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right sides are two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar here is all in CNF, with productions like S -> NT71 NT73, and each non-terminal on the right side being a combination of terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nSo the process should be to parse the string using the grammar, checking if we can derive the string step by step.\n\nLet me write down the start symbol: S. S expands into NT71 and NT73. Each of these is on the left side of a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT73: NT73 -> NT63 NT42.

{"custom_id":"request-191","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of several non-terminals and rules that expand into other non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string I need to evaluate starts with 't13 t2 t10 t2 t20 t20 t43 t46 t36 t2 t2 t19 t24 t19 t22 t22'. \n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards from the given string and see if I can parse it according to the grammar. Parsing context-free grammars often involves checking if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol.\n\nThe string given has 17 tokens, all starting with 't' followed by a number. So I'll list them out:\n\nt13, t2, t10, t2, t20, t20, t43, t46, t36, t2, t2, t19, t24, t19, t22, t22.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal (NT) expands into two other non-terminals except for some that directly produce a terminal ('t' followed by a number). For example, NT87 directly becomes 't8', NT54 can become either 't19' or other combinations, and so on.\n\nSo, the plan is to start from the string and split it into parts that match the left-hand side (LHS) of the grammar rules. Since most rules are of the form NT -> NT1 NT2, I'll split the string accordingly.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe entire string is: t13 t2 t10 t2 t20 t20 t43 t46 t36 t2 t2 t19 t24 t19 t22 t22.\n\nFirst, S -> NT71 NT73. So S splits into two parts. Let's consider the string as [part1] [part2], where part1 is derived from NT71 and part2 from NT73.\n\nLooking at NT73's rules: NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So part2 (from NT73) has to split into NT63 and NT42. So the string should be split at NT63 NT42. Looking at the string, I don't immediately see a split point. Let's look at the sequence:\n\nThe beginning is t13 t2 t10 t2 t20 t20 t43 t46 t36 t2 t2 t19 t24 t19 t22 t22.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for NT73 in the top level. NT73 can become NT63 and NT42. So part1 would be NT71 (S splits into part1 NT71 and part2 NT73). Now NT71's rule: NT71 is derived from... I don't recall a rule for NT71. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar starts with S -> NT71 NT73. Now I need to find where NT71 is defined. Looking through the rules, I see NT73 is defined, but no NT71 is listed except as S's child. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar rules: the first line is S -> NT71 NT73. Then, NT73 -> NT63 NT42. I must have made a mistake because if NT71's expansion is not listed, then perhaps it doesn't exist beyond the start symbol. That might complicate things. Wait, maybe I missed NT71's definition. Let me scan through the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT73 is defined.\n- NT27 is defined.\n- NT42 is defined.\n- NT54 is defined, with four possibilities: 't21', 't19', 't2', 't22'.\n- NT4 is defined as 't22'.\n- Other NTs: NT63, NT90, etc.\n\nWait, there's no rule for NT71, except as the left-hand side of S. So that suggests that NT71 cannot produce any other non-terminals. But S can only produce NT71 NT73, so part1 must be NT71, which implies that part1 cannot expand further, which would mean part1 is an terminal symbol, but NT71 isn't a terminal since it's a non-terminal. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because NT71 isn't defined. Wait, perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again: The first rule is S -> NT71 NT73. Then under NT73: NT73 -> NT63 NT42.\n\nNow, I'm thinking that might imply that NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals that don't expand further beyond their definitions, meaning that the start symbol S directly produces these two non-terminals, which are leaves. But in the string given, the initial part is 't13 t2', which doesn't immediately match NT73's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm handling this. Let me try a different approach. Let's try to parse the string by trying possible splits at each step.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\n\nt13 t2 t10 t2 t20 t20 t43 t46 t36 t2 t2 t19 t24 t19 t22 t22.\n\nSince S expands into NT71 NT73, the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT71 and NT73. So, I need to split the string into two parts: left part from NT71 and right part from NT73.\n\nBut I don't know the expansions of NT71 and NT73 beyond S. Wait a minute, NT73 has a rule: NT73 -> NT63 NT42, so the right part (from NT73) should further split into NT63 and NT42.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 could have a rule, for example NT63 -> NT2 or something, but I don't see that in the given rules except for NT63's rule: Looking again, under NT63, I see that one of the productions is NT63 \u2192 t2, another is NT63 \u2192 NT10? Wait, looking through the rules again:\n\nI think I might have an error in reading the grammar because in the initial rules, the lines under NTs are a bit hard to parse, but let me try to list them out clearly.\n\nThe given grammar rules:\n\n1. S -> NT71 NT73\n2. NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n3. NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n4. NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n5. NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n6. NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n7. NT87 -> 't8'\n8. NT54 -> 't19'\n9. NT42 -> 't46'\n10. NT54 -> 't2'\n11.

NT63 -> 't10'\n22. NT27 -> 't20'\n23. NT71 -> 't48'\n24. NT63 -> 't13'\n25. NT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, that's better. Now, NT71 can only be derived as per its rule: S -> NT71 NT73. So, the entire string must be split into two parts: left part from NT71 and right part from NT73.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT71 isn't defined further; hence, it must be a terminal. Therefore, NT71 should directly correspond to a terminal symbol, which is a 't' followed by a number. Let's check if one of the terminals is there.\n\nIn the string, starting with 't13'. So perhaps the entire string could be represented as NT71 = 't13' and NT73 the rest.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIf NT71 produces 't13', then the string starts with 't13', and the remaining string is 't2 t10 t2 t20 t20 t43 t46 t36 t2 t2 t19 t24 t19 t22 t22'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So the string should start with the symbols derived from NT71 followed by those from NT73.\n\nLet me break down NT71 and NT73.\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT39 NT63. So NT71 can only produce NT39 and NT63.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT48 NT43. Wait, from the list above, NT43 is 't43' (line 19: NT42 \u2192 't46', but wait, line 19 is NT21 \u2192 't43').\n\nWait, no, line 19 is NT21 \u2192 't43', so line 18 is NT42 \u2192 't36', and 20 is NT42 \u2192 't36'. Hmm, so NT42 can produce 't36' as well. Wait, no:\n\nLine 18: NT21 \u2192 't43'\n\nLine 19: NT42 \u2192 't36'\n\nLine 17: NT21 \u2192 't43'\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me correct. Each production can be applied multiple times, so if a non-terminal has multiple productions, any of them can apply.\n\nSo the productions are deterministic in the sense that a production is applied if possible, but since we're not given a specific strategy like leftmost or rightmost, we have to consider all possible derivations.\n\nSo let's re-express the grammar correctly.\n\nNon-terminals and their productions:\n\nS: NT71 NT73\n\nNT73: NT63 NT42\n\nNT27: NT54 NT4\n\nNT42: NT36 NT27; NT36 NT27; NT42 can produce 't46' (since line 20 says NT42 \u2192 't36'? Wait no line 20: NT42 \u2192 't36'? Wait no, looking again.\n\nWait, line 20: NT42 \u2192 't36' (line 20). So NT42 has two productions: one is NT36 NT27 (from line 4), and another is 't36' (line 20).\n\nSo NT42 can produce either NT36 and NT27 or the terminal 't36'.\n\nSimilarly, NT54: NT21 NT87 (line 5), 't19' (line 8), 't2' (line 10), 't13' (line 21), and NT63 (line 24). Wait, line 5: NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, line 8: NT54 \u2192 't19', line 10: NT54 \u2192 't2', line 21: NT54 \u2192 't13', and line 25: NT90 \u2192 't35'\u2014no, that's nt90. So NT54 has five productions: NT21 NT87; 't19'; 't2'; 't13'; and is that correct? Wait line 5: NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87. Line 8: NT54 \u2192 't19'. Line 10: NT54 \u2192 't2'. Line 21: NT54 \u2192 't2'. Wait no, line 21 is NT27 \u2192 't20'; that's for NT27. Line 22 is NT90 \u2192 't35'. So line 10 is NT54 \u2192 't2', line 21 is NT27 \u2192 't20', so for NT54 we have:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 (line 5)\n- NT54 \u2192 't19' (line 8)\n- NT54 \u2192 't2' (line 10)\n- NT54 \u2192 't13' (line 21: or is this for NT63?)\n\nWait, line 21 is NT63 \u2192 't13'.

Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal breaking into two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string must be a concatenation of these terminals, following the leftmost- or rightmost-derivation path.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is NT71 NT73. So the first two tokens must correspond to NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT71 NT73. NT71 is on the right side in some productions. Let me check NT71. Checking all productions, I see NT71 \u2192 't48'. So NT71 must directly produce 't48'. Therefore, the first token in the string is 't8', but according to the grammar, NT71 produces 't48', which is different. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, does S derive to NT71 first, then NT73. So the string starts with NT71, which is 't48', and then NT73, which is 't24'. So the first part of the string should be 't48 t24'. But the given string starts with 't8', which doesn't match. That would immediately invalidate the string, but wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding NT71's production.\n\nLooking back: NT71 \u2192 't48' according to the grammar. So S \u2192 NT71 NT73 should produce 't48' followed by whatever NT73 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with 't8'. So that suggests that either I'm missing something or perhaps the string is not possible. Wait, but perhaps I'm thinking about the order wrong. Maybe in the string, 't8' comes from another non-terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, the right-hand side of S is NT71 followed by NT73. So the first two symbols in any derivation would be the terminals derived by NT71 and NT73, in that order. NT71's production is only 't48', so the first token should be 't48', not 't8'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't8', so this suggests that maybe the string is not generated by this grammar because 't8' doesn't come from NT71. Therefore, the answer might be 'No.'\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe there's another non-terminal that can produce 't8'. Looking through the productions, I see NT87 \u2192 't8' and NT54 \u2192 't19', etc. None of the other non-terminals directly produce 't8' except NT87. But NT87 isn't part of the production chain from S. So if the string starts with 't8', that would mean S must derive from a non-terminal that produces 't8', which isn't the case here.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first token is 't8', which doesn't match the possible productions of NT71 (which is 't48') and NT73 (which is 't24').\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is meant to be a concatenation of different non-terminals, but given the structure of S, the first part is NT71 and then NT73, both of which have fixed terminal outputs. So the initial part should be 't48 t24', but the string starts with 't8', which contradicts this.\n\nThus, I conclude that the string is not generated by the given grammar, so the answer is 'No.'\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This means every production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF, except I notice that some non-terminals have production rules with more than two non-terminals or terminals on the right.

{"custom_id":"request-215","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific rules: each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLet me look at the grammar first. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all in CNF. The string to evaluate is \"t13 t2 t20 t11 t43 t22 t2 t20 t20 t48 t39 t20 t24 t46 t24 t10 t11 t35\".\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string into individual tokens. The string is split by spaces, and each part is a token. So the string is a sequence of 19 tokens. I'll list them out as [t13, t2, t20, t11, t43, t22, t2, t20, t20, t48, t39, t20, t24, t46, t24, t10, t11, t35].\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, we can use either top-down methods (like recursive descent or using a parsing table) or bottom-up methods (like the CYK algorithm). But given that I'm trying to do this manually, I might go with a top-down approach, starting from S and seeing if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce NT71 NT73. So S \u2192 NT71 NT73. That means the first two tokens of the string should correspond to NT71 and NT73 in some order, considering how the derivations proceed.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is a single rule. So S \u2192 NT71 NT73 means that S can be expanded into NT71 followed by NT73, not necessarily adjacent tokens in the string. Hmm, maybe I should approach this as a parse tree, ensuring that each NT71 and NT73 expand into the respective parts.\n\nBut wait, more accurately: each step in the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with a pair of non-terminals or a terminal. So to get a string, each path from the root to a leaf in the parse tree should be the sequence of terminals, while non-terminals are expanded step by step.\n\nThis might be complex, but perhaps I can break it down by looking at the string as a sequence and trying to apply the productions.\n\nLet me consider the string: t13 t2 t20 t11 t43 t22 t2 t20 t20 t48 t39 t20 t24 t46 t24 t10 t11 t35.\n\nThat's 19 tokens, which is quite long. Maybe I can group the tokens into segments corresponding to the productions.\n\nWait, each production seems to split a non-terminal into exactly two parts. For example, S \u2192 NT71 NT73 means the entire string must be derived as (NT71 expansion) followed by (NT73 expansion). Similarly, each non-terminal can further split into two parts, etc., all the way down to terminals.\n\nSo I can represent the entire string as a list and try to split it into segments according to the grammar's production rules.\n\nLet me try to do this step by step.\n\nFirst, the top level is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the entire string should be equal to the concatenation of the expansions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t13, which is a terminal. So t13 must come from either NT71 or NT73, depending on which non-terminal it's expanding. Wait, no. Wait, NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, so their expansions will produce sequences of terminals, possibly of different lengths.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each non-terminal must expand into a sequence that eventually leads to terminals. So let's see.\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT63 NT42, according to the grammar: NT71: S->NT71 NT73; NT71's production is in another part of the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar given: S is the start, and the other non-terminals are defined with specific productions. Let's list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nThen, the other non-terminals:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87; also NT54 \u2192 't19', NT42 \u2192 't46', NT54 \u2192 't2'; NT4 \u2192 't22'; NT21 \u2192 't39'; NT63 \u2192 't2'; NT73 \u2192 't24'; NT27 \u2192 't11'; NT33 \u2192 't11'; NT42 \u2192 't36'; NT63 \u2192 't13'; NT90 \u2192 't35'.\n\nWait, some non-terminals have multiple productions: for example, NT54 has both a production to NT21 NT87 and also to terminals 't19', 't2', and 't13'. Similarly, NT42 has a production to NT36 NT27 and also to specific terminals 't46', 't36', and is involved in more rules.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should list each non-terminal and their possible productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n  NT42 \u2192 't46' (from earlier)\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n  NT54 \u2192 't19'\n  NT54 \u2192 't2'\n  NT54 \u2192 't13'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT63 \u2192 't2'\n  NT63 \u2192 't10' (from line 15)\n- NT73 \u2192 't24'\n- NT27 \u2192 't11'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't13' (from line 15)\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, some of these seem conflicting. For example, NT54 can go to 't2' (line 7: NT54 \u2192 't2'), but also to 't19' and 't13'. Similarly, NT63 can produce 't2' (line 9) and 't10' (line 15), which is 't63 -> t2' and 't63 \u2192 t10'\u2014so actually, two different productions.\n\nBut how does that work? I think in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a rule that either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal. So maybe in the grammar, the same non-terminal can have multiple productions, each being a possible way to split the non-terminal into two parts or a terminal.\n\nBut for parsing, you can choose any of the available productions for a non-terminal at each step.\n\nSo, back to the problem.\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73, so the expansion of S must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, which starts with t13, that would have to be either part of NT71's expansion or part of NT73's expansion.\n\nLet me consider the string as being cut into parts that match the expansions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nFirst, the entire string is t13 t2 t20 t11 t43 t22 t2 t20 t20 t48 t39 t20 t24 t46 t24 t10 t11 t35.\n\nI need to split this into two parts: the first part (NT71's expansion) and the second part (NT73's expansion).\n\nEach of these parts must themselves be derived from their respective non-terminals.\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nSo, the first part of the string must start with NT63's expansion followed by NT42's expansion.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42 (line 2), so the second part must be NT63 followed by NT42.\n\nWait, actually, wait: looking back, line 2 says NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and each of those has their own expansions.\n\nSo for NT71, it's NT63 (from line 9: NT63\u2192t2) and NT27 ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So all the productions given here fit that, except I notice that some terminals are directly on the right side, which is fine.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol, the grammar starts with S. The production for S is S -> NT71 NT73. So the string must start with the two non-terminals NT71 and NT73.\n\nBreaking down the string into pairs, starting from the beginning, I'll group them into the non-terminals. The string is:\n\nt39, t13, t13, t22, t19, t24, t36, t2, t11, t24, t22, t11, t36, t39, t13, t43, t20, t43, t39.\n\nWait, that's 18 tokens, so the grammar should parse into 18 steps, but let's start grouping into possible non-terminals.\n\nThe grammar has definitions for the non-terminals.

I need to see if t39 is the production of NT71 or NT73.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT71 -> NT48 NT13: Wait, no, looking back, NT71 is defined as NT48 NT13?

Similarly, NT4: 't22' is listed, and looking back, I think the grammar might have overlapping productions. Hmm, actually, wait, let's structure this properly.\n\nWait, the given grammar seems to have multiple productions for some non-terminals. Like NT54 has entries:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nSimilarly, NT4: 't4' is the first production, then later the same.

For example, NT54 has three productions:\n\n1. NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\n2. NT54 -> 't19'\n\n3. NT54 -> 't2'\n\nBut wait, that can't be right; each non-terminal in CNF can have only one production per each right-hand side. Wait, no, in CNF, a non-terminal can have multiple productions only if they are all of the form A->BC, but in this case, some of the productions are terminals, so I think the correct way is to have productions that are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the first production for NT54 is two non-terminals (NT21 and NT87), and then another production is a terminal 't19', and another is 't2', but that would mean that NT54 can produce either 't19' or 't2' directly. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me re-examine the given grammar:\n\nHere's the given grammar again:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, looking closely, some are single productions (like NT87 -> 't8'), and then for NT54, there are three productions:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nThis might be an error because a non-terminal in CNF can have multiple productions only if all of them are of the form two non-terminals or single terminal. Wait, but actually, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, so if a non-terminal has a production that is a terminal, it can only have that terminal in one production. But here, it seems NT54 has three productions, two of which are terminals, which is allowed as it can produce different terminals in different steps. Wait, no, in CNF, each production for a non-terminal is individual. So having NT54 with three productions is allowed as long as all of them are either two non-terminals or terminals. So in this case, NT54 has two productions where it produces a terminal, but that's okay because only one of them can be chosen at any given time.\n\nHowever, I think the structure might be that some productions are written more than once, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nNow, I need to parse the string step by step. The string is:\n\nt39 t13 t13 t22 t19 t24 t36 t2 t11 t24 t22 t11 t36 t39 t13 t43 t20 t43 t39\n\nLet me try to parse this from the start.\n\nStarting with S -> NT71 NT73. So the first two tokens should be the productions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the first token: t39. Is t39 part of NT71's production or NT73's production?\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT71 goes to 't48', so to get 't39', I need to see if that's possible. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nEach non-terminal's productions are listed, so NT71's production is to 't48', meaning that when NT71 is used, it directly produces 't48'.

In this case, the grammar is given with various non-terminals like S, NT73, NT63, etc., and their productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t24 t11 t35 t8 t10 t24 t20 t46 t13 t48 t35 t48 t13 t10 t39 t22 t13 t13 t8`.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string using the grammar, breaking it down from the start symbol S down to terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step should replace a single non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals).\n\nLet's see the start symbol: S -> NT71 NT73. So the first step is to split the string into two parts that correspond to NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t24 t11... Maybe NT71 produces t24 something, and NT73 produces t11 something. Alternatively, I need to find a way to split the string into two parts where each part can be derived from NT71 and NT73 respectively.\n\nWait, actually, the first production is S -> NT71 NT73, which means the entire string should be derived as (NT71)(NT73).

That makes sense.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the entire string can be divided into two substrings where the first substring is generated by NT71 and the second by NT73.\n\nLet me see the right-hand side of NT73. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nSo that's two non-terminals. Then, NT63 and NT42 each have their own productions.\n\nLooking at NT63, it produces t2 or other NTs. Wait, no.

One is NT54 -> t21 t87, and the other is NT54 -> 't2'?

So for NT54, it's:\n\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n\nWait, that would mean NT54 can produce 't2' directly, but also can produce NT21 followed by NT87.

Alternatively, perhaps the productions are:\n\nLooking again at the user's input:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nWait, perhaps in the actual grammar, NT54 has two productions: one to 't2' and another to NT21 NT87.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is left-hand side (A) and right-hand side (two symbols, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal or even two terminals, although technically, in Chomsky CNF, right sides can have two non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal, or even a single terminal? Wait, no, Chomsky CNF requires all productions to have two non-terminals on the right or a single non-terminal. Hmm, but looking at the grammar provided, each production has two non-terminals on the right, which is correct for CNF.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT71 NT73. So, S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nNow, I notice that some non-terminals have both a terminal and a non-terminal expansion. For example, NT87 can only produce 't8'. NT54 has multiple productions, some of which are terminals: 't19', 't2', 't24', 't13', 't35'. Similarly, NT42 can directly produce 't46' or go to other non-terminals.\n\nMy approach is to trace the string through the grammar, trying to find a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nThe string is: t19 t35 t8 t20 t48 t13 t24 t46 t43 t13 t13 t39 t20 t20 t48 t36 t20 t2 t24 t10.\n\nWait, that's 21 tokens. But I need to split this into a sequence of productions. Each production either produces two non-terminals or, for those that have terminals, the terminals must appear in order as per the string.\n\nAlternatively, since the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of the right-hand sides of the productions, I can consider possible splits.\n\nI think a good way is to process the string step by step, trying to match the productions.\n\nBut considering the grammar, perhaps it's easier to model the entire string as a series of expansions from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can generate the string.\n\nStart with S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nThen, NT71 -> 't48' (since NT71 is defined as having a production to 't48'), so the first token is t48.\n\nNT73 can produce 't24' (from NT73 -> 't24'), so the second token is t24.\n\nSo far, the first two tokens are t48 t24, which matches the first two tokens of the string (t19, t35). Wait, but that's not matching. Wait, the first token is t19.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So perhaps that's not the correct expansion. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string starts with t19, so perhaps I should try to see how the string can be split to produce that.\n\nLet me see: t19 is one of the options for NT54. So, starting from S, perhaps S can produce NT71 and NT73, but in the string, after S, the first token is t19, which comes from NT54, not S's production.\n\nWait, that seems to indicate that S's production doesn't directly lead to t19, but maybe the string starts with NT54's production, but that can't be, because S must produce NT71 NT73.\n\nWait, maybe the string cannot start with t19, because to get t19, you have to have a NT54, which can be reached only if there's a production that produces t19, but S must go through NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait, perhaps S's expansion is NT71 NT73, which are t48 and t24 respectively. So the string starting with t19 could not be generated, meaning the string is invalid. But that may not be the case because maybe the NT73 can expand into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me make a table of all the non-terminals and their options.\n\nLet me list all productions again for clarity:\n\nNT73:\n- NT63 NT42\n- 't24'\n\nNT63:\n- 't2'\n\nSo NT73 can expand to 't24' directly, or to NT63 NT42. If it's the latter, NT63 is 't2', NT42 can expand to 't46' or to NT36 NT27.\n\nSimilarly, NT71 is 't48' directly.\n\nSo S -> NT71 NT73 -> 't48' (for NT71) followed by something that could produce 't24' directly via NT73.\n\nBut that would give the string starting with t48 t24, which is not the case, as the string starts with t19 t35.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t19, which is from NT54, not S. That can't be because S must split into NT71 NT73, and then those two must be expanded into the correct tokens.\n\nHmm, perhaps the string does not start with t19, but according to the string, it does. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated, hence the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. The string is: t19 t35 t8 t20 t48 t13 t24 t46 t43 t13 t13 t39 t20 t20 t48 t36 t20 t2 t24 t10.\n\nThis is a 21-token string.\n\nS expands to NT71 NT73, which are 't48' and 't24' respectively.\n\nSo the first two tokens after expansion would be t48 t24.\n\nBut in the string, it's t19 t35. So this does not match. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing that NT73 can be split into NT63 NT42, and then NT63 produces 't2', NT42 produces 't46', so that would make 't2 t46', but that's not matching t19 t35.\n\nAlternatively, NT73 can't produce the initial part of the string correctly, so the entire string is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string does not start with t48 and t24, which would be required if S expanded to NT71 't48' and NT73 't24'. Instead, it starts with t19 and t35, which are not possible from S's expansion. Therefore, the grammar cannot generate the given string.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It seems to be a series of productions where each non-terminal on the left is split into two non-terminals or terminals on the right. The start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT71 and NT73. \n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 or NT21 NT2, or NT36\n- NT87 is a terminal 't8'\n- NT54 also has another production: \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- Wait, I see some duplicates here, like NT54 having multiple rules. Let me list them all to avoid confusion.\n\nWait, actually, each non-terminal can have multiple productions. So I should list all productions for each non-terminal:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 | 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | NT21 NT2 | 't21' NT36 | 't19'\n- Wait, no, that's not correct. Looking again, NT54's productions are:\n  - NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n  - NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT2\n  - NT54 \u2192 't21' NT36 (Wait, but in the given grammar, some rules have 'terminals' mixed with non-terminals. For example, the first production of NT54 is NT21 NT87, which is two non-terminals. Another is NT21 NT2, which is NT21 and a terminal. The third production is 't21' NT36, which is a terminal and a non-terminal. But in Chomsky normal form, each production should have only one non-terminal on the left, and each step should consist of replacing that non-terminal with two other symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. However, mixing terminals and non-terminals in a production is allowed but the production should only have up to two symbols. But in this case, the grammar seems a bit messed up because some productions are combining NTs and terminals.\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me re-examine each production correctly:\n\nActually, let's parse each production properly, ensuring that each production is either a non-terminal or two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. Let me go through each:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73 : Good, two non-terminals.\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42 : Good.\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4 : Good.\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 : Good.\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 : Good.\n- NT87 \u2192 't8' : Wait, no. The given grammar shows NT87 \u2192 't8' or 't19'? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user's grammar is:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, some non-terminals have multiple productions. For example, NT54 has multiple rules:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 \u2192 't21' NT36\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't19'\n\nWait, but Chomsky normal form requires that a production can only consist of two symbols, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and a terminal. But in this case, some productions for NT54 involve mixing terminals with non-terminals, which is allowed but complicates things because it introduces terminals early in the derivation.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42: that's two non-terminals.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4: also two non-terminals.\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27: two non-terminals.\n\nNT54 has several productions, some involving a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nLet's list NT54's productions again accurately:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't21' NT36\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n\nWait, but 't2' is a single terminal, which technically cannot be a production in Chomsky normal form because each production must replace a non-terminal with two symbols. But some sources allow terminals in the same rule. So, a production like A \u2192 a B, where 'a' is a terminal and B is a non-terminal, is allowed in extended Chomsky normal form but not in the standard form. However, in this case, the non-terminals are mostly being processed with terminals, which might indicate that some non-terminals have epsilon productions or are left- or right-sensitive.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals are allowed to produce single terminals, which effectively means that a non-terminal can be replaced by a terminal symbol or two non-terminals.\n\nOkay, but let's not get too bogged down in that. Maybe I should approach this differently, perhaps by checking if the string can be parsed using the given grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt22 t22 t36 t13 t19 t13 t36 t13 t13 t19 t43 t11 t20 t24 t13 t39 t46 t36 t8 t46\n\nSo it's a sequence of 20 tokens.\n\nWe need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and each production splits a non-terminal into two symbols, the parsing should be possible with a leftmost derivation.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps it's better to see if we can find a way to split this string into the productions of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is small, perhaps it's possible to represent the possible strings as a regular language (though technically, the grammar defines a context-free language, but regular only if certain conditions are met), but we can check by trying to parse the string.\n\nLet's write down the string tokens in order:\n\nt22, t22, t36, t13, t19, t13, t36, t13, t13, t19, t43, t11, t20, t24, t13, t39, t46, t36, t8, t46.\n\nThat's 20 tokens.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the entire string would need to be the result of deriving two sequences from NT71 and NT73, concatenated.\n\nSo, the first token should be part of the NT71 derivation, and the second part from NT73.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Wait, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so the entire string is the derivation of NT71 followed by NT73. So probably, the string is built by first generating the string from NT71 and then from NT73.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is generated by NT71 producing a part, followed by NT73 producing another part. So, the string is split into two parts, one from NT71 and one from NT73, concatenated.\n\nBut let's check: the first token is t22, which is a terminal. Looking at the productions, t22 is only in NT4's production: NT4 \u2192 't22'. So perhaps NT4 can produce 't22'.\n\nSimilarly, let's see which terminals are in the string:\n\nt22, t22, t36, t13, t19, t13, t36, t13, t13, t19, t43, t11, t20, t24, t13, t39, t4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-245","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. My goal is to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's structured with non-terminals on the left and right-hand sides, using production rules. The start symbol is S, which produces NT71 and NT73. Then, each of these non-terminals breaks down into other non-terminals, eventually leading to some terminals. The terminals seem to be the words in the string we're evaluating, like 't39', 't2', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t39 t39 t2 t43 t19 t36 t2 t48 t11 t36 t8 t35 t11 t19 t8 t2 t24 t8 t20 t46 t35`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the trivial productions where a non-terminal is directly the terminal. So, each step in the derivation should replace a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals, until we reach the terminals.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which is the initial non-terminal. S produces NT71 and NT73. So any valid derivation must consist of sequences that split into these two, then each of those splits into their respective components, and so on, until all are replaced with terminals.\n\nLet me map out the structure of the string. The string is a series of terminals: the first few are t39, t39, t2, then t43, t19, t36, t2, t48, t11, t36, t8, t35, t11, t19, t8, t2, t24, t8, t20, t46, t35.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first symbol is t39. Let me check if any non-terminals directly produce t39. Looking through the rules, I see NT21 can produce t39 (as per the last rule on NT21 \u2192 't39').\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so S starts by producing two non-terminals. Then, each of those, if applicable, will be replaced by their respective rules.\n\nSo, when we start, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Now, let me check what NT71 and NT73 produce.\n\nLooking at NT71's productions: There isn't a direct production for NT71; I need to check. Wait, no, in the grammar provided, NT71 is not present. Let me look again. The given grammar only includes NT73, NT72, NT27, etc. Wait, does the grammar include NT71?\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar provided starts with S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, I need to see what NT71 and NT73 produce. But in the given rules, I don't see NT71 or NT72 directly being produced from other non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT73 is defined as NT63 NT42.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT71 NT73 would result in S expanding into NT71 followed by NT73, which then becomes NT63 NT42. So, that gives S \u2192 NT71 NT63 NT42.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to map this out.\n\nWait, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Now, to expand further, each of these non-terminals (NT71 and NT73) must be replaced. But looking at the rules, I don't see any production for NT71 or NT73 except as part of other rules.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT71 is not present on the left side of any production, which suggests it's a primary symbol that only appears on the left-hand side of the initial S production. So, perhaps NT71 doesn't have any further productions, which would mean it must be a terminal. But wait, I can check: are any of the non-terminals' productions ending up as terminals?\n\nLooking through the grammar, the productions end with some non-terminals like NT21, NT63, NT27, etc., which in turn produce terminals like 't2', 't39', etc.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the given grammar seems to have non-terminals that can be replaced until they reach terminals. So, the process is to derive the string step by step, breaking down each non-terminal until all are replaced with terminals.\n\nSo, to check if the string is in the grammar, I might need to look for a way to derive the string by appropriately breaking down each non-terminal into terminals via the given rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the string as a parse tree using the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to analyze the structure of the string. The string starts with two t39s. Looking at the grammar, the only way to get a 't39' is from NT21's production. So, t39 \u2192 NT21.\n\nSo, the first two t39s would come from NT21 appearing twice in the expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, it's t39 t39. So, that would correspond to NT21 NT21.\n\nBut looking at the initial production, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, how can the derivation go from S to having NT21s?\n\nI need to see how NT71 and NT73 can produce sequences that would eventually yield t39.\n\nLooking at NT71: in the given grammar, is there a production for NT71? It seems not. Because the grammar as provided doesn't have any rule starting with NT71 on the left. So, unless NT71 is defined elsewhere, it must be a terminal. But I don't see it in the given rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT71 appears as the second symbol after S, but there is no production rule for NT71. So, perhaps NT71 only appears as a leaf node in the expansion and is a terminal. So, then S would produce NT71, which is t39, and NT73, which we can expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's list all the non-terminals and see their productions.\n\nHere's the list of Non-terminals and their productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 or NT21 NT2 or NT 't19'\n- NT4 \u2192 NT 't22' or NT 't35' or NT 't43' etc.\n- NT21 \u2192 't39' or NT4 or NT20\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 't11' or 't48'\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 or NT63 etc.\n- NT63 \u2192 't2' or ... etc.\n- And more non-terminals as given.\n\nWait, so NT71 is a non-terminal, but in the production rules, it's only used in S \u2192 NT71 NT73. It doesn't have any further productions defined. So, that suggests that NT71 is a leaf node in the derivation tree, meaning it's a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT71 NT73; NT71 is 't39' (from the rules, looking for rules where production leads to terminal). Wait, looking through the rules, do any of them produce 't39'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT71 \u2192 't39', but perhaps via another NT. Wait, perhaps NT21 \u2192 t39.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT71 NT73 would produce two non-terminals, NT71 and NT73. If NT71 is a terminal, it would produce its corresponding terminal. But it's unclear unless I see a production for NT71.\n\nWait, perhaps NT71 is only present as a left-hand side in some production, but since none of the rules have NT71 on the left except S, that means NT71 isn't further expanded. So, NT71 must be a terminal.\n\nWait, but the only possible way is that when S is expanded into NT71 and NT73, the NT71 is a terminal, and NT73 is further expanded. Or if NT71 doesn't have a production, it's a terminal.\n\nWait, but in standard CNF, a non-terminal must have a production with exactly two non-terminals. So, if a non-terminal doesn't have any production, it can't be in the grammar unless it's a terminal. Therefore, in this case, NT71 appears only as a child of S, so it must be a terminal.\n\nIf that's the case, then S \u2192 NT71 ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-239","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals and productions. The string given is \"t10 t22 t20 t46 t39 t35 t35 t2 t24 t13 t19 t48 t22 t8 t36 t39 t24 t24 t10 t48 t24\". \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production is either generating a terminal or two non-terminals. That helps because the parse trees will have a certain structure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT71 and NT73. So, the string should start with the productions of NT71 and NT73. Let me see what NT71 and NT73 are:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\nNT71 is in the string, so looking at NT71's productions, it's NT35 and NT48. But wait, in the grammar, NT71 only appears in the start symbol S, so maybe I got that wrong. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, right, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so NT71 and NT73 are the immediate children of S.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So S directly produces the concatenation of NT71 and NT73. Therefore, the string should start with the start of NT71 and NT73.\n\nBut looking at the productions for NT71 and NT73:\n\nWait, actually, I need to check if NT71 and NT73 are terminals or non-terminals. From the grammar, NT71 is on the left-hand side of S, so it's a non-terminal. Similarly, NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals.\n\nSo, each of these non-terminals will produce a sequence of symbols until they reach terminals. So, let's trace the parsing process.\n\nGiven the string, let's try to parse it as per the grammar. Each production can contribute to a part of the string.\n\nBut parsing manually might be tricky. Maybe we can break down the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me list the productions again for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | NT21 NT35? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT35? No, in the given grammar, NT54 has two productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT35?\n\nNo, actually, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar has several NT54 productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 \u2192 't19'\n\nWait, that's correct. So NT54 can produce either two non-terminals (NT21 and NT87) or the terminal 't19'.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have their own productions.\n\nThe string is: t10 t22 t20 t46 t39 t35 t35 t2 t24 t13 t19 t48 t22 t8 t36 t39 t24 t24 t10 t48 t24.\n\nSo, 21 elements in the string, all terminals.\n\nTo parse this, I can look for possible ways to split the string into substrings that correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S, which produces NT71 and NT73. So the string must be a concatenation of the strings from NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo, let's first try to parse the part before and after a split point. Let's think about the possible split points.\n\nBut that might take a while. Maybe a better approach is to look for non-terminals and see if their productions can generate parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT73: it produces NT63 NT42 or something else? Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nWait, NT73's productions are only NT63 NT42. Not sure if that's right. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, let me find all NT73 productions. From the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT73 has only one production: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. Wait, no, actually, checking again:\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nSo NT73 can only produce NT63 and NT42.\n\nSo NT73 is a non-terminal that can only be expanded into NT63 and NT42. So that's our first step.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the string must be the concatenation of NT71's expansion and NT742's expansion. Wait, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, not NT42. So NT73's expansion is followed by NT63 and NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is the concatenation of NT71's derived string and NT73's derived string. So, we can split the string into two parts, one for NT71 and the other for NT73.\n\nBut how? Let's look for possible splits.\n\nLet me see the string: t10 t22 t20 t46 t39 t35 t35 t2 t24 t13 t19 t48 t22 t8 t36 t39 t24 t24 t10 t48 t24.\n\nHmm, looking at the possible end of NT71 and the start of NT73.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the productions of NT73. Since NT73 is NT63 NT42, which are non-terminals themselves.\n\nWait, NT63 and NT42. Let's find their productions.\n\nLooking at NT63's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT10 | 't2' (maybe that's not correct; let's check again. Wait, looking at the grammar, for NT63, do I see anything else?)\n\nWait, looking back: The grammar provided has several NT63 productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't2' | 't13' | 't10' | 't10' | 't13' etc. Wait, no, according to the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal, I think I need to list all productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | 't19' | 't2' | 't35' | 't2' | 't21' | 't39' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps that's too messy. Alternatively, let me try to see if the string can be split into parts.\n\nAnother approach is to work top-down.\n\nStarting with S, which must produce NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo the string is a concatenation of NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo, the whole string is [NT71's expansion] [NT73's expansion].\n\nTherefore, if I can find a split point in the string where NT71 produces the first part and NT73 produces the second part, that would work.\n\nLet me try to find possible split points.\n\nThe string: 21 elements.\n\nLet me see if I can split after some elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each non-terminal's production can generate a substring.\n\nBut that might take a long time.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps check the start productions and see how they can generate the initial part.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nSo, let's see what NT71 can produce.\n\nWait, in the grammar, does NT71 appear on the left-hand side of any production? Looking at all productions, I see that NT71 is only on the left side of S. So NT71 is only present in S's production. So NT71 can only be expanded through S's production.\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Did I correctly note all the productions? Let me see again.\n\nIn the grammar, only S \u2192 NT71 NT73 is N71's production.\n\nSo NT71's own non-terminals are not present. So the only way to get symbols from NT71 is through productions that ultimately derive into terminals.\n\nSimilarly for NT73.\n\nSo, for NT71 and NT73, their productions lead into other non-terminals, which eventually lead to terminals.\n\nTherefore, each non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-250","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of several production rules. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Each rule is in the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for CNF. The start symbol is S, which produces NT71 NT73. From there, each NT (non-terminals) further breaks down into other NTs and eventually terminals (tX). The terminals are words like 't8', 't19', etc., and the non-terminals are all the NTs with numbers.\n\nThe string to check is: `t43 t2 t11 t2 t20 t46 t35 t13 t2 t35 t2 t24 t39 t10 t48 t24 t2 t24 t22 t24 t10 t20`.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a standard recursive descent or shift-reduce parser. But since I have to do this manually, I'll try to see the possible derivation steps.\n\nStarting with the string, the first two elements are t43 and t2. Now, looking at the grammar, I should see if any rule directly produces these. From NT71, the production is NT73, which is an NT27. But wait, NT71 \u2192 NT73, and NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So S \u2192 NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So S generates two tokens, each being a non-terminal.\n\nWait, I think I got that wrong. Let me recheck: S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Then NT71 \u2192 NT73 (from the given rules, I see that S produces NT71 and NT73. Let me look again: S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Then NT71 \u2192 NT73. So S can be considered as NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, and then I have to break down each of those.\n\nBut wait, no, I think S initially generates NT71 and NT73. Then each of those can produce further. So the entire string should be a sequence of the productions leading to the terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I should find the parse tree. Let's break down the string into individual tokens:\n\nt43, t2, t11, t2, t20, t46, t35, t13, t2, t35, t2, t24, t39, t10, t48, t24, t2, t24, t22, t24, t10, t20.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT71 NT73. So the initial structure is a sequence of NT71 and NT73. Each NT71 and NT73 produce two non-terminals each.\n\nWait, no. Let me make sure: S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Then NT71 \u2192 NT73. So the initial structure is S: NT71 NT73 which is N1 N2 where N1 is NT71 \u2192 NT73, and N2 is NT73. So the entire string should be a sequence of N1 and N2 and their further expansions.\n\nWait, that can't be right because then S would produce N1 N2, each of which breaks down. So perhaps the string is composed by expanding S, each step breaking down non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of the fully reduced non-terminals, but each non-terminal must be expanded until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me think in terms of the string provided. The string has 21 tokens. Let's see how that aligns with the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to build the parse tree step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces two symbols: either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in our case, all productions have only two non-terminals except perhaps for some? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT21 \u2192 't43'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't10'\n- NT27 \u2192 't20'\n- NT71 \u2192 't48'\n- NT63 \u2192 't13'\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nI notice that some NT rules produce terminals, others produce other NTs. The goal is to find a sequence of these that produces the given string.\n\nLet me consider the string as a sequence: the first part is t43, which must come from a non-terminal that produces t43. Looking through the rules, I see that NT42 can produce t46, t2, etc., but not t43. Wait, let's look at NT42's rules:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, and NT42 also has a production to 't46' via another rule: wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, and also NT42 \u2192 't46' as another option. So yes, NT42 can be a terminal 't46' in one of its productions.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t43. So perhaps that t43 must come from another non-terminal? Let me see.\n\nLooking for any NT that produces t43 as a terminal. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't43' except in one case, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, checking the NT4's: NT4 \u2192 't22', NT4 \u2192 't35', and others. NT21 \u2192 't39' and 't43'. Oh, yes! NT21 has the production NT21 \u2192 't43'. So in the rules, NT21 can produce 't43' as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, for other terminals:\n\n- t2 appears in NT27 \u2192 't20', but perhaps other NTs as well.\n- t48 appears in NT71 \u2192 't48' and NT27 \u2192 't48' in another rule.\n- t10 appears in NT63 \u2192 't10' and others.\n\nSo, the string starts with t43, which must come from NT21 \u2192 't43'. So the first part of the string is t43. That would mean we have something like NT21 \u2192 't43', and this must be part of the overall expansion.\n\nSo, let's say the string starts with NT21 being expanded to 't43', and then the next part must follow that NT's expansion. Wait, but in CNF, each production produces two symbols, so perhaps the NT21 is part of a larger structure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this with a bottom-up approach or to see if the string can be parsed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step, starting from the root.\n\nLet me consider each symbol in the string and see where they can fit into the grammar.\n\n1. The first token is 't43'. Looking at the grammar, 't43' is produced by NT21 \u2192 't43'. So that must be part of the expansion.\n\n2. After NT21 (which gives 't43'), we have 't2'. Where can 't2' come from? It's produced by NT27 \u2192 't20', but no. Looking at the rules: NT54 \u2192 't42' as well. Wait, no, 't2' is one of the options for NT21.\n\nWait, let me see NT21's rules: NT21 \u2192 't39' and 't43'. So after 't43', the next token is 't2', which must come from NT21 as well, but that can only produce 't39' or 't43'. So that's a problem because the next token is 't2', which isn't produced by NT21. So maybe the 't43' is part of a larger structure.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the initial structure isn't just S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

NT27 \u2192 't11'\n16. NT33 \u2192 't11'\n17. NT4 \u2192 't35' (this is another production for NT4 to 't35')\n18. NT21 \u2192 't43'\n19. NT33 \u2192 't48'\n20. NT42 \u2192 't36'\n21. NT63 \u2192 't13'\n22. NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, looking at some of these, I see that multiple productions can lead to the same terminal. For example, NT54 has four productions: one to 't19', 't2', and two others as well. Similarly, NT4 has two productions: one to 't22' and another to 't35'.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t46 t48 t35 t2 t19 t11 t2 t43 t36 t2 t24 t13 t11 t11 t13 t10 t39 t48 t46 t11 t13 t11`\n\nI think the strategy here is to try to parse the string from the start symbol S and see if it can derive this string step by step.\n\nStep 1: The start symbol is S, which produces NT71 and NT73. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the strings derived from NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't46', so let's check where 't46' comes from. From the grammar, I see that NT42 \u2192 't46' (among other productions), so perhaps NT71 is involved in producing 't46'.\n\nWait, NT71 isn't a non-terminal in the given grammar. Oh wait, that must mean NT71 is a terminal? But that\u2019s a bit unusual. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So NT71 must be a non-terminal because otherwise, the grammar would only produce terminals. So perhaps I missed some productions for NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait looking back at the grammar given, I only see rules for several NTs but not NT71 or NT73. Does that mean they have empty productions or only derive to something? Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine that.\n\nWait, no, in the list, I don't see any production for NT71 or NT73 on the right-hand side. That might mean they have only one production each, perhaps to some non-terminals or maybe they\u2019re terminals. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, looking at the list, NT71 and NT73 are on the left sides, and their right sides are combinations of other NTs. So perhaps NT71 and NT73 have their own productions that lead to terminals.\n\nBut I don't see any production for NT71 or NT73 in the given rules. So maybe in the actual grammar, they have some productions leading to terminals, but they\u2019re not listed here? That can\u2019t be, because the user provided the entire grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me list all the grammar rules again carefully:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n2. NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n3. NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n4. NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n5. NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n6. NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n7. NT87 \u2192 't8'\n8. NT54 \u2192 't19'\n9. NT42 \u2192 't46'\n10. NT54 \u2192 't2'\n11. NT4 \u2192 't22'\n12. NT21 \u2192 't39'\n13. NT63 \u2192 't2'\n14. NT73 \u2192 't24'\n15. NT27 \u2192 't11'\n16. NT33 \u2192 't11'\n17. NT4 \u2192 't35'\n18. NT21 \u2192 't43'\n19. NT33 \u2192 't48'\n20. NT42 \u2192 't36'\n21. NT63 \u2192 't13'\n22. NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nSo, looking at this, S must produce NT71 and NT73. Both NT71 and NT73 must produce sequences of terminals, but according to the rules, they don't immediately do that. Instead, they both break down into other non-terminals. So for the string to be valid, each of these must produce the corresponding segments.\n\nFor example, the string starts with 't46'. Looking at the grammar, 't46' comes from NT42 (from production 9: NT42 \u2192 't46'). So the first part of the string must come from NT71 producing something that includes 't46', and the second part from NT73 producing the rest.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't46', and then has 't48', 't35', etc. Let me think about how the entire string is structured in the grammar.\n\nThe S rule is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the string is the concatenation of what NT71 produces and what NT73 produces.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should correspond to what NT71 can produce, and the second part to what NT73 can produce.\n\nLooking at the provided string, the first part is: `t46 t48 t35 t2 t19`. Then comes `t11 t2 t43 t36 t2 t24 ...` etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string backwards to see if it can generate from the top-down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if each part of the string can be generated by the productions.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts, corresponding to NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo the full string is:\n\nt46 t48 t35 t2 t19 t11 t2 t43 t36 t2 t24 t13 t11 t11 t13 t10 t39 t48 t46 t11 t13 t11\n\nI think that's 22 tokens. Let's see, since S \u2192 NT71 NT73, each of NT71 and NT73 produce a certain number of tokens.\n\nLet me try to figure out how many tokens each part should produce. Since it's a left-associative, each non-terminal in the chain will contribute tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for a possible parse from the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that since the string is quite long, it might be the case that certain non-terminals can generate multiple tokens, but given the grammar, perhaps some tokens are in a chain.\n\nWait, another approach: look for sequences in the string that could be associated with certain productions.\n\nFor example, 't46' must come from NT42: production 9 says NT42 \u2192 't46'.\n\nThen, before that, 't48 t35 t2 t19' would be the remainder of the first part coming from NT71.\n\nWait, but NT71 is on the left side in the S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So NT71 must derive something that starts with 't46 t48 t35 t2 t19' and produces that.\n\nWait, but from the grammar rules, NT71 isn't a non-terminal on the left of any production, unless perhaps through other rules. Wait, actually, the productions given don't have NT71 as a terminal or a non-terminal. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, looking back at"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-266","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the grammar and the string are.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> terminal, where B and C are non-terminals. That should help because it simplifies the analysis a bit. Each production splits the non-terminal into two other parts, which could be other non-terminals or terminals. My string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like t2, t35, and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t2 t35 t13 t22 t2 t10 t46 t10 t13 t8 t48 t46 t48 t43 t11 t2 t20 t35 t11 t35 t13 t10 t11`.\n\nThat's quite a long string, 21 elements. So I need to see if this string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLet's list out all the nodes and their dependencies based on the productions. The top-level is S -> NT71 NT73. So S produces two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. Each of these must derive a string, and when concatenated, they should form the given string.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT71 -> NT63 NT33\n\nWait, NT63 and NT42 are used in both NT73 and NT71. Let's see what the productions for these are:\n\n- NT63 -> NT2, NT10, etc. Specifically, NT63 -> NT2, NT10, etc., but looking at the rules, NT63 can produce t2, t10, t13, etc., but wait, does NT63 have multiple productions? Let me check the original grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar is listed as:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87 | NT42 | NT2 | NT87\nWait, no, looking back, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19' (I think this is a terminal production)\nSimilarly, other NTs like NT42, NT63, etc., have productions that sometimes are terminals.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nNT54 -> 't21' is one production and another NT87 -> 't8' and so on.\n\nWait, let me reorganize the structure:\n\nEach non-terminal leads to two possible productions, which could be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I should create a parsing tree or see how the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reverse-engineer the string by seeing which productions could generate it.\n\nThe string has 21 elements, which suggests that if each production of a non-terminal leads to two terminal symbols, the number of steps would be 20 (since for n symbols, there are n-1 productions). But since some of the productions may lead to more non-terminals, it's a bit more involved.\n\nWait, another approach: build a parse tree bottom-up, ensuring that each step combines two symbols according to the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, given that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parsing process splits a non-terminal into two parts, each of which can be a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be paired into chunks that match the grammar's productions.\n\nBut given that the string is a sequence of 21 symbols, I need to see if there's a way to group these into a structure starting from S.\n\nLet me see what the starting non-terminal S can produce. S -> NT71 NT73. So, when S is used, it must expand into two non-terminals, NT71 and NT73, which then each will expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT71 and NT73:\n\n- NT71 -> NT63 NT33\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nSo each of these NT71 and NT73 expands into NT63 followed by NT33 or NT42, respectively.\n\nNow, NT63 and NT42 each expand further:\n\n- NT63 can produce 't2', 't10', etc. From the given rules, I see NT63 has rules like NT63 -> NT2, but also NT63 -> NT10, etc. Wait, but let me check again. Looking at the given grammar:\n\nNT63 has several productions. Let me tabulate them:\n\nFrom the input, I see lines like:\nNT63 -> NT2\nNT63 -> NT10\nNT63 -> NT13\nNT63 -> NT90\nSo four productions: leading to NT2, NT10, NT13, NT90.\n\nSo when NT63 is encountered, it can expand into four different possibilities. Each of these will then have their own productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has the following productions:\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT42 -> NT36 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT42? No, wait, let me check the user's input:\n\nNo, looking back, the user wrote:\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> ... wait, no, let me check the original input correctly.\n\nThe user's grammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19' (terminal)\nNT42 -> 't46' (terminal)\nNT54 -> 't2' (terminal)\nWait, I think I got confused before.\n\nWait, the user's grammar starts with S -> NT71 NT73, then NT73 -> NT63 NT42.\n\nFor NT27: NT27 goes to NT54 NT4.\n\nFor NT42: NT42 goes to NT36 NT27, or is it? Let me look again.\n\nActually, looking at the original input, each NT's productions are on new lines, but it's a bit messy.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) usually involves productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has production rules starting with S, and I need to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So S splits into two non-terminals, NT71 and NT73. Each of these must be expanded using their respective rules.\n\nLet me write down the provided string: `t35 t22 t43 t11 t35 t19 t22 t35 t24 t10 t48 t13 t19 t46 t20 t46 t39 t36 t11 t43 t43 t48 t20`.\n\nThat's 21 tokens, separated by spaces. Each token is a terminal, I believe, except for the non-terminals like NT71, NT73, etc.\n\nWait, the grammar only has NTs and S as production heads. So the string must consist of a sequence of terminals that can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string starting from S, using the grammar rules to split the string into parts that match each production.\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the entire string should be the concatenation of two parts, one derived from NT71 and the other from NT73.\n\nSo I can split the string into two parts at some point, say after the i-th token, and check if the first part can be generated by NT71 and the second by NT73.\n\nLet me try to outline the possible split points. The string has 21 tokens, so possible split points are after 1, 2, ..., up to 20 tokens. But not all splits will make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a top-down parsing approach would help, but since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent might be feasible.\n\nAnother approach is to represent the string as a list and see if I can derive it step by step.\n\nLet me list the string: [t35, t22, t43, t11, t35, t19, t22, t35, t24, t10, t48, t13, t19, t46, t20, t46, t39, t36, t11, t43, t43, t48, t20]\n\nWait, no, that's 22 elements. Wait, the user provided 21 tokens. Let me recount: t35, t22, t43, t11, t35, t19, t22, t35, t24, t10, t48, t13, t19, t46, t20, t46, t39, t36, t11, t43, t43, t48, t20. Yeah, that's 21 tokens.\n\nSo the string is 21 tokens long. Since S \u2192 NT71 NT73, we split into two parts, let's say part A (from NT71) and part B (from NT73), with the total number of tokens in A plus B equal to 21.\n\nWe'll need to try possible splits.\n\nNow, each non-terminal in the grammar has production rules.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. This should make parsing a bit easier, but I need to keep that in mind.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar so I don't lose track:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nThat's a bit of a lengthy grammar. Now, the string to check is: `t46 t39 t8 t20 t19 t43 t2 t43 t46 t11 t35 t48 t35 t36 t36 t35 t2 t2 t43 t11 t46 t36 t11 t35`.\n\nWow, that's a lot of tokens. I think I should break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT71 NT73. So S -> NT71 NT73. So the first step is that we have these two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t46. Let me see if that's generated by NT71 or NT73.\n\nNT71's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT73 -> NT63 NT42. Let me see if t46 is generated by NT71. So, I should look at NT71's productions. Wait, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT71 having any further productions. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nAnd then in the grammar, I don't see any productions for NT71 except as the start symbol. So NT71 must directly produce t48, because looking at the grammar, NT71 -> 't48' is a production. So if NT71 is 't48', and the first token is t46, that doesn't match. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the string starts with t46, but NT71 produces 't48'. So that can't be right. Did I look correctly?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nSo wait, NT42 can directly produce 't46'. So if we have NT42 as a non-terminal, it can be replaced by 't46'.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 can be broken down into NT63 and NT42. If I have NT73, it's NT63 followed by NT42.\n\nWait, but 't46' is a terminal, so in the string, t46 would have to come from a non-terminal that expands directly to t46. Or wait, no, because in Chomsky normal form, productions are two non-terminals or a terminal. So 't46' must be a terminal, so it's terminal, right? So in that case, the only way to get t46 is if the non-terminal directly produces it. Looking at the grammar, yes, NT42 can produce 't46', according to the production NT42 -> 't46'.\n\nSo let's try to see how the string can be generated.\n\nThe string is: t46 t39 t8 t20 t19 t43 t2 t43 t46 t11 t35 t48 t35 t36 t36 t35 t2 t2 t43 t11 t46 t36 t11 t35.\n\nStarting from S: produce NT71 and NT73. So the entire string must be the concatenation of two parts: the string derived from NT71 and the string derived from NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t46. So that must come from NT71. But wait, NT71's only production is 't48' because looking at the grammar, after S -> NT71 NT73, I don't see any other productions for NT71 except it being the start symbol. Wait, no, actually, S is just NT71 NT73. NT71 is a non-terminal, right? So the start symbol S generates two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. So in the string, first we have the string generated by NT71 followed by the string generated by NT73.\n\nNow, looking at the first token t46, is that from NT71? But NT71's only production is 't48', so t46 cannot be generated by NT71. That would mean the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first token t46 can't come from NT71.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps the first part generated by NT71 is more than one token? Let me see: NT71 is 't48', so if NT71 directly produces 't48', then the string starts with t48, but in our case, it starts with t46.\n\nSo this suggests that the string cannot be generated because the first symbol is t46, which cannot be produced by NT71. Therefore, my initial thought is that the answer is No. But wait, let me check if I'm missing anything.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar allows for NT71 to somehow produce multiple tokens, not just 't48'. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any rules that expand NT71 into more than one symbol. So NT71 directly produces 't48', meaning the first symbol of the string must be 't48'. However, the given string starts with 't46', which is a different symbol, so this would mean that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the grammar. Let me go through it again carefully.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT42, yes, it can produce 't46'. But NT71's productions, according to the grammar, only have S -> NT71 NT73. There's no rule that expands NT71 further. So NT71 is a terminal? Wait, no. In Chomsky normal form, all non-terminals have productions that either go to two non-terminals or two terminals. Wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the rules are like that. So NT71 is a non-terminal that only has a production S -> NT71 NT73. Wait, no, actually, the grammar is given with all the non-terminals, but perhaps S is the only non-terminal. Wait, no, the start symbol is S, which is a non-terminal. All other symbols seem to be terminals except for the NTs, like NT71, NT73, etc. Wait, no, they are all non-terminals except for the terminals 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSo in this case, NT71 is a non-terminal that can only produce S, which is also a non-terminal, which then can be broken down further.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because S is the start symbol and is on the left-hand side of the production. But in the grammar, the rules are all the other non-terminals on the left-hand side. So S is a non-terminal that produces NT71 and NT73.\n\nBut NT71 is another non-terminal, so we have to see what NT71 produces. Wait, the given grammar doesn't list any productions for NT71 except for the fact that S produces NT71 and NT73. So for NT71, the only way is through other rules. But since the grammar wasn't provided for NT71, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, I think I might have made a mistake.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, but I think in this grammar, each symbol is a terminal, so each production eventually reduces to a terminal.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with the start symbol S. Looking at the productions:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nSo, S splits into NT71 and NT73. Each of these needs to be expanded according to their production rules. Let's analyze the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t48 t46 t46 t35 t11 t11 t46 t2 t20 t43 t36 t39 t35 t20 t43 t48 t22 t39 t11 t39 t39 t39 t2 t39.\n\nI'll write this as a list for easier processing:\n1. t48\n2. t46\n3. t46\n4. t35\n5. t11\n6. t11\n7. t46\n8. t2\n9. t20\n10. t43\n11. t36\n12. t39\n13. t35\n14. t20\n15. t43\n16. t48\n17. t22\n18. t39\n19. t11\n20. t39\n21. t39\n22. t39\n23. t2\n24. t39\n\nWait, that's 24 tokens. Since the grammar has only two symbols (S, NT73, NT71, etc.), each production step doubles the symbols or replaces them with terminals. But let's check the number of symbols each step would produce.\n\nStarting with S -> NT71 NT73 (2 symbols)\nEach NT symbol will be expanded according to its production rules. Each production either replaces a symbol with two symbols or a terminal. Since all are non-terminals until they reach terminals, the number of symbols will eventually reach the length of the string. However, 2^k should equal 24, but 2^4=16 and 2^5=32, so 24 isn't a power of 2, which is a problem. But wait, maybe the grammar can have more than two levels of expansions, but the string's length must be a power of two because each non-terminal splits into two. But here, 24 isn't a power of two, which suggests the string might not be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, that might not be the case because even if the string is longer, the grammar can produce strings that have more symbols in intermediates, but the generated string itself must have a number of terminals that can be derived through some sequence of productions. However, the string's length is 24, which is not a power of two. So that's a red flag. Because, for a CFG in CNF, the length of any generated string must be a power of two. So if the string length isn't a power of two, it can't be generated.\n\nWait, but that's only for non-recursive grammars? Or is that a general rule? Let me think. Each production in CNF replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. Starting from one symbol, each step doubles the count. So after k steps, you have 2^k symbols. So any derived terminal string must have a length that's a power of two. Since 24 isn't a power of two (the closest is 16 and 32), the string length is invalid, meaning it can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's a way to get 24 symbols through some combination. Each non-terminal expands into two symbols, but each symbol can expand further if they are non-terminals. So perhaps the number of terminals generated can be more than 2^k, depending on how many layers you have. Wait, no. Because each non-terminal at each step can only produce two symbols, whether they are terminal or non-terminal. So for example, if you have S -> A B, then A and B each can lead to two symbols, but if, say, A -> t, and B -> C D, then you end up with 3 symbols (t, C, D). Wait, no, because each production must split non-terminals into two symbols, which can themselves be terminals or non-terminals. So the total number of symbols after each step can vary as long as each step increases it by some amount, but the exact count depends on how many non-terminals are left.\n\nBut the total number of terminals in the derived string must be such that it's the sum of all the leaf nodes which are terminals. However, the problem is that for each step, the number of non-terminals can vary, but the total number of leaves (terminals) must satisfy a certain condition. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be represented as an application of productions that result in 24 symbols. Since each production step reduces the count of non-terminals by some amount but increases terminals by others, perhaps it's possible. But earlier reasoning about the length suggests it's impossible because 24 isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the initial start symbol. S has length 1. Each step can replace a non-terminal with two symbols, increasing the count by 1 each time a non-terminal is split. For example, after one expansion, S splits into 2 symbols (non-terminals). Then, each of those can split, leading to 4, or 3 if one splits and the other doesn't. Wait, but each non-terminal must split into two. So each step, the number of non-terminals could vary, but each non-terminal that is a symbol will split into two, so the total number of non-terminals could vary. The end result is that the number of terminals plus non-terminals could change differently.\n\nBut I think the key is that the number of terminals in the final string must be equal to the number of times a production produces a terminal. Each production that ends in a terminal contributes 1 to the total, while those that produce two non-terminals contribute 2. But since each production is A -> BC, if B and C are non-terminals, they will each be replaced by something, possibly producing terminals.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the length of the string must be a power of two because each step is a binary split. Wait, but I think that is only when all the non-terminals are replaced immediately, leading to a binary tree with depth k, producing 2^k terminals. But that's only for when all splits happen at each level, leading to a maximum number of terminals. If some splits occur before others, you can have more complex numbers.\n\nWait, but the key point is that for any CFG in CNF, the number of symbols in the derived string (terminals) must be >=1 and <= 2^k for some k. But in this case, the string length is 24, which is not a power of two, but perhaps it can be formed through a combination of splits. For example, starting with S: 1 symbol. Then each non-terminal splits into two. So after the first split, you have 2 symbols. Each of those could split further, but if some split immediately and others not, the count can increase by varying amounts.\n\nWait, but that's complicating it. Let me think of it as a binary tree. Each non-terminal is a node that splits into two children. The leaves are terminals. The number of leaves is 2^d where d is the depth of the tree. So any string of terminals must have a length that is a power of two. Therefore, if the string's length isn't a power of two, it cannot be generated. Since 24 isn't a power of two, the answer is No.\n\nSo regardless of the specific productions and expansions, the string's length is 24, which is not a power of two, hence it cannot be generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no: According to the user's message, the productions are:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as:\n\n```S -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, so each NT has multiple productions, some of which are terminal symbols, others non-terminal.\n\nFor example, NT73 can expand to NT63 NT42. Let's see what those produce.\n\nFirst, let's build a parse tree starting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nSo, NT71 expands, and NT73 expands.\n\nLooking at NT71's productions. Wait, in the given grammar, does NT71 have any production listed? No, I don't see it. The user listed various NTs, but I need to check if NT71 is a non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, according to the given grammar, all the non-terminals are the capital NTs like NT73, NT27, etc. So, S is the start symbol, and in the initial productions, perhaps NT71 and NT73 are also non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the given productions, none list NT71 as a non-terminal. Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake because, in the initial production, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so NT71 must be a non-terminal because it's on the right side.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, NT71 is not listed as a production. So perhaps the user intended to list all relevant non-terminals? Alternatively, perhaps NT71 has a production that's missing. Wait, maybe I need to check all productions again.\n\nWait, the initial productions given by the user include NT73, NT27, etc. But S \u2192 NT71 NT73, which suggests that S can produce two non-terminals, NT71 and NT73. So, the grammar should include NT71 being a non-terminal with some productions.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see NT71 listed as a non-terminal. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and NT71 is actually a terminal? That's possible if 't71' is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but the string has t71? Looking at the string, I don't see t71, but t48 is repeated a few times. Let me check the string again: It's `t11 t48 t24 t13 t22 t20 t48 t13 t46 t48 t22 t36 t19 t48 t13 t11 t36 t11 t22 t35 t13 t2 t13 t20 t13`.\n\nWait, in the string, the last part is 't2 t13 t20 t13'. So, perhaps the parser can end with a terminal, but the start symbol S \u2192 NT71 NT73 must expand into the entire string.\n\nBut S is the start symbol, so the entire string must be generated by S. Therefore, the total length should correspond to how S expands.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the generated string would be the concatenation of what NT71 produces and what NT73 produces.\n\nSo, in order for the string to be generated, we need to parse it as NT71 producing the first part and NT73 producing the second part, then concatenate them.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps it's divided into two parts: first part corresponds to NT71's expansion, and the second corresponds to NT73's expansion.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nString: t11 t48 t24 t13 t22 t20 t48 t13 t46 t48 t22 t36 t19 t48 t13 t11 t36 t11 t22 t35 t13 t2 t13 t20 t13\n\nLet's check if the entire string can be split into two parts, each matching NT71 and NT73 respectively.\n\nFirst, NT71's production is perhaps t48, as S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, if NT71 produces a terminal 't48', which is in the string as the 4th token? Wait, let me index the tokens:\n\n1: t11\n2: t48\n3: t24\n4: t13\n5: t22\n6: t20\n7: t48\n8: t13\n9: t46\n10: t48\n11: t22\n12: t36\n13: t19\n14: t48\n15: t13\n16: t11\n17: t36\n18: t11\n19: t22\n20: t35\n21: t13\n22: t2\n23: t13\n24: t20\n25: t13\n\nSo, 25 tokens in total.\n\nWait, this seems like the number is significant.

It's essential to see which non-terminals produce sequences of these 'tN' strings.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nSo S would generate two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73.\n\nThen, NT73 expands to NT63 and NT42, each of which will need to produce a sequence leading to the 't' strings.\n\nLooking at NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, and then each of those can be broken down further.\n\nI think the key here is to construct a parse tree for the given string, starting from S and trying to match the string step by step.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts to see if it fits the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t8 t20 t13 t22 t19 t11 t48 t43 t19 t43 t35 t48 t8 t11 t22 t36 t39 t19 t20 t20 t13 t2 t8 t19 t8.\n\nThat's quite long, but let me see if I can parse it by grouping into the production rules.\n\nFirst, S is NT71 NT73.\n\nSo the string should start with NT71 generating the first part and NT73 the second part.\n\nFrom the string, the first few tokens are t8, t20, t13... Let's see if that matches NT73.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nNT63 can expand into different options:\n\nLooking at NT63 productions: 6. NT63 \u2192 t2, 13. NT63 \u2192 t10, 24. NT63 \u2192 t13.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT63 has these productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT90 NT33, which is a non-terminal pair, and also NT63 \u2192 t2, NT63 \u2192 t10, and NT63 \u2192 t13.\n\nWait, no, in production 6: NT63 \u2192 t2, production 13: NT63 \u2192 t10, and production 24: NT63 \u2192 t13.\n\nSo when NT63 is derived, it can be any of t2, t10, or t13, but in the string, the first 't' is t8, which is part of NT73.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that can't be right because if NT63 can only produce t2, t10, or t13, then how do we get t8 in the string?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake because in production 6, NT63 \u2192 t2, but in production 24, NT63 \u2192 t13. But t8 is a different terminal and doesn't appear in any NT63 production. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the productions.\n\nLooking again:\n\nProductions starting with NT63:\n\n6. NT63 \u2192 t2\n\n13. NT63 \u2192 t10\n\n24. NT63 \u2192 t13\n\nSo NT63 cannot produce t8.

Let me double-check.\n\nThe string starts with t8, t20, etc. So the first symbol is t8, which would have to come from NT73, which expands into NT63 and NT42. But according to the productions, NT63 can't produce t8. Therefore, it's impossible for NT73 to produce t8 as the first symbol.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first token t8 cannot be produced by any expansion of NT73.\n\nWait, but that's a crucial point. The production NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42 allows the first symbols to be the results of NT63's expansion, but since NT63 can't produce t8, the string can't start with t8.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string cannot be generated by the given grammar because NT73 cannot produce t8 as its first symbol.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-287","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check whether it's generated by this grammar. Alright, let's try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of several non-terminals and terminals. The starting symbol is S, and S expands into NT71 and NT73. So S -> NT71 NT73. That means the string we're evaluating must be built up by the expansions of these NTs.\n\nLooking at the NTs, each of them has two productions, either splitting into two other NTs or being a terminal. For example, NT73 -> NT63 NT42, and so on. So each of these non-terminals eventually will resolve into a terminal. The string we need to evaluate must consist of a sequence of these terminals.\n\nThe string given is: t13 t24 t43 t39 t35 t22 t22 t24 t11 t8 t19 t35 t19 t48 t22 t35 t24 t2 t19 t39 t48 t39 t19 t46 t22 t2.\n\nThat's a long string with 24 tokens. I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting with S.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So, any valid string must have a derivation where each step generates a leftmost expansion, and the entire string must consist of terminals with no non-terminals left.\n\nOne approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is small, maybe I can look for the possible expansions.\n\nLooking at S, which is NT71 NT73. So the string must be the combination of the expansion of NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo the string is split into two parts: NT71's expansion and NT73's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if the first part ends with t24 or something that makes sense with NT71.\n\nWait, actually, since NT71 and NT73 are separate, maybe the string is a concatenation of the two parts from NT71's expansion and NT73's expansion.\n\nLet me look at each NT:\n\nLooking for NT71: In the grammar, what is NT71's expansion? Wait, in the given grammar, I see S -> NT71 NT73, but I don't see NT71 or NT73's expansions beyond that.

So where does NT71 expand to? Because looking through the list, I don't see a production for NT71. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let's check again.\n\nLooking through all NT entries:\n\n- NT73 appears in S and other NTs.\n- NT71 appears in NT27's production: NT27 -> NT54 NT4, and NT54 -> NT21 NT87 or other. But no, I don't see NT71 expanding to anything except possibly in the initial S.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all the NTs:\n\nS: NT71, NT73.\n\nThen,\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nWait, I see that NT71 is present in the productions of NT71: does it have a production? No, I don't see any. So perhaps I missed it. Wait, looking again, I don't see any production for NT71 except it's a child of NT27. But no, in the initial S, it goes NT71 NT73, so I think NT71 must have a production. Wait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see NT71 in any of the productions except in S. Maybe I was mistaken earlier; perhaps there's an error in the grammar provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar:\n\nThe start is S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nThen the NT entries:\n\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\n- NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n\nWait, so NT71 is not present in any of these productions. That can't be. Because in S, it's NT71 NT73, but we need to see how NT71 is derived. Unless it's a typo, perhaps.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look at the NT27 production: NT27 -> NT54 NT4. And then, looking down, I see that NT71 is not present except in the starting symbol. Wait, perhaps NT71 is only present in the initial S, and not as a non-terminal elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT71 can only be derived from some other path. Wait, but the grammar given doesn't have a production for NT71, except in S. So that suggests that NT71 is only present in the starting symbol, and perhaps cannot be further expanded? Or maybe it's a terminal?\n\nWait, that can't be, because NT71 is in S, which is the start symbol, and S shouldn't be a terminal. So, perhaps NT71 is supposed to have a production, but it's missing from the grammar provided. Alternatively, maybe NT71's production is implicit as a terminal. But in that case, does the start symbol generate a terminal string? Or perhaps I've made a mistake in reading.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an error in the grammar provided. Maybe I need to check again.

Since the string is a sequence of terms separated by spaces, I'll treat each as an element in the string to process.\n\nStarting with S, which expands into NT71 NT73. Each of these non-terminals must generate parts of the string.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step, tracking the non-terminals needed at each step.\n\nFirst, S -> NT71 NT73, so the string must start with the production of NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at NT71: I don't have a production rule for NT71 in the given grammar; it seems like NT71 is only used on the right side and doesn't have a leftmost expansion. Wait, the grammar is presented as S -> NT71 NT73, but I don't see any rule for NT71 or NT73 beyond what's already given. Maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, checking the rules, I see NT73 -> NT63 NT42, NT71 isn't on the right side except in S's production. So perhaps NT71 only appears in the S rule and doesn't expand further, which might mean it's a terminal. But in the string provided, I don't see any 't71' token. So if NT71 is terminal, it's not present, but if it's non-terminal, it would have to expand into something else.\n\nWait, looking again, the rules only go as far as S -> NT71 NT73. So to determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I have to see if each part of the string corresponds to a derived sequence of expansions from the start symbol.\n\nLet me try to analyze the string by considering each part as a production.\n\nThe string starts with 't36', which can come from either NT90 NT33 (producing t36) or NT48 (producing t36). But looking at the grammar, NT90 -> 't35', so NT90 can't produce 't36'; the other option is NT48. However, looking at the grammar, NT48 isn't present as a non-terminal; it seems the closest is NT42, which when expanded could produce t46, etc. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, the way the rules are written, each rule is like A -> B C, etc. So for example, NT42 -> NT36 NT27, and then NT36 can be NT90 NT33 or NT48, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a parse tree for the string, or at least try to see if each token can be derived step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to generate all possible strings from the grammar and see if the given string matches any. But that's impractical, so instead, I'll try to perform a bottom-up or top-down parsing.\n\nGiven that it's a CNF grammar, a recursive descent parser would be suitable, but I'll try to do it step by step mentally.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT71 NT73. So the entire string must be the concatenation of expansions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with 't36', which is a terminal. If NT71 were a terminal, it must match 't36'. But in the given string, after the initial 't36', the next element is 't20', which suggests that NT71 could produce 't36' and then NT73 must produce a string that starts with 't20', etc.\n\nAlternatively, if NT71 is a non-terminal, it would have to produce a sequence of terminals. But looking at the rules, NT71 only appears in S's production as NT71 and doesn't have any other rules, meaning it can't expand further. So if NT71 can't produce a terminal, then it's terminal. But in the string, the first token is 't36', which suggests that S must expand into something that starts with 't36'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify the grammar rules:\n\nLooking again:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87 or NT21 NT2 (from the given rules), and also NT36.\n\nWait, looking at NT54: it has rules like NT54 -> NT21 NT87, NT54 -> 't19', NT42 -> 't46', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT63 and NT73 can be broken down further.\n\nThe string begins with 't36', so I can look at the possible NT73 production.\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT63 can be 't2' or more rules. Looking at the grammar, NT63 -> 't2', NT73 -> 't24', etc. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\n- NT63 can be NT2 or NT13, but looking at the provided rules:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT63 -> 't2', 't10', 't13', 't24'. So NT63 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't2', 't10', 't13', or 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 -> 't46', so that's another terminal.\n\nSo putting it together, NT73 -> NT63 NT42, which would produce a string like (something from NT63)(something from NT42).\n\nBut in the string, the first elements after 't36' is 't20', etc. I'm getting lost.\n\nMaybe I should approach it by attempting to parse the string step by step, considering each possible expansion.\n\nFirst, S must expand to NT71 NT73. So the string must start with NT71's expansion followed by NT73's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't36'. So NT71 must produce 't36'. But in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT71 except in S. This might be a problem because if NT71 can only be in S and doesn't expand, it's either a terminal or non-terminal. But according to the rules, NT71 doesn't have a production, so it's a terminal. But in the string, the first element is 't36', so perhaps S's expansion starts with a terminal that matches 't36'.\n\nBut wait, in the given rules, NT36 can produce 't36' or 't35' from NT48. Since 't36' is present, perhaps NT36 can generate it.\n\nWait, let me clarify: NT36 is a non-terminal that can produce 't36' if it's generated from NT90 NT33 or from NT48. But looking at NT48: is there a rule for NT48? Wait, the given rules don't show a production for NT48, so that's a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-297","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. That's helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, although I'm not actually going to parse the string; I just need to see if the derivation exists.\n\nFirst, let's break down the grammar. The start symbol is S, which directly expands to NT71 NT73. So, the entire string should be divided into two parts: one derived from NT71 and the other from NT73.\n\nLooking at the string: `t2 t8 t10 t35 t35 t8 t11 t13 t35 t20 t24 t2 t2 t35 t24 t22 t48 t13 t39 t19 t19 t11 t10 t10 t19 t43 t22`. Let me count the tokens: that's 32 tokens. Since S produces two parts, each part should have a certain number of tokens. But wait, NT71 and NT73 both could produce sequences that add up to 32 tokens. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the structure required for NT71 and NT73.\n\nNT71: Let's see what it expands into. From the grammar:\n\nNT71 -> NT35 NT48\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, NT48 isn't a terminal directly. Let me check:\n\nNT35 -> ... Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see NT35. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again. Oh, I see NT90 -> 't35', NT63 -> 't10', etc. But NT35 isn't a production, so maybe I'm looking at NT4 being used elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Each production rule either breaks down into two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and each production must expand into exactly one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string is 32 terminals long. Starting from S, which splits into NT71 and NT73. Each of those will produce a sequence of terminals. Let me see if I can decompose the string into two parts that correspond to NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait, maybe I should construct the parse tree. Let's start by splitting the string into two parts: the first part is from NT71, the second from NT73.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: 't2' and 't8'. Let's see what those could be.\n\nFrom the grammar, 't2' appears in several NT productions:\n\n- NT4 -> 't22' (but not 2)\n- NT63 -> 't2' (multiple times)\n- NT27 -> 't20'\n- NT21 -> 't43'\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n- NT73: Wait, does NT73 ever produce a terminal? Looking at the grammar, NT73's rule is NT63 NT42. So NT73 can only produce two non-terminals. Therefore, the first token must come from NT73. Wait no, S splits into NT71 and NT73, so NT71 produces the first part, NT73 the second.\n\nWait, but S is NT71 NT73, so the entire string is a concatenation of the expansions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo the first part (before the middle) is from NT71, the second from NT73.\n\nLooking at the first part: 't2 t8 t10 t35 t35 t8 t11 t13 t35 t20 t24 t2 t2 t35 t24 t22'.\n\nWait, that's 17 tokens, but the string is 32, so NT73 must produce 15 tokens? Let's count:\n\nNo, the total is 32, so the first part (NT71) must be 't2 t8 ...' up to 16 tokens, and NT73 the remaining 16? Or perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe each production leads to multiple tokens, but it's easier to think step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work from the start symbol and see if I can expand it into the given string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nNow, let's expand NT71:\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT35 NT48.\n\nBut in the grammar, are there NT35 or NT48? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT35 or NT48. Wait, perhaps I'm confused. The rules provided are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, I might have misread some. For example, NT71 \u2192 't48' directly. So NT71 can expand to 't48' in one step.\n\nBut looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me list all the rules to avoid confusion.\n\nList of productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT63 \u2192 't2'\n- NT73 \u2192 't24'\n- NT27 \u2192 't11'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT21 \u2192 't43'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't10'\n- NT27 \u2192 't20'\n- NT71 \u2192 't48'\n- NT63 \u2192 't13'\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nHmm, okay, so NT71 can directly go to 't48' because of one of the rules: NT71 \u2192 't48'.\n\nWait, that's correct. So the first part of the string is 't48'. Let's see if that matches.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't2 t8 t10 ...', so the first part from NT71 can't be 't48' because that's just one token, but the string starts with two. That suggests that NT71 might be expanding into multiple tokens. But looking at the rules, does NT71 expand into more than one non-terminal or perhaps a terminal?\n\nWait, NT71 expands to NT35 NT48. So, that would mean NT71 \u2192 NT35 NT48. Then NT35 and NT48 would each expand into something.\n\nBut in the rules, I don't see a production for NT35. Wait, that's confusing. Why didn't NT35 have a rule? Looking back, I think I might have missed it.\n\nWait, I see that NT54 \u2192 't2' is a rule, but NT35 is not found anywhere. So perhaps there's a mistake in the rules, or maybe I misread it. Alternatively, maybe NT35 is a typo for another symbol.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 \u2192 that's correct.\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, which goes to 't19' or 't2'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46' or 't36' perhaps.\n\nWait, no, I'm looking for NT35, but it's not present."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar rules for clarity. The start symbol is S. Looking at the productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n2. NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n3. NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n4. NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n5. NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n6.

NT63 \u2192 't13'\n22. NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t13 t24 t10 t8 t19 t22 t8 t35 t8 t39 t22 t24 t39 t46 t10 t39 t11 t19 t48 t43 t8 t13 t39 t13 t36 t48 t2`.\n\nFirst, I need to parse this string into its components. It looks like the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Let's list them out:\n\nt13, t24, t10, t8, t19, t22, t8, t35, t8, t39, t22, t24, t39, t46, t10, t39, t11, t19, t48, t43, t8, t13, t39, t13, t36, t48, t2.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary tree structure, and the derivation is sequential, combining two symbols at each step. Each production is used exactly once, so the leftmost symbols are expanded first.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it expands into NT71 NT73. So the initial string to derive would be NT71 followed by NT73. Let's look at the possible terminals for these:\n\nFrom the rules, NT71 \u2192 't48' (since rule 20). Similarly, NT73 \u2192 't24' (rule 7). So the entire expansion would directly produce 't48' 't24', which is 't48 t24'. But the given string starts with 't13 t24', which doesn't match. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT71 doesn't directly produce 't48', maybe it's part of a larger derivation. Let me check the rules again for NT71 and NT73. \n\nLooking at rule 20: NT71 \u2192 't48'. So in the initial step, S \u2192 NT71 NT73 \u2192 't48' 't24' \u2192 't48 t24'. But the given string starts with 't13 t24', which is different. So either the string isn't generated by this grammar, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at rule 20: NT71 \u2192 't48'. Yes.\n\nRule 7: NT73 \u2192 't24'. So yes, the initial expansion is 't48 t24'. The given string starts with 't13 t24', which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the string does not start with 't48 t24', which would be the direct expansion of S. So the string can't be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is 't13', which isn't 't48'. Additionally, looking deeper, 't13' could possibly come from NT63 \u2192 't13' (rule 18). So maybe the expansion starts with NT63.\n\nWait, but since S \u2192 NT71 NT73, the first two symbols must be 't48' and 't24', or if S is expanded in a different way, but the grammar seems to enforce that S directly expands into NT71 and NT73. So the initial two symbols should be 't48' and 't24', unless there's a rule that allowed NT71 or NT73 to be further expanded into multiple symbols. But according to CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So NT71 can only produce one terminal, 't48'. Similarly, NT73 produces only 't24'.\n\nSo the very first two symbols must be 't48' followed by 't24'. But the given string starts with 't13', which means it can't be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-313","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's see, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I need to check is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice that S starts with NT71 and NT73. So the first two symbols of any string generated by S should be NT71 followed by NT73. Wait, is that correct? Wait no, the grammar is S -> NT71 NT73, so the string starts with NT71, right? But wait, NT71 is a non-terminal. So the string we have starts with t19, then t2, etc. Wait, but t19 is a terminal. So in the string, the first symbol is t19, which must correspond to some production that ends with t19.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT54 can produce 't19'. So the first symbol t19 must come from NT54. So how can NT71 be transformed into NT54? Wait, the production is NT71 -> NT48... no, wait the grammar's S is NT71 followed by NT73. So the first symbol is NT71, but according to the grammar, S produces NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait, no, S is NT71 and NT73, but NT71 is a non-terminal. So in the string, we start with t19, which must come from NT54, not from NT71 directly. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the string is just a list of terminals. I need to parse it according to the grammar, meaning every time I see a non-terminal, I should expand it according to the rules until I get only terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t19. Looking at the grammar, NT54 can produce t19 exactly. So that could be the first step: NT54 -> t19.\n\nWait, but the first symbol in the string is t19, so we have to see if the first two symbols correspond to some NT71 followed by something that can lead to t2, or perhaps we're missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree starting from the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each must be produced by a non-terminal somewhere.\n\nLet me list the symbols in the string: t19, t2, t46, t24, t8, t43, t8, t13, t36, t48, t39, t35, t20, t20, t35, t36, t39, t2, t10, t24, t22, t20, t13, t19, t22, t35, t11, t22.\n\nWait, that's a lot of symbols, 31 in total. So we need to see if this can be broken down into a sequence of productions starting from S.\n\nSince S is NT71 NT73, that would mean the beginning must first be NT71 and then NT73. So in the string, the first non-terminal symbol must expand into some string that starts with the rest. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me clarify: S generates a string by the productions, so each application of a non-terminal to terminal or non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be decomposed step by step starting from S. So let's try to see.\n\nBut 31 symbols seem a lot, maybe I can check the start symbols and see if the first few symbols correspond to possible expansions.\n\nWait, but the first two symbols in the string are t19 and t2. Now, t19 comes from NT54, but NT71 is a non-terminal which produces other things. So maybe S first expands into NT71 and NT73, but how does NT71 become t19?\n\nWait, let me look at the productions for NT71: I don't see any production for NT71 in the grammar. Wait, the grammar shows S -> NT71 NT73, so NT71 must be a non-terminal that can be further expanded. Let's see if there's any production that includes NT71. Looking through the grammar, I only see S -> NT71 NT73 and maybe other productions where NT71 appears. Wait, I go through each production and see the left-hand sides.\n\nLooking through all productions, I don't see any for NT71 except possibly as part of other non-terminals. Wait, for example, NT27 -> NT54 NT4, so if any NT27 appears, it's expanded into those. But I don't see any production for NT71 except as a left-hand side of S. Hmm, so S starts with NT71 NT73, and since NT71 isn't directly expanded, maybe it's supposed to generate more non-terminals that eventually produce t19.\n\nWait, but NT71 isn't present in the productions, except as part of S. So if NT71 can't produce anything else, that means it must be a dead end. But since S uses NT71, that would mean the entire string must come from NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait, so let's think differently. Maybe the grammar isn't correctly given, or perhaps I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I see that the productions are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nWait, that's all the productions. So NT71 is a non-terminal that doesn't have any further productions except in S; same with NT73. So when I start with S, I have NT71 NT73, which must both be expanded. But since NT71 and NT73 don't have any productions except in S, this implies that they must be terminals, but that's not the case because NT73 produces NT63 NT42.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because NT71 is a non-terminal with no productions, leading to a problem. So perhaps the grammar is malformed because NT71 only appears in S and doesn't have any productions, making it impossible for it to generate any terminals. So S can't produce any string because NT71 and NT73 can't be expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, that can't be, because then S would generate nothing, which is impossible since the empty string would be allowed. But if S can't produce any terminals, then the string we have, which is all t's, can't be generated because the grammar starting from S can't produce any terminals.\n\nWait, but that seems unlikely. Let me check again if I missed any productions for NT71. Looking through the list, no, the only mention of NT71 is as part of S's production. Therefore, in our string, the first symbols must come from some expansion of NT71 and NT73, but since they have no productions, the only way that works is if the string is empty, which it's not. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the string starts with t19, which must come from some NT production. Then the problem arises because t19 comes from NT54, but the S production starts with NT71, which can't expand into anything. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that NT71 and NT73 don't have other productions.\n\nWait, another look at the grammar reveals that NT71 only appears on the left-hand side of S. So it doesn't appear anywhere else. Therefore, NT71 can only generate itself and then produce nothing, leading to an infinite loop. But that's impossible because the parse would never terminate.\n\nSo in this case, the grammar as given is inconsistent. Because S -> NT71 NT73, but NT71 and NT73 don't have any other productions except for possibly in S. Therefore, this grammar can't generate any terminal string, because there's nothing that can expand into a terminal, except for NT54 and a few others.\n\nWait, but let me see: T19 comes from NT54. So the string starts with NT54 producing t19, but then what about the other part of S, which is NT73.\n\nWait, maybe the initial production is S -> NT71 NT73, but in the string, the first symbol is t19, which would have to come from NT54, but that's part of the second non-terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-315","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t8 t19 t24 t20 t19 t35 t10 t46 t19 t11 t19 t22 t22 t24 t2 t35 t19 t46 t46 t48 t43 t11 t11 t2 t48 t24 t19 t13`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens. \n\nFirst, I should remember that CNF means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and one non-terminal or terminal on the right. In this grammar, most of the rules have terminals on the right. That usually makes it easier for parsers because each step of the derivation can be seen as expanding one non-terminal with two symbols, which can either be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which produces NT71 and NT73. So the start is N71,73, but wait, in the given grammar, S -> NT71 NT73. So in the string, the first part should be the concatenation of NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with `t8 t19 ...`, so the first production is NT71 -> 't8' and NT73 -> 't19' or something similar.\n\nWait, let me check. The parsing process will start from S, which becomes NT71 NT73. So the string must be a sequence that starts with NT71 followed by NT73, expanding each into their respective parts.\n\nNow, I can see that NT73 directly produces 't24' in the string. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT73 -> NT63 NT42. Oh right, so NT73 expands into two non-terminals: NT63 and NT42. So in the string, after t8 (from NT71), the next part should be the expansion of NT63 and NT42.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t8, which matches NT71 -> 't8', so that's fine. Then comes t19, which must match NT73, but wait, NT73 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So the string after t8 should be 't63 t42', but in the given string, after t8, it's t19. Wait, that's a problem. Because NT73 is NT63 NT42, which should be two non-terminals, unless one of them produces a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. For NT73, it's NT63 NT42. Does any of these non-terminals produce a terminal? NT63, for example, has rules: NT63 -> NT90 NT33, which are both non-terminals. NT42: let me see, rules like NT42 -> NT36 NT27, which are non-terminals. Hmm, so NT73 -> NT63 NT42 would produce two non-terminals, which would each have to be expanded further.\n\nBut in the string, immediately after t8, the next token is t19, which is a terminal. So that would mean that the NT73 must be producing t19, which is a terminal, so there's a direct rule NT73 -> 't19'. Looking at the grammar, yes, I see that NT73 -> 't24' is not the case. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking back, the grammar is a bit tangled. Let me list all the rules again to make sure I get them right:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT63 has several rules: NT63 -> NT90 NT33, which is not helpful directly, but also NT63 becomes things like 't2', 't10', 't13', etc.\n\nWait, no. Actually, I should list all the rules systematically.\n\nLet me write down all the production rules for each non-terminal to better understand their expansion options.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNow, for NT71: Not sure if it's listed, but let me check. I think in the initial list, NT71 only appears in S. Hmm, so maybe NT71 doesn't have any rules beyond what's given. Wait, let's check the given grammar again:\n\nThe user provided a list of rules where NT71 is on the right-hand side of S. Are there any rules for NT71 elsewhere? Looking through the list: I don't see any NT71 as a target of a production. So NT71 must be a terminal? Because otherwise, it would have production rules.\n\nWait, but in the context of CNF, non-terminals only appear on the left side, but in the right side, they can't have other non-terminals above two levels. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So, any production on the right-hand side that has terminals is allowed, but non-terminals must be exactly two.\n\nIn the given grammar, for example, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, which is a production with two non-terminals on the right. NT63 \u2192 NT90 NT33 is another, again two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check all the provided rules:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT21 \u2192 't43'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't10'\n- NT27 \u2192 't20'\n- NT71 \u2192 't48'\n- NT63 \u2192 't13'\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, some non-terminals produce terminals directly. So for example, NT87 \u2192 't8', NT54 \u2192 't19', etc.\n\nSo, returning to the string. The first token is 't8', which must come from a production that directly produces 't8'. Looking at the rules, NT87 \u2192 't8', but is there a non-terminal that directly produces 't8'? Or perhaps NT71 can produce 't8'? Wait, S starts as NT71 NT73, so if either NT71 or NT73 can produce 't8'.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, NT71 is in S, which is on the left, but on the right, any production for NT71? It doesn't appear, so I think NT71 is a terminal. So if S is NT71 NT73, then NT71 must produce a terminal, and NT73 must produce the rest.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't8'. If S is NT71 NT73, then 't8' must come from NT71, but if NT71 is a terminal, then NT73's expansion must come next. But if NT71 is a terminal, then the string starts with t8, then comes what NT73 expands to.\n\nBut looking at NT73's production: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, which are non-terminals, so NT73 can only produce a string of two non-terminals, unless one of those has a terminal production.\n\nSo the first two tokens after 't8' should be the expansions of NT63 and NT42, but in the string, after t8 comes t19 directly.\n\nWait, that's an issue. Because the second token should be a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal, but directly t19 is a terminal, which can't be derived from NT63 or NT42 unless that NT has a rule that produces terminal.\n\nWait, no. Because NT63 can produce NT90 NT33 or 't2' or 't10' or 't13'. So maybe NT63 can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking back: NT63 \u2192 NT90 NT33, which are non-terminals, but also NT63 \u2192 't2', 't10', 't13'.

{"custom_id":"request-323","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t39 t2 t46 t8 t20 t36 t46 t24 t11 t19 t39 t13 t2 t36 t2 t10 t46 t11 t20 t13 t36 t13 t2 t20 t20 t11 t46 t48 t24`. That's a lot of t's and numbers! \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to understand how it builds strings. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Since CNF is used here, the string's length should be 2^n where n is the number of productions. The initial symbol is S, and from S it branches into NT71 and NT73.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string step by step. The string starts with 't39', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, I'll search for any production that results in 't39'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT33 -> 't39'. So, t39 must come from NT33.\n\nNext, looking at the string, the second symbol is 't2'. Let me check which non-terminals produce 't2'. I see NT27 -> 't2' and NT36 -> 't2'. So, the second 't2' could come from either NT27 or NT36.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT27 can be broken down into NT54 and NT4. Let's see if 't2' comes from NT54 or NT4. In the rules, NT54 -> 't19' or 't2'\u2014so, yes, 't2' can come from NT54. Then, NT54 might also come from other rules, like NT42 or NT21. So, if NT54 is producing 't2', that would be NT21 -> 't2' as well? Wait, looking at the rules, NT21 is actually 't21', so not sure. Maybe it's better to reconstruct the entire string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps reconstructing the parse tree would be more efficient. Starting from S, which is NT71 NT73. Then, NT71 can be broken down into NT73 and NT33 (from S -> NT71 NT73). So, we have NT73 and NT73. Wait, no, the production is S -> NT71 NT73, so the initial production creates two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo, the first part of the string comes from NT71, and the second part from NT73.\n\nBreaking down NT71: It's defined as NT73 and NT33. So, that's another split. So, the first token 't39' comes from NT33. Now, looking back, NT71 is NT73 NT33. So, the first token is from NT33, and the next part is from NT73.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial production is S -> NT71 NT73. So, the entire string must come from NT71 and NT73 interleaved? Maybe I need to split the string into two parts according to this split.\n\nThe string has 45 tokens. Since S is splitting into two, which should each produce a certain number of tokens. The number of symbols in a derivation starting from a non-terminal in CNF is 2^n, where n is the number of splits. Since the entire string is 45 tokens, which isn't a power of two (2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64), so that's a problem because CNF strings have lengths that are powers of two. So, this suggests that the string might not be valid because 45 is not a power of two.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's see: S produces two parts. Each part can produce more splits. The total number of leaves in the parse tree must be a power of two. Let me count the number of symbols in the string: it's 45, which is 45. Since 45 is not equal to 2^n for any integer n (since 32 is 2^5, 64 is 2^6), that would imply that the string is invalid because the length must be a power of two in CNF.\n\nBut is that always the case? Wait, no. Because the initial S may produce two parts, each of which can split further. The total number of leaves is the product of the splits. So, for example, if S splits into A and B, and A can split into A1 and A2, and B into B1 and B2, then the total is A1 A2 B1 B2, which is 4 tokens, 2^2. If each of those splits further, for 8 tokens, 2^3, etc. So the total number of tokens should indeed be 2^k for some k. \n\nIn this case, the string has 45 tokens. So, 45 is not a power of two (since 32*2 is 64), so that suggests that the string is invalid because the grammar can only generate strings with lengths that are powers of two. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Maybe S produces NT71 and NT73, and each of those can produce more splits, but maybe they don't split the same number of times.

Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar is. It looks like each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT71, NT73, etc.) can only produce two other non-terminals or a terminal 't' followed by a number. The productions are all in the form of A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except the ones that produce a single terminal, which is a situation when it's like A -> tX or A -> X t, I guess. Wait, no, looking at the rules, all of them are A -> BC, except some that directly go to a single terminal like 't8'.\n\nWait, no. Looking closely, for example, NT87 -> 't8', so that's a production where NT87 becomes the terminal 't8'. Similarly, others like NT54 have productions to 't19', etc. So the terminals are these 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t39 t11 t8 t39 t8 t46 t20 t39 t19 t13 t43 t24 t2 t8 t35 t8 t48 t36 t24 t19 t36 t39 t22 t10 t20 t10 t43 t2 t36`.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of 37 terminals (split by spaces). That's a lot, but let's see.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, I think I can use the CYK algorithm. But maybe there's a simpler way since the grammar is small. Alternatively, I can parse the string from the smallest units backward.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe see which terminals can be generated by each non-terminal, and then check if their concatenation can form the given string.\n\nFirst, let me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, but some non-terminals have multiple productions.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to understand how the non-terminal symbols can produce terminals. The start symbol is S, which is defined as \"NT71 NT73\". So, S must produce two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at NT73, it produces two other non-terminals: NT63 and NT42. I'll need to see if these can derive to terminal symbols. Moving down, NT63 can be either a terminal 't63' or another non-terminal.

Let me make sure I have these right:\n\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\nWait, looking back, line 10 says NT54 -> 't2', which I didn't note earlier. Similarly, line 5: NT54 -> NT21 NT87, and line 8: NT87 -> 't8'. Also lines 17: NT4 -> 't22', 20: NT42 -> 't36', 14: NT63 -> 't2' (from line 14), line 21: NT63 -> 't10', line 13: NT63 -> 't2', line 24: NT90 -> 't35'. Hmm, that's a lot of non-terminals reducing directly to terminals.\n\nSo, each step in the derivation reduces some non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals. Since the string consists of a sequence of terminals, every non-terminal in the derivation must be directly replaced by a terminal.\n\nGiven that S must produce two NT71 and NT73, which in turn produce other non-terminals. Let's consider the approach step by step.\n\nFirst, the string given is a sequence of 33 terminals. I'll note that the length is important because each step in the grammar's leftmost derivation should consume symbols. The number of symbols relates to the number of steps needed in the derivation.\n\nThe string starts with \"t35 t24 t46 t22 t46 t46 t13 t19 t35 t39 t24 t13 t13 t8 t46 t8 t8 t48 t36 t35 t11 t36 t48 t11 t46 t11 t10 t46 t11 t39\".\n\nFirst, let's note down each terminal in the string and see if it's present as a terminal in any non-terminal's productions. Looking at the grammar, the terminals are: t2, t4, t8, t10, t11, t13, t19, t22, t24, t35, t36, t39, t42, t46, t48, t54, etc., but the string uses t35, t24, t46, t22, t46, t46, t13, t19, t35, etc. I notice that all these are present as terminals in the rules. For example, NT87 is t8, NT54 can be t19, t2, t48, etc. Wait, but wait, in the rules, the only non-terminals that produce terminals are those that have a production ending with -> 'tX'. Let me check:\n\n NT87 -> 't8' (line7)\n NT54 -> 't19' (line8)\n NT42 -> 't46' (line9)\n NT54 -> 't2' (line10)\n NT4 -> 't22' (line11)\n NT21 -> 't39' (line12)\n NT33 -> 't11' (line16)\n NT4 -> 't35' (line17)\n NT21 -> 't43' (line18)\n NT33 -> 't48' (line19)\n NT42 -> 't36' (line20)\n NT63 -> 't2' (line21)\n NT63 -> 't10' (line24 is line24: \"NT63->t13\"; wait, let me check line numbers again. Wait, I think in the original list, line 24 is NT90 -> 't35', line13 is NT63->t2, line21 is NT63->t10, line19 is NT33->'t48', line22: NT42->t36, line14: NT63->t13, etc. Wait, but in the initial grammar presented, it's:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing, but I think it's better to list each production and see which produce terminals. Let me make a list of all non-terminals and their possible productions:\n\n- NT71: S uses NT71, which then becomes NT73 (S is NT71 NT73).\nWait, actually, S is \"NT71 NT73\", so the grammar starts by expanding NT71 into something, but I'm getting confused.

Let's list them:\n\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n- NT27 -> 't11'\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT63 -> 't10'\n- NT27 -> 't20'\n- NT71 -> 't48'\n- NT63 -> 't13'\n- NT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, I think the user had multiple lines for a single symbol, so perhaps I'm missing some rules. To be precise, let me list each symbol and their possible productions.\n\nLooking again, perhaps the grammar has overlapping rules, so I need to make sure I parse all possible ways each symbol can be broken down.\n\nSo, to approach this problem, I can use a recursive descent parser or try to see if the string can be broken down into the required units.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, starting from the initial symbol S and trying to replace non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals in the order dictated by the rules.\n\nThe string given is: t22 t22 t2 t39 t39 t43 t19 t22 t43 t8 t19 t39 t39 t36 t8 t8 t10 t11 t2 t22 t39 t43 t19 t24 t13 t39 t2 t46 t46 t22\n\nFirst, let's note the structure:\n\nThe given string starts with t22, t22. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the first two units should be NT71 and NT73.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts: the first two symbols 't22' 't22' for NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nSo, the string must start with whichever symbols NT71 and NT73 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT71, I didn't see a line for NT71 in the provided grammar. Hmm. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar provided:\n\nLooking back, line 17 is NT71 \u2192 't48', so NT71 produces 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, let me re-examine all symbols and their productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, let's note all the symbols and their rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't48'\n\n- NT73 \u2192 (from rule 2) NT63 NT42 or (rule12) 't24'\n\nWait, but in the grammar, does NT73 have multiple productions? Let me check:\n\nFrom the provided lines, NT73 is defined as:\n\nline 2: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nline12: NT73 \u2192 't24'\n\nSo yes, NT73 can be 't24' or can split into NT63 and NT42.\n\nSimilarly, for NT71, line17 has NT71 \u2192 't48'.\n\nNow, back to the string: it starts with t22 t22.\n\nBut according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and S is the start symbol.\n\nSo, the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT71 and NT73 produce, respectively.\n\nLooking at NT71, it can only produce 't48'. So the first part of the string must be 't48', but in the given string, the first part is 't22' 't22'... which can't be 't48'.

{"custom_id":"request-337","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on CFGs, but I remember that Chomsky normal form has specific rules, usually each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to have several productions. Let me list them out to get a better picture.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So S is producing two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. Both of these need to be expanded further.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. Then NT63 and NT42 each produce other non-terminals. NT63 \u2192 NT27, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, wait, actually, NT73 expands into NT63 and NT42. Wait, no, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So each NT73 will generate two non-terminals: NT63 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT42, it \u2192 NT36 NT27, so that's two more non-terminals. Then NT36 can produce NT90 and NT33, and NT33 can produce NT11 and NT11, which seems to loop but also eventually will produce terminals.\n\nWait, but actually, I need to look for the way down to terminals. Let me focus on the string we have: \"t10 t48 t36 t43 t2 t13 t2 t39 t19 t10 t36 t2 t48 t20 t24 t24 t35 t46 t13 t36 t2 t24 t13 t2 t48 t11 t24 t35 t46 t20 t11\".\n\nThat's 45 symbols, all of which are 't' followed by a number, except that I assume they are concatenated, so the string is t10 t48 t36 and so on, meaning the string is a sequence of these terms without any spaces.\n\nSo the string has 45 elements, meaning the grammar's derivation must result in a string of 45 tokens, each being a terminal.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols, but since some productions produce terminals, it depends on the structure.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so each step from S would produce two non-terminals each, which themselves produce more.\n\nSo let's think of the string as the top-down expansion starting from S. Each NT is a non-terminal that can be expanded into two other non-terminals, until we reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' followed by a number must be produced by a terminal rule, like NT \u2192 'tX'.\n\nSo first, to verify if the string is compatible with the grammar's structure, each terminal must match a production's terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, terminals are t10, t11, t13, t19, t2, t20, t24, t35, t36, t39, t42, t43, t46, t48, etc.\n\nIn the string, we have t10, t48, t36, t43, t2, t13, t2, t39, t19, t10, t36, t2, t48, t20, t24, t24, t35, t46, t13, t36, t2, t24, t13, t2, t48, t11, t24, t35, t46, t20, t11.\n\nSo the string has all these terminals, and no unknown ones, so that's good.\n\nNow, to see if the string can be broken down into a leftmost derivation that follows the grammar's structure.\n\nThe grammar has S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so the string starts with t10 and t48. But according to the grammar, the first production is NT71 \u2192 ... Wait, in the given grammar, the start symbol S produces NT71 and NT73.\n\nBut looking at the grammar provided, the first production is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So when we start, each production step adds more symbols.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should map the NTs down the chain.\n\nLet me try to see how each NT expands into terminals and other NTs.\n\nLet's consider NT71. Is there a production for NT71? Looking at the grammar:\n\nYes, NT71 \u2192 NT48. So NT71 expands into NT48.\n\nAnd NT48 \u2192 what? Looking through the grammar, NT48 isn't listed except for its presence in the string. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT27, NT42, NT54, etc. Wait, looking through each non-terminal:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\nNT63 \u2192 NT27.\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27.\nNT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33.\nNT90 \u2192 t35.\nWait, so wait: NT90 \u2192 t35, right? So if NT90 is a production that goes to terminal t35.\n\nSimilarly, NT33 \u2192 NT11 NT11, but wait, no: in the grammar, NT33 \u2192 t11 and NT33 is also in another production.\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit confused in my head. Let me list each NT and their productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT63 \u2192 NT27\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 \u2192 which is the same as above\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 or NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 t22\n- NT21 \u2192 t39 or t63\nWait, looking again:\n\nWait, let me list all the productions correctly:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27 \u2192 which is same as above, so perhaps this is a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nHmm, okay, perhaps I should list all of them clearly:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\nNT63 \u2192 NT27\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | 't2' | 't19' | 't2' | etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to model the derivation starting from S and see if the string can be formed.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so the string starts with NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string: t10.

{"custom_id":"request-346","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all the productions are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. It looks like there are several non-terminals connected by productions, and each production is made up of other non-terminals or terminals. My task is to parse the string `t46 t13 t39 t35 t2 t2 t19 t36 t36 t36 t43 t35 t22 t46 t13 t46 t39 t24 t20 t11 t11 t19 t39 t10 t10 t48 t20 t46 t2 t36 t22` and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the string's length can give me a clue about how many production steps to expect. Each rule is two non-terminals, and strings derived from them will have lengths equal to the number of production steps. Since each step replaces a non-terminal into two symbols, the length of the string should be a power of 2. The initial symbol S will derive a string of length 2^n.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a space-separated list of 36 't's followed by numbers. So the total length is 36. Now, 36 is not a power of 2 (since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64). That might indicate that the string length doesn't fit the number of possible derivations, but I should verify the exact structure instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows overlapping or multiple paths, so even if 36 isn't a power of 2, it's still possible. I need to reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLooking at the top-down approach, starting from S:\n\n1. The start symbol S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the string must start with NT71 and NT73.\n\nLet me check the first two tokens: t46 followed by t13.\n\nLooking into the grammar rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT21 NT? Wait, in the first rule: S \u2192 NT71 NT73. From the provided grammar, looking for NT71:\n\nWait, actually, the provided grammar is a list, where each line is a production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT63 \u2192 't2'\n- NT73 \u2192 't24'\n- NT27 \u2192 't11'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT21 \u2192 't43'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't10'\n- NT27 \u2192 't20'\n- NT71 \u2192 't48'\n- NT63 \u2192 't13'\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nSo S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nSo NT71 and NT73 should produce the first two tokens.\n\nLooking at NT71: in the rules, do I see NT71? Yes, on line 17: NT71 \u2192 't48'.\n\nSo NT71 \u2192 't48', which matches the first token in the string.\n\nNow, NT73: in the rules, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42 (line 2). Then, we need to check what comes next in the string: the second token after t48 is t13.\n\nSo the first two steps are:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\u2192 't48' and whatever NT73 produces.\n\nNow, nt73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nSo we have 't48' followed by nt63 and nt42.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't48' we have 't13', so t13 must match the next production.\n\nLooking at NT63: in the rules, NT63 \u2192 't2' (line 9), and also 't10' (line 16).\n\nWait, but the second token after 't48' is 't13', which isn't directly matched by the productions of NT63.\n\nHmm, maybe I made an error here. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, the string is t46 t13 t39... etc. The initial approach assumed that S \u2192 NT71 NT73, which is 't48' and then NT73 which starts with NT63 \u2192 't2' or 't10'. But the string starts with t46 t13, so maybe my initial assumption is incorrect, or perhaps I misread the string.\n\nWait, the string provided is:\n\nt46 t13 t39 t35 t2 t2 t19 t36 t36 t36 t43 t35 t22 t46 t13 t46 t39 t24 t20 t11 t11 t19 t39 t10 t10 t48 t20 t46 t2 t36 t22\n\nSo the first token is t46, not t48. So perhaps my initial assumption that S \u2192 NT71 NT73 producing t48 is incorrect.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Both NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, so their productions would derive into terminals and possibly other non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I misread the initial productions. Let me confirm.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe first rule is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Both of these are non-terminals, not terminals. So S itself is a non-terminal, and the first step would replace S with NT71 NT73. Thus, the string starts with NT71's derivation and NT73's derivation.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT71 \u2192 't48' directly. So S would lead to 't48' from NT71. So the first symbol in the string should be t48. But in the string, the first symbol is t46, not t48. That's a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the first token wrong. Let me double-check the string again.\n\nThe string is: t46 t13 t39 t35 t2 t2 t19 t36 t36 t36 t43 t35 t22 t46 t13 t46 t39 t24 t20 t11 t11 t19 t39 t10 t10 t48 t20 t46 t2 t36 t22\n\nYes, first token is t46. So if S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and NT71 \u2192 't48', but the first token is t46, that can't be. Therefore, perhaps NT71 is something else.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in parsing the grammar. Let me re-examine each rule:\n\nLooking for NT71: Wait, 'NT71' isn't present as a left-hand side except in S \u2192 NT71 NT73 and one other rule: NT54 \u2192 't19', NT54 \u2192 't2', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the lines.

{"custom_id":"request-347","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string to evaluate is quite long. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. CNF grammars have each production rule either combining two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar provided has S leading to two NT71s, so the string must be generated from S, which splits into two branches of NT71. Each of these NT71s further breaks down into NT73 and NT63.\n\nLooking at the rules, each NTxxx seems to eventually produce a terminal or another combination. I think the way to approach this is to see if the string can be segmented according to the grammar rules. \n\nEach NT production seems to result in a specific terminal or a combination of two NTs. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to see if these can be grouped into the structures defined by the grammar. \n\nStarting with the first character 't10', I need to see which NT rules produce 't10'. Looking at NT63, I see two rules where NT63 \u2192 't2' and NT63 \u2192 't10'. So, the first 't10' could come directly from NT63. \n\nThe next part of the string is another 't10'. Again, this must come from NT63. Then comes 't19', which likely comes from NT73 because NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42 and one of the rules for NT42 produces 't19'. So after two 't10's, 't19' would come from NT73.\n\nContinuing, the string has 't43', which I'm not sure where that comes from yet. Let me check the NT42 rules. Oh, looking back, NT42 has a rule that can produce 't46' from NT63 and NT42. Wait, no, that might not directly help. Alternatively, NT42 produces 't46' in another rule. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, let me list out the relevant productions:\n\nLooking back, S \u2192 NT71 NT71.\n\nEach NT71 \u2192 NT73 NT63.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nNT63 can produce 't2', 't10', 't13', etc.\n\nLooking at the string after 't19', the next is 't43'. But wait, 't43' isn't a terminal directly. That suggests that 't43' is part of a non-terminal's expansion. Wait, no, because in CNF, the productions only generate terminals on the left. So each non-terminal must produce two terminals or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Each production rule, when applied, replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal. So in the string, each symbol (except the spaces) must be a terminal, which they are all 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I see that NT42 can produce 't46' in one rule and another combination in another rule. Similarly, NT27 can produce 't11', 't20', etc. I need to make sure that each step in the string can be mapped correctly.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, keeping track of possible derivations.\n\nThe string is: t10 t10 t19 t43 t2 t36 t35 t2 t13 t8 t19 t11 t39 t20 t24 t24 t19 t39 t46 t35 t8 t22 t46 t10 t11 t13 t24 t10 t13 t43 t20 t39.\n\nI'll break this down into segments corresponding to the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT71.\n\nSo the string should be split into two parts, each starting with NT71.\n\nThe first part of the string, considering 't10' and then 't10' again, suggests two NT63s because NT71 produces NT73 NT63, and each NT73 is NT63 NT42, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list all the possible NTs and their productions.\n\nLooking at NT73: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nNT63: 't2', 't10', 't13', etc.\n\nNT42: 't36', 't46', 't43', etc.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if these terminals are correctly linked.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be split into a series of pairs that match the grammar's production rules.\n\nEach rule creates a non-terminal that splits into two parts. So the entire string should be structured in such a way that it can be parsed according to the grammar's production rules, breaking it down from the root S.\n\nLet me try to parse the string as per the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT71.\n\nEach NT71 \u2192 NT73 NT63.\n\nSo each part would be NT73 NT63. So the entire string can be split into:\n\nFirst NT73 is the first part, and NT63 is the second part of each S split. So the string is (NT73_1 NT63_1) (NT73_2 NT63_2).\n\nBut wait, the string is a linear sequence, so perhaps I need to parse it as a single sequence using the grammar rules in reverse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be divided into a structure where each NT71 produces NT73 NT63, which in turn each produce their own NTs, and so on until terminals.\n\nLet me try to represent the string as a tree.\n\nLooking at the first 't10', it could come from NT63, but perhaps it's better to see how the entire string can be constructed using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) style parsing or recursive descent parsing.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps I'll try stepping through the string.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first symbol is 't10'. Looking at NT63's productions, which can produce 't10' directly. So that could be NT63.\n\nThe next symbol is 't10' again, which is also from NT63.\n\nSo so far, two 't10's, which match NC:63 t10.\n\nBut each NT63 also produces a NT42, so after 't10', the next symbols should be NT42.\n\nWait, but after 't10' comes 't10' and then 't19'. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT73 first splits into NT63 NT42, and each of those can produce more.\n\nLooking at NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nSo after S splits into NT71 and NT71, each NT71 splits into NT73 and NT63. So each of those is a two-step process.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: check if every 't' number can be traced back to a production rule.\n\nLooking at the string, the first 't10' could be from NT63 (NT63 \u2192 't10').\n\nNext 't10' again, same.\n\nThen 't19' suggests NT73's last part, which comes from NT42. So perhaps after two 't10's, the next 't19' is part of NT73? Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps each S split into NT71 and NT71, each of which splits into NT73 and NT63.\n\nSo the entire string is structured as (NT73_1 NT63_1) (NT73_2 NT63_2).\n\nWait, but in the string, it's a single sequence of symbols, so it's not clear how the split is done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT71 \u2192 NT73 NT63, so the first part is NT73 NT63, and then the second part is another NT73 NT63.\n\nSo the entire string would be (NT73 NT63) (NT73 NT63).\n\nEach NT73 is NT63 NT42, so each becomes (NT63 NT42).\n\nThen each NT63 is a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nSo let's map this step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string is:\n\nt10 t10 t19 t43 t2 t36 t35 t2 t13 t8 t19 t11 t39 t20 t24 t24 t19 t39 t46 t35 t8 t22 t46 t10 t11 t13 t24 t10 t13 t43 t20 t39."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-351","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific Context-Free Grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t13 t43 t24 t8 t46 t36 t46 t35 t36 t39 t48 t39 t8 t2 t36 t39 t10 t35 t8 t20 t46 t11 t48 t35 t22 t13 t11 t11 t24 t20 t11 t8`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. The grammar is given with a series of productions. Each non-terminal on the left side of an arrow can be replaced by a pair of non-terminals on the right. Each production has two symbols on the right side. Since this is CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nThen, there are a series of NTs with numbers, like NT73, NT63, etc., that have productions which either split into two NTs or produce a single terminal. For example, NT73 -> NT63 NT42, which continues splitting. Each of these NTs eventually leads to terminals like 't8', 't2', etc.\n\nSo, the strategy is to see if the given string can be broken down into the structure defined by the grammar.\n\nThe string has 39 tokens. Wait, let me count the tokens correctly. Let me try to list them step by step to make sure I have the correct sequence.\n\nThe string is: t13, t43, t24, t8, t46, t36, t46, t35, t36, t39, t48, t39, t8, t2, t36, t39, t10, t35, t8, t20, t46, t11, t48, t35, t22, t13, t11, t11, t24, t20, t11, t8.\n\nThat's 37 tokens. Wait, let me recount: \n\n1. t13\n2. t43\n3. t24\n4. t8\n5. t46\n6. t36\n7. t46\n8. t35\n9. t36\n10. t39\n11. t48\n12. t39\n13. t8\n14. t2\n15. t36\n16. t39\n17. t10\n18. t35\n19. t8\n20. t20\n21. t46\n22. t11\n23. t48\n24. t35\n25. t22\n26. t13\n27. t11\n28. t11\n29. t24\n30. t20\n31. t11\n32. t8\n\nWait, that's 32 tokens? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me count again carefully.\n\nLet me write each token sequentially:\n\n1. t13\n2. t43\n3. t24\n4. t8\n5. t46\n6. t36\n7. t46\n8. t35\n9. t36\n10. t39\n11. t48\n12. t39\n13. t8\n14. t2\n15. t36\n16. t39\n17. t10\n18. t35\n19. t8\n20. t20\n21. t46\n22. t11\n23. t48\n24. t35\n25. t22\n26. t13\n27. t11\n28. t11\n29. t24\n30. t20\n31. t11\n32. t8\n\nSo, 32 tokens in total. Each step in the derivation must expand the start symbol S into these tokens. The first production for S is NT71 NT73.\n\nNow, the approach is to look at the string and see if it can be parsed by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal. So, each word in the string must correspond to either a direct terminal production or be the result of a split in the parsing.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT71 NT73. So, S -> NT71 NT73, meaning in parse, S expands into two non-terminals, NT71 and NT73. Each of these must then expand into sequences of terminals or non-terminals ending in terminals.\n\nSo, the string must be the result of expanding each NT71 and NT73 to some sequences of terminals.\n\nI can approach this step by step by trying to split the string into two parts: the first part corresponding to NT71 and the second to NT73, each of which should themselves be valid derivations from those starting symbols, recursively.\n\nWait, first, let's see what NT71 and NT73 produce. Maybe I can write down the production rules for NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nThen, what's NT71's production? Looking through the given productions:\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nI see NT73 has certain productions. Wait, the user provided lots of productions. Let me see the productions starting with NT73:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nAnd other NTs have more productions, but perhaps focusing on NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait, I'm given:\n\nLooking for NT71:\n\nChecking, wait, I think I need to find all the NTs and their productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLet me list each NT and their possible productions.\n\nLooking at:\n\n- S: S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT73: NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT63 has several productions, like NT63 -> NT90 NT35, NT2, etc.\nWait, perhaps this will get too long, but maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a token list that matches the production chains.\n\nWait, another approach is to see the possible words and see if they can be built from the given productions.\n\nLooking at NT71 and NT73 starting points, we can attempt to parse the string by working backward from the grammar.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to see if each token can be derived step by step. Alternatively, perhaps using dynamic programming to check if the string can be accepted by the grammar, but that would require building a parse table, which might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation is a binary tree where each node has exactly two children until the leaves, which are terminals.\n\nSo, for the given string of 32 tokens, the structure must be such that each non-terminal production leads to a certain number of tokens.\n\nWait, each step S->NT71 NT73 would split into two NTs, each leading to sequences of tokens.\n\nSo, the total number of tokens resulting from S would be the sum of the lengths of the two sequences generated by NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the string's length: 32 tokens. So, perhaps NT71's generated string and NT73's generated string must add up to 32.\n\nSo, let me assume that NT71's production contributes K tokens and NT73 contributes (32-K) tokens. Then, K must be a number that allows the non-terminals to produce sequences of K and (32-K) tokens.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find what K is. Let's list the possible lengths for NT71 and NT73.\n\nBut wait, without knowing the exact derivation, it's difficult. Maybe I can check tokens from the beginning and see if they can be formed by a production rule.\n\nLooking at the first token: t13.\n\nLooking through the productions, which NT can produce t13.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar:\n\nLooking for any production ending with 't13'.\n\nLooking at the given productions, I see NT21 -> 't21' as per the user's input:\n\nWait, actually, in the user's grammar, under NT33: NT33 -> 't11' is present. Also, NT21 -> 't20', etc.\n\nWait, I need to see which NTs have a terminal production with 't13'.\n\nLooking at the provided productions, I see:\n\nNT4: 't4' ... wait, no, the user's productions start with S, then have a list that includes NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So any string generated by this grammar must start with NT71 and NT73. So the first two symbols after S should be these. Let me check the string. The first symbols are t48, t35. The grammar must have NT71 -> t48 and NT73 -> t35, or some combination that leads to that.\n\nLooking at NT71: The grammar doesn't define NT71 directly. Wait, no. Wait, the grammar shows NT71 as the left-hand side of the production, but looking through the productions, the only NT71 I see is in S->NT71 NT73. So perhaps the non-terminals NT71 and NT73 are being used and need to derive to terminal symbols. So I'll need to find the derivations for NT71 and NT73.\n\nLet's examine NT71 and NT73. \n\nFirst, S -> NT71 NT73. So the string must be split into two parts corresponding to NT71 and NT73.

Hmm, maybe I should parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a sequence and see which symbols fit into each non-terminal's productions.\n\nLooking at NT71. NT71 is not directly a terminal. Looking at the productions, NT71 isn't listed as a production because all the NTs in the grammar have higher numbers. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

So NT71 and NT73 must both derive into sequences of terminals.\n\nSo, first, I'll need to see what NT71 and NT73 generate.\n\nLet's start with NT73. The production is NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So NT73 expands into two non-terminals. Let's see what NT63 and NT42 produce.\n\nNT63 -> NT2 and NT13. NT90 -> NT35. Wait, no, looking back: NT63 has production NT2 and NT13?

For example, NT87 \u2192 't8', NT54 can be 't19' or something else.\n\nWait, no. Wait, grammar rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT87 has a production NT87 \u2192 't8', which is a single terminal. Similarly, NT54 has two productions: NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 and NT54 \u2192 't19'.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in Chomsky Normal Form, each rule either has two non-terminals or a single terminal. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for NT54, it can either be split into NT21 and NT87, or produce 't19'.\n\nSo, let's try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t48 t35...

{"custom_id":"request-366","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it simplifies things a bit. My task is to check each step of the string against the production rules. But wait, I should remember that I might need to use a parsing strategy, maybe something like the CYK algorithm or just manually expanding the string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar and the string. The grammar has several non-terminal symbols like S, NT71, NT73, NT27, etc., and some terminals like 't8', 't19', etc. The string is a sequence of these terminals without any spaces or separators, so I'll need to split it correctly. \n\nFirst, the string provided is: \n\n`t43 t10 t36 t19 t48 t35 t20 t48 t20 t43 t20 t19 t10 t48 t39 t48 t48 t48 t46 t48 t46 t19 t46 t39 t20 t10 t46 t22 t13 t36 t24 t35 t8`\n\nSo, that's 35 tokens.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT71 NT73. So, the entire string should start with two non-terminals. But in the string, the first token is 't43'. Hmm, that's a terminal. So, I might need to check if 't43' can be part of a larger derivation.\n\nWait, no. Because in the grammar, each production is left-associative and each production has two symbols on the right side, since it's in Chomsky normal form. So each step generates two symbols. Therefore, the entire string should have a length that's a product of two derivations, but actually, wait, Chomsky normal form allows the derivation to result in a string where each step produces exactly two symbols. So, the initial step from S would produce two symbols, then each of those could produce two each, etc. So the string length could be up to 35 tokens, but I need to see how exactly.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar rules, using a top-down approach. So starting from S, which is NT71 NT73.\n\nWait, but S itself is NT71 followed by NT73. So the first two symbols of the string should be whatever NT71 and NT73 expand to. So, I need to see if the string starts with the productions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT71 has productions: I don't see any rule for NT71 in the given grammar. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules given are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nHmm, so for NT71, looking through the rules, I don't see any production. The rules I have for NT are:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nSo to derive NT73, it'll need to be NT63 NT42. Then, each of those can be further derived.\n\nSimilarly, NT71 is supposed to be NT73 NT27. Wait, no. Wait, looking back, S is NT71 NT73, so NT71 is a non-terminal in the grammar. But looking at the rules, I don't see any production for NT71. Only NT73, NT27, etc. So how can NT71 be on the right-hand side of a production? That can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me go back. The question says, \"Grammar: S-> NT71 NT73 NT27 ...\" Wait, no, looking again, the original grammar the user provided is:\n\nGrammar: \nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, so S is NT71 NT73. But none of the rules include NT71. Hmm, but in the NT rules, NT71 is mentioned as production in one rule:\n\nLooking again: \"NT71 -> 't48'\"\n\nAh, okay, so NT71 directly produces 't48', which is a terminal. So that means in the derivation of S, S = NT71 NT73 expands into 't48' (from NT71) followed by whatever NT73 expands into.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string should be the expansion of NT71 and NT73. So the first symbol is 't43', but NT71 directly produces 't48', so unless there's a different way, perhaps the first symbol is from NT71.\n\nWait, no. S is NT71 NT73, so the first two symbols may not directly be from NT71 or NT73, but the entire derivation is two branches. Wait, no, in a CFG, the left-hand side non-terminal is replaced by the right-hand side in one step. So, for example, S could explode into NT71 NT73, which are then non-terminals that can be further expanded.\n\nBut since the string is a flat sequence of terminals, I need to consider how the derivations proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using the CYK algorithm, which can determine whether the string is generated by the grammar. Let me try to apply that.\n\nThe CYK algorithm involves building a table where each cell represents a possible substring that could be derived from a particular non-terminal.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. So each rule has two symbols on the RHS.\n\nLet me list all the productions:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nHmm, so each production is of the form A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C can be other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst step: Identify all the terminal symbols. From the string, the first symbol is 't43'. Looking at the productions, 't43' is not listed as a terminal in any production.

{"custom_id":"request-375","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of symbols. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to walk through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF looks like. In CNF, each production rule has either a single terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols. The start symbol is S, and every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar given here uses S as the start symbol, which is good.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level rule is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the first two symbols of the generated string should be the expansion of NT71 and NT73. Wait, no, not exactly. In the string, the symbols are interleaved. Since each production is two symbols, the string must be such that each pair (NT71 and NT73) expands into a sequence that starts with those symbols. Let me clarify that: The expansion of S is a tree where each expansion step splits into two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string given is `t36 t39 t13 t22 t24 t10 t11 t35 t36 t2 t13 t13 t10 t22 t2 t24 t46 t35 t13 t46 t2 t24 t20 t13 t46 t19 t46 t39 t39 t36 t36 t11 t8 t10`. So, I need to parse this string through the grammar to see if it can be derived.\n\nSince it's a tree, each part of the string must be generated by the productions. I think a way to approach this is to simulate the derivation and see if the entire string can be covered by the rules.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top symbol. The string starts with t36, which is a terminal. Let's see what can produce t36. Checking the grammar, NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33 and NT90 \u2192 't35', which is a terminal. So NT36 \u2192 t35 t33. But in the string, the first two symbols are t36 and t39. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, no, because in S, the first expansion is NT71 followed by NT73, right? So, in the string, after the start, we have a sequence of symbols generated by NT71, which might break into several steps, then NT73.\n\nSo, starting from S, the first production is NT71 NT73. So the string should start with whatever NT71 generates and then whatever NT73 generates. Let me first figure out what NT71 and NT73 expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nNow, NT63 expands into NT2 and NT13 (NT63 \u2192 NT2 NT13). NT2 is 't22'. So, NT63 \u2192 t22 NT13. Then, NT13 can produce which? Looking at the rules, NT13 isn't in the given non-terminals except through other rules. Wait, the production for NT63 is NT2 NT13, but NT13 isn't defined here. Wait, hold on, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT2 NT13\n\nWait, the given rules include NT63 \u2192 NT2 NT13, NT13 might not have a production? Actually, in the provided grammar, I see NT63 \u2192 NT21 NT87. Wait, no, looking at the original list:\n\nLooking back: NT63 is presented as NT63 -> NT2 NT13, but looking through the provided rules, it's:\n\nIn the initial list, I see:\n\nNT63 has two rules: NT63 -> NT2 NT13, and later other entries:\n\nWait, actually, in the provided list:\n\nIt starts with S -> NT71 NT73, then NT73 -> NT63 NT42, and then other rules for NT27, NT42, etc.\n\nWait, so checking all rules for NT63: Do I see NT63 \u2192 NT2 NT13 or not? Yes, the second line is \"NT63 -> NT2 NT13\" as per the user's input. But in the given grammar, I have:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar:\n\nLine 3: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nThen line 4: NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nThen line 5: NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nThen line 6: NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nLine 7: NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n\nLine 8: NT87 \u2192 't8'\n\nLine 9: NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nWait, actually, in the user's grammar, NT63 is defined in line 2 as NT63 -> NT2 NT13. Wait, perhaps line 2 is \"NT63 -> NT2 NT13\". Is that correct?\n\nYes, the third production is NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. Line 2 is NT63 \u2192 NT2 NT13. So, so far, NT63 produces two non-terminals, NT2 and NT13.\n\nBut wait, does NT13 have a definition? Looking back: No, in the provided rules, I see NT27, NT42, etc., but I don't see NT13 being defined. Wait, that can't be right because in a context-free grammar, every non-terminal must have at least one production rule. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the lines.\n\nWait, the user's grammar is a list of lines starting with the productions. Let me index them:\n\n1. S -> NT71 NT73\n\n2. NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\n3. NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\n4. NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\n5. NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\n6. NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\n7. NT87 -> 't8'\n\n8. NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\n9. NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\n10. NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\n11.

{"custom_id":"request-368","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and then see how the string can be derived from it.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. All the production rules start with a non-terminal symbol on the left side (like S, NT73, etc.) and produce two other non-terminal symbols. The non-terminals eventually derive into terminal symbols, which in this case are strings like 't24', 't20', etc., or other non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is defined as NT73 NT71. So any string generated by this grammar must have S as its root. Let's look at the string to be evaluated:\n\nt24 t20 t35 t10 t22 t20 t2 t10 t11 t39 t43 t36 t20 t11 t24 t2 t46 t46 t43 t22 t13 t48 t24 t22 t11 t20 t35 t22 t48 t13 t43 t13.\n\nHmm, that's a fairly long string, 33 tokens. Now, each production rule splits a non-terminal into two parts, so the string's length is related to the number of production steps. Since S produces two non-terminals, the string will have an odd length if each step adds two tokens, but wait, actually, each production step adds one token because each non-terminal becomes two symbols. Wait, no, let's think again.\n\nIn context-free grammars, each rule replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time a rule is applied. So starting from S (1 symbol), after one step, there are two symbols, then each subsequent step increases the count by one, so the length of the string is 1 + n, where n is the number of steps. Therefore, for a string of length L, n = L - 1 steps are needed. But wait, S starts as one, and each production adds one symbol at each step. Wait, no, each production creates two non-terminals instead of one, so each step increases the count by one (since it replaces one with two, net +1). So to get a string of length 33, we'd need 32 steps, but that's just a side note.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string from the bottom up, trying to match the string to the grammar using the productions.\n\nLet's see. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT73 NT71. So the string must start with NT73 and end with NT71. Looking at the string, the first token is t24, so that's part of NT73's expansion, and the last token is t13, which is part of NT71's expansion. Wait, but NT73 produces NT63 and NT42, right? Because looking at the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. Similarly, NT71 might produce what? Wait, let me check the grammar again. NT71's productions\u2014oh, wait, in the given grammar, the right-hand sides are all two-terminals or non-terminals except for some that are directly terminals. Wait, looking back, I see that NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, while NT71 isn't further defined, but perhaps it's a terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, are any of the symbols on the left side terminals, or are they all non-terminals except the terminals? Let me check: for example, NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, and then NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33, etc., and eventually some of them produce terminals like 't24', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, maybe some of the non-terminals are terminals. But in the grammar, the left-hand side is always a non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be non-terminals or terminals. So for example, NT54 \u2192 't19', which would mean that NT54 is a terminal because it can produce the terminal 't19'. Similarly, NT42 \u2192 't46', so NT42 is a terminal. Wait, that can't be because in context-free grammars, non-terminals are the ones that can be recursively expanded. If NT54 can produce a terminal, then it's a non-terminal that can be replaced by a terminal. Similarly, NT42 can produce a terminal, making it a non-terminal that can eventually be replaced by a terminal symbol.\n\nSo let me list which non-terminals can produce terminal symbols:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22', 't35', 't36', 't10', 't20', 't43', etc. Wait, looking back, some of the rules have terminals on the right side, so those non-terminals can produce terminals. So NT42 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by 't46', NT54 \u2192 't19', NT4 \u2192 't22', NT21 \u2192 't39', etc.\n\nSo, each time a non-terminal is replaced, it can either be another non-terminal or a terminal. So the idea is to build the string from the start symbol by expanding each non-terminal step by step, eventually resulting in all terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's start analyzing the string.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt24 t20 t35 t10 t22 t20 t2 t10 t11 t39 t43 t36 t20 t11 t24 t2 t46 t46 t43 t22 t13 t48 t24 t22 t11 t20 t35 t22 t48 t13 t43 t13.\n\nI'll try to parse this string step by step, trying to match it from the bottom up, using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT73 NT71. So the string must start with NT73 and end with NT71. Let's check the first token: t24. So t24 must be part of NT73's expansion. Looking at the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So NT73 splits into NT63 and NT42. Let's see if t24 is part of either of these.\n\nLooking at NT63's rules: NT63 \u2192 NT90 NT33, and other rules may lead to 't2', 't10', etc. Similarly, NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, which go further, and eventually produce 't46' (from NT42 \u2192 't46') and some others.\n\nWait, but wait: NT54 is a non-terminal that can produce 't19', and NT42 can produce 't46' as well. Let me check the NT63 rules: I see NT90 \u2192 't35' and other rules. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the end of the string and see what it's produced by. The last token is t13. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't13'. Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see a production for 't13' directly, but maybe it comes from a non-terminal that eventually leads to it. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT42 \u2192 't46', so if a non-terminal is used to derive 't46', that's the case. Similarly, NT87 \u2192 't8', which is a terminal. But I'm looking for t13.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the rules to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 | 't46'\nNT63 \u2192 NT90 NT33 | 't2' | 't10'\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4 | 't11'\nNT33 \u2192 NT48 NT42 | 't11'\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 | 't46'\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | 't19' | 't4' | 't2'\nNT21 \u2192 NT39 NT4 | 't39' | 't20' | 't43' | 't48'\nNT39 \u2192 NT11 NT24 | 't43' | 't22' | 't13' \nNT24 \u2192 NT2 NT46 | 't24' | 't48'? Wait, I don't see a rule for NT24 on the right side. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, let me list all the rules again accurately:\n\nS -> NT73 NT71\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string carefully. \n\nFirst, I notice the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The grammar is somewhat complex with many non-terminals and terminals. Each non-terminal seems to expand into two other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals (like 'tX'). \n\nThe target string is a sequence of terminals: `t10 t10 t19 t2 t46 t36 t11 t20 t46 t13 t24 t39 t13 t20 t2 t10 t13 t43 t39 t8 t19 t39 t35 t20 t19 t24 t22 t10 t2 t2 t19 t39 t11 t11 t11`. \n\nMy task is to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing in CNF can be done using a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which works for context-free grammars. Alternatively, I can try to build a derivation tree step by step.\n\nFirst, I should list all the non-terminals and their possible productions:\n\nLet me group them by left-hand side (LHS):\n\n1. S -> NT71 NT73\n2. NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n3. NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n4. NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n5. NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n6. NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n7. NT87 -> 't8'\n8. NT54 -> 't19'\n9. NT42 -> 't46'\n10. NT54 -> 't2'\n11. NT4 -> 't22'\n12. NT21 -> 't39'\n13. NT63 -> 't2'\n14. NT73 -> 't24'\n15. NT27 -> 't11'\n16. NT33 -> 't11'\n17. NT4 -> 't35'\n18. NT21 -> 't43'\n19. NT33 -> 't48'\n20. NT42 -> 't36'\n21.

Let me see if these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at production 21: NT63 -> 't10', which matches the first 't10'. Similarly, production 26 (which isn't listed, but according to the list, NT63 has two rules: 13 and 21). Wait, looking back, NT63 has two productions:\n\n- NT63 -> 't2' (13)\n- NT63 -> 't10' (21)\n\nSo the first 't10' can come from NT63. \n\nNow, the string starts as t10 t10 t19 t2 t46 ... So after the first NT63 (expanding to 't10'), the next symbol is t10 again. That's the second 't10', which would also come from NT63. But looking at how the grammar works, S is S -> NT71 NT73. So S is split into two parts: NT71 and NT73. Each of them needs to derive to their respective sequences.\n\nLet me parse each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the first 't10' from NT63. But in S, NT71 and NT73 each need to produce a sequence starting with their respective productions.\n\nWait, S is split into NT71 and NT73. Let's look at their productions:\n\n- NT71: Looking at the list, NT71 only appears in production 7: NT27 -> NT71 NT4. So NT71 is derived from NT27. But looking at the productions, NT27 can go to NT54 NT4 or NT27.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all non-terminals and their production rules to better visualize them.\n\nList of non-terminals and their productions:\n\n1. S: NT71 NT73\n2. NT27: NT54 NT4 | NT27\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-387","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The starting symbol is S, and according to the rules given, S -> NT71 NT73. That means S is rewritten into two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. So the first thing I notice is that any string generated by this grammar must start with the symbols derived from NT71 and NT73. In other words, the string should start with the sequence that NT71 produces and followed by the sequence from NT73.\n\nLooking at the string I have to evaluate: `t24 t43 t22 t46 t22 t13 t46 t22 t13 t48 t10 t39 t39 t8 t36 t43 t43 t35 t43 t24 t43 t2 t2 t19 t20 t36 t19 t24 t10 t35 t13 t48 t48 t2 t13 t10`.\n\nThat's quite long, but I think it's manageable. Let me see if it begins with t24. Wait, looking at the string, the first element is 't24', which matches NT73 -> 't24'\u2014so that's good. Next, according to NT73, it goes to NT63 and NT42. So after t24, the next part should be the expansion of NT63 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string: after t24, it goes to t43, t22, t46, etc. I might need to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me start by parsing the string using the grammar.\n\nFirst, S is NT71 NT73. So the string must be split into two parts: the first part from NT71 and the second from NT73.\n\nSo, starting with S, the production is NT71 NT73. So I'll need to split the string accordingly.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 't24' (from NT73) followed by 't43' and others. So the beginning of NT73's derivation is 't24' directly, because NT73 -> 't24'. So from NT73, next rule is NT63 NT42.\n\nBut wait, NT73 is 't24', which is a terminal, so it doesn't produce further. So after t24, the NT73 part is done. Now, the NT71 part should start next.\n\nLooking at the string, after t24, the next elements are t43, t22, t46, t22, t13, t46, etc. So the NT71 part is from the start of the string until where? Since NT71 is part of S, and we've already used the t24 (from NT73) to start, the next part should be NT71.\n\nBut looking at the production for NT71: I don't see it directly in the provided grammar rules. Instead, NT71 is in S's first production. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps I need to process NT71 and NT73 step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by creating a parse tree. Starting from S, which splits into NT71 and NT73. The string must start with the symbols from NT71 and NT73 in order.\n\nBut given that, S produces NT71 NT73, so the string must start with NT71's expansion followed by NT73's expansion. So in the given string, the first part must come from NT71, and the second part from NT73.\n\nFrom the string, the first element is 't24', which is from NT73, but according to S, S is NT71 followed by NT73. So the first element should come from NT71 and the second from NT73. So the string starts with 't24' which is supposed to come from NT73, but according to S, the first part is NT71, which would be the first element. Therefore, this suggests that the string does not conform to the grammar, right?\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nS produces NT71 and NT73. So when starting to derive the string, the first symbol should come from NT71, and the second symbol from NT73. So the string's first token must be from NT71, and the second token must be from NT73.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is 't24', which is from NT73. This doesn't align with S, which starts with NT71, followed by NT73. So that would mean the string starts with NT73, which isn't allowed because S starts with NT71.\n\nWait, so that would immediately indicate that the string is not generated by the grammar, right? Because the first symbol should be from NT71, but here it's from NT73.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows multiple derivations, but the very first step must be S->NT71 NT73. So the first symbol must be from NT71, not NT73. So the string starting with 't24' is incorrect.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe the production is S -> NT71 NT73, so in the first step, it's t24, but if NT73 can produce only 't24', then the S must produce NT71 followed by NT73, so the first symbol should indeed be from NT71.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the grammar's S rule again: S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nYes, so the first symbol must come from NT71.\n\nGiven that, the string's first element is 't24', which is from NT73. Thus, this would not be part of the language generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The NT71 is a non-terminal. So perhaps I'm mistaking the start of the string for which part.\n\nNo, S is the starting symbol, and S's production is NT71 followed by NT73. Therefore, the first symbol must be from NT71, not NT73.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with 't24', which is from NT73, which would be the second symbol after NT71.\n\nWait, but in the string, 't24' is the first symbol. But according to S, it's NT71 followed by NT73. So unless NT71 can produce 't24', which it doesn't, as per the given grammar, the string cannot be derived.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, NT71 isn't listed; perhaps it's only mentioned in S's production. So NT71 is a non-terminal that doesn't have its own production in the given rules. That seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the grammar provided for the problem is: S -> NT71 NT73. Then there are other productions, like NT73 -> NT63 NT42, and others for each NT... So perhaps NT71 is another non-terminal, but I don't see its production rule. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals seem to be combinations like NT73, NT27, etc. There's no production for NT71 except what's in S: S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nSo, if S's production is NT71 followed by NT73, then NT71 must have a production rule of some sort. But in the provided grammar, it's only given for S. Perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, the grammar's lines are of the form NTxx -> NT... So, for example:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nSimilarly, NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nI don't see any rules for NT71. So perhaps NT71 can only derive a terminal symbol or nothing. If that's the case, then the first symbol after S is NT71, which doesn't have a production, unless it's just a terminal. But in the given grammar, NT71 is a non-terminal, so it must produce some strings.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the grammar has a mistake, but assuming it's correct, let's proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible that NT71 is a terminal. But in the problem statement, it's written as NT... which suggests it's a non-terminal. Unless there's a different convention. Alternatively, maybe the NT stands for something else, like a non-terminal code, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production for NT71 is missing in the provided grammar, making NT71 a non-terminal without a production, which would mean that S -> NT71 NT73 can't produce any terminal strings because NT71 can't be replaced, leading to infinite loops or non-derivations.

{"custom_id":"request-396","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. So, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly one non-terminal or terminal on the right. The string to evaluate is `t13 t24 t22 t48 t13 t24 t35 t35 t39 t39 t46 t24 t20 t43 t24 t22 t43 t10 t48 t10 t36 t2 t19 t24 t10 t11 t13 t10 t11 t22 t35 t11 t20 t43 t2 t8`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is producing. Since it's in CNF, it's either left- or right-lookahead, but for this purpose, it's more straightforward to parse the string using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals (like t13, t24, etc.). Each step in the parsing process should replace a non-terminal with a sequence of terminals according to the rules.\n\nLet's start by identifying the start symbol. In Chomsky Normal Form, the start symbol is usually S, but looking at the rules, S appears multiple times:\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT42 -> NT46 NT27\n- S also seems to be involved in the productions, but since S is the start symbol, perhaps it's followed by NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo the first step would be S -> NT71 NT73. Now, we need to expand NT71 and NT73 using the given rules.\n\nLooking at NT73: It can be NT63 NT42. So now, the string is built from N73, which breaks down into N63 and N42.\n\nNT63: NT2 NT33. So now, we have N63 expanding into N2 and N33.\n\nWait, hold on. The grammar appears to have multiple rules for the same non-terminals. For example, NT54 appears in several places with different expansions, like 't19', 't2', 't21', etc. So this might have a lot of overlapping subproblems, but for this situation, since our string doesn't involve 't19' or 't2' from NT54, maybe those can be ignored for now.\n\nWait no, the string given is composed of many 't's, which are terminals. So in the expansions, we need to ensure that the non-terminals eventually resolve to exactly these terminals.\n\nLet me write down the entire string again: `t13 t24 t22 t48 t13 t24 t35 t35 t39 t39 t46 t24 t20 t43 t24 t22 t43 t10 t48 t10 t36 t2 t19 t24 t10 t11 t13 t10 t11 t22 t35 t11 t20 t43 t2 t8`\n\nBut wait, that doesn't look right. Wait, no, the string is as provided: each token is separated by space, so each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So each symbol is a terminal, like t13, t24, etc.\n\nSo each symbol in the string must match the terminal from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals can produce terminals or other non-terminals. So S starts the derivation.\n\nBut actually, the string is 33 tokens long, and each token is one terminal. So let's think recursively.\n\nEach production rule in the grammar is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, for example, S -> NT71 NT73. Then NT73 -> NT63 NT42, and so on. But the only leaves (terminals) are when a non-terminal is directly replaced by a single terminal. For example, NT87 -> 't8', NT54 can be 't19', 't2', 't21', etc. Similarly, others like NT27 -> 't11', NT33->'t11'.\n\nSo the process would involve starting at S, then splitting into NT71 and NT73, each of which would split into their respective subterms.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, trying to match it using the grammar.\n\nFirst, S splits into NT71 and NT73.\n\nNT73: NT63 => NT2 NT33.\n\nThen NT63 becomes NT2 and NT33.\n\nNT33 is 't11'.\n\nWait, but NT33 in the grammar has rules: NT33-> t11, t11, t11, etc. So NT33 can expand to 't11'.\n\nSo NT63 would be NT2 and 't11'.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 would be...\n\nWait, hold on, this is getting complicated. Let me break down the string by grouping the right-hand sides of the production rules and see if the sequence matches.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string from the start, applying the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, given the time constraints, I could check if the string can be built from the leftmost derivation of the grammar, respecting the structure.\n\nGiven that the problem is whether the string is generated by the grammar, here's a step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. The start symbol is S.\n\n2. S expands into NT71 NT73.\n\n3. Next, NT73 expands into NT63 NT42.\n\n4. Then NT63 is NT2 NT33, which becomes 't11'.\n\n5. NT42 is NT4 NT27, which then needs to expand. But in our string, after 't11', the next token is 't24', so we need to see if NT4 can match.\n\nWait, looking at NT27->'t11', but NT4 is a rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the ordering wrong. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be built by recursively applying the production rules.\n\nAnother approach is to try to identify the structure of the string and see if it matches the required expansions.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps the initial approach is too long, and I can think about the possible structure.\n\nAlternatively, I think the string has a t8 at the end, which is generated by NT87. So in the derivation, S must eventually produce a path that includes NT87.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT87 is 't8'.\n\nAnother part of the string is 't19', which can be generated by NT54.\n\nHowever, the given string is as follows:\n\nt13 t24 t22 t48 t13 t24 t35 t35 t39 t39 t46 t24 t20 t43 t24 t22 t43 t10 t48 t10 t36 t2 t19 t24 t10 t11 t13 t10 t11 t22 t35 t11 t20 t43 t2 t8\n\nWait, but how do we get a t36, t22, etc., from the grammar? Because in the grammar, the only terminals are as follows:\n\nNT87: 't8'\n\nNT54: 't19', 't2', 't21'\n\nNT73: 't24'\n\nNT27: 't11'\n\nNT33: 't11'\n\nNT4 is 't35', 't35', 't39', etc.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the rules again:\n\nSome non-terminals can expand into terminals. Let's list the terminal non-terminals:\n\nNT54 can expand into 't19', 't2', 't21'\n\nNT73 can expand into 't24'\n\nNT33 can expand into 't11'\n\nSo, in the string, the terminals are things like t13, t24, t22, t48, etc., which are not in the grammar as terminal outputs.\n\nWait, is that a problem? Because if the grammar doesn't have a production for, say, NT22 => 't22', then t22 cannot be generated by this grammar. So if the string contains t22, and the grammar doesn't have a rule for 't22', then the string is not in the language.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces t22.

{"custom_id":"request-403","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the structure of the grammar: it's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. This should simplify parsing because each step in the derivation only replaces one symbol with two symbols, either non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT71 NT73. So the string must start with whatever NT71 produces and then whatever NT73 produces.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the string to be evaluated: `t39 t48 t8 t46 t2 t13 t20 t2 t13 t10 t20 t24 t10 t36 t11 t46 t20 t22 t22 t36 t8 t36 t43 t22 t22 t48 t43 t39 t2 t20 t2 t2 t39 t35 t46 t2 t36`.\n\nThat's a lot of terminals, all 't' followed by some number. So I need to figure out if the grammar can produce this sequence.\n\nLet me check the possible productions for NT71 and NT73.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nSo after S, the first part must come from NT71 and the second from NT73, which in turn branches into NT63 NT42. So overall, S leads to NT71 NT63 NT42.\n\nLooking at NT71, it must be broken down further. Let me see what NT71 can produce. Scanning through the productions, I don't see a rule for NT71 except as part of S. So maybe NT71 has other productions? Wait, looking back, I see NT71 is only in the production S-> NT71 NT73. So perhaps I'm missing something, maybe NT71 can't be broken down further, or maybe it's a terminal? Wait, the grammar only shows S->NT71 NT73, and in the rest, I see a lot of NTs with two terminals on the right side. So maybe NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals that further produce more NTs.\n\nWait, let me check all the NTs. It seems like every NT in the grammar is a non-terminal that can only be broken down into two other NTs. For example, NT71 isn't further specified, so perhaps that's a problem. Maybe I need to check if the NTs can reach terminals.\n\nWait no, the productions only show the rules for the given NTs. So perhaps S is S-> NT71 NT73, and each of these NTs can be broken down further as per their own productions. So for example, NT73 may produce NT63 NT42, so that becomes part of the string.\n\nLet me try to outline the structure. Starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nSo that gives us S \u2192 NT71 NT63 NT42\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first few tokens are t39, t48, t8, etc. Let me see if the NTs can produce those.\n\nBut wait, each production for the NTs seems to be two NTs on the right, so I'll need to recursively break them down until I reach terminals, which I can then compare to the input string.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to split it into the possible NTs and see if each step can be matched by the grammar.\n\nBut that might be a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be grouped into a sequence of products that match the grammar's NT productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the entire string as a list and try to match it by applying the grammar rules in reverse. Each step would involve finding a substring that matches a production rule and replacing it with the left-hand side.\n\nLet me attempt to walk through the string.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt39 t48 t8 t46 t2 t13 t20 t2 t13 t10 t20 t24 t10 t36 t11 t46 t20 t22 t22 t36 t8 t36 t43 t22 t22 t48 t43 t39 t2 t20 t2 t2 t39 t35 t46 t2 t36.\n\nFirst, perhaps start by looking for NT71 and NT73, which produce NT71 NT73. But according to the grammar, S is only S-> NT71 NT73, so the first step is that S must produce two NTs: NT71 and NT73.\n\nBut in the string, it's the first token, t39. Hmm. Maybe the NT71 somehow produces a sequence starting with t39, and NT73 starts with t48.\n\nWait, but NT71 and NT73 are separate in the production, so the NT71's derived string comes first, followed by the NT73's derived string.\n\nSo the entire string must be the concatenation of the two parts: one part generated by NT71, and another by NT73.\n\nSimilarly, since NT73 is NT63 NT42, its derived string is the concatenation of the two parts: NT63 and NT42.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is a concatenation of NT71's string and then NT63's string and then NT42's string.\n\nSo, the overall approach is to see if the entire string can be split into three parts: the first part is generated by NT71, then a part generated by NT63, then a part generated by NT42.\n\nSimilarly, each of these parts (NT71, NT63, NT42) can further be broken down into their own productions.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStart with the whole string. Let's denote it as Split 1: entire string.\n\nWe expect it to be NT71's production followed by NT73's production, which is NT63 NT42. So S is NT71 NT73, but NT73 is NT63 NT42. So overall, the string would have to be NT71's string concatenated with NT63's string concatenated with NT42's string.\n\nFirst, check if the string starts with what NT71 can produce. But NT71 is a non-terminal; in the grammar, it's not defined further, so perhaps I need to see if there are any productions for NT71 beyond what's given.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar shows S as the only production involving NT71: S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nWait, I just realized that some NTs may have similar structures. For example, NT73 -> NT63 NT42.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps I should approach this by breaking down the grammar as much as possible and seeing what NT71, NT63, etc., can produce.\n\nLet me list the productions again for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nWait, wait, I see that NT42 is shown twice:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nWait, that must have been a typo. I think the correct list is:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nWait, that's the same production again.

Wait, no, in the grammar, every production's right side must have two symbols, which can be a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or one terminal.

Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side, except for the start symbols which can produce terminals. Looking at the rules, they all seem to consist of two non-terminals on the left except for those ending with terminals like 't8', 't20', etc. So, that fits CNF.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t8 t20 t22 t35 t24 t39 t22 t22 t43 t10 t46 t20 t46 t24 t13 t48 t35 t36 t13 t36 t2 t48 t11 t48 t36 t13 t22 t19 t2 t22 t22 t13 t13 t20 t22 t35 t48 t36`.\n\nThat's a long string. I notice it's a series of 't' tokens with numbers. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. So, each 'tX' must correspond to a terminal produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. \n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see which non-terminals correspond to 't's. Scanning through:\n\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27, NT36 NT27 again? Or wait, actually, in the rules, some go to 't42' or 't22', etc. Wait, no: the rules are written with the arrows, so each production on the right is another non-terminal except when it's written as e.g., 't8'. So, for example, NT87 -> 't8' means NT87 can produce a terminal 't8'. Similarly, NT54 can produce multiple things: 't19', 't2', etc.\n\nSo each 't' in the string must come from a terminal production. So first, let's parse the string into individual tokens: it's a list of 't's with numbers, like t8, t20, etc.\n\nNow, the string starts with t8. Looking at the grammar, 't8' is directly produced by NT87. So to get t8, NT87 must be the first non-terminal used in the derivation.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which immediately goes to NT71 NT73. So each step of the derivation must follow the rules. Let me try to represent the derivation.\n\nStart: S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nSo, first, I need to produce t20. Let me look at the grammar.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string starts with t8, but that must come from NT87, so perhaps the initial NT73 is breaking down into something that leads to t8 in the first position.\n\nWait, but S is NT71 NT73. So first, NT71 and NT73 each must generate some sequences, and their concatenation should form the string.\n\nLet me see: the string starts with t8. So that suggests that either NT73 is generating something that starts with t8, or perhaps NT71 generates the first part. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t8 t20 t22 t35 t24 t39 t22 t22 t43 t10 t46 t20 t46 t24 t13 t48 t35 t36 t13 t36 t2 t48 t11 t48 t36 t13 t22 t19 t2 t22 t22 t13 t13 t20 t22 t35 t48 t36.\n\nSo S => NT71 NT73.\n\nNT71 must produce the beginning part of the string, and NT73 must produce the end part. Or maybe it's the other way around. Depending on how NT71 and NT73 split the production.\n\nBut let me think: perhaps I can model the generation as NT71 producing the first part and NT73 producing the second.\n\nAlternatively, maybe either NT71 or NT73 could produce the first few 't's. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t8, which comes from NT87. So perhaps NT73 is producing a sequence that starts with NT87.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT73: NT73 -> NT63 NT42.\n\nSo, NT73 can only produce two non-terminals, NT63 and NT42. So the second symbol after NT73 would be t20 maybe? Let's see: does NT42 produce a 't20'? Looking at the rules, NT42 has productions:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the rules are:\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nBut in the list, I see NT42 -> 't46', etc., so let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT42 has several productions. Let me list them:\n\nLooking at the original grammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT63 -> NT10 or other things?\n\nWait, let me list all the NT definitions as per the given grammar.\n\nHere's a list of all NT productions:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT63 -> NT2 (but 't2', so that's a terminal)\nNT10 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27, but wait, how many options does NT42 have? Looking back.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT42-> NT36 NT27\n\nBut also, in the list:\n\nNT42 -> 't46' (probably as another production)\n\nWait, let me re-express the grammar more clearly, since it's written in a non-standard way:\n\nThe grammar is given as S -> NT71 NT73, and each non-terminal on the left, with right-hand side productions. So each line defines a production for the left side.\n\nSo each production is written as NT[...] -> production, which is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT63 -> NT2 (terminal 't2' maybe, or 't2' is NT2? Wait, in the grammar, 't2' is written as a terminal, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, some of these are NTs that produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 has several options: NT21, 't19', 't2', 't48', etc.\n\nWait, wait, let me parse each production correctly.\n\nEach line is a non-terminal on the left, and the right is either a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo for NT73, the production is NT63 NT42. That means NT73 is replaced by NT63 and NT42.\n\nSimilarly, for NT54, there are several productions listed, such as NT21, 't19', 't2', 't48', NT48, etc. So each line is a different production rule.\n\nSo, for instance, NT54 can produce:\n\n- NT21 and something else (another NT rule, but wait, NT54's rule is written as 't21' \u2014 no, wait: the user wrote:\n\n\"NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT54 -> 't48'\n\nNT54 -> 't21' ?? Wait, perhaps I misinterpret.\n\nWait, no. Each production is a separate rule. So, for each left-hand side, there are multiple RHS options.\n\nSo, for NT54, the productions are:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT54 -> 't48'\nNT54 -> NT48?\n\nWait, no, because in the list, it's written as NT54-> 't2' and NT54-> 't48' etc.\n\nWait, I think it's clearer if I list all the productions:\n\nNT73: NT63 NT42\n\nNT63: NT2 (terminal t2?

{"custom_id":"request-410","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two symbols (could be terminals or non-terminals) on the right. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the strings and the grammar to see where things might go wrong. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't20 t2 t43 t13...'. Okay, so all the symbols are terminals, meaning they need to be derived directly from the grammar's terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules like S -> NT71 NT73, and each NT has specific rules leading to other NTs or terminals. So, to parse the string, I need to see if it can be generated by expanding S through these rules.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with 't20'. Looking at the grammar, where do 't20' come from? I see NT27-> 't20' and NT71 is part of the S production. Also, NT27 appears in multiple productions like NT27-> NT54 NT4, which eventually lead to 't20' from other rules.\n\nWait, the first symbol is 't20', which I think is produced by NT27. Let me check the grammar for 't20'. Oh, in NT27-> NT39, and then NT33-> 't11' or 't33'? Wait, maybe I'm getting lost. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe string is quite long, from 't20 t2... up to 't48...' So it's a sequence of 40 tokens. Since the grammar is context-free and in CNF, each step in the derivation will add two symbols, but wait, no\u2014wait, Chomsky normal form allows productions to be terminals and non-terminals, so each rule's right-hand side is two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nHmm, but the way the string is structured, it's a sequence of terminals, so each production must be expanding to terminal symbols eventually. But the grammar might have paths where it's generating multiple terminals in a row.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe it's easier to approach the problem by checking each token in the string against the possible productions, ensuring that each step can generate the required terminal symbol. Since the string is all terminals, the grammar must have a way to reach each of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the first token, 't20'. In the grammar, NT27-> 't20', yes, that's one way. So maybe the initial expansion is S-> NT71 NT73, then NT71 might be expanded to produce 't20' through some chain of NTs. \n\nSimilarly, the second token is 't2', which can be produced by NT73-> 't2'. So that's straightforward. \n\nThe third token is 't43', which I need to trace back. Looking at NT43, but wait, I don't see a production for NT43. Wait, maybe NT42 has a production or another NT leading to 't43', but I don't see that. Hmm, is 't43' even a terminal in the grammar? Or is it from some NT that eventually can go to 't43'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't43'. Looking through all the productions, I see rules for NT36, NT42, NT63, etc., but nothing for 't43'. So if the string has a 't43', the grammar must have a production rule for a non-terminal that can derive 't43'. But in this grammar, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces 't43'. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The production rules include NT27-> 't20', NT33-> 't11' or 't33', NT42-> 't46', etc. I don't see a production leading to 't43'. So if the string has 't43', that implies the grammar can produce 't43', but looking at the given rules, there's no 't43' terminal. So that would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar because 't43' can't be derived.\n\nWait, but maybe 't43' is from a non-terminal that I'm missing. Let me look again. The NTs are NT27, NT33, NT42, NT54, NT63, etc. None of these have a production for 't43'. So 't43' can't appear in any derivation, making the entire string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some expansion path where some NT can derive 't43'. Let me see, for example, is there a way for an NT to eventually derive 't43'? Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT42-> 't46' or other rules, but no, that leads to 't46', not 't43'. NT21 has 't39' and 't24' as options. NT33 produces 't11' or 't33', which might loop but not reach 't43'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a deeper expansion, like through multiple steps, but I can't see a way to get to 't43' because none of the rules have 't43' as a terminal.\n\nSo if the string has a 't43', the grammar can't generate it because there's no production for that terminal. Thus, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm missing something. Maybe the NT42 is part of a longer chain that could produce more symbols, but looking back, all the NT42 rules end in t46 or other terminals that might not lead to t43. So, in the string, any 't43's would make it impossible.\n\nTherefore, the presence of 't43' in the string suggests that the grammar can't generate it. So the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the grammar is structured so each production is either two terminals or a non-terminal with two non-terminals. That's typical for Chomsky normal form, which is useful. Looking at the start symbol, it's S, and S expands to NT71 NT73. Then I guess each of these Ns are non-terminals that further expand.\n\nThe string I need to check is:\n\nt11 t48 t19 t46 t10 t43 t46 t48 t10 t20 t11 t8 t22 t22 t10 t48 t43 t46 t11 t35 t8 t36 t19 t43 t36 t39 t39 t22 t39 t36 t46 t48 t20 t13 t19 t48 t10 t2 t36.\n\nWow, that's a long string with a bunch of t followed by numbers. I notice that several symbols are non-terminals that can expand into combinations of other symbols, and some can directly produce a terminal (t followed by a number) or others.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string from the top down, starting with S, and see if I can build the string by expanding symbols correctly. Since the grammar is CNF, it's efficient for such parsing, maybe even using something like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I need to go that deep. Alternatively, I can try to see if each part of the string can be represented by the productions.\n\nLooking at S -> NT71 NT73. So the string should start with NT71 followed by NT73. Let's see what NT71 and NT73 generate.\n\nLet me check the productions:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT63 is one of the non-terminals. Let me see NT63's productions: NT63 -> NT2 -> ...

So actually, the rule is NT63 -> NT21 NT87, right? So when I look at NT63-> 't2', that's if NT21 is a rule leading to 't2', but that's not correct. Hmm.)\n\nWait, I think I need to parse each production correctly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\n- NT63 rules are somewhere else.

Let's see:\n\n- Rule 13: NT63 -> 't2'\n\n- Rule 21: NT63 -> 't10'\n\nWait, so NT63 is a non-terminal that can produce either 't2' or 't10'.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 is produced in rules 4,9,20.\n\nNT42's rules are:\n\n- Rule 4: NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\n- Rule 9: NT42 -> 't46'\n\n- Rule 20: NT42-> 't36'\n\nSo NT42 can produce either 't46', 't36', or expand into NT36 NT27.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 can produce multiple things: rule 5: NT54->NT21 NT87; rule8: NT54->'t19'; rule10: 't2'; rule21: 't13'? Wait no, rule10 is NT54->'t2', rule8 is NT54->'t19', and rule21 is another 't2' or wait, rule21 is NT63->'t10' as per above.\n\nWait, perhaps I should tabulate each non-terminal and their possible rules:\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n1. S\n   - S -> NT71 NT73\n\n2. NT71\n   - I don't see NT71 being defined as a production, so it must correspond to a terminal? Looking at the provided string, no 't71' appears. So in the given string, do any tokens start with 't71'? Looking back, the string starts with t11, t48, t19... Nope, no t71. So perhaps NT71 produces 't something'.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol S uses NT71 NT73, but the string doesn't start with t71, so maybe there's a rule I missed. Wait, checking, in the provided grammar rules, NT71 is only mentioned in rule 23: NT71->'t48'. Hmm, no, that's not correct. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the list:\n\nRule 23: NT71 -> 't48'\n\nYes, so that's correct. So NT71 is 't48', and similarly NT73 uses production rule 2: NT73-> NT63 NT42.\n\nSo S starts with NT71 followed by NT73, which is 't48' followed by NT73.\n\nBut the first token of the string is 't11', so that doesn't seem to match. Hmm. That suggests maybe I messed up.\n\nWait, let's check: the start symbol is S, which is NT71 NT73. So in the start symbol, we have two parts: NT71 and NT73. Now, NT71's rules: looking back, in the rules, rule 23 is S-> NT71 NT73, but wait, for each non-terminal. Wait, no, the initial list of rules includes for NT71: rule 23 is NT71 -> 't48'.\n\nSo NT71 is a non-terminal that can produce 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 as per rule 2 is NT73-> NT63 NT42\n\nSo when expanding S, we have S -> 't48' (NT71 produces 't48') followed by NT73.\n\nBut this would mean the string must start with 't48'.

So, NT71 -> 't48'\n\nSo, S is NT71 NT73, which translates to 't48' followed by NT73's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't35'. But wait, S starts with 't48' because S is NT71, which is 't48'. That's a problem because the string starts with 't35', which doesn't match 't48'. So that suggests that either I'm misunderstanding the productions or perhaps there's an error. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I forgot some NT71 productions. Wait, in the initial list, NT71 is only present once. Let me see:\n\nIn the grammar, NT71 is only listed as 't48' because I don't see any other productions for NT71, except maybe S itself. So, S is the only place where NT71 appears, and NT71 only goes to 't48'.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string must start with 't48' followed by NT73's production.\n\nBut the string starts with 't35', so that seems impossible. Unless I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding which non-terminals lead to which terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions to make sure.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 has several options: NT21 NT87, 't8', 't19', 't2', 't22', 't35'\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n- NT27 -> 't11'\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't35' (so maybe there's another production for NT4?)\nWait no, previously, for NT4, only 't22' was listed, but in the same grammar, another production for NT4 is 't35'. But wait, looking again, the grammar has:\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nSo, NT4 can go to 't22' or 't35'.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 has several options beyond NT21 NT87, including 't8', 't19', 't2', 't22', 't35'.\n\nSo, I need to check if the string can be produced by expanding S as NT71 NT73.\n\nSo, first, S expands to 't48' followed by NT73's expansion, which is 't24'.\n\nSo, the first two tokens must be 't48' followed by something, but the given string starts with 't35'. That can't be possible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with 't35', but S's expansion starts with 't48'.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread somewhere. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking again, the start symbol is S, which is NT71 NT73. NT71 is only 't48', so the first token must be 't48', followed by NT73.\n\nGiven the string starts with 't35', it's impossible, right?\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in thinking that NT71 only produces 't48'. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the provided grammar, under NT71, there's only one production: 't48'. So yes, NT71 can only go to 't48'.\n\nWait, but in another look, I notice that in the initial grammar provided for the user, under NT71, it's written as:\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nSo that's correct. So S -> NT71 NT73 becomes 't48' followed by the expansion of NT73.\n\nTherefore, the string must start with 't48', but it starts with 't35'. So the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to reach 't35' through some expansion. But looking back, S can only produce 't48' followed by NT73's expansion, which starts with 't24'. So the entire start is 't48 t24...'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't35', which is not possible.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something. Maybe the string is being parsed differently, but in a context-free grammar, the entire string must be consumed from left to right by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a way to get 't35' as part of the expansion of NT71 or NT73.\n\nWait, but S only produces NT71 followed by NT73. So the first symbol must come from NT71, which is 't48'.\n\nUnless there's a possibility that NT71 somehow can produce 't35', but in the grammar provided, NT71 only goes to 't48'.\n\nTherefore, I'm convinced that the string does not start with 't48', which is required by S.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's good because it simplifies parsing, especially since CFT often uses such structures.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with the start symbol S. The productions from S are all at the top, and I see that S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, S generates two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. That means any string generated by S must consist of the concatenation of whatever NT71 generates and whatever NT73 generates.\n\nI'll start by looking at each non-terminal and their productions to see how they derive to terminals. Let's list out all the non-terminals and their possible derivations:\n\n1. NT71 \u2192 NT48 NT35 (I notice there's a 't48' and 't35' terminal. Wait, does NT71 \u2192 't48' t35?

{"custom_id":"request-435","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either a terminal or a non-terminal on the right. No rules have \u03b5 (epsilon) as a production.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t36 t36 t36 t2 t22 t8 t36 t36 t48 t48 t48 t43 t8 t39 t22 t2 t22 t11 t10 t22 t22 t36 t13 t11 t24 t22 t39 t22 t43 t43 t11 t46 t43 t39 t8 t8`.\n\nFirst, I'll recap the grammar rules to understand how the string can be broken down.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nSo, the entire string must be derived from S, which splits into NT71 and NT73. Looking at the string, it starts with t36 t36 t36 t2..., which suggests that S might start with some t36s.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT71 can only be replaced by S? Wait, no. Let's see: NT71 isn't listed as a non-terminal; looking at the rules, S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the start symbol S produces NT71 and NT73, which are other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT71 rule: actually, in the grammar provided, the non-terminals are S, NT71, NT73, NT27, NT42, NT54, NT36, NT90, NT87, etc. Wait, no, in the given rules, S is the start, and then NT71 and NT73 are the next level. But looking through the rules, I don't see NT71 or NT73 being further broken down. That seems odd because if S \u2192 NT71 NT73, then NT71 and NT73 must be terminals or we need production rules for them.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again: It seems I missed that NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals. Because S \u2192 NT71 NT73, which would be two non-terminals, but in the given grammar, the only options are combinations of NTs and terminals. But in the provided grammar, I don't see NT71 or NT73 having any production rules. That might be a mistake, because in CNF, all non-terminals must have production rules.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's an error in the question, or perhaps I misread it. Let me check the original grammar:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nHmm, so NT71 and NT73 don't have any production rules. That can't be right because in a proper Chomsky Normal Form grammar, all non-terminals must have at least one production. So maybe it's a typo, and the user intended S to be S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and NT71 and NT73 have productions, perhaps missing in the transcription.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT71 and NT73 are terminals. But that's unlikely because they seem to be non-terminals since other rules branch into them. But looking at the string, it starts with t36 t36 t36 t2..., and we have NT42, NT54, etc., which are non-terminals but also produce terminals. For example, NT54 can produce 't2', 't19', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial production S \u2192 NT71 NT73 is a mistake, and it should have been something else, but given the rules, I'll proceed as I have them.\n\nBut since NT71 is derived from S, let's see what comes next. If NT71 and NT73 don't have any rules, then they can't produce anything except perhaps nothing, which would imply that S produces two strings that can't be expanded further, making S a terminal. But that can't be since the string is quite long and starts with t36s, which are probably non-terminals.\n\nThis suggests that there's a problem with the grammar as provided, but perhaps it's intended that S is the only production, and the others are included for context. Maybe the user intended S to be the only production, but that doesn't make sense because S would then derive nothing, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that S is followed by NT71 and NT73, which, due to some reason, don't have rules, but that would imply that S can't be used to produce anything, which conflicts with the string provided.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the first step is to check if the string can be parsed using the provided grammar, assuming that S can generate the entire string by applying the rules.\n\nLet me start analyzing the string. The string begins with t36 t36 t36 t2... Let's see what productions can generate t36.\n\nLooking at the rules, t36 is the terminal, so it must come from a production that includes t36 as a right-hand side.\n\nLooking for rules where t36 is a terminal, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11' (but wait, looking again, no, in the rules, NT33 has two productions: one is NT21 NT4 and another is 't11'. Wait, no, in the given rules, I think I misread, so let me re-examine:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, so I should list all the rules correctly.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT63 \u2192 't2'\n- NT73 \u2192 't24'\n- NT27 \u2192 't11'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT21 \u2192 't43'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't10'\n- NT27 \u2192 't20'\n- NT71 \u2192 't48'\n- NT63 \u2192 't13'\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nSo, I can now list the terminal symbols as 't2', 't48', 't36', 't19', 't46', etc.\n\nNow, t36 is generated by which non-terminals? Looking at the rules, t36 is only on the right-hand side of NT42 (NT42 \u2192 t36) and also part of NT36's production (NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33). So, to get t36, we can have either:\n\n1. NT42 directly producing t36.\n\n2. NT36 producing t90 and t33, but to get t36 from that, the production must somehow combine t90 and t33 to produce t36, which may not be possible because both are non-terminals (unless one of them is supposed to produce t36).\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the case.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of symbols, each looking like 't' followed by a number. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll remind myself of what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where 'a' is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S, and all non-terminals can produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT71 and NT73. So the string must start with the concatenation of whatever NT71 and NT73 generate. NT73 in turn produces NT63 and NT42, which themselves break down further until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is: `t19 t20 t39 t36 t13 t10 t13 t19 t11 t19 t46 t36 t19 t43 t24 t43 t2 t10 t24 t39 t10 t19 t22 t46 t11 t22 t8 t11 t20 t8 t8 t2 t24 t43 t43 t39 t10 t24 t24 t35 t46`.\n\nMy initial thought is that the string should be generated by applying the productions from S step by step. Each production adds non-terminals until we reach terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string should consist of a series of terminals, each corresponding to the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string backward because the first thing to do when faced with a string and a grammar is to see if it can be generated by applying productions in reverse.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is 't46'. Looking at the right-hand sides of the grammar, 't46' appears in NT27 \u2192 NT11 NT22, NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, NT63 \u2192 NT10 NT33, NT27 \u2192 NT11 NT20, NT33 \u2192 NT11 NT19, NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 (among others). Wait, but in the grammar, certain NTs have terminals as their right-hand sides. Let me list what NTs produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t2, t19, t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t22, t35\n- NT21 \u2192 t39, t21 (Wait, no, NT21 \u2192 't39'), but in the given grammar, NT21's productions are: NT54 \u2192 t21 (twice?), NT63 \u2192 t10, NT27 \u2192 t20, etc. Similarly, NT42 can produce t46 via NT54 \u2192 t2, but wait no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the user probably meant each line is a production for each NT. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nThe given grammar is as follows, with each line representing a production for a particular non-terminal:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nSo, from these, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT54 -> t19\n- NT42 -> t46\n- NT54 -> t2\n- NT4 -> t22, t35\n- NT21 -> t39, t43\n- NT33 -> t11, t48\n- NT63 -> t2, t13\n- NT90 -> t35\n- NT73 -> t24\n- NT27 -> t11\n- NT73 -> t24\n- NT27 -> t20\n- NT21 -> t39, t43\n- NT33 -> t11, t48\n- NT42 -> t36, t27, etc.\n\nWait, but for each line, the production is for that particular non-terminal. So, for example, NT54 can produce 't2', 't19', and also via other paths.\n\nBut looking specifically, in the grammar, NT54 can produce 't2', 't19', and also continues to produce other non-terminals. But since we're in CNF, each production can only handle two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for NT54, the possible terminal productions are:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n\nAdditionally, looking at NT42, the production is NT42 \u2192 't46', which is a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, let's list all the non-terminals that direct to terminals:\n\n- NT54 can produce 't2', 't19'\n\n- NT4 can produce 't22' and 't35'\n\n- NT21 can produce 't39' and 't43'\n\n- NT33 can produce 't11' and 't48'\n\n- NT63 can produce 't2' and 't13'\n\n- NT90 can produce 't35'\n\n- NT73 can produce 't24'\n\n- NT27 can produce 't11' and 't20'\n\nSo, when we see a terminal symbol, we should check if it's one of these and see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers. To parse this string, let's think of it as a sequence of symbols, each of which must come from some production. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost non-terminal expands into two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) at each step until all are terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward approach is to see if the string can be broken down into segments that correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to simulate the parse by starting from the string and working backward, trying to split the string into the right-hand sides of the productions, working from the start symbol S.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT71 NT73, the string should start with the concatenation of NT71 and NT73. Let's look at the string. The first two symbols are 't19' and 't20', but wait, 't20' as a single symbol. So that would correspond to NT73, because NT73 produces 't24' (from the grammar), but also in the given grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nSo perhaps, starting with 't19' and 't20' is not correct because in the grammar, NT73 produces 't24', but looking back, the grammar has NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So, unless there's a chain leading to a terminal from NT63 and NT42.\n\nWait, but let's look more carefully:\n\nThe grammar says:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT63 \u2192 t2, t13\n\nNT42 can produce t46, but also NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27.\n\nLooking at NT63: produces t2, t13.\n\nNT42: can produce t46, or via NT36 \u2192 t90, t33; and NT27 \u2192 t11, t20.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t19. Let me check the grammar: NT54 can produce 't19', and the string starts with t19, so does it come from NT54? But in NT73, the production is NT63 NT42, not NT54. So the initial expansion has to be NT71 and NT73, with NT73 expanding to NT63 and NT42. Therefore, the initial two non-terminals after S would be NT71 and NT73. Let's see NT71's productions.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nSo when S expands, it becomes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-445","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall CNF. CNF is a special case of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier, as each production step only introduces two non-terminals. I'm not exactly sure how that affects parsing right now, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nThe grammar given has production rules that all go from a non-terminal (NT) to two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and each of those NTs splits into more NTs or terminals. The terminals are things like 't8', 't20', etc. So each terminal is a leaf node in the parse tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t20 t36 t8 t2 t46 t20 t8 t13 t46 t13 t36 t10 t35 t20 t11 t36 t13 t43 t36 t2 t39 t11 t24 t22 t2 t36 t22 t13 t22 t22 t13 t20 t20 t36 t20 t24 t20 t2 t48 t8 t48`\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to construct a parse tree for the string using the given grammar. But with such a long string, that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can try to break the string down into segments that match the production rules.\n\nWait, but maybe I can look for patterns. Each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two parts, so perhaps the string can be viewed as a series of splits where each split corresponds to a production rule.\n\nLet me see. Starting with the start symbol S. The first production for S is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the entire string should be the concatenation of two sequences, one generated by NT71 and the other by NT73.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if the first part (before a certain point) is generated by NT71 and the second part (after that point) is generated by NT73.\n\nBut wait, I don't know where the split occurs. Hmm. That might be problematic. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, each production rule in CNF represents a step in the grammar that can be used to expand the non-terminals until all are terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation only adds one terminal and splits non-terminals, so the process is orderly.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps building the parse tree bottom-up. Let me consider that each production is a node, and their children are the parts that produce the constituents.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to write the entire string and try to map it back to the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the string as a sequence of non-terminals and terminals and see if it matches.\n\nAlternatively, I can parse the string by trying each production and seeing if it can derive the string.\n\nLet me write down the string as a list of tokens for clarity:\n\nt20, t36, t8, t2, t46, t20, t8, t13, t46, t13, t36, t10, t35, t20, t11, t36, t13, t43, t36, t2, t39, t11, t24, t22, t2, t36, t22, t13, t22, t22, t13, t20, t20, t36, t20, t24, t20, t2, t48, t8, t48.\n\nThat's 39 tokens. So the derivation needs to produce exactly these 39 tokens.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the string is split into two parts: the first part is generated by NT71 and the second by NT73.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how NT71 and NT73 can produce their respective parts.\n\nLet me write the first part and the second part.\n\nFirst part: t20 t36 t8 t2 t46 t20 t8 t13 t46 t13 t36 t10 t35 t20 t11 t36 t13 t43 t36 t2 t39 t11 t24 t22 t2 t36 t22 t13 t22 t22 t13 t20 t20 t36 t20 t24 t20 t2 t48 t8 t48.\n\nWait, no, that's the entire string. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nActually, S splits into NT71 and NT73, so the entire string is the concatenation of what NT71 produces and what NT73 produces. So if I split the entire string into two parts at some point, I need to check if the first part can be generated by NT71 and the second by NT73.\n\nBut without knowing where to split, that's going to be tricky. Maybe I can check which non-terminals lead to certain tokens.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t20. Let's see which NT20 productions we have.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 't20' and maybe other rules. Let me scan through the production rules:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nI see:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't20'. So that's a rule where NT20 directly produces t20. So in the first part of the string, if I have a t20, that's a direct production.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 \u2192 't46'.\n\nWait, but looking at the given grammar, many of the NTs have multiple productions, but some produce terminals directly.\n\nFor example, looking at NT20 in the grammar: I see several NT20's with different rules, but in the given grammar, the rules are spread out across different lines.\n\nWait, let me list out all the NT production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n- NT87 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT63 \u2192 't2'\n- NT73 \u2192 't24'\n- NT27 \u2192 't11'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT21 \u2192 't43'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't10'\n- NT27 \u2192 't20'\n- NT71 \u2192 't48'\n- NT63 \u2192 't13'\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nOkay, so each NT has all the possible productions. Now, for the NT20, it's not immediately clear from the list. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT20: I don't see any productions for NT20 in the given list. Wait, that can't be. The rules start from S.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\nNT4 appears in two places: NT42 \u2192 ... and NT4 \u2192 't22'.\n\nWait, so I think I might have miscounted.

My string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it can be constructed by substituting the non-terminals at each step until I reach the terminals.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't8'. Looking at the productions, NT87 produces 't8'. So perhaps NT87 is involved here. But let me check how NT87 is used in the grammar. Wait, actually, looking back, NT87 is a non-terminal, but in the given grammar, does NT87 produce anything else besides a constant?\n\nWait a second, in the grammar provided, NT87 is listed as a production that outputs 't8'. Let me list out the relevant productions:\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nSo NT87 directly can produce 't8'.

Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nThe productions for NT54 are:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nAnd other NTs. Wait, so NT54 can produce 't19' directly as well as NT21 NT87.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t8, which comes from NT87. Now, moving further. Let's try to walk through the string step by step, substituting each t as we go.\n\nThe string is:\nt8 t10 t10 t48 t22 t35 t20 t8 t22 t36 t11 t22 t11 t39 t10 t36 t43 t2 t8 t8 t2 t19 t11 t43 t13 t11 t8 t24 t39 t8 t8 t13 t24 t35 t11.\n\nBreaking this down, the first symbol is t8, which is from NT87. Now, NT87 -> 't8', so that's good. But we also need to see if this substitution is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, but NT87 is part of NT54 in some of its productions. So perhaps the structure starts with an NT54. Let me think about the higher-level structure.\n\nLooking at S, it's NT71 NT73, but that's further down, so maybe the initial productions are more at the bottom levels.\n\nWait, S -> NT71 NT73. Then NT73 -> NT63 NT42, and NT71 must be part of some production, but in the given grammar, NT71 only appears in NT73 and other parts? Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the grammar again, I see NT73 is part of the initial productions, so S -> NT71 NT73. So the initial split would involve NT71 and NT73.\n\nBut perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's try to break down the string step by step, checking for possible substitutions.\n\nThe first symbol is t8, so that's NT87. So perhaps the next step is to see if NT87 is part of a production, but NT87 itself only produces 't8' directly. So that's a terminal, so the first part is done.\n\nNow, moving to the second symbol: t10. Let's see. The productions for t10 might come from NT63, since I see NT63 has a production to 't2' in multiple places. Wait, no, looking again, I think I misread some of the productions. Let me list all the NT productions more clearly:\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nLooking further:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87 | 't19'\nNT21 -> 't39' | NT63 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27 | 't46' | 't42' ? Wait, looking again. Oh, no, actually, in the grammar, NT42's productions are:\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27 | 't46'\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The grammar provided for NT42 is:\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27 | 't46'\n\nSo NT42 can produce 't46' directly or as NT36 NT27.\n\nSimilarly, NT27's productions:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4 | 't11' | other parts? Wait, no, looking at the provided grammar, NT27 is:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4 | 't11'\n\nWait, but in the initial grammar, it was written as:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nBut now I realize that in the context I was given earlier, when I wrote it out, NT27's productions are:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4 | 't11'\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire grammar, as given:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT71 -> ...? Wait, in the given grammar, do we have NT71? Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nWait, let's parse the grammar carefully.

Let me re-express the grammar correctly, perhaps.\n\nThe correct list is:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 | 't46'\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | 't19' | 't2' | 't35'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't11' | 't48'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't63' | 't10' | 't13'\n\nWait, no, looking again, in the initial grammar post, it's as given.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and a terminal or a non-terminal on the right. Although some rules here look a bit different, like NT54 having multiple productions, but I think that's okay because CNF allows for multiple productions for the same non-terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so my task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar's production rules.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see which ones produce terminal strings:\n\n- NT54 can be 't19' or 't2' or 't21'... etc. Wait, looking closer, some rules have more than one alternative, like NT54 -> NT21 NT87 or NT54 -> 't19' etc. I think that when a rule has two non-terminals, we have to break those down further until we get all terminals.\n\nLet me list out all the terminal productions to understand the possible terminal sequences:\n\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n- NT54 -> 't19' (among others)\n- NT42 -> 't46' or 't36' \u2192 't36' leads to NT33 \u2192 't11' or 't35' \u2192 So t36 can produce t11 or t35\n- NT36 -> 't90' or 't33' (then further breakdown)\n- NT27 -> 't11' or 't20' \u2192 So producing t11 or t20\n- NT42 -> 't36' \u2192 which as above\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n- NT90 -> 't35'\n- NT21 -> 't39' or 't43'\n- NT27 -> 't11' or 't20'\n- NT73 -> 't24' (from the first rule)\n- NT63 -> multiple options, but some key ones are 't2', 't10', 't13', 't2' from NT63 and NT27\n- NT4 -> 't22' or 't35' \u2192 t22 or t35\n- NT23 isn't a thing, wait NT63 appears in other productions as well.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all terminal symbols and their possible derivations:\n\n- t8 is directly from NT87.\n- t19 is directly from NT54.\n- t20 from NT27.\n- t43 is from NT42 (since 42 can be 36 \u2192 43) or NT63's rules?\nWait, looking at NT42: it can go to NT36 NT27 or 't36' or other options. Wait, let me clarify the rules.\n\nWait, no, NT42 is defined as:\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nAnd NT36 can be NT90 NT33 or NT33 NT4. Wait, no:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33 (since I need to check all rules for NT36):\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nBut earlier, I thought that NT36 could be split further, but from the provided rules, I don't see NT36 having any production except NT90 NT33. Wait, that's not right. Let me list all productions:\n\nWait, looking at the entire grammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT42 -> NT21 NT87? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the full grammar provided is:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT42 -> NT21 NT87\n\nHmm, that's not possible because that would result in cycles.\n\nWait, perhaps I miswrote the grammar. Let me parse it properly.\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT42 -> NT21 NT87 \u2192 Wait, this can't be correct because NT42 is defined as NT36 NT27, and also as NT21 NT87. So these are alternative derivations for NT42.\n\nSo, NT42 can be broken down into either (NT36 NT27) or (NT21 NT87).\n\nTherefore, when we start from S, we have NT71 and NT73. NT73 is NT63 NT42, which then breaks into NT63 and NT42.\n\nSimilarly, NT71 would be broken down into NT54 and NT48.\n\nWait, NT71 is not a non-terminal; wait no, NT71 and NT90 are non-terminals. Let me clarify the non-terminals: \n\nEach capital letter with a number is a non-terminal. So NT71, NT73, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nSo, S produces NT71 and NT73, which are non-terminals. Therefore, the initial step is to expand S into NT71 NT73.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals must be expanded into their respective production rules until we get to terminals.\n\nSo, starting with NT71: Can NT71 produce anything? Looking back, I don't see NT71 in any production. Hmm, that seems odd. All the given productions start with S, then NT71, NT73, etc. Wait, no, perhaps it's a typo in the question. Because if NT71 doesn't have a production, then the grammar as given doesn't even produce the characters in the string. But the string starts with 't20', which is produced by NT27, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the grammar rules given. The user provided rules start with S and list various non-terminals, but I don't see a production for NT71 except as part of S.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't20', which is produced by NT27, so that's okay. Let's try to see how the string could be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the NT71 production. Looking again: No, S is the only production that uses NT71, which is then broken into NT54 and NT48 (from the given rules). Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking carefully, I don't see any production for NT71 except in S.\n\nWait, S -> NT71 NT73, but NT71 and NT73 only appear in S's first production. So if NT71 doesn't have any further rules, then S can't produce anything beyond that. That would mean the grammar can't generate any strings, which can't be right because the string given has 't20', which is produced. So there must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some production for NT71.\n\nLooking back, in the provided grammar, all the rules are for non-terminals except where a rule's right-hand side includes a terminal.\n\nWait, from the rules list:\n\nI see NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT63 -> NT2, as in 't2', same with NT73 -> 't24', etc. So that's correct. So each non-terminal can have either further non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, S is NT71 NT73. If neither NT71 nor NT73 have any production rules, that can't be right. Maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe initial lines:\n\nThe user provided grammar states:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nAnd so on, and then the rules for other non-terminals.\n\nBut, I don't see any productions for NT71. So if NT71 is only present in S, then that would imply that the grammar starts with NT71 and NT73, but if NT71 has no production, then these non-terminals are undefined, which can't be. This is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nIn the provided grammar, all the non-terminals are given. The first production is S -> NT71 NT73. Then, other non-terminals have their own rules. But if NT71 doesn't have any further rules, then the grammar can't generate anything because S would produce NT71 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Because in the list, NT54 is followed by 't19' and then 't2', each on separate lines. Similarly, NT42 has 't46' as a production, and perhaps another one? Let me see the complete list.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- S: two non-terminals.\n- NT73: two non-terminals.\n- NT27: two non-terminals.\n- NT42: NT36 NT27, and then also NT42 \u2192 't46'. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in the given grammar, after NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, there's another line for NT42 \u2192 't46'. So that's allowed; in CNF, productions can have a mix of non-terminals and terminals as long as the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must be either two non-terminals or one terminal. So if a production for NT42 is NT36 NT27 and another is 't46', then NT42 has two productions: one to two non-terminals, and another to a terminal. That's allowed in CNF, as each production can be either of the two forms.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 has three productions:\n1. NT21 NT87\n2. 't19'\n3. 't2'\n\nWait, that's not allowed because that would mean one production has two non-terminals, which is fine, and another production for the same non-terminal to a terminal. So that's okay.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the given grammar, each NT has multiple productions, but each production must have exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. So in this case, for NT54, the three productions are:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\nNT54 \u2192 't19'\nNT54 \u2192 't2'\n\nYes, that's allowed. So the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is:\n\nt2 t35 t11 t46 t46 t13 t19 t43 t10 t24 t11 t36 t13 t8 t11 t20 t48 t13 t48 t39 t19 t2 t46 t19 t11 t2 t39 t8 t13 t46 t43 t2 t39 t10 t35 t2 t39 t22 t43 t22 t46 t36 t10.\n\nFirst, let me notice that the string starts with 't2' and ends with 't10'. \n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do that, I can try to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the sequence of NT productions that could generate this string. Each NT corresponds to certain terminals, so I can try to map the string into a sequence of NTs that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's list the NTs and their associated terminals:\n\nNT21: 't39', 't43'\nNT27: 't11', 't20'\nNT33: 't11', 't48'\nNT36: 't90', 't33' \u2192 wait, NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33, but also another production 't10' for NT63, which is another NT. Wait, no, looking at NT36: in the list, it's:\nNT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\nIt also appears in NT63 \u2192 NT90 NT33. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's create a mapping from each NT to the terminals it can produce:\n\n- NT21: 't39', 't43'\n- NT27: 't11', 't20'\n- NT33: 't11', 't48'\n- NT4: 't22', 't35'\n- NT42: 't46'\n- NT54: 't19', 't2', 't90' (Wait, no, NT54 is only producing 't19', 't2', and from the initial grammar, how is 't90' appearing? Wait, let me check the grammar again.)\n\nWait, NT54 \u2192 't19' is one production, 't2' another, and 't21 NT87'? No, wait, NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87, which is two non-terminals. So when does 't90' come into play?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33.\n\nNT90 \u2192 't35'.\n\nSo, when NT90 is expanded, it produces 't35'.

{"custom_id":"request-472","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are pretty long and complex, so I'll need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar is and how CNF works. CNF is a specific form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure should make parsing the string more straightforward if I were to use a recursive descent parser, but since I'm just trying to determine if the string is generated, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's a set of rules that define how non-terminals can be expanded into other non-terminals and terminals. Each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and the right side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, which means the start symbol S can be replaced by NT71 followed by NT73. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of t followed by numbers, like 't48 t10 t39...' and so on. Each part of the string is a token, so 't48' would be a terminal that needs to be matched by a production rule that directly outputs that terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a single step. That means each production either directly matches a terminal or combines two non-terminals. So, for example, to get a string, I need to see if I can break down the string into parts that match these productions.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string from the top down, starting with the start symbol S and seeing if the string can be generated. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, maybe I can work backwards, but I'm not sure if that's easier.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the grammar. The top-level production is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, S must be broken down into two non-terminals, NT71 and NT73. So the string must start with the sequence generated by NT71 followed by NT73.\n\nLet's check the string: it starts with 't48 t10 t39 t10 t2 t24 t36 t13 t43 t19 t11 t13 t8 t19 t10 t24 t36 t46 t48 t35 t35 t8 t10 t24 t8 t46 t19 t48 t39 t19 t43 t43 t10 t20 t20 t35 t48 t22 t2 t46 t13 t39 t36 t10'.\n\nWait, actually, that's a lot. Maybe I should look for the terminals and see if they can be matched by the productions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the entire string must be split into two parts: the first part generated by NT71 and the second part by NT73.\n\nLooking at NT73, in the grammar, it produces NT63 NT42. So NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nSo, the second part of the string is generated by NT42, but wait, no. Actually, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, so the second part is generated by NT63 and NT42?\n\nWait, no. NT73 produces two non-terminals: NT63 and NT42. So the second part of the string is the concatenation of NT63's generated string and NT42's generated string.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 is another non-terminal. Let me see the productions for NT63. From the grammar, NT63 \u2192 NT2 NT33, or also I see NT63 \u2192 't10' and NT63 \u2192 't2' and others, but in CNF, the productions are only for non-terminals. Wait, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, if NT63 can be a terminal, that's a production like NT63 \u2192 't10' or NT63 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar again. The productions are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8' \nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46' \nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2' \nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nHmm, okay, so NT63 has multiple production options: two non-terminals, or a terminal. So, it can be 't10', 't2', 't13'. So when I see 't10' in the string, that must come from NT63 \u2192 't10'. Similarly, 't48' can come from NT63 \u2192 't13' wait, no, Wait, NT63's productions: looking back, I see NT63 has several rules. From the given data, I see:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT21 NT90\nNT63 \u2192 NT2 NT33\nNT63 \u2192 't2'\nNT63 \u2192 't10'\nNT63 \u2192 't13'\n\nSo, all these options are possible. Now, looking at the string, there are several 't10's and 't63's? Wait the string provided doesn't have 't63' but several 't10's, 't13's, 't2's, etc.\n\nBut perhaps I can work through the first few symbols to see if it fits. Let's start with the entire string being split into NT71's output followed by NT73's output.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t48 t10 t39... Wait, but wait, NT71 is a non-terminal. Let's see the productions for NT71.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT71 -> 't48' (looking at the given productions, yes, NT71 has a production to 't48'). So NT71 can directly produce the terminal 't48'.\n\nSo that's the first symbol. Good. So the first part of the string is 't48'.\n\nNow, the next part must be NT73's output. So after 't48', what comes next? The string after 't48' is 't10 t39 ...'.\n\nWait, no, the string is t48 t10 t39 t10 t2 t24... So the first token is t48, then t10, then t39, etc.\n\nBut wait, the grammar says NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So, the entire part after t48 must be generated by NT73, which is the concatenation of NT63's output and NT42's output.\n\nSo, after t48 comes the two parts generated by NT63 and NT42. So from the string, after 't48' comes 't10 t39 t10 t2 t24 t36...'.\n\nWait, that's the part after 't48'. So the next part is 't10', then 't39', etc. So I need to see if this can be split into two parts: one generated by NT63 and one by NT42.\n\nBut wait, the grammar for NT73 is NT63 NT42, so NT73 must produce a string that is NT63's string followed by NT42's string. So, after 't48', the next tokens must be a concatenation of the two.\n\nLet me try to see if 't10 t39 t10 t2 t24 t36 t13 t43 t19 t11 t13 t8 t19 t10 t24 t36 t46 t48 t35 t35 t8 t10 t24 t8 t46 t19 t48 t39 t19 t43 t43 t10 t20 t20 t35 t48 t22 t2 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule either breaks a symbol into two non-terminals or a terminal. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and then see how the string fits into it.\n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol S. The first production is S -> NT71 NT73. That means the string must start with the combination of NT71 and NT73. Let me check the string: It starts with t39 followed by t10, which corresponds to NT71 and NT73. So far, that's good.\n\nNext, I need to see how NT71 and NT73 can expand. Looking at the grammar, NT73 has two productions: NT63 NT42 and NT63 NT4. Wait, actually, looking again, NT73's productions are: NT63 NT42 and NT63 NT4. Hmm, but in the grammar provided, the user had some rules, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT73 is rewritten as NT63 NT42, and then NT63 can be NT2 or NT10. Wait, no, let me look more carefully.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT63 -> NT2 or NT10\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87 or NT21 NT2 or NT4\n... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a better way to represent this. Maybe building a parse tree would help, but that could be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using a top-down or bottom-up approach would be more manageable.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, decomposing it from the top down using the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: `t39 t10 t43 t8 t13 t13 t8 t2 t36 t13 t35 t36 t20 t11 t20 t48 t19 t20 t36 t22 t10 t19 t19 t11 t39 t20 t46 t10 t8 t22 t24 t46 t35 t10 t22 t43 t48 t36 t11`.\n\nBreaking it down, the entire string is a sequence of tokens. Since S produces NT71 NT73, the first two parts should be the expandables for NT71 and NT73. In the string, the first two tokens are t39 and t10. So:\n\nNT71 -> t39\nNT73 -> t10\n\nLet me see if that makes sense. Looking at the grammar, NT71 is directly a terminal: t39. And NT73 can be either NT63 NT42 or NT63 NT4.\n\nSo next, I need to expand NT73. Since NT73 can be NT63 NT42 or NT63 NT4. Let's check which one fits the next part of the string.\n\nWait, the string after the first two tokens is t43, t8, t13... Hmm. Let me see. Maybe I need to consider all possible expansions.\n\nNT73 can be NT63 NT42 or NT63 NT4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT63 can be -> NT2 or NT10.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can be -> 't22' directly, or maybe more, but in the given grammar, under NT4, it's 't22'. Also, NT21 has several rules.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to represent this as a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S -> NT71 NT73, so we have [t39] [NT73's expansion].\n\nLet me see what comes after t39: the next token is t10, which must be the result of expanding NT73. But looking at NT73's rules:\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42 or NT63 NT4.\n\nSo, NT73 can expand into two NT63's followed by some rules.\n\nWait, but in the string after t39, it's t10, which is a terminal. So, if NT73 expands to NT63 NT4, then NT63 must produce t10.\n\nLooking at NT63's rules: NT63 can be NT2 or NT10.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT2 is 't2', and NT10 is 't13'? Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT63, the productions are:\n\nLooking back, NT63 is rewritten as NT2 or NT10. No, wait, in the user's message, the grammar points are:\n\nNT63 -> NT2 or NT10.

Okay, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The top-level non-terminal is S, which is defined as NT71 NT73. So, the string must start with NT71 followed by NT73.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each of these NT terminals breaks down into other NT terminals and eventually into strings that consist of 't' followed by some numbers.\n\nI'll list out all the production rules to see where each number in the string comes from:\n\n- NT73 breaks down into NT63 NT42.\n- NT63 can be 't2' or 't10' or 't13' or 't35', based on the rules.\n- NT42 can be 't46', 't27' (which further breaks down), etc.\nWait, I think I should parse each part of the string through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the possible combinations. Each NT terminals eventually produce sequences of t followed by numbers, and the overall string is a concatenation of these tN sequences.\n\nThe string given is: t20 t2 t10 t19 t24 t46 t10 t43 t24 t2 t2 t22 t13 t11 t24 t19 t48 t19 t13 t39 t11 t43 t2 t11 t36 t48 t46 t8 t2 t10 t8 t39 t20 t46 t13 t10 t43 t36 t11 t35 t39 t2 t46 t46 t13.\n\nThat's a lot of 't's and numbers. Maybe I should count how many 't's there are. Since each 't' is part of a sequence, I don't think that's helpful. Instead, each 'tN' represents a terminal symbol, where 't' is followed by a number from 1 to 39, as far as I can tell from the string. The numbers correspond to production rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to generate the entire string by parsing it backwards through the grammar. Starting from S, let's see if all these NT terminals are covered by the production rules.\n\nWait, but the NT71 and NT73 are the top-level productions. Let me check their rules:\n\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT71 -> 't20' (from the list)\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nSo the string must start with 't20', which is correct. Then, it continues with other terms. So the string is built as 't20' followed by what NT73 produces.\n\nNT73 is NT63 NT42. Let me look up the products of NT63 and NT42.\n\nNT63 has the production rules:\n- NT63 -> 't2', 't10', 't13', 't35'\n\nNT42 has:\n- NT42 -> 't46', NT27.\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, NT42 can produce 't46' or further breaks down into NT27, which is another NT.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nBut looking back, I think I may have misread.

Let me double-check.\n\nThe grammar provided is:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\nNT87 -> 't8'\nNT54 -> 't19'\nNT42 -> 't46'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't22'\nNT21 -> 't39'\nNT63 -> 't2'\nNT73 -> 't24'\nNT27 -> 't11'\nNT33 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT21 -> 't43'\nNT33 -> 't48'\nNT42 -> 't36'\nNT63 -> 't10'\nNT27 -> 't20'\nNT71 -> 't48'\nNT63 -> 't13'\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, I see that NT33 has two productions: NT33 -> NT90 NT33 and NT33 -> 't11'. But that seems problematic because the first production creates a cycle because it's NT33 -> itself, so it will never terminate. However, in the given string, there are instances where 't11' appears, so we can ignore the cycle for now as it allows a production to reach a terminal.\n\nBack to NT27: it can be NT54 NT4 or 't11'. Since 't11' is a terminal, that's straightforward. So if we have 't11' in the string, it must come from NT27 or NT33 because those are the non-terminals that can directly expand to 't11' or other terminals.\n\nWait, no: NT27 and NT33 can expand to 't11' or produce NT54 and NT4 or itself, leading to a recursive terminal. Hmm, perhaps I need to trace back from 't11' in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't11'. So this must come from some non-terminal that can produce 't11'. Let's see which non-terminals have a production to 't11' directly or indirectly.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4 or 't11' (so NT27 can be 't11')\nNT33 -> NT90 NT33 (doesn't help because it's a cycle), but NT33 can also be 't11' if another production is used.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar again, NT33 only has the production NT33 -> NT90 NT33, which is a recursive production. Alternatively, if there are other productions that lead to NT33, but from the given grammar, it seems NT33 only has that recursive production. Therefore, 't11' must come from NT27, since NT27 has a production to 't11'.\n\nSo the first symbol 't11' comes from NT27 -> 't11'.\n\nNow, looking at the production that leads to 't11', which is NT27 -> 't11', so NT27 must have been the symbol before it. So the expansion starts with NT27, which produces 't11' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, no. The first symbol is 't11', which comes from NT27, so the entire string must be built by expanding NT27 and NT73 from S.\n\nSo S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nSo the string must be a combination of the symbols generated by NT71 and NT73.\n\nLet me write down what I have so far:\n\nThe string is: t11 t8 t39 t22 t48 t13 t39 t36 t2 t43 t36 t24 t13 t11 t11 t19 t10 t10 t20 t46 t20 t10 t48 t13 t43 t13 t46 t48 t24 t8 t39 t13 t11 t46 t43 t46 t11 t20 t2 t8 t22 t39 t13 t13 t19 t8.\n\nSince the first symbol is 't11', which is NT27, and S is NT71 NT73, let's check what produces NT71 and NT73.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nSo NT73 expands into NT63 and NT42.\n\nWait, no: NT73 -> NT63 NT42, so that's another non-terminal pair. So the second part is NT63 and NT42.\n\nThe string after 't11' is 't8', which must come from NT63 or NT42 or the other non-terminals in their expansions.\n\nWait, let's see. The entire structure:\n\nS produces NT71 and NT73. So the string is the result of NT71's expansion followed by NT73's expansion. So the string starts with NT71's symbols and ends with NT73's symbols, or vice versa? No, because the productions are ordered as NT71 and NT73. So the string should have the symbols from NT71 first, followed by those from NT73.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the productions are in parallel. So each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal first. So the string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT71 and NT73, in that order.\n\nSo the entire string should be the expansion of NT71 followed by the expansion of NT73.\n\nSo let me check: The string starts with 't11', which is the 't' from NT27's expansion, which is part of the expansion of NT71 or NT73? Wait, S -> NT71 NT73. So the first part is NT71, which expands into something, and the second part is NT73, which expands into something.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT71 -> 't48' (since looking at the productions, I see NT71 -> 't48').\n\nWait, yes: NT71 -> 't48' (from the grammar, line: NT71 -> 't48').\n\nTherefore, NT71 produces a single terminal 't48'.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't11', which must be part of the expansion of NT71. But NT71 only produces 't48' as a terminal symbol. So that's a problem because the string starts with 't11', not 't48'.\n\nWait, no"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side and the right side can be either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing easier, but here I'm just trying to see if a specific string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t13 t13 t11 t43 t19 t11 t20 t13 t19 t22 t48 t48 t24 t8 t22 t20 t39 t11 t39 t36 t35 t20 t8 t8 t35 t11 t35 t24 t20 t36 t10 t39 t35 t8 t46 t22 t46 t22 t35 t36 t48 t11 t36 t24 t13 t19.\n\nLet me break down the grammar to understand the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87 or NT21 NT54, and so on.\n\nHmm, wait, the notation seems a bit off. For example, NT54 has multiple productions, some of which end in terminals, and some continue branching. So each of these non-terminals can expand into others, possibly terminating in a terminal or further expansion.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S and trying to derive the string step by step, ensuring that each part of the string matches the possible productions.\n\nGiven that, let me look for the start symbol S, which is S -> NT71 NT73. So the string should start with NT71 and NT73. Looking at the string, the first two elements are t13 and t13.\n\nWait, no. Because S -> NT71 NT73, meaning the whole string must be two NT71 and NT73? Or wait, no. NT71 and NT73 are the right-hand sides, so S produces two non-terminals, each of which can expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t13. So maybe NT71 produces t13, and NT73 produces a longer string? Or perhaps NT73 starts with another t13.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStart with S, which is NT71 NT73. So the string must be the concatenation of NT71's expansion and NT73's expansion.\n\nSo let's look at NT71 and NT73.\n\nLooking at NT71, but scan the grammar, I don't see NT71 directly. Wait, the start is S -> NT71 NT73, and NT71 is not listed as a non-terminal in the grammar, only NT27, NT42, NT54, etc. So wait, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If S -> NT71 NT73, and NT71 is not a defined non-terminal, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps S -> NT71 NT73 is actually S -> NT71 NT73, which are part of the non-terminals, but looking through the grammar, it seems NT71 and NT73 might be errors because the non-terminals only go up to NT54, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo and the user meant something else, but the given grammar has only up to NT54, and S uses NT71 and NT73, which don't exist. That would imply that the grammar may be ill-formed or incomplete. But maybe the user made a typo and it's NT27 and NT73 or something else.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar:\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT71 NT73. Then NT73 -> NT63 NT42.\n\nThen NT27 -> NT54 NT4.\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27.\n\nNT54 has multiple productions, some ending in terminals.\n\nSo perhaps NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, but in the given grammar, are they only S's children, but not further defined. That can't be, because S must produce via the given rules.\n\nWait, maybe it's a mistake, and the user intended the start to be S -> NT27 NT45 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps NT71 and NT73 are just the initial terminals, but that doesn't make sense because then they can't expand, but according to the problem statement, the grammar is in CNF, so all non-terminals must expand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo and it's N71 and N73, which might be NT21 or similar.\n\nBut regardless, perhaps I can proceed.\n\nWait, let me list all non-terminals in the grammar:\n\nNT73\nNT63\nNT42\nNT54\nNT36\nNT27\nNT4\nNT21\nNT87\nNT2\nNT42\nNT63\nNT10\nNT27\nNT63\nNT35\nWait, I see multiple NT63 entries, which suggests perhaps duplicates in the list. Let me compile a list without duplicates.\n\nNon-terminals:\n\nNT73, NT63, NT42, NT54, NT36, NT27, NT4, NT21, NT87, NT2, NT10, NT35, etc. It seems like some non-terminals are defined but others are part of the left-hand sides.\n\nWait, but looking back, S is a start symbol, which is supposed to be a non-terminal. But in the given grammar, S is defined as NT71 NT73. That suggests that NT71 and NT73 are derived non-terminals, which in the standard context-free grammars are themselves non-terminals. So perhaps NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, but they are not defined further, which is a problem because S must have a derivation.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. So perhaps the user made a typo in the grammar, and the correct production is S -> something else, like NT71 NT73, but NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals that need to be defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT71 and NT73 are terminal symbols, but in CNF, all symbols except the start symbol should be terminals or non-terminals that have productions. So this is confusing.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user made a mistake in the formatting, and the grammar is actually meant to be S -> NT71 NT73, and each NT71 and NT73 have their own productions, but perhaps the user didn't list them correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again: the user wrote it as 'grammar: S -> NT71 NT73 NT73... etc.'? Wait, no, the first line is S -> NT71 NT73. Then the rest are for other non-terminals.\n\nWait, now I see that perhaps the user intended S -> NT71 NT73, but in the list, NT71 is only in the part where NT63 is rewritten as t2 or t10.\n\nWait, but none of the non-terminals except the terminal symbols are written, which suggests that S is supposed to be NT71 and NT73, but NT71 and NT73 are terminals. That's also odd.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the possibility that the initial grammar may have had a typo, and that the user intended S to produce NT27 NT45 or something similar, but the problem is that NT27 and NT45 are not in the list, making it unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps S -> NT71 NT73 is a typo and it should be S -> NT27 NT43, similar to the string, which has t13 t13 t11 t43... Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the grammar is as given, with S -> NT71 NT73, and each NT has the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended S -> NT71 NT73, but the NT71 and NT73 have their own productions, but in the provided grammar, I don't see those, so perhaps this is a mistake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to proceed with the question at hand, and see whether the string can be generated, regardless of the structure.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t13 t13 t11 t43 t19 t11 t20 t13 t19 t22 t48 t48 t24 t8 t22 t20 t39 t11 t39 t36 t35 t20 t8 t8 t35 t11 t35 t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So for NT54, it can be split into NT21 and NT87, or it can directly produce 't2', 't19', 't2', etc. Wait, that might be a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-512","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It looks like every non-terminal symbol (on the left side of the arrows) expands into exactly two non-terminal symbols, which is consistent with Chomsky normal form. The grammar has several non-terminals, and each has productions that lead eventually to terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is quite long: `t13 t46 t24 t20 t35 t43 t13 t46 t46 t24 t35 t39 t11 t36 t48 t13 t19 t46 t19 t2 t19 t43 t24 t39 t36 t2 t13 t20 t11 t46 t8 t20 t46 t10 t13 t19 t24 t36 t8 t8 t48 t35 t2 t48 t2 t20 t19 t2`.\n\nEach part of this string is separated by spaces, so each token in the string must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My goal is to see if this entire sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the production rules for S:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nSo the entire string must start with NT71 and then NT73. Let me look at the string's beginning:\n\nt13 t46 t24... Wait, the first two tokens are t13 and t46. But looking at the grammar, NT73 expands into NT63 NT42. Let's check the productions for NT42 and NT63.\n\nNT63 -> NT2 NT4? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nNT63 -> NT27 NT4.\n\nWait, no, let me check the given grammar again. Sorry, I initially misread.\n\nActually, the grammar provided has several NTs and each has two non-terminals. For example, S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nLet me parse the string in parts. The string starts with t13, which is a terminal. So let's see which production rules generate t13.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see where terminals appear as results of productions:\n\nNT90 -> t35\n\nNT27 -> t11, t20, t24, t36, t43, etc.\n\nNT42 -> t27, t35, t46, etc.\n\nNT54 -> t21, t2, t19, t2, t35.\n\nNT4 -> t22, t35.\n\nLooking for t13: in the grammar, I see NT36 -> NT90 NT33, and NT90 -> t35. Hmm, so NT36 could lead to t35, but that's not t13. Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the entire grammar, I see:\n\nThe NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT63 -> NT27 NT42\n\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\n- NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n\n- NT27 -> 't11'\n\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n\n- NT21 -> 't43'\n\n- NT33 -> 't48'\n\n- NT42 -> 't36'\n\n- NT63 -> 't10'\n\n- NT27 -> 't20'\n\n- NT71 -> 't48'\n\n- NT63 -> 't13'\n\n- NT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, in the initial problem statement, the grammar is presented as: \n\nThe start symbol is S -> NT71 NT73.\n\nLooking at NT71's productions: In the initial problem statement, NT71 is only present as the left-hand side of the production, so I need to check if it expands further or is a terminal. Since NT71 is used in S's production but it's not on the left side of any other production (except S), it must be a terminal. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the other non-terminals have productions, but if a non-terminal doesn't appear on either side of any production, then it's a terminal. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, each non-terminal on the left has productions, but let's check for NT71. In the grammar, the only line has NT71 -> ...? Wait, no, the only line for NT71 is in S's production: S -> NT71 NT73. So NT71 does not appear on the left of any other production except itself, so it must be a terminal. So NT71 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 is a terminal because it only appears in S's production and nowhere else.\n\nWait, no, that can't be correct because S is the start symbol, and NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals because they have production rules elsewhere. Wait, no, looking again, in the grammar, NT71 and NT73 are only on the left side of S's production, and nowhere else. So they must be terminals.\n\nBut looking back at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nOther non-terminals: NT27, NT42, NT54, NT36, NT87, etc. These all have production rules, so they are non-terminals.\n\nWait, so S is the start symbol which produces NT71 and NT73, and since these don't have any further productions (only S's production refers to them as terminals), they must be terminals. So, in the given string, the first two tokens are t13 and t46.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT71 is a terminal, which must be 't48' as per NT71 -> 't48' (from the line NT71 -> 't48').\n\nSimilarly, NT73 is a terminal, which must be 't24' as per NT73 -> 't24'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first two tokens are t13 and t46. That would mean that S produces NT71 as 't13' and NT73 as 't46'. But according to the grammar, NT71 -> 't48', so it shouldn't produce 't13'. That seems like a problem because the start symbol would produce 't48 t24', but the string starts with 't13 t46'. So that would imply that the start symbol produces 't13' and 't46', but in the grammar, S only appears as S -> NT71 NT73, where NT71 and NT73 are terminals with fixed values: NT71 is 't48' and NT73 is 't24'.\n\nTherefore, any string generated by this grammar must start with 't48 t24', but the provided string starts with 't13 t46', which doesn't match. That suggests that the string is not generated by the grammar. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again, the production rules are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nOther non-terminals have their own productions. But are NT71 and NT73 terminals or non-terminals? Since they don't appear in any other left-hand side, they must be terminals with their specific terminal symbols.\n\nSo, for production rules:\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nTherefore, when S is expanded, it would produce 't48 t24'. So the string must start with 't48 t24'. But in the given string, the first token is 't13', not 't48'. So S would produce 't48 t24', making the first two tokens 't48 t24', but the string starts with 't13 t46', which doesn't match. Therefore, the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that's only if both NT71 and NT73 are terminals. But let me see if there's any way NT71 and NT73 can be non-terminals. Let me check again. For a non-terminal, it must appear on the left side of some production.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals. That should make parsing easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm, but I'll try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It's a bit lengthy, so I'll list out all the production rules and terminals to get a clearer picture.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S -> NT71 NT73. So the entire string should be generated by starting with NT71 and NT73. Let me check if the given string starts with these two. The string is: \n\nt10 t35 t8 t2 t46 t11 t2 t13 t35 t11 t11 t8 t39 t22 t10 t2 t39 t11 t20 t11 t10 t46 t24 t2 t22 t10 t24 t20 t46 t24 t22 t22 t20 t48 t35 t36 t35 t43 t35 t35 t20 t20 t10 t46 t48 t11 t48 t19.\n\nLooking at the beginning, the string starts with t10, so I need to see if t10 can be derived from NT71 or NT73, etc., through the rules.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which goes to NT71 NT73, so the initial split would be into two parts: whatever NT71 generates and whatever NT73 generates. Then, the entire string should be a concatenation of those two.\n\nSo first, I need to check if the given string can be split into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT71 and the second by NT73.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT71: Let me check the productions for NT71. Wait, in the given grammar, the rules are all for N terminals except S, so looking through the rules:\n\n- NT71 only appears as S->NT71 NT73. So in the grammar, NT71 isn't further broken down. So does NT71 produce a single terminal? Because if NT71 doesn't have a production, that means it's a terminal. Wait, no. Because in Chomsky normal form, all productions are from non-terminals to two non-terminals or terminals. So if NT71 doesn't have any production rules in the input, perhaps it's a terminal? Or maybe it's a non-terminal with only a single production (but no production would mean it's a terminal). Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the grammar provided is a set of production rules. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n- NT27 -> 't11'\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT21 -> 't43'\n- NT33 -> 't48'\n- NT42 -> 't36'\n- NT63 -> 't10'\n- NT27 -> 't20'\n- NT71 -> Hmm, wait, looking back, S->NT71 NT73, but there's no production rule for NT71. So does that mean NT71 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal with an empty production? If it's a terminal, then it would just output a single terminal symbol. But if it's a non-terminal, then it has to be able to produce something, but since there's no rule, perhaps it's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT71 in the left-hand sides: Nope, not present. So, perhaps NT71 is a terminal, and similarly, NT73 might be a terminal or have a production.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT73's productions are all to other terminals or non-terminals, so maybe NT73 isn't a terminal. Let me check if any of NT73's productions have non-terminals. Yes, NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So NT73 is a non-terminal, but in the given string, it must generate a certain sequence.\n\nNow, the start symbol S generates NT71 NT73. So if both are non-terminals, their expansions must form the entire string. But if they are terminals, they just produce a single symbol each, unless there are multiple symbols.\n\nWait, but if NT71 and NT73 are terminals, the string would have to consist of two symbols: t10 something. But that doesn't seem to align with the given string, as the string has 46 symbols. So that can't be it. Therefore, both NT71 and NT73 must be non-terminals that can expand to multiple symbols.\n\nGiven that NT71 isn't in any production, that's a problem. Wait, in the grammar, NT71 is only on the left-hand side of the production S->NT71 NT73. So, in the right-hand side, NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals. But NT71 doesn't have any production rules, meaning it's a terminal. Because if it had a production, it would either be to another non-terminal or to a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, are all non-terminals required to have at least one production? Or is a non-terminal that doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production treated as a terminal? I think that's correct. So NT71 is a terminal, outputting a single symbol, and NT73 is a non-terminal, generating a sequence of symbols. So the start symbol S will generate a string that is a concatenation of NT71 and NT73's expansion.\n\nBut the given string starts with t10, which is a terminal, so let's see:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73 => terminal symbol t10 followed by the expansion of NT73.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is t10, which matches NT71 if NT71 is 't10'. Wait, in the grammar, is there a production for NT71? No, so NT71 is a terminal, so it must be a terminal symbol. Looking through the rules, do any terminals appear as NT71? Let me check:\n\nLooking at all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n- NT27 -> 't11'\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT21 -> 't43'\n- NT33 -> 't48'\n- NT42 -> 't36'\n- NT63 -> 't10'\n- NT27 -> 't20'\n- NT71 -> (no production)\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n- NT27 -> 't11'\n\nSo, NT71 is not present as a terminal in any production. So, perhaps NT71 is a terminal and must output a certain symbol. Since S->NT71 NT73 and the first symbol in the string is t10, we can check if NT71 outputs t10.\n\nLooking at the left-hand sides, is there a production where NT71 is the LHS and outputs something? No, so NT71 is a terminal symbol, but which symbol? The terminal symbols are all the ones that appear on the LHS of a production, but that's not the case here. Wait, actually, in the list of rules, the LHS can only be non-terminals. So all terminals in the output must be literals. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the grammar is ambiguous because S is followed by NT71 NT73, but NT71 is a terminal, so S's expansion starts with t10, then NT73 would expand. So the overall string would be t10 followed by the expansion of NT73. Since the overall string is 46 symbols long, the expansion of NT73 must be 45 symbols long.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I remember that this normal form has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that it's quite extensive with a lot of non-terminals and productions. My task is to see if the string `t46 t43 t46 t2 t11 t19 t11 t39 t10 t19 t36 t39 t43 t43 t19 t8 t48 t36 t10 t20 t39 t19 t24 t24 t20 t48 t20 t8 t48 t22 t11 t43 t19 t43 t11 t13 t22 t10 t11 t36 t46 t39 t19 t39 t39 t13 t46 t24 t8` is in the language defined by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the string and see if it can be built using the given productions. Since it's a string of terminals, I need to see if it can be derived starting from the start symbol. The start symbol in the grammar seems to be S because the first production is S -> NT71 NT73. So, the string must start with whatever NT71 and NT73 produce, and each of those should also produce sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT71 and NT73 are the starting points. NT71 is part of S's production, so let's examine its possible derivations. But I realize that the grammar is quite complex, and each non-terminal might have multiple productions. That could make parsing the string quite challenging.\n\nI think a good approach might be to try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning and see if each segment of symbols matches any of the right-hand sides of the productions. Since every production in Chomsky normal form is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal, the parse should be straightforward as there are no ambiguous rules\u2014each production either expands into two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nLet's start with the beginning of the string: `t46 t43 t46 t2 t11...`. The first part is `t46`, so looking at the grammar, I see several non-terminals that produce 't46'. Specifically, NT42 -> 't46' and NT63 -> 't10' (wait, but that's 't10', not 't46', so that might not be it). Let me check the productions again. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT71 -> 't48'\n- NT33 -> 't11', etc.\n\nSo the first token is 't46'\u2014which must come from NT42 -> 't46'. So the first part of NT73 would need to be NT42, which is 't46'. Wait, but NT73 is part of the S production. Let me write down the S production again: S -> NT71 NT73. So both NT71 and NT73 must be expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by looking at each non-terminal and see what they can produce. Let's list all the non-terminals and their possible productions:\n\n- NT71: S -> NT71 NT73. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. The grammar starts with S -> NT71 NT73, which are symbols, I suppose. Each of NT71 and NT73 must be non-terminals that can produce sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking back, the non-terminals are various numbers like NT71, NT73, NT27, etc. So perhaps the initial step is to expand NT71 and NT73 into sequences of terminals using their productions. But each non-terminal may have multiple production rules, so I need to choose the right path that fits the input string.\n\nLet's start with the string and see how it can be broken down. The first input is 't46', which we determined must come from NT42 -> 't46'. So looking back, S -> NT71 NT73. So the first part of the string should be NT71 producing 't46' and NT73 producing the rest. But wait, no\u2014NT71 and NT73 are separate. S is the start symbol, which splits into NT71 and NT73. Therefore, the entire string must be a concatenation of what NT71 produces and what NT73 produces.\n\nWait, no\u2014because S -> NT71 NT73. So NT71 and NT73 are both non-terminals. Each of them must expand into a sequence of terminals. So the entire string is NT71's expansion followed by NT73's expansion. Therefore, the string must be divided into two parts: the first part is produced by NT71, and the second by NT73.\n\nLooking at the input string, the first token is 't46' which comes from NT42. But NT42 is part of NT73 or NT27? Let me check NT73: NT73 -> NT63 NT42. Oh, so NT73 is made up of NT63 and NT42. So perhaps the first token is part of NT63 or NT42.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, every node is a binary tree except the leaves, which are terminals. Let me consider the bottom-up approach, since that might be easier for me.\n\nStarting from the input string, can I split it into two parts that fit the productions of NT71 and NT73?\n\nBut before that, perhaps it's easier to look at each non-terminal and see their possible terminal sequences. For example, NT42 can produce 't46' directly. Similarly, NT54 can produce 't19', 't2', or 't13' depending on the production.\n\nLet me try to see what's possible for NT71 and NT73.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT71 NT73. So the entire string must be the concatenation of NT71's derivation and NT73's derivation.\n\nLet's try to parse the string into two parts: the first part is what NT71 produces, and the second is what NT73 produces.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: `t46 t43 t46 t2 t11 t19 t11 t39 t10 t19 t36 t39 t43 t43 t19 t8 ...`. \n\nWait, perhaps I can take the first token, 't46', and see where that leads. So, 't46' is produced by NT42. Looking at NT73's productions, which ones can lead into NT42. Let's look at NT73 -> NT63 NT42. So NT73's production is NT63 followed by NT42. Therefore, if the first token is 't46' from NT42, then before that, there must be a production of NT63 that produces the next tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since the entire string is built from S's expansion, which is NT71 followed by NT73, I can try to split the string into two parts and see if each part can be generated by NT71 and NT73, respectively.\n\nLet me count the tokens to see where the split could occur. But considering the complexity of the grammar, maybe it's better to see if there's a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to see if the string can be built by recursively applying the productions.\n\nBut perhaps another angle: each production in the grammar can only generate a terminal string, and the way to construct it is by replacing non-terminals step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to see if each part of the string matches a production rule.\n\nStarting with 't46', which is a terminal\u2014so it's a terminal itself, as per NT42. But wait, in the grammar, NT42 can produce 't46' directly. So perhaps NT73's production is NT63 followed by NT42, and if I can see if after 't46', the rest of the tokens form a sequence that starts with NT63.\n\nBut let me think more clearly. Let's try to break down the string into segments that correspond to each production.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are `t46 t43 t46 t2...`. Let's see if this corresponds to NT73's expansion.\n\nWait, NT73 is NT63 followed by NT42. Let me see: NT63's productions are NT63 -> NT2 and NT33 -> NT2?

{"custom_id":"request-526","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar provided is a set of productions, and the string is quite long, consisting of a series of symbols starting with 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that all productions either generate a single terminal symbol like 't8' or have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which fits the requirements of CNF. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNext, the task is to check if the string is part of the language generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me list them out:\n\nt19, t35, t24, t35, t8, t11, t10, t11, t36, t11, t35, t19, t43, t46, t8, t20, t24, t11, t46, t24, t36, t11, t11, t35, t20, t8, t13, t36, t2, t24, t11, t20, t35, t19, t13, t24, t8, t35, t39, t10, t43, t39, t8, t19, t35, t11, t13, t36, t46.\n\nI'm thinking about how to approach this. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a type of grammar where each step in the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. This suggests that the string's length can help us determine the number of possible steps. The given string has 47 symbols. \n\nIn CNF, the maximum length of a string derived from a non-terminal is 2^n, where n is the number of productions used. Wait, let me clarify that: each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So for each step, the number of symbols can double or stay the same. But in this case, since all productions are either a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal, the length of the string should be 2^k where k is the number of times a non-terminal was expanded into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string's length is 47, which is not a power of 2. Let's calculate:\n\n2^0 = 1\n\n2^1 = 2\n\n2^2 =4\n\n3=8, etc. \n\n47 is not a power of two. So that's a quick way to determine that it's invalid. Because if you start with a single non-terminal S, each production when it's a terminal contributes to the length, but each step that splits non-terminals increases the number of symbols by multiplication by 2. Since the initial production for S is S \u2192 NT71 NT73, that's two symbols. Let's see:\n\nLooking more closely, S starts as NT71 NT73, which are two non-terminals. Then, each of those can be expanded into more non-terminals or terminals. But in each expansion, if a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, that contributes to the terminal string, but in the parse tree, each non-terminal that is split increases the count of symbols.\n\nThe key point is that each production either adds zero or two symbols, but in terms of count:\n\nWait, no: for each production, if it's A \u2192 a, that contributes one terminal. If A \u2192 BC, then it adds two symbols. So when you start with S \u2192 NT71 NT73 (two symbols), and each of those NTs can either be terminals or split into two.\n\nThe maximum length of the string would indeed be 2^k, but 47 is not a power of two. 32 is 2^5, 64 is 2^6. 47 is in between and not a power of two, so it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because its length is 47, which is not a power of two.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The initial S is S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so that's two symbols. Each NT in this can, upon expansion, either produce a terminal (length +1) or split into two NTs (length +2). Wait no, that's not the right way to think about it. Each expansion step either adds one or two symbols.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model it as each production of a non-terminal in CNF contributes to the string's length in a way that the total length can be represented as a sum based on the depth of the parse tree.\n\nBut in CNF, the maximum length of the string is 2^k, where k is the height of the parse tree (number of splits). The string's length is 47. Are there two consecutive splits? Let's see:\n\nPossible expansions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, each NT is a non-terminal that can produce either a terminal or split into further non-terminals.\n\nEach time a non-terminal produces two non-terminals, the count increases by one (from 1 symbol to 2). If it produces a terminal, the count increases by zero (1 to 1). So starting from 2 symbols, the possible lengths can be 2 + m, where m is a number of splits.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the minimal and maximal possible lengths.\n\nThe minimal possible string is when all non-terminals immediately produce terminals, leading to a fixed length. For example, if S expands to NT71 NT73, each of those immediately expand to terminals, the minimal length would be 2. But in our case, 47 is way longer, so it's not the minimal.\n\nThe maximal for a given depth would be 2^n, where n is the maximum depth of the parse tree. Let's try to see for 47.\n\nThe nearest power of two above 47 is 64, which is 2^6. 47 is less than 64, so it would require 2^6 depth, but that would give a string length of 64, which is longer than 47.\n\nWait, actually, the minimal length when you have maximum splitting. Each NT can split up, so the maximum possible for n splits is 2^n. So 47 is between 2^5 (32) and 2^6 (64).\n\nBut the problem is that 47 is not a power of two. So the string cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the possible steps. Starting from S, each step can either produce terminals or split into more non-terminals. The number of symbols is 47. Since S \u2192 NT71 NT73, the initial count is 2. Each time you split, you can increase the count by 1 or 2. Let me think as the number of symbols (let's call it L) increases.\n\nEach time a non-terminal is split, for each split, L increases by 1 (if it was a non-terminal that split into two non-terminals), because before, it was 1, now it's 2 (so +1). If a non-terminal splits into a terminal, then L stays the same.\n\nBut the minimal possible way to reach 47 from 2 would involve splitting until all possible non-terminals have been split, but perhaps that's complicated.\n\nAnother approach: The minimal length is 2, maximum possible when you keep splitting as much as possible. Let's see:\n\nEach step can double the number of symbols if you keep splitting all non-terminals each step. So starting at 2:\n\nAfter 1 split: 2 \u2192 4.\n\nAfter 2 splits: 4 \u21928.\n\nAfter 3: 8\u219216\n\n4: 16\u219232\n\n5:32\u219264\n\nSo to reach 47, which is less than 64, it would require stopping before all possible splits, but that would not generate 47 since the counts would jump from 32 to 64, skipping numbers in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps certain production sequences can lead to lengths that are not powers of two, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, in a context-free grammar, the lengths can vary as long as log2(length) is an integer because each split at a non-terminal adds a certain number of symbols, but you can have multiple splits at different points.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that for a string of length 47 generated by a CNF grammar, since 47 is not a power of two, and the grammar in CNF requires that the number of symbols at each level is related to the power of two.\n\nSo perhaps this is not a correct approach.

{"custom_id":"request-529","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, it's structured in a way that makes it easier to parse, but I'm not sure if it's ambiguous or not. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string to see how it can be broken down. The string is: `t36 t13 t36 t11 t48 t48 t36 t11 t13 t39 t13 t11 t43 t13 t22 t43 t39 t39 t24 t11 t2 t22 t43 t22 t19 t13 t24 t19 t43 t48 t22 t8 t10 t48 t22 t43 t11 t22 t11 t22 t2 t48 t46 t8 t13 t36 t10 t20`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be parsed by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can consider each production and see if I can work backwards from the start symbol S, which is NT71 NT73. \n\nLet's break down the string step by step:\n\n1. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so the string should start with the symbols derived from NT71 and NT73.\n\n2. Let's split the string into two parts based on NT71 and NT73. From the string, the first part would be the sequence generated by NT71, and the second part by NT73. \n\n3. I'll look for the symbols that NT71 can derive. NT71 \u2192 NT48 NT48 (from production: NT71 -> NT48 NT48). So, the string must start with two 't48's, but looking at the string, the first two symbols are 't36' and 't13', which aren't 't48's. Hmm, that's confusing because according to the grammar, NT71 should be 't48' 't48'. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar given.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the productions for NT71: S starts with NT71 \u2192 NT48 NT48. So, the first part of the string should be two 't48's. But the given string starts with 't36'. That doesn't match. Unless I'm misreading the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The user provided:\n\nGrammar:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'; NT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'; NT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'; NT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'; NT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'; NT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'; NT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'; NT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, so NT71 has a production NT71 -> NT48 NT48. So, the first symbol after S is two NT48s, which resolve to 't48' each. So, in the given string, the very first part is 't36', which would be part of NT36 or something else, but according to S, it should be 't48's.\n\nWait, perhaps the decomposition is not simply two parts, because S is NT71 NT73, which each may be NT followed by NT, and so on. But in this case, the start is S, which is NT71 NT73, each of which is an NT. So, the string must be a concatenation of the two NT71 and NT73 derivations.\n\nLet me try to see what the string starts with. The string is: t36 t13 t36 t11 t48 t48... So, the first symbol is t36, which could be from NT36, which is part of other productions, but according to NT71, it's 't48's. So, that seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the breakdown should happen. Perhaps I need to parse the entire string, considering each step with the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into exactly two symbols, so the string length must be 2^n + 1, but let's check the length. The string has 41 tokens, so 2^n +1 = 41 \u2192 2^n =40, which isn't a power of two, so this could be an issue.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount: the string is t36, then t13, t36, t11, t48, t48, t36, t11, t13, t39, t13, t11, t43, t13, t22, t43, t39, g39 t24 t11 t2 t22 t43 t22 t19 t13 t24 t19 t43 t48 t22 t8 t10 t48 t22 t43 t11 t22 t11 t22 t2 t48 t46 t8 t13 t36 t10 t20.\n\nWait, let me count accurately:\n\nt36 (1)\nt13 (2)\nt36 (3)\nt11 (4)\nt48 (5)\nt48 (6)\nt36 (7)\nt11 (8)\nt13 (9)\nt39 (10)\nt13 (11)\nt11 (12)\nt43 (13)\nt13 (14)\nt22 (15)\nt43 (16)\nt39 (17)\nt39 (18)\nt24 (19)\nt11 (20)\nt2 (21)\nt22 (22)\nt43 (23)\nt22 (24)\nt19 (25)\nt13 (26)\nt24 (27)\nt19 (28)\nt43 (29)\nt48 (30)\nt22 (31)\nt8 (32)\nt10 (33)\nt48 (34)\nt22 (35)\nt43 (36)\nt11 (37)\nt22 (38)\nt11 (39)\nt22 (40)\nt2 (41)\nt48 (42)\nt46 (43)\nt8 (44)\nt13 (45)\nt36 (46)\nt10 (47)\nt20 (48)\n\nWait, so the length is 48 symbols, which is even, so it's possible as 2^5 + some exponent. But perhaps more importantly, when parsing with a top-down approach, starting from S, each step generates two symbols, so the derivation steps would alternate between two levels, decreasing the stack each time. So, the total number of symbols must be 2^n, but in this case, 48 is 2*24, which is 2* (24), so maybe possible, but perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nGiven that S is NT71 NT73, each of which is two symbols, the string must start with two NT71 and then two NT73? Wait, no, S is the combination, so when derived, the first part is NT71 (which resolves to, say, two symbols) and the second part is NT73 (which also resolves to two symbols). So, the entire string should be the concatenation of the derivation of NT71 and NT73.\n\nWait, no. Each NT is a non-terminal that can derive a sequence of symbols. Since both NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals, they each resolve to some sequence of terminal symbols. So, S = NT71 NT73 would derive a string that's the concatenation of NT71's derivation and NT73's derivation.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT71 and NT73:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT63 can be 't10', 't13', etc.\n\nWait, but wait."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT71 and NT73. So, the first thing is to see how these can derive into the string. Let's look at NT71 and NT73.\n\nNT71 can be broken down using the given productions. Looking at the rules for NT71: I don't see a direct production for NT71 except the start symbol S, so perhaps it can be derived from other non-terminals. Wait, looking back at the initial setup, the grammar might have been miswritten. Let me check the initial statement again.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the grammar starts with S -> NT71 NT73. Then, NT73 is defined as NT63 and NT42. Then, NT27 is NT54 and NT4, and so on. I think I need to map out the derivations step by step.\n\nThe string we have is \"t48 t24\". Since the grammar uses two non-terminals per production, each step will produce two terminals or two more non-terminals. But the string has two 't' terms, so we need to see if the start symbol S can derive exactly these two non-terminals that produce these t's.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and their possible productions to see how they can lead to 'tX' strings.\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT71 NT73. So, each of NT71 and NT73 must derive into a string of terminals.

So, we need the entire derivation to produce exactly two terminals, which are t48 and t24.\n\nThe start symbol S produces two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. So, for the string to be 't48 t24', each NT71 and NT73 must produce one terminal each. Let's see:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT71 must derive into 't48'\n\nNT73 must derive into 't24'\n\nSo, first, can NT71 derive into 't48'?\n\nLooking at NT71's productions: Wait, the initial problem statement says that NT71 -> 't48', because looking at the given productions, I think I might have missed this.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the initial grammar.

Let me reconstruct the list more clearly.\n\nHere's the complete list of non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT63 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't24'\n\nNT27 -> 't11'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nSo, the non-terminals include S, NT71, NT73, NT27, NT33, NT4, NT42, NT54, NT36, NT87, NT21, NT63, NT90.\n\nNow, the string is 't48 t24'. So, looking at the possible 'tX' productions, we can see that NT71 and NT73 have specific terminal values.\n\nLooking at NT71: S's first part is NT71, which can directly produce 't48' as per NT71 -> 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 can directly produce 't24' as per NT73 -> 't24'.\n\nSo, if NT71 is 't48' and NT73 is 't24', then S -> NT71 NT73 becomes 't48 t24', which matches exactly our string.

{"custom_id":"request-23","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t48 t13 t36`, and the grammar is a bunch of production rules. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where every rule either produces two terminals or a non-terminal followed by another non-terminal, except for the start symbol. That's good because for CNF grammars, the derivation tree is binary, which might help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production rules are all for different non-terminals (NT), and each production is of the form NT -> NT1 NT2 or NT -> terminal. So, the start symbol S first expands into NT71 NT73. To generate the string, each of these NTs will need to eventually produce terms that form the string.\n\nLooking at the given string `t48 t13 t36`, it has three tokens. Since our grammar starts with S->NT71 NT73, the first step is to have NT71 and NT73 each produce their respective terminal tokens. However, each of these NTs might themselves be part of more productions, so I need to explore how they derive the tokens.\n\nLet me list all the production rules:\n\n- S -> NT71 NT73\n- NT73 -> NT63 NT42\n- NT27 -> NT54 NT4\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT21 NT87\n- NT36 -> NT90 NT33\n- NT87 -> 't8'\n- NT54 -> 't19'\n- NT42 -> 't46'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't22'\n- NT21 -> 't39'\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n- NT73 -> 't24'\n- NT27 -> 't11'\n- NT33 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT21 -> 't43'\n- NT33 -> 't48'\n- NT42 -> 't36'\n- NT63 -> 't10'\n- NT27 -> 't20'\n- NT71 -> 't48'\n- NT63 -> 't13'\n- NT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait a minute, notice that NT87, NT4, NT54, NT21, NT36, NT33, etc., all have productions where they can produce either a terminal or a combination of non-terminals. So, for example, NT73 can expand into NT63 NT42. Each of these non-terminals can, in turn, produce other combinations or terminals.\n\nSince the string in question is `t48 t13 t36`, it has three tokens. That suggests that the S rule must split into three non-terminals, but wait, in CNF, each production has at most two non-terminals on the right. So S -> NT71 NT73 would produce two elements. Each of these can expand further, potentially increasing the number of tokens. But we only have three tokens, so maybe each of the first expansions produces a terminal or a non-terminal that later produces one or two terminals.\n\nLet me think about how the derivation would look. Starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nEach of these needs to produce something. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, NT71: Looking at the production rules, NT71 \u2192 't48'. So that's an easy one; NT71 directly produces 't48'.\n\nSecond, NT73: The production rules for NT73 are -> NT63 NT42. So NT73 can expand into two non-terminals, NT63 and NT42. Each of these will then need to produce something. Let's see what each can do.\n\nNT63 \u2192 either 't2', 't10', or 't13'. In the string, we have 't13', so perhaps NT63 \u2192 't13'?\n\nWait, but NT63 can also expand into NT90 NT33. So maybe NT63 expands into NT90 and NT33, each of which could produce 't35' and 't48' respectively. But in the string, the first part is 't48', which would correspond to NT71. Then NT63 needs to produce 't13', which is one of its terminals. Does NT63 have a direct production to 't13'? Yes, looking above, NT63 \u2192 't13' is one of the options. So NT63 directly becomes 't13'.\n\nNow, next, NT42. Looking at the productions, NT42 can \u2192 NT36 NT27 or 't46' or 't36' or other options? Wait, let's see. The options for NT42 are:\n\n- \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- \u2192 't46'\n- \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, in the initial list, I see for NT42:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n\nSo it can either produce two non-terminals, or two terminals? Wait, no, wait\u2014Chomsky normal form allows each production to have at most two non-terminals, but terminals are single characters. However, each production must consist of a single symbol on the left and either two symbols (terminals or non-terminals) on the right. So in this case, NT42 can produce 't46' (which is a single terminal) or 't36' (another terminal) or NT36 NT27 (which would require more steps).\n\nBut in the given string, after 't48' and 't13', the next token is 't36'. So, does NT42 produce 't36' directly? Yes, because one of the production rules is NT42 \u2192 't36'.\n\nSo let me put this together:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT71 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNow, within NT73's expansion:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't36'\n\nSo, the full expansion would be S \u2192 't48' 't13' 't36', which matches the given string exactly.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\n1. S starts by expanding to NT71 and NT73.\n\n2. NT71 immediately expands to 't48'.\n\n3. NT73 expands to NT63 and NT42.\n\n4. NT63 expands to 't13'.\n\n5. NT42 expands to 't36'.\n\nSo yes, that's three tokens: 't48', 't13', 't36'.\n\nI think that's a valid derivation. Let me make sure that I didn't miss any possible alternative paths. For example, when NT73 expands to NT63 and NT42, could there be another production that could lead to a different combination? Well, if NT73 used another production that required more steps, but since NT73's simplest expansion leads to two non-terminals, which then immediately produce the necessary terminals, I think that's the only way.\n\nAnother thing to consider: each NT must consume exactly two symbols when it's not producing a terminal. But in this case, NT73 is not a problem because it only uses one production, so each of its expansions is straightforward.\n\nSo, the derivation is:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nNT71 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT63 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't36'\n\nSo, the string is generated correctly. Therefore, the answer should be 'Yes'.\n<\/think>\n\nYes\n\nThe given grammar can produce the string `t48 t13 t36` through the following derivation:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73  \nNT71 \u2192 't48'  \nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42  \nNT63 \u2192 't13'  \nNT42 \u2192 't36'\n\nAnswer: Yes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The same for NT33.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. I think in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a single rule, so each NT has one production unless it's a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 \/ 't19'\nThat means NT54 has two production rules: one is replacing with NT21 NT87, and another is the terminal 't19'.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has two options: either replace with NT36 NT27 or the terminal 't46'.\n\nSo, now, the start symbol is S, which has S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nThe given string is `t48 t2 t46`.\n\nSo, to check if it's in the language, I need to see if S can derive this string.\n\nLet me see.

So NT71 can directly produce 't48'.\n\nSimilarly, for NT73: line 2: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT71 NT73 expands to t48 (from NT71) and NT73 which is NT63 NT42. So now we have t48 followed by NT63 NT42.\n\nNow, let's process NT63 NT42.\n\nNT63 \u2192 either 't13' or 't10'? Wait, looking at lines 18 and 21: NT63 \u2192 't10' and NT63 \u2192 't13'. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a non-terminal in CNF should only have one production option. Did I misparse the grammar?\n\nWait, looking again. Line 18: NT63 \u2192 't10' and line 21: NT63 \u2192 't13'. So that's two options for NT63. That would mean NT63 is a non-terminal that can produce either 't10' or 't13', correct.\n\nSimilarly, NT42: NT42 \u2192 't46' or NT36 NT27.\n\nWait, line 4: NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, and line9: NT42 \u2192 't46'.

I'm supposed to figure out whether this string is part of the language defined by the grammar, outputting either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Wait, no, actually in CNF, each RHS can have at most two non-terminals. So if a rule has two non-terminals, like S -> NT71 NT73, that's allowed. But in this case, some of the RHS have terminals instead.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the rules have two non-terminals.

Let's parse this string into individual tokens: 't48', 't13', 't35', 't11', and 't20'. So the task is to see if these can be derived from the starting symbol S using the given rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nI think the approach is to use a parse table or a recursive descent approach, but since I don't have a parser, I'll try to simulate a top-down approach or maybe see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each terminal is present in the immediate RHS of some production; if not, I need to break down further.\n\nLooking at S, the start symbol is S, and it produces NT71 NT73. So to get S, we need NT71 and NT73.\n\nThen, NT73 produces NT63 and NT42. So we need NT63 and NT42.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT2 (since in the rules, I notice that NT63 -> NT21 NT87, but wait, maybe I should list all the NTs and their rules.)\n\nWait, let's list the productions for each NT:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 \u2192 't8'\n\nSimilarly, NT21 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\nNT54 \u2192 several options: NT21 NT87, 't19', 't2', 't39', 't43', 't20'?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nWait, no, in the given, it's:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nWait, so NT54 can go to either NT21 NT87 or produce 't19'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at other NTs:\n\nLet me list all NTs and their rules clearly:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | 't19'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33 | ... Wait, no: in the given grammar, NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33.\n\nWait, no, let me check each line:\n\nThe grammar lines are:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nNT73 -> NT63 NT42\n\nNT27 -> NT54 NT4\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT36 -> NT90 NT33\n\nNT87 -> 't8'\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT21 -> 't39'\n\nNT33 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT21 -> 't43'\n\nNT33 -> 't48'\n\nNT42 -> 't36'\n\nNT63 -> 't10'\n\nNT27 -> 't20'\n\nNT71 -> 't48'\n\nNT63 -> 't13'\n\nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, okay, each line represents a production. So for NT54, it can produce 't19', 't2', 't20'? Or is each production only one direction?\n\nWait, no. Each production is on a separate line. So:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't20'? No, looking back.\n\nWait, no: the lines are each separate productions. So for NT54:\n\nNT-> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 \u2192 't19'\n\nBut also, in the given grammar, is there another production for NT54? Let me see:\n\nThe lines are:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nAlso, later, 'NT54 -> 't2' appears, wait:\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, it's a series of rules.

{"custom_id":"request-56","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I\u2019ve got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a specific way grammars are structured, usually with all productions being of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe grammar provided is a bit lengthy, so let me try to parse it and see if I can break it down. The string to evaluate is `t48 t2 t35 t11 t11`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar rules step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of the grammar, it all starts with S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, the start is going to generate two non-terminals, NT71 and NT73. Each of these can further produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me think about each part. NT71 and NT73 both produce two non-terminals each. For example, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. Each of these non-terminals might lead to more splits, but eventually, there are rules that produce terminals. \n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example, NT87 \u2192 't8', and NT54 has multiple rules, some of which produce terminals like 't19', 't2', etc. Similarly, NT42 has several rules: NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 or NT42 \u2192 't46'. \n\nSo, to approach this, perhaps I can work backward from the string. Let's split the string into tokens: `t48`, `t2`, `t35`, `t11`, `t11`. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT71 NT73, the string should ultimately be a concatenation of two parts: one part from NT71 and one from NT73.\n\nLet me consider NT71 first. Looking at the grammar, NT71 must produce something that can eventually lead to a series of terminals. Following the productions, NT71 likely leads to other non-terminals. But wait, in the grammar provided, I don\u2019t see NT71 having a direct production except as S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So, maybe I need to see how NT71 is broken down. Wait, let's check the grammar again:\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42, which in turn break down further until some non-terminals produce terminals. But I don't see NT71's production. Hmmm, did I miss something? Wait, no, in the initial list, the start symbol S is the only one with a production, and all the other non-terminals have their own productions. So, S produces NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo, for the string `t48 t2 t35 t11 t11`, it's produced by S, which is NT71 NT73. So, the first part of the string must come from NT71, and the second part from NT73.\n\nLet me first look at the second part, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. Then NT63 and NT42 each have their own productions. For example, NT63 might produce other non-terminals until it results in terminals. \n\nLooking at the NT63 rules: I don't see a direct production, but wait, actually, in the grammar, NT63 is a non-terminal and has its own production. From the given grammar, none of the non-terminals start with NT63 in the initial list, but wait, I might have miscounted. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 or 't46'\n- NT54 can produce 't19', 't2', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 has several productions\n- NT33 has 't11', etc.\n- NT42 \u2192 't46' (that's another one, so maybe I was wrong earlier; it has multiple rules, both producing non-terminals and terminals)\n- NT63 \u2192 't2', perhaps?\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n- Others follow similarly.\n\nWait, so when I look at NT73's expansion: NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. If I can expand both NT63 and NT42 into terminals, then that part generates a string of terminals. \n\nLet's think about NT63. In the given grammar, does NT63 produce anything directly? It seems not, unless I missed it. Wait, I need to check all non-terminals again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT63 is not a starting non-terminal, but I see NT63 appearing in the production S \u2192 NT71 NT73? No, S is NT71 NT73.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go one step back. Maybe NT63 has a production that I overlooked. Let me recount all the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27 or 't46'\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 or 't19' or 't2' or 't21' \u2192 Wait, no, let me recheck.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread. Let me list all the non-terminals with their productions properly.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n2. NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n3. NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n4.

No, perhaps more accurately, the given lines under NT54 are: 't21' \u2192 Wait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar part shows:\n\nNT54 -> NT21 NT87\n\nNT54 -> 't19'\n\nNT42 -> 't46'\n\nWait, maybe each line corresponds to a production for that non-terminal.\n\nSo, the grammar provided is split into multiple lines, each a production for a specific non-terminal.\n\nSo, looking again:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n- NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\n- NT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87\n- NT54 \u2192 't19'\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT27 \u2192 't11'\n- NT33 \u2192 't11'\n- NT42 \u2192 't36'\n- NT63 \u2192 't2'\n- NT27 \u2192 't20'\n- NT71 \u2192 't48'\n- NT63 \u2192 't13'\n- NT90 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, that makes it clearer. So each line is a production rule for a non-terminal.\n\nSo, S produces NT71 and NT73.\n\nEach of these non-terminals is defined as:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\n\nNT71 \u2192 Let's check: NT73 is produced by S, but what about NT71? Wait, maybe I missed NT71's production. Looking again:\n\nThe productions are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nSo, NT71 is a non-terminal that must have its own production. But in the given grammar, after S, I don't see a production for NT71. Hmm, so perhaps NT71 is a single terminal? Or perhaps it\u2019s part of the production chain.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for NT71 in other productions. Let me check all the lines:\n\nNo, I think NT71 is only present in S's production. So, that might be an error, or perhaps it's implied in another way. Alternatively, maybe the user forgot to list NT71's production elsewhere. But given the information, maybe NT71 is a leaf that produces something. Wait, looking at the given grammar, I don't see any production for NT71 other than S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So perhaps NT71 doesn't have any further productions beyond that, which would mean that S \u2192 NT71 NT73 is the definition of NT71, which is similar to how many terminals are handled in CNF.\n\nWait, in Ch"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-71","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string `t48 t2 t35 t48 t2 t35` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT71 NT73. So S -> NT71 NT73. Next, each of these non-terminals (NT71 and NT73) seem to expand further. \n\nLooking at NT71: It has several productions, like NT71 -> NT54 NT36, NT73, etc. Similarly, NT73 expands to NT63 NT42. The key here is that both NT71 and NT73 must eventually derive terminal symbols, and the process should result in the string `t48 t2 t35 t48 t2 t35`.\n\nWait, the string has six terms, but our starting point S is NT71 NT73, which would be two terminal sequences. That seems off because the string has six terms, so each of NT71 and NT73 should generate three terms each. Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking at NT71: it has, for example, NT71 -> NT54 NT36. NT54 has multiple productions, including NT54 -> 't2', etc. So let me try to see if each non-terminal can ultimately lead to a sequence of 't's.\n\nWait, the string is `t48 t2 t35 t48 t2 t35`. Let's break it down: it's a sequence of t48, t2, t35 repeated twice. So it's like (t48 t2 t35) twice.\n\nBut how does that break down into the grammar? Let's see:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73\n\nSo, we need NT71 to produce something that, when combined with NT73, gives us the string. Let's see what each NT71 and NT73 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT73: it starts with NT73 -> NT63 NT42. NT63 -> NT2, which is NT21 and NT63 again. Wait, NT63 has two productions: NT63 -> NT21 NT63 and NT63 -> 't2'. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, NT63 can produce 't2' or NT21 NT63. NT21 has a production NT21 -> 't39'. So if NT63 uses the first production, it would lead into a longer chain with NT63 again, which could potentially loop. But if it uses the second production, it just gives 't2'.\n\nSimilarly, NT27: it can be NT54 NT21. NT54 has several options, including 't19', 't2', 't21', etc. And NT21 is 't39'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try to find a way to get 't35' out of some non-terminal. Looking at NT4, some productions are NT4 -> 't22', NT4 -> 't35', etc. So NT4 can produce 't35'.\n\nLooking back to the grammar, let's see where 't35' comes from. The only NT with a terminal 't35' is NT42 (NT42 -> 't36', but also NT42 -> NT46, etc.) Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me check:\n\nOh, I see NT42 has several productions, one of which is NT42 -> 't46', another is 't36', and others. But NT4 also has NT4 -> 't35'. So perhaps there's a chain that goes through NT4 to get 't35'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT42 -> NT46, and NT46 might produce something else. Wait, the string includes 't48' which is in NT48. Let me see if there are any NTs that produce 't48'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT42 -> 't36', but no NT directly gives 't48'. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me scan the list again. Oh, yes, there's NT27 -> NT33, and NT33 has NT48 NT4. So NT33 can produce 't48' because NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't35' and 't42'. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, NT33 has two productions: NT33 -> NT48 NT4 and NT33 -> NT48 NT33. Also, NT48 is a terminal 't48'.\n\nSo, NT33 can derive 't48' followed by NT4. And NT4 can have various terminal expansions. So if NT33 is expanded as NT48 NT4, that gives 't48' and then something else.\n\nWait, in the string, after 't48' comes 't2', then 't35', and this repeats. So perhaps the derivation needs to produce 't48 t2 t35 t48 t2 t35'.\n\nLet me try to construct a parse tree for this string. Starting from S -> NT71 NT73. Each of NT71 and NT73 should produce three terminals each to make six in total.\n\nSo, let's think about how NT71 and NT73 can derive their respective parts.\n\nLooking at NT71: possible productions include NT71 -> NT54 NT36, which then NT54 can produce 't2' or 't19', 't2' and so on. Similarly, NT36 can produce 't90' or 't33'. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step. Let's consider the entire string and see if each part can be generated.\n\nThe string is: t48 t2 t35 t48 t2 t35.\n\nLet's break it into two parts of three each: t48 t2 t35 and t48 t2 t35.\n\nSo perhaps NT71 generates the first part and NT73 generates the second part.\n\nLooking at NT71: it can expand to NT54 NT36.\n\nThen NT54 can be expanded into various options, such as 't2', 't19', 't21', etc., and NT36 can be 't90' or 't33'.\n\nWait, 't2' is a possibility for NT54, and 't35' could come from NT4's production.\n\nWait, let's think: if NT54 produces 't2' and NT36 somehow leads to 't35'. But NT36 can't directly produce 't35' because the productions for NT36 are 't90' or 't33'. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT36 can expand into NT33, which has production NT48 NT4, so if NT36 is NT33, then it would produce 't48' followed by something else. But that doesn't seem to help because then the next term would be 't48' and then 't35' from NT4. But our string has 't2' after 't48', which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to see if the string can be split into sequences that match the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the string t48 t2 t35 t48 t2 t35, I notice that it's symmetrical. Each part is t48 t2 t35 repeated twice.\n\nLet me check each part t48 t2 t35. So for the first part, where does 't48' come from? Looking at NT33, as I saw earlier, NT33 can produce 't48' because of the production NT33 -> NT48 NT4, and NT4 can have 't35' as a terminal. But also, after NT48 comes NT4, which can be 't35'.\n\nWait, but after NT33 as 't48', the next would be 't35', which is then in the string. But the string has 't2' after 't48' in the first part. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT27 is involved. NT27 can produce NT54 NT21. NT54 has 't2' as a terminal, and NT21 can produce 't39'. So that gives 't2 t39', which isn't matching our string.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another path. Let me check NT27's other productions. For example, NT27 -> NT54 NT21. So that's NT54 and NT21.

{"custom_id":"request-75","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t48 t10 t35 t48 t2 t22`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. It's a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for simplifying the structure of the grammar, which can help in parsing algorithms. Okay, so the grammar provided fits this form because all the rules are either converting non-terminals into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string I'm given is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. My goal is to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying production rules step by step until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar structure:\n\n- S \u2192 NT71 NT73: So the start symbol S produces NT71 and NT73. Both are non-terminals, so the first step is to replace S with NT71 NT73. The string generated will have the sequences from NT71 and NT73 concatenated.\n\nSo, the string `t48 t10 t35 t48 t2 t22` is a sequence of six tokens, so it's six symbols long. Let's see what the start symbol S produces.\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73. NT71 and NT73 are both non-terminals. So each of them should generate a string, and when combined, they should produce the overall string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT73 can produce NT63 NT42 (from rule NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42). Let's check NT63 and NT42.\n\nNT63 has two productions: NT63 \u2192 NT2 and NT90. Looking at the rules, NT63 can go to NT2 or NT90. NT2 is another non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 can go to NT36 NT27 and then further down. NT36 goes to NT90 NT33, and NT90 is 't35', a terminal. NT33 can go to NT11 NT11 or 't11'.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps I can try to break it down.\n\nThe first token is t48. Looking for where t48 appears as a terminal. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 t46\n- NT54 \u2192 t2, t19, t2, t2.\n- NT4 \u2192 t22\n- NT36 \u2192 t90, t33\n- NT4 \u2192 t35\n- NT21 \u2192 t39, t43, t43, etc.\n- NT71 could derive to t48 from NT71 \u2192 NT48? Wait, actually, looking at the rules, do any of these equal t48?\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see any rule that directly gives t48, but maybe through a chain.\n\nWait, checking specific rules:\n\nLooking at NT54 -> 't19', but I don't see t48 there. Let me check all the rules for t48.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me look again:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't2', 't19', 't2', 't2'.\n- NT42 \u2192 't36', which then goes to NT36 \u2192 't90', which goes to 't35' and 't33'.\n- NT71 \u2192 NT48, but wait, is there a rule where NT71\u2192't48'? Hmm, no, but in the rules provided, I don't see any. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42\nNT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\nNT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | 't19', etc.\nNT4 \u2192 various rules, including 't22'\n... continuing down.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a t48. Is there a rule that produces t48? Looking through, the rules for NT54 are 't21 nt87 | t2 | t19 | t2 | t2'. No t48. Wait, maybe a production chain ends in t48.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that t48 might be generated by a non-terminal that eventually leads to t48. For example, NT54 \u2192 t2. No, but perhaps through other steps. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t48 is a direct terminal in one of the rules. Scanning:\n\nLooking at NT54 again:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT21 NT87 | 't19' | 't2' | 't2' | etc. But wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps 't48' is generated by NT42 \u2192 NT36 NT27, and then NT36 \u2192 NT90 NT33, NT90\u2192t35, NT33\u2192t11. But that gives t35 t11, not t48.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t48 is produced by NT71. Let me check NT71. Wait, does NT71 have a production? Looking at the initial rules, I don't see NT71 having a production except S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So NT71 and NT73 are both non-terminals, and each must produce a string.\n\nWait, perhaps NT71 \u2192 something that starts with t48. But in the rules, I don't see a direct link. Alternatively, maybe a longer production chain leads to t48.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the string is split into parts, and each part should correspond to a production.\n\nGiven the string, it's six tokens long. So it's six symbols, so the entire expansion must produce this.\n\nGiven the start symbol S, which is two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. Each of these will produce a sequence of symbols.\n\nSo let's see, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so the overall string is (NT71's string) followed by (NT73's string). The string is six tokens, so maybe each part is three tokens? Or other splits.\n\nLooking at the given string: t48, t10, t35, t48, t2, t22.\n\nt22 is one of the terminals, specifically from NT4 \u2192 t22. So the last token is t22, which must come from NT4. So looking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals produces t22.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t39, t43, etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 t22\n- NT36 \u2192 t90 and t33\n- Others, like NT27 \u2192 t11.\n\nSo t22 must come from NT4. Therefore, one of the parts in the start (either NT71 or NT73) must produce t22 as the last symbol. But since NT71 and NT73 are the children of S, let's see which part ends with t22.\n\nWait, but S is NT71 NT73, so S must directly expand into two parts: NT71's expansion and NT73's expansion, which when concatenated form the string.\n\nSo, the string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT71 and NT73.\n\nSo, the string is of the form (NT71's string) (NT73's string). So, the first part is NT71's tokens, and the second part is NT73's tokens.\n\nSo, the six tokens could be split as, for example, 3 + 3. So, tokens 1-3 from NT71 and 4-6 from NT73. Alternatively, other splits.\n\nThe string is: t48, t10, t35, t48, t2, t22.\n\nLooking at the last three tokens: t48, t2, t22.\n\nt22 is from NT4. So, if the last three tokens are producing from NT73, perhaps NT73's expansion is t48, t2, t22, but that seems off because NT73's production is to NT63 NT42. So NT63 and NT42 must expand into those tokens.\n\nLet's try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nSo the string is the concatenation of NT71_str and NT73_str.\n\nSo, let's figure out each part.\n\nFirst, looking at NT73. NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42.\n\nSo NT63 must produce a string, and NT42 must produce another string.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT2 or NT90, because NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if S can derive this sequence through some sequence of productions.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens: [t48, t13, t35, t48, t43, t8, t22]\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So S derives into two non-terminals: NT71 and NT73. The string has seven tokens, but S produces two non-terminals, so each of these non-terminals will also produce sequences of terminals. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the string is seven tokens long. So when S produces NT71 NT73, each of these leads to sequences. Let me consider what NT71 and NT73 produce.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. Both NT63 and NT42 are non-terminals that can produce terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT71 is a terminal? Wait, no: looking at the rules, NT71 doesn't appear on the left of any production except S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Wait, no, in the rules, NT71 is on the left as a result. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the rules are all A \u2192 something, where A is a non-terminal. The left-hand sides are NT71, NT73, etc. So in the given grammar, NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals. So when S \u2192 NT71 NT73, each of these must be expanded.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the production for NT71 is not defined except in S. Oh, no, in the given grammar, I see that NT71 is not on the left of any production except in S. So it's generated as S \u2192 NT71 NT73, so both NT71 and NT73 are non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nWait a second: in the rules provided, I don't see a production for NT71 except S \u2192 NT71 NT73. Similarly, NT73 is defined as NT63 NT42.\n\nSo let me try to expand S:\n\nS \u2192 NT71 NT73\n\nEach of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into sequences of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals:\n\nNT73, NT63, NT42, NT36, NT87, NT54, NT33, NT4, NT21, NT39, NT63 again, NT71, NT27, NT11, NT4, NT20, NT90.\n\nWait, some are duplicate, like NT63 appears twice, but that's just in the rules.\n\nLet me start expanding:\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nSo the string must start with whatever NT71 produces and then NT73 produces.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t48. So let's see where t48 comes from. Looking at the rules, some non-terminals produce t48. Let's check:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't36' but that's t36, not t48.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce t48. Checking the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT4: it appears on the left of several productions. Hmm, no, wait:\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 't22' (Wait, no, looking again: NT4 is not on the left except in its own productions? Wait, let me re-examine the rules:\n\nThe given grammar has:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't46'\n- NT4 \u2192 't22'\n- NT33 \u2192 't48'\n- So, NT33 \u2192 't48' directly. So if a non-terminal expands to NT33, it can produce t48.\n\nSo perhaps the production needs to go through NT33.\n\nBut let me check the entire string step by step.\n\nThe string is t48 t13 t35 t48 t43 t8 t22.\n\nSo the first token is t48. Let's see how that can be generated. It can come from NT33, since NT33 \u2192 't48'. So if NT33 expands to t48, then the first part is fine.\n\nBut we need to find where the t48 in the string comes from. Let's see how S can lead to it.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT71 NT73. So the first part is NT71, which needs to expand into t48. So NT71 must produce t48.\n\nWait, but in the rules, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, and NT71 isn't defined in terms of terminals except as part of S. So perhaps NT71 must be expanded further. Let me look for NT71 in the rules. I don't see any production for NT71 except in S. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the given rules again:\n\nThe given grammar includes:\n\n- NT71 as a right-hand side in S \u2192 NT71 NT73.\n\nBut there's no production for NT71 except for in S. So perhaps NT71 is only used in S, meaning that it must be a terminal. But that can't be unless it's defined as a terminal.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, all symbols start with a capital letter, like S, NT71, etc., indicating non-terminals. So if there's no production for NT71, except in S, that suggests that NT71 might be only used in S, but that would require it to produce terminals or to reduce back. But in a CFG in CNF, non-terminals must have two-terminals or produce two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, with B and C also non-terminals. So in the given rules, only the non-terminals on the left side are defined. So, for example, NT73 \u2192 NT63 NT42. So to expand NT73, I need to expand NT63 and NT42.\n\nBut then, the question is, what do NT71 and NT73 produce? Looking at the given rules, S \u2192 NT71 NT73, but there's no production for NT71 or NT73, except what's in the rules.\n\nWait a second: I think I've missed that.

Or maybe that's NT63's production.\n\nWait the grammar given is:\n\nNT63 -> NT90 NT35\nWait no, let me check the user's grammar again:\n\nHere's the grammar part:\n\nS -> NT71 NT73  \nNT73 -> NT63 NT42  \nNT27 -> NT54 NT4  \nNT42 -> NT36 NT27  \nNT54 -> NT21 NT87  \nNT36 -> NT90 NT33  \nNT87 -> 't8'  \nNT54 -> 't19'  \nNT42 -> 't46'  \nNT54 -> 't2'  \nNT4 -> 't22'  \nNT21 -> 't39'  \nNT63 -> 't2'  \nNT73 -> 't24'  \nNT27 -> 't11'  \nNT33 -> 't11'  \nNT4 -> 't35'  \nNT21 -> 't43'  \nNT33 -> 't48'  \nNT42 -> 't36'  \nNT63 -> 't10'  \nNT27 -> 't20'  \nNT71 -> 't48'  \nNT63 -> 't13'  \nNT90 -> 't35'\n\nWait, okay, this is a bit confusing. Let me arrange them:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n1. S -> NT71 NT73  \n2. NT73 -> NT63 NT42  \n3. NT27 -> NT54 NT4  \n4. NT42 -> NT36 NT27  \n5. NT54 -> NT21 NT87  \n6. NT36 -> NT90 NT33  \n7. NT87 -> 't8'  \n8. NT54 -> 't19'  \n9. NT42 -> 't46'  \n10. NT54 -> 't2'  \n11. NT4 -> 't22'  \n12. NT21 -> 't39'  \n13. NT63 -> 't2'  \n14. NT73 -> 't24'  \n15. NT27 -> 't11'  \n16. NT33 -> 't11'  \n17. NT4 -> 't35'  \n18. NT21 -> 't43'  \n19. NT33 -> 't48'  \n20. NT42 -> 't36'  \n21. NT63 -> 't10'  \n22. NT27 -> 't20'  \n23. NT71 -> 't48'  \n24. NT63 -> 't13'  \n25. NT90 -> 't35'\n\nSo NT63 has two productions: NT63-> 't2' (line 13) and NT63-> 't13' (line 24). So both are possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, NT73: looking at line 2, NT73-> NT63 NT42. Then NT63 can become 't2' or 't13', and NT42 can become either a terminal or through other rules.\n\nWait, let's take it step by step.\n\nStart from S: S is NT71 NT73. NT71 can only produce 't48' (line 23). So S produces 't48' followed by whatever NT73 produces.\n\nSo if S expands to 't48' + (expansion of NT73).\n\nNow, let's look at NT73: line 2, NT73-> NT63 NT42. So NT73 expands into NT63 and NT42.\n\nSo let's expand NT63 and NT42.\n\nNT63 can expand into 't2' or 't13' (lines 13 and 24). Similarly, NT42 expands into various non-terminals or terminals. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT42: line 4, 9, 20, 20, and 20: Wait, line 4: NT42-> NT36 NT27; line 9: NT42-> NT36 NT27; wait wait, line 20 is NT42-> 't46', line 9 is NT42-> NT36 NT27, line 20 is NT42-> 't46', and line 20 was line 9 in initial list.\n\nWait, perhaps the lines are misnumbered, but perhaps in the provided grammar, NT42 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nFrom lines 4, 9, 20... I see:\n\nNT42 -> NT36 NT27  \nNT42 -> NT36 NT27  \nNT42 -> 't46'  \nNT42 -> 't36' (line 20?) Or perhaps line 20 is: line 20: NT42 -> 't46'; line  line 20 is perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
