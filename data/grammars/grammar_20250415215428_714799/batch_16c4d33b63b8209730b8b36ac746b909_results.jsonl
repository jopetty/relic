{"custom_id":"request-0","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is `t3`. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with production rules. Each rule has two non-terminals on the left side. For example, S -> NT64 NT96, and so on. The terminal symbols are the ones that appear on the right side of the rules, like 't3'. The string we're checking is just 't3'.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right? Wait, no, actually, in the provided rules, each production seems to have exactly two non-terminals. So that's consistent with CNF.\n\nNow, our string is just a single terminal symbol: t3. So I need to check if the start symbol S can derive this string through some sequence of productions.\n\nLet's look at the production rules for S. There are three:\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these productions involves two non-terminals. So from S, the first step is to choose one of these and replace S with two non-terminals. Let's see what each of these two non-terminals can produce.\n\nLet's take the first production: S -> NT64 NT96. So NT64 and NT96 need to derive t3. Let's check the rules for NT64 and NT96.\n\nLooking at NT64, it can produce NT84 NT62. So NT64 becomes NT84 and NT62. Now, each of these needs to be terminals or produce terminals.\n\nNext, NT84's production rule is NT4 NT1. Now, NT4 is a terminal: 't1'. NT1 is another production that depends on other non-terminals. Let's see NT1: NT5 NT77. So NT1 becomes NT5 and NT77. Each of these needs to be resolved.\n\nNT5 is a terminal: 't2'. NT77's production is NT1 NT62. NT1 is 't2', and NT62 is 't0'. So putting it all together: NT77 -> 't2' 't0' which is 't2t0'. But the string we're checking is just 't3', so this path might not lead to that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about each non-terminal and see where it leads.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to trace backward. The string is t3. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't3'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't3' is NT78 -> 't3' or maybe NT74. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through the terminals, NT78 is present, and its rule is NT78 -> 't0'. No, that's 't0'. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me list out all the terminal rules:\n\n- NT68 -> 't4'\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't3'\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT68 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> 't3'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT43 -> 't0'\n- NT53 -> 't2'\n- NT84 -> 't0'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT74 -> 't3'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT47 -> 't4'\n- NT14 -> 't0'\n- NT96 -> 't4'\n- NT47 -> 't4'\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't0'\n- NT77 -> 't1'\n- NT98 -> 't0'\n- NT77 -> 't3'\nWait, I think I might have duplicated some rules. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, no, some non-terminals like NT77 have multiple production rules. For example, NT77 -> 't1', 't3', etc. So the production NT77 can derive 't1' or 't3' or other combinations if it does multiple steps.\n\nWait, but looking again, for example, NT77: the rule is NT77 -> 't1' and also NT77 -> 't3'. So if a derivation reaches NT77, it can produce either 't1' or 't3' directly as a terminal symbol.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have direct terminal productions. For example, NT26 has a production to 't3', which is exactly what we need. So if any non-terminal can produce 't3' directly, then perhaps that's a path.\n\nWait, so the string is 't3', which is a single terminal. Let's see which non-terminals can directly produce 't3' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, let's list all non-terminals that have a production to a single terminal:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal:\n\n- NT68: can produce 't4', 't2' (from different rules), 't3'?\nWait, let me go through each non-terminal:\n\nNT68 -> 't4' (from the rule NT68 -> 't4'), also NT68-> 't2' (from the rule not listed in the initial grammar, wait no, looking back, I see that in the initial presentation of the grammar, there are lines like:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\nNT68 -> NT1, etc. Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, the rules are a list, some of which are not terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-2","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the string \"t1\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the production rules. The start symbol is S, and it can produce combinations like NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, etc. So S is replaced by two non-terminals.\n\nNext, I'll list the non-terminals and their productions. For example, NT47 can produce NT21 NT3, and so on. But some non-terminals, like NT64, NT68, and so on, directly produce terminals 't' or specific characters. Wait, actually, some are more complex. Wait, let me see the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice some have 't' followed by a number. For example, NT64 -> 't4', NT63 -> 't2', NT54 -> 't3' and 't4', etc. So these non-terminals when expanded produce a 't' followed by a number. But others, like NT3 or NT7, have two options. For instance, NT33 can produce NT84 NT81 or 't1', and NT36 can produce 't4'.\n\nWait, the string in question is \"t1\". So the question is, can we derive \"t1\" from the start symbol S?\n\nLet me think about how a single 't1' can come from the grammar. Looking at the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce 't' followed by a number, like NT64 -> 't4', NT63 -> 't2', etc. But none directly produce 't1' except maybe some I'm missing. Wait, looking again:\n\nNT39 -> NT70 NT39: this is a right recursion, which I can ignore for now unless it's part of the derivation.\n\nWait, let's see. The string is only \"t1\", which is a single token. So to get \"t1\", I need a non-terminal that directly expands to 't1'. Looking at the productions:\n\nI see NT1 -> 't2', NT77 -> 't1', NT47 -> 't4', NT14 -> NT33 NT27, and so on. None of the non-terminals directly produce 't1', except perhaps NT33 -> 't1', wait no:\n\nWait, no. Let's look again:\n\nLooking at the NT productions, does any non-terminal produce 't1' directly?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT64 -> 't4'\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't3' and 't4'\n- NT39 -> NT70 NT39 (which probably leads to another production)\n- NT62 -> 't0'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT21 -> 't4'\n- NT74 -> 't4'\n- NT53 -> 't2'\n- NT84 -> 't2'\n- NT33 -> 't0' and 't1'? Wait, no:\n\nWait, looking back, the NT33 production is: NT33 -> NT84 NT81 (terminal), but initially, I might have misread. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT33 has two options: one is NT33 -> NT84 NT81, which are both non-terminals. Another is NT36 -> 't4'\u2014wait, let me look again. No, NT33 is:\n\nLooking through, here's the list for NT33: \n\nNT33 has production rules:\n\n- NT33 -> NT84 NT81\n- NT33 -> NT81 (duplicate? Or was that a typo?)\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, NT33 is listed as:\n\nNT33 -> NT84 NT81\n\nWait, is that all? Or is there another production for NT33?\n\nWait no, looking again, the provided grammar doesn't list another production for NT33 beyond NT33 -> NT84 NT81. Hmm, but in the provided grammar, here's a line:\n\nNT33 -> NT84 NT81\n\nSo that means NT33 produces NT84 and NT81. Both NT84 and NT81 are non-terminals. So NT33 can't directly produce 't1'. Looking further, are there any non-terminals that directly produce 't1'?\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see NT96 -> 't4', NT54 -> 't2', NT77 -> 't1', NT33 -> NT84 NT81, but none of the others except NT77 directly produce 't1'. So the only non-terminal that directly produces 't1' is NT77.\n\nSo, to get 't1', the derivation must involve NT77 expanding to 't1'. Now, can NT77 be derived from the start symbol S?\n\nLooking back, the start symbol is S, which expands into combinations like NT97 NT7, etc. So let's see what the productions from S are:\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S -> NT97 NT7\n2. S -> NT96 NT96\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo S can produce any of these. We need to see if any of these lead to NT77 somehow, because NT77 is the only non-terminal that directly gives 't1'.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n1. For S -> NT97 NT7:\n\nNow, looking at NT97 and NT7.\n\nLooking at NT97: There's a production NT97 -> NT43 NT75. So NT97 expands into NT43 and NT75.\n\nNow, each of NT43 and NT75: Let's see their productions.\n\nNT43: Looking through, I don't see it being defined. Wait, perhaps I need to check the list. Oh, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT43 -> 't0'?\n\nWait, let's look: \n\nLooking for NT43 in the production list.\n\nYes, I find this line:\n\nNT43 -> 't0'.\n\nSo NT43 -> 't0'. Then NT75: its production is NT98 NT26.\n\nLooking at NT98, its production is NT78 NT14. So:\n\nNT98 -> NT78 NT14.\n\nNT78 -> 't0'.\n\nNT14 -> NT33 NT27. So let's break it down.\n\nSo stepping through:\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75.\n\nNT43 -> 't0'\nNT75 -> NT98 NT26\nNT98 -> NT78 NT14\nNT78 -> 't0'\nNT14 -> NT33 NT27\n\nSo replacing those:\n\nNT97 -> 't0' (from NT43) and NT75 which is NT98 NT26 -> ('t0' and NT26).\n\nNT26's production: NT26 -> 't3'. So NT26 is 't3'.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nNT97 -> T0 (from NT43) and NT75 which is NT98 NT26 -> T0 and T3 (from NT26).\n\nSo overall, NT97 -> T0, T0, T3, or more accurately, T0 (from NT43) and T0 T3 (from NT75).\n\nThus, NT97's expansion is T0, T0, T3. So the production for NT97 is 't0 t0 t3' or concatenated \"t0t0t3\".\n\nNow, the other part of S's first production is NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7: Its production is NT66 NT48.\n\nSo NT66 -> NT52 NT63.\n\nNT52 -> NT74 NT62. Both of these are non-terminals.\n\nLooking further:\n\nNT52 -> NT74 NT62\n\nNT74 has a production NT53 NT75.\n\nNT53's production: NT53 -> NT86 NT33\n\nWait, but NT33's production is NT84 NT81, which are non-terminals. So NT33 can't produce directly 't1' as per earlier. So NT53 -> 't2' and other?\n\nWait, let me see: NT53 -> NT86 NT33.\n\nLooking at NT86's production: NT86 -> 't0'.\n\nNT33's production is as before: NT84 NT81.\n\nAnd NT84 has NT4 NT1: So NT84 -> 't4' from NT4 and 't1' from NT1.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-examine NT84's production:\n\nFrom the grammar: NT84 -> NT4 NT1.\n\nSo NT84 can produce 't4' (if NT4 expands to that) or 't1' (if NT1 expands to that).\n\nBut NT4's production is NT68 NT3.

So in this case, '4' is a terminal, but does that mean the rule NT84 -> '4' '1' is written as NT84 -> '41' or is that two separate rules? Hmm, looking at the given grammar, it's written as NT84 -> NT4 NT1. Each symbol after the arrow is a separate part. So that's correct for CNF: two non-terminals on the right. But '4' is a terminal, which would be in the right-hand side as a single terminal.

Let me list all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\n\nNT1 -> NT5 NT77\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT53 -> NT86 NT33\n\nNT7 -> NT66 NT48\n\nNT33 -> NT84 NT81\n\nNT38 -> NT34 NT27\n\nNT12 -> NT82 NT48\n\nNT5 -> NT68 NT3\n\nNT38 -> NT63 NT96\n\nNT14 -> NT33 NT27\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nNT39 -> NT70 NT39\n\nNT24 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT98 -> NT78 NT14\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nNT75 -> NT98 NT26\n\nNT53 -> NT39 NT80\n\nNT70 -> NT84 NT36\n\nNT27 -> NT24 NT62\n\nNT3 -> NT22 NT74\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\n\nNT63 -> 't1'\n\nNT47 -> 't1'\n\nWait, hold on. There are rules where the right side is a single terminal. For example, NT63 -> 't1', and so on. So in CNF, right-hand sides can be either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So that's acceptable.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is \"t3 t3\".\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar. Let's break it down into two parts, each being a single symbol, since the grammar can produce two symbols at a time, each being a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, no, each production in the grammar can generate two symbols, either two non-terminals (which can in turn produce other symbols), or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, but that's not standard CNF. Wait, maybe in this case, the productions with terminals are rules that produce single terminals, but in the grammar, I see rules like NT84 -> NT4 NT1, which would produce a string of two symbols. Or perhaps the grammar is written in such a way that when it's a terminal, it's just written as NT84 -> 't0', but in reality, that's a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided the grammar with some rules ending with symbols like 't0', 't1', etc. For example, NT63 -> 't1', NT3 -> 't0', etc. So these are terminal symbols. So the grammar is using single-character terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string \"t3 t3\", which is two terminals, each being 't3', we need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLet me think about how the start symbol S can derive two terminals. Let's see the productions available for S:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\n\nS -> NT97 NT7\n\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo, S can generate pairs of non-terminals. For example, S can become NT64 NT96, which then can each derive further non-terminals until we get down to terminals.\n\nOur target string is \"t3 t3\", so we need two terminal 't3's. Let's explore each possible production for S.\n\nFirst possibility: S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nNow, NT64 and NT96 will each have their own productions. Let's see what NT64 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT64 can only go to NT84 followed by NT62. Both are non-terminals.\n\nNow, NT84 has two productions: NT84 -> '4' '1' (since NT84 -> NT4 NT1 is not present anymore, because looking at the list, it's NT84 -> NT4? Wait, no. Looking back, I see NT84 has:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1 (from line: NT84 -> NT4 NT1). Wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, looking at line 19: NT84 -> NT4 NT1. Yes, so NT84 can produce NT4 followed by NT1. But NT4 is not defined. Wait, maybe the problem is that there are more non-terminals than they should be, or perhaps some are missing.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules for NT4, NT1, etc. Wait, looking through the rules, I only see NT64, NT66, NT35, etc. But I don't see any production for NT4. So perhaps NT4 is a terminal? Let me check the terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT63 -> 't1', NT33 -> 't1', etc. Wait, but the terminal symbols are '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, two non-terminals, or maybe three, but all right? Looking at the productions, I see S is defined as NT64 NT96, which are two non-terminals. So the start symbol S will split into NT64 and NT96. My task is to see if this can derive `t0 t4`.\n\nI need to check if each non-terminal can expand into the corresponding terminals in the correct order. Let's look at NT64 and NT96.\n\nLooking at NT64: It has rules NT84 NT62, NT53 NT86, and NT33 NT84. Wait, in the list, I see NT66 is another production, but NT64 doesn't seem to be in the list anymore. Hmmm, maybe I misread. Let me check.\n\nWait, the NT64 rule isn't present. Oh, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, let me see:\n\nIn the given grammar, the NT entries go from NT1 to NT98. For NT64, I don't see an explicit production in the rules after the NT... lines. Wait, no, in the initial list, NT64 is one of the productions? Let me check:\n\nThe initial list includes:\nS -> NT64 NT96\nS -> NT97 NT7\nS -> NT35 NT84\nThen, a lot of NTx -> NTy NTz entries.\n\nWait, in the NT64 line, I see it's written as NT64 -> NT84 NT62. So, that's one of the productions for NT64. So NT64 can expand into NT84 and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 is defined as -> NT54 NT53, from the line: NT53 -> NT86 NT33, etc.\n\nWait, no, wait, looking at NT96: It says \"NT96 -> NT54 NT53\" \u2014 yes, that's correct.\n\nSo starting from S:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\nWhich then NT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nSo the string after first step is NT84 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nWait, but the given string is t0 t4. So we have to see if these non-terminals can produce t0 and t4.\n\nBut wait, each step produces more non-terminals, right? Or do they? No, the productions can sometimes produce terminals.\n\nLooking back, for example, NT3 -> 't0', so NT3 can produce t0 directly. Similarly, NT7 -> 't2', etc.\n\nSo perhaps I need to find a way for the initial NT64 and NT96 to produce the required t0 and t4, with possibly other symbols in between.\n\nWait, but the string given is only two terminals: t0 and t4. So starting from S, which is NT64 NT96, each of those needs to expand into something that collectively can produce t0 and t4. But since each production is two non-terminals, unless those can each derive a single terminal, which seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think in terms of derivation:\n\nStart with S.\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 (from the given rules)\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nSo now, the string is NT84 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nBut NT84 can expand further. Let's see: Looking through the NT rules, there's NT35 \u2192 t3. Hmm, but maybe I need to find a way to get t0 and t4.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check each symbol in the string `t0 t4` and see if they can be produced from S.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Each NT64 and NT96 must expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that eventually produce t0 and t4. But since the string given is `t0 t4`, it's a two-terminal string, so each NT must derive exactly one terminal.\n\nBut how? Because each production for NT* results in two non-terminals, which would imply that the terminal count increases. Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the derivation tree would result in the entire string being the leaves, which is `t0 t4`. So S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Let's see what each NT64 and NT96 can derive.\n\nFirst, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So let's examine NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 can be derived as per rules. Looking through the grammar, I remember NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. Let's see what NT4 does. NT4 \u2192 t1, which is a terminal? Wait, looking back, the NT4 row is: NT4 \u2192 't1'.\n\nWait, according to the provided data:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't1'\nSo NT4 is a terminal symbol? Or is it a non-terminal that just produces t1.\n\nWait, that's a terminal. So NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, which would be t1 t1.\n\nWait, no. Because I'm getting confused: NT84 is a non-terminal, right? Because the production is NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. So the two non-terminals on the right, so NT84 becomes two non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nWait, unless one of them produces a terminal. So NT4 produces 't1', which is a terminal, and NT1 produces 't2'?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nNT1 is defined as NT5 NT77.\n\nWait, then NT5 is NT68 NT3, which eventually leads to t2. Wait, this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this as a tree where each step adds non-terminals until they produce terminals. But with the given string, `t0 t4`, which is two terminals, we need the non-terminals to produce exactly\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a terminals in the correct order.\n\nWait, starting from S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Let's expand each of these:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't1' (terminal)\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77.\n\nWait, so NT1 expands into NT5 and NT77.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3.\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0' (terminal)\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, wait. NT3 is 't0', yes. So NT5 \u2192 NT68 (t0) and NT3 (t0). Wait, so NT5 becomes t0 t0.\n\nBut then, NT1 would be NT5 NT77 \u2192 t0 t0 followed by NT77.\n\nNT77 is defined as 't1', which is a terminal.\n\nSo NT1 = NT5 NT77 \u2192 t0 t0 t1.\n\nWait, but that would make NT1 produce three terminals, but that's not matching because in the previous step, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which are two non-terminals, each of which expands to two non-terminals, making four non-terminals in the initial step.\n\nBut the given string only has two terminals, so I must be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to see if NT64 can derive 't0' and NT96 can derive 't4', or vice versa.\n\nWait, let me check the definitions:\n\nNT62: Looking back, the list has:\n\nNT62 is defined where? Not explicitly listed except for some expansions, but perhaps it's not present. So I think NT62 is a non-terminal, and perhaps it doesn't derive to any terminals, which would be a problem.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 and NT53 may not derive to terminals.\n\nWait, but let's look for any NT productions that end with terminals.\n\nLooking through the given NT rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't4' ?\n\nWait, looking at NT66 \u2192 't4' yes, that's in the list.\n\nWait, in the initial list, I see:\n\nNT66 -> 't4'?\n\nWait, no, looking at the given NT rules:\n\nLooking for NTx -> t*, I have:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT74 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT80 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT81 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, wait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for each NTx:\n\n- NT3: 't0'\n\n- NT4: 't1'\n\n- NT1: NT5 NT77"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-39","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string, `t1 t0 t0`, is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific rules: each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, most of the productions are A \u2192 BC, and some end with terminals like 't0' or 't1'. So, it fits the CNF criteria.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t1 t0 t0`. Each 't' is a terminal symbol. Since each step in the derivation can only produce two non-terminals, I need to figure out how the string can be broken down into those.\n\nLet me list the productions again to reference them:\n\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nThese are the three options for S. Each production splits into two non-terminals. Since the string is `t1 t0 t0`, which is three tokens, I might need at least two productions to reach this. Let's see:\n\nStarting from S, suppose we take one production, say S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded further until we get terminals.\n\nLooking at NT64 and NT96, I see NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 and NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. So expanding NT64 gives NT84 and NT62, and NT96 gives NT54 and NT53.\n\nNow, each of these can be expanded again. Let's take NT62. The production for NT62 is \"t0\". So NT62 \u2192 t0. Similarly, NT54 \u2192 NT1, and NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33. Wait, that's not terminal. Hmm, need to check again.\n\nWait, looking at the NT62 production: it's a terminal. Similarly, NT54 is NT1, which might be terminal. Let me track that.\n\nWait, the production for NT1 is NT68 NT3, which are non-terminals. Hmm, so that's getting complicated. Maybe I should try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for sequences that can reach 't1', 't0', 't0'. Let's see possible paths.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT97 NT7, let's check what NT97 and NT7 can produce.\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, and NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48.\n\nSo NT97 expands to NT43 and NT75, and NT7 expands to NT66 and NT48.\n\nNow, NT43 \u2192 NT4 NT1, which are non-terminals. NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26. NT4 is a terminal? Wait, no, looking back, NT4 production isn't listed. Wait, let me check the grammar again. Looking through the productions, most are two non-terminals except some end with 't'. For example, NT68 \u2192 't4', NT77 \u2192 't2', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT68 \u2192 't4', which is a terminal. But in our case, I'm trying to get 't1', 't0', 't0'.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try building the string `t1 t0 t0` step by step. Each step adds two symbols to the string since S produces two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no\u2014each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the initial S is one symbol, then it's split into two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time a production is applied. Wait, no\u2014each production replaces one non-terminal with two, so the total number increases by one. So starting from S (1 symbol), after one production, you get two non-terminals (2), then each step could increase by one. But the target is three symbols, which would require two productions from S.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: S \u2192 A B. Then A can be expanded into C D, and B into E F, leading to C D E F, which is four symbols. But our target is three symbols, so perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe one of the non-terminals in A or B can only produce a single terminal symbol, combining to form a two-symbol string.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see if the string can be generated with S expanding into two non-terminals, then one of those non-terminals further expanding into one terminal, but that doesn't make sense because in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals, so the number of symbols increases.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

The string is \"t0 t0 t1\", and I need to determine if it's generated by the grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has all productions either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most rules seem to fit this: they all have two non-terminals on the right side, except some directly produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. Wait, no, actually in CNF, the right-hand side should consist of two non-terminals, except for the terminals being single characters. So perhaps some productions are exceptions, maybe the ones that directly produce terminals.\n\nLet me check the grammar again. Most rules have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT64 NT96. But then I see production rules like S \u2192 NT97 NT7, which is also two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe all the non-terminals are defined in a way that produces either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, some of these have a single terminal on the RHS. Like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, that's okay, two non-terminals. But some like NT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27, again two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that some rules directly produce a terminal. Let me look again. The terminal symbols are 't0', 't1', etc. So in the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't1', NT7 \u2192 't0', etc. So those are productions where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. But in CNF, a production can have a single terminal, so that's fine.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is \"t0 t0 t1\". Since the grammar uses 't0', 't1', etc., the terminals are probably separated by spaces in the input string, meaning the string is a sequence of 't0', 't0', 't1'. So I need to see if the grammar can derive this string starting from S.\n\nFirst, let's consider the starting symbol S. The productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo S produces pairs of non-terminals.

Maybe we need to see which rules produce these terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't2'\nNT35 \u2192 't3'\nWait, but in our string, we have 't0's. So perhaps NT96 \u2192 't4'? Or wait, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, NT54 \u2192 't4' is a production. But in the string, we have 't0's.

{"custom_id":"request-59","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether the string \"t2 t2 t4 t1\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal (like S, NTx) has rules that either break it down into two non-terminals or directly produce a terminal symbol (like t0, t1, etc.).\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the first step is to see which of these can lead to the string \"t2 t2 t4 t1\". Since the string has four tokens, the derivation will require splitting the start symbol into four non-terminals, which is possible if we have three intermediate steps where each non-terminal splits into two. Alternatively, maybe some non-terminals can directly produce terminals, but given that all the initial productions split into two non-terminals, I think S has to generate four non-terminals which then get replaced into terminals.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, S produces three different combinations. Let me consider each starting point:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96\nSo, NT64 and NT96 will each have to produce the required t's. Let me check what NT64 and NT96 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 (and 4 \u2192 t1, 1 \u2192 t2)\nWait, let me parse this. NT84 can produce 't4' and 't1' as terminals. Similarly, NT62 \u2192 t0 and t0? Wait, looking back:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\nNT52 \u2192 NT22 NT6\nWait, I think I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should approach this by trying to find a way to generate four terminal symbols, starting from S.\n\nEach step from S splits into two non-terminals, so from S, three splits are needed to get four terminals. So each split must eventually produce terminals. So, each of the three intermediate non-terminals must derive into a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals can produce terminals directly, but looking at the productions, most are non-terminals splitting into other non-terminals, except for the ones that end with 'tX' like NT3 \u2192 t0, etc.\n\nWait, I notice that some NTs directly go to 't' symbols. For example:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nBut NT84 can eventually produce 't4' (from NT4 \u2192 t1? Wait, no, let me see.\n\nHold on, let me take it slowly.\n\nFirst, I need to get four 't's: t2, t2, t4, t1.\n\nLet me consider each possibility for the initial split of S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nWe need to see if NT64 and NT96 can produce t2, t2, t4, t1 through their derivations.\n\nLet's see what NT64 can do:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNow, NT84: NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT4 \u2192 t1, and NT1 \u2192 t2\n\nWait, no, looking back: NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62 (which I already used).

NT54 is not a terminal because the rule NT54 \u2192 't3' is not listed. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, looking back at the original grammar rules provided:\n\nWait, here's the grammar provided:\n\n...\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT84 -> 't2'\nNT12 -> 't3'\nNT39 -> 't0'\nNT64 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT47 -> 't4'\nNT77 -> 't3'\nNT96 -> 't4'\nNT98 -> 't0'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT78 -> 't0'\n...\n\nWait, so yes, NT54 isn't a terminal, it must be an internal node. So NT54 \u2192 something else.\n\nNow, looking at the string \"t0 t1 t4 t3\". Four tokens, which suggests a derivation of depth 3 (since each step in a CNF grammar replaces two symbols with something else; but in this case, the start symbol S might produce two nodes, each of which would need to produce two more, but it's a bit complicated).\n\nBut let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t0, t1, t4, t3. So four terms, implying possibly three production steps from S, but let's see.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. S has two production rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\nS \u2192 other rules (but in this case, since S only appears in the first two, but the string begins with t0, which is from NT64 or NT96, etc.)\n\nLet's take S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Both NT64 and NT96 will need to derive the appropriate tokens.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't4' (from the rules, yes, NT64 \u2192 't4')\nNT96 \u2192 't4' (yes, NT96 \u2192 't4')\n\nWait, but in the string, the second token is 't1', not 't4', so that would not fit. Hmm, so maybe S uses one of its other production rules, like S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, S has four production rules, but I only listed two. Wait, let me look again:\n\nUnder the grammar, the S rules are:\n\nS->NT64 NT96\n\nS->NT97 NT7\n\nS->NT35 NT84\n\nSo there are three S production rules.\n\nWait, so the string begins with 't0', which is produced by NT64 or other terminals.\n\nBut if S starts with NT64, which produces 't4', which is the third token in the string. But in the string, the first token is 't0', which would require that NT64 produces 't0', but according to the rules, NT64 is 't4'. Therefore, perhaps S starts with NT97 or NT35.\n\nLet me check NT97: NT97 \u2192 't2' (from the rules). The second token in the string is 't1', which doesn't match.\n\nNext, S\u2192NT35 NT84. NT35 \u2192 't3' and NT84 \u2192 't2'. So the string starts with t0, which doesn't fit either.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the possible production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at all possible ways to get 't0', 't1', etc., from S.\n\nWait, another approach: Each production rule in CNF can only have two symbols on the right-hand side. So, for the string to be generated, each token (t0, t1, etc.) must be either a terminal produced from a rule or derived from a chain of productions.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the string: t0, t1, t4, t3. So four tokens. That suggests that the derivation starts with S, which might produce two non-terminals, each of which then produce two more, ending up with four terminals.\n\nSo for S \u2192 A B, each A and B must produce two terminals each, so A \u2192 t0 x, B \u2192 y t1, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps one of A or B is a deeper production chain.\n\nAlternatively, S might produce two symbols which each generate two tokens, requiring two steps.\n\nBut let's look for a way that the four tokens can be derived.\n\nLet me try to see which S rule can lead to the string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nNT64 \u2192 't4' (so first token should be t4, but in the string it's t0) \u2192 doesn't fit.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2' (so first token is t2, but the string starts with t0) \u2192 no.\n\nOption 3: S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nNT35 \u2192 't3', NT84 \u2192 't2' \u2192 the string starts with t0 \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the S rules start with a terminal that matches the first token 't0'. Wait, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the S rules.\n\nWait, let me check the original grammar again"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-80","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string `t4 t2 t1 t4 t2` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has a start symbol S, and from S, there are three production rules. Let me list them:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo the start symbol S first splits into pairs of N-terminal symbols. Each of these N-terminals then has their own production rules, which either are N-terminals again or eventually resolve to terminal symbols (the ones ending with 't' and numbers). \n\nLooking at the first production rule: S -> NT64 NT96. Then, NT64 produces NT84 NT62, and NT96 produces NT54 NT53. Wait, but in the given string, the first token is t4. Let me check where the terminals correspond.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NT symbols produce a terminal 't' immediately. For example, NT68 -> 't0', NT97 -> 't2', etc.\n\nThe string is `t4 t2 t1 t4 t2`. So a sequence of 5 tokens. Since the grammar starts with S and each expansion is two symbols, I might need to consider how many steps it takes to reach the string length.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is two symbols. So the initial expansion of S would produce two NT symbols. Each of those might expand further, each expansion potentially generating two more symbols, but some might be terminals.\n\nThe string has an odd number of tokens (5), which suggests that maybe the derivation process involves some steps where more than one NT token expands at the same level. Or perhaps some of the NT symbols produce more than one terminal or require multiple steps to fully expand.\n\nWait, no, in a standard CNF grammar, each production is a pair of N-terminals, so each step produces two symbols. To get the string, you have to consider how the NTs expand, each time adding two symbols until you get down to the terminals.\n\nBut let's see. The start symbol S expands into two NTs, and each of those becomes something else, which may themselves expand into two NTs, etc., until you reach terminals.\n\nLet me try to trace a possible derivation.\n\nStarting with S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nThen, NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nAnd NT96 -> NT54 NT53.\n\nNow, looking at NT54: NT54 -> 't3'.\n\nWait, but let me check. The entries for the N-terminals:\n\nNT54's production: NT54 -> 't3'.\n\nSo NT54 becomes t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT53: looking at NT53's productions, I see NT53 -> 't2' and also NT53 -> NT86 NT33. So it can be either 't2' or further expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT62: NT62's production is NT52 NT63.\n\nWait, let me get back. It might be easier to see the possible steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should build a parse tree for the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the minimum number of steps needed for the grammar to generate a string of 5 terminals.\n\nBut let me think: each application of a production reduces the NT count by one, replacing one NT with two. So starting with S, which generates two NTs. Each NT can generate either two more NTs or, in the case of a terminal, just contribute a terminal.\n\nSo to get a string of length 5 terminals, how does that break down?\n\nWell, let's count the number of terminals in the string: 5.\n\nStarting from S, each expansion step increases the number of symbols by one. Because S is one NT, which becomes two NTs. Each of those can expand, but each step either replaces a single NT with two, so the number of NTs can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the number of terminals required.\n\nWait, each production is two NTs, which become tokens. So starting with S, the first expansion gives two NTs. Perhaps each of those can produce two NTs, so four tokens, but some of those might be terminals.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Instead, perhaps I can see the possible sequences of NT expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the terminals in the string and see if they can be produced by the appropriate NTs.\n\nLooking at `t4 t2 t1 t4 t2`.\n\nLet me try to match this sequence step by step, perhaps in reverse, using a top-down approach.\n\nWait, let's consider the grammar rules that produce t's:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't0', according to NT7 -> 't0';\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nWait, the given grammar has many entries.

{"custom_id":"request-74","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I\u2019ve got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t2 t2 t0 t0 t4`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This structure makes it easier for certain parsing techniques, like the CYK algorithm, but since I don't have to implement that here, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nLet me look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo S can expand into three different combinations of non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals probably further expand into other non-terminals or terminal symbols.\n\nNow, looking at the productions of non-terminals ending with numbers. For example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which looks like another non-terminal split. Similarly, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, and so on. Some of these non-terminals, like NT68, NT3, NT97, etc., are terminals with corresponding 't' values. For instance, NT68 \u2192 't0', NT3 \u2192 't0', NT97 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nWait, but I realize that some non-terminals are pointing to the same terminals. For example, NT47 \u2192 't1' and NT68 \u2192 't3', etc. But I should check which NT's are actually terminals because that determines the end of the derivation.\n\nSo the string we have is `t2 t2 t0 t0 t4`. Each symbol in the string is either a terminal or a non-terminal. The non-terminals can further expand, so I need to see if this string can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nSince all elements in the string are terminals, the derivation must have reduced all non-terminals to terminals. The string length is 5, which is odd. In CNF, each production splits a non-terminal into two, so the length of the string at each step increases by one. So starting from S (length 1), after one step, length 2, then 3, 4, etc., but here we have 5, which is possible.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by working backwards. That is, see if the string can be split into two parts, each of which can derive a non-terminal leading back to S.\n\nThe string is t2 t2 t0 t0 t4.\n\nLet me consider possible splits:\n\nOption 1: [t2, t2] [t0, t0, t4] \u2014 but wait, the string is 5 symbols. Wait no, each split would have two parts, each of which is a pair from the grammar. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the non-terminals in the string and see if each can be produced from some NT. Each 't' is a terminal, so each must be the result of an NT production.\n\nLooking at each t symbol:\n\nt2: Where does t2 come from? Looking at the productions, NT97 \u2192 't2', NT68 \u2192 't0' (no), NT98 \u2192 't1' or 't2' or others. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nFrom the given rules, NT97 \u2192 't2', NT77 \u2192 't1' (no), NT7 \u2192 't2' (yes, NT7 splits into NT66 and NT48, and if either of those NTs produce 't2', but NT7 itself is 't2' because NT7 \u2192 't2', wait no\u2014wait, looking at the rules, yes, NT7 \u2192 't2'. That's a direct production.\n\nWait, wait, let's go through each part:\n\nt2 appears three times. Let's see:\n\n- t2 can come from NT7, since NT7 \u2192 't2'.\n- Or from NT97 \u2192 't2'.\n- Also, looking back, NT77 \u2192 't1', which is 't1', not t2.\n\nWait, but looking in the rules, is there any NT that directly produces 't2'? Checking the given rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n- NT47 \u2192 't4'\n- Others: nt35 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nSo, each 't2' in the string could come from either NT1 or NT7.\n\nSimilarly, t0's: Let's see which NTs produce t0.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't0'\n- NT64 \u2192 't4' (no)\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' (yes)\n- NT52?

Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, for NT84, it says NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. So NT84 is not a terminal, it's a non-terminal. But some NT might produce 't2' or 't0'.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIs there an NT64 \u2192 't0'? No, looking at the rules, I think no. Wait, when I look through each line, for example:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT84 \u2192 't2'\n\nAh, yes, so NT84 \u2192 't2' is correct. So in the string, the last element is 't4', so which NT produces 't4'?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't3' (No)\n- NT27 \u2192 't4' (Wait, let me check)\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nLine 27: NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\n\nNo, that's a production, not a terminal. Wait, looking for any NT that ends with \u2192 't4'.\n\nLooking through the given rules again:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 't4' (Yes, because line says NT64 \u2192 't4')\n- NT66 \u2192 't4'\n- NT26 \u2192 't3' (No)\n- NT52 \u2192 't2' (No)\n- NT74 \u2192 't4' (Yes, because line says NT74 \u2192 't4')\n- NT54 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't4'? Wait, NT68 \u2192 't4'? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, the lines:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't4': No, I think I mixed up. Actually, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' (Yes, line says NT68 \u2192 't0')\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n- NT54 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, I think I missed this earlier. Let me check:\n\nLine: NT54 \u2192 't4' \nYes, because the rule is NT54 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo 't4' can come from NT54, NT64, NT66, NT74, NT54. So multiple sources.\n\nSo in the string t2 t2 t0 t0 t4, each 't4' must come from one of these NTs.\n\nBut given that, let's proceed.\n\nSo to figure out the string, perhaps we can try to split the string into three parts, but since the string is of length 5, and each production step adds one symbol, the initial S is of length 1, then 2, 3,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-98","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0`, and the grammar has several production rules. I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) typically has each production rule on the left side generating exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol which can generate a single terminal. But looking at the rules here, a lot of them terminate in terminals directly, like NT66 -> NT52 NT63, but also some have a terminal, like NT47->NT1 NT62, which is still acceptable in CNF because each rule can have two symbols, either both non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal, but I think more accurately, all non-terminals on the right-hand side must be in CNF. Wait, CNF requires that each production is either A->BC or A->a, where B and C are non-terminals. So the given grammar actually has some rules like NT3 -> 't0', which are terminals, so that's allowed. So each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nSo the task is to see if the string `t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0` can be generated by this grammar. The string has six tokens, all of which are t0, t1, t2, etc. So I need to see if the derivation can produce this sequence.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has a start symbol S which branches into S->NT64 NT96, S->NT97 NT7, and S->NT35 NT84. So the initial step will have S generate two non-terminals. But the input string is six tokens long. Since each rule leads to a single token or a pair of symbols, the length of the string will be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. Wait, but for our case, each step can either add a terminal (length 1) or two non-terminals (length 2). So in the first step, S produces two non-terminals, so the next step would be those two generating something, and so on, leading to a total length that could be variable. Alternatively, considering each production is either expanding a non-terminal or just producing a terminal, the total number of tokens in the string can be variable length.\n\nBut wait, the string is six tokens. Let's see if that's possible. Let me think about possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to reverse engineer it or look for possible paths from the start symbol.\n\nThe string is t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0. Since the start symbol S is the top symbol, and each step replaces S with two symbols, but sometimes those can be terminal. Wait, no, in the initial step, S is replaced by two non-terminals, so any generated string would have at least two symbols (like tX tY), but since S is replaced by two non-terminals, in the next step, each of those non-terminals would be resolved, potentially into more symbols, until finally, terminals are left.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is length 6, so let me consider possible ways to parse it.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t2. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t2.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT47->'t1', but some others convert into t2. Looking through, NT97->'t2', right? Let me check the rules:\n\nWait, the rules for NT97->NT43 NT75, NT75->NT98 NT26, NT98->... etc. Hmm, maybe not directly. Wait, no, the terminals are listed, like 't2' appears directly in a rule. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through, actually, in the given rules:\n\nLooking at NT97->'t2', no, wait, looking through lines, I think NT97->NT43 NT75, NT75->NT98 NT26, etc. The actual terminal 't2' is in a rule like:\n\nNT97->'t2'? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S->NT64 NT96\n- S->NT97 NT7\n- S->NT35 NT84\n\nThen some rule like NT47->'t1', but also:\n\nLooking through the other rules, I see:\n\n- NT98->'t1'\n- NT77->'t1'\n- NT4->'t1'\n- NT7->'t0'\n- NT21->'t4'\n- NT74->'t1'\n- etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should make a list of all the non-terminals and their possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mapping the rules:\n\nLet me try to process the string step by step, considering the possible breakdowns.\n\nThe string is t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0.\n\nLet me see if t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 can be produced by the grammar. Let's see what the start symbol, S, produces: S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nSuppose the first step is S->NT64 NT96. Then each of these would need to produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nSo, NT64 would need to produce the first part of the string, and NT96 the rest.\n\nWait, but let's see: If S->NT64 NT96, then we would have NT64's derivation producing a sub-string and NT96's deriving another.\n\nSo, let's think: If the first part is t2, then NT64 must derive a t2 followed by something, but then the next symbols are t4, so perhaps that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, let's try the other possible S options.\n\nS->NT97 NT7. Then NT97 and NT7 would need to derive parts of the string.\n\nIf NT97 produces t2 and NT7 produces t4, then part of the string could fit.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT97: NT97->NT43 NT75. No direct production for t2, except in NT47->'t1', but I'm not seeing a rule that directly produces t2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look specifically for terminals.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see several terminals:\n\n- NT1 -> 't2'\nWait, no, looking back:\n\n- NT97->'t2'\u2014no, I think I'm looking at NT97->NT43 NT75, which doesn't produce a terminal. Let me find rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, let's list all non-terminals and their productions:\n\n1. NT47 -> NT21 NT3\n2. NT1 -> NT5 NT77\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-99","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t3 t3 t0 t4 t4 t3`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like it's in CNF because each production is either to two terminals or two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which is two non-terminals on the right side. The grammar also includes a mix of NT and terminal symbols, which I'm guessing represent non-terminals and terminals respectively.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these symbols, but I'm a bit confused because t3, t0, etc., are terminals, right? So each of them is a terminal symbol, and the non-terminals are the ones with letters NT followed by numbers or other NTs.\n\nMy goal is to see if the grammar can derive the string `t3 t3 t0 t4 t4 t3`. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to find a way to expand the grammar starting from S and see if I can reach this exact terminal sequence.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its individual components. Each element separated by a space represents a step in the derivation. The string is of length 6, which might mean 5 productions or something like that, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should try to find a path from S down to all these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. I'll consider each option to see if they can lead to the target string.\n\nFirst, let's try S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 can be derived from NT84 NT62. So expanding NT64 gives me NT84 NT62. Then NT84 becomes 't2', and NT62 can produce t0 or other things. Hmm, but in the string, the first two are t3, t3, so maybe this path isn't the right one.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT97 NT7. Expanding NT97 leads to NT43 NT75. NT43 is 't0', and NT75 is NT98 NT26. NT98 is 't1', and NT26 is 't3'. This seems promising because the string starts with t3, t3. Wait, no, NT43 is 't0', not t3. So maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules again. NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. Looking back, I see that NT43 \u2192 't0' in the rules. So the first part would give 't0'. But the string starts with t3, so maybe this path is not the correct one either.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT35 NT84. NT35 is 't3' according to the rules. So NT35 produces 't3', which matches the first 't3' in the string. Then NT84 can produce 't2'. So the first two steps could be NT35 \u2192 't3' and NT84 \u2192 't2'. But the string is t3 t3, so I need to see if after that, somehow another t3 appears.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Since each production leads to two symbols, the derivation steps might be more complex. Maybe I should think in terms of parsing the string from left to right, choosing which parts can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm. But since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps the parse table can be constructed to see if the string is in the language.\n\nBut before diving into that, perhaps I can see if there's a way to factor the string into parts that can be derived from the grammar. Let's split the string into pairs of symbols:\n\nt3 t3, t0 t4, t4 t3.\n\nEach pair should correspond to some production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first pair t3 t3. The only way to get t3 is if there's a production that produces t3 from two symbols. Looking through the rules, I don't see a production that directly produces t3. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production rules: NT47 -> t1, NT48 -> t1, NT3 -> t0, NT68 -> t2, NT97 -> t2, NT98 -> t1, etc. I don't see any NT that directly produces t3. So if the string has t3 as a terminal, how can that happen?\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me look back at the rules. I see that for example, NT48 is 't1', but NT47 is 't4'. Wait, no, looking at the production rules, some NTs directly yield a terminal 't' with a subscript. For instance, NT26 is 't3', NT62 is 't0', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the production rules that directly yield a terminal.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\n\nNT36 -> 't4'\n\nNT47 -> 't1'\n\nNT48 -> 't1'\n\nNT54 -> 't1'\n\nNT68 -> 't2'\n\nNT94 -> 't3' [Wait, no, looking back, no. Let me check. Oh, no NT is directly producing t3 except perhaps NT47 which in some rules produce t1. Wait, wait, looking again, I don't see a direct rule where any NT produces 't3'. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the list, I don't see any production with t3 as a terminal, except maybe some I'm missing. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\n\nNT68 -> 't2'\n\nNT47 -> 't4'\n\nNT12 -> 't3' [Wait, no, NT12 is 't3'? No, according to the list:\n\nWait, let me check each production rule that ends with a terminal:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n\n- NT68 -> 't2'\n\n- NT47 -> 't1'\n\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n\n- NT54 -> 't1'\n\n- NT66 -> 't4'\n\n- NT77 -> 't3' [No, NT77 is 't1'\n\nWait, no, looking at the list again:\n\n- NT98 -> 't1'\n\n- NT39 -> 't0'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list out all the NT's that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through each rule that ends with a terminal symbol:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n\n- NT33 -> 't1' (Wait, no, NT33 is 't1' only when it produces NT84 NT81, which in the rules are both non-terminals. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the list, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the rules show that NT33 has a production that may lead to terminals, but in the given rules, I don't see NT33 directly producing a terminal. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps the list is too long, and it's getting confusing. Let me search for any NT production that has a terminal on the right.\n\nLooking again at the provided grammar rules:\n\nFind all NT \u2192 something where something is a terminal.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT74 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT80 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT74 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT81 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, but I'm looking at each production rule that produces a terminal. So for example, NT26 produces 't3', NT33 is 't1', etc. So the terminals are the ones where an NT directly produces a single 't' symbol.\n\nSo in the string, I have t3 t3 t0 t4 t4 t3.\n\nEach of these is a terminal, so each must be produced by some NT that directly yields a single 't' symbol.\n\nLet me note each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t3\n\n2. t3\n\n3. t0\n\n4. t4\n\n5. t4\n\n6. t3\n\nSo each of these must come from some production NT \u2192 't...'.\n\nLooking through the rules again, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT26: 't3'\n\n- NT33: 't1'\n\n- NT36: '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the rules. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The initial production rules are:\n\n- S -> NT64 NT96\n- S -> NT97 NT7\n- S -> NT35 NT84\n\nThe string I'm given is `t0 t4 t4 t4 t2 t1 t1`. Since the start symbol S produces pairs of non-terminals, I need to see if this string can be derived step by step through these production rules, eventually ending up with terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t0`, then `t4`, then another `t4`, and so on. I know some of the non-terminals map directly to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT64 -> t4\n- NT1 -> t2\n- NT21 -> t4\n- NT68 -> t2 (from NT68 -> t2 sometimes)\n- NT3 -> t0\n- And so on.\n\nWait, I should check each step. Let's try to see if we can break down the string using the production rules.\n\nThe string is seven t's, which is an odd number. Since each production of S results in two non-terminals, the derivation tree will have a depth that leads to an odd number of terminal symbols if the grammar allows for an odd length word. But I'm not sure if the grammar inherently requires the word length to be even or odd. Let me check the string length. The string is seven symbols, which is odd, so depending on the grammar's rules, it might be possible.\n\nNow, looking at the initial productions of S, each produces two non-terminals. So S can generate S->NT64 NT96, which would eventually generate t4 and t4, as NT64 -> t4 and NT96 -> t4 (since NT96 -> t4? Wait, no, looking back, NT96 is in the production, but let me check:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n- NT96 -> NT54 NT53\n- NT54 -> t3\n- NT53 -> t3 or other\n\nBut wait, in the given rules, some of the non-terminals directly map to 't' symbols.\n\nFor example, NT66 -> t4\nNT77 -> t3\nNT47 -> t4\nAnd others like NT21 -> t4\nNT75 -> t84? Wait, let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the rules, some of the non-terminals directly produce t's. For example:\n\n- NT64 -> t4\n- NT66 -> t4\n- NT68 -> t2\n- NT97 -> t2\n- NT98 -> t1\n- NT1 -> t2\n- NT3 -> t0\n- NT7 -> t0\n- NT47 -> t4? Wait, not sure. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking at the rules more carefully, for each NT:\n- NT47 -> NT21 NT3 (so two non-terminals)\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12 (which itself breaks down into t's)\n- NT96 -> NT54 NT53\n- NT35 -> NT84 NT84\n- And so on.\n\nBut the important thing is that the entire string is t's, so the final derivation must result in terminal symbols. So let me try to see if the initial S can start with t0.\n\nLooking at the first symbol of the string is t0. So which non-terminals produce t0:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that:\n\n- NT3 -> t0\n- NT68 -> t0 (because NT68 is mapped in some cases to t0, like NT68->t0)\n- NT64: NT64 can go to t4, not t0\n- NT1: maps to t2\n\nHmm, so which part of the initial expansion of S can lead to t0?\n\nWait, the initial S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Let me see the first expansion\u2014let's say S->NT64 NT96.\n\nNow, NT64-> t4, as per NT64->t4. And NT96 is a non-terminal that could expand. So NT96->t4, but wait, looking at the rules, NT96 is broken down into NT54 NT53. Then NT54 can produce t3 (since NT54->t3), and NT53 can produce t3 or other things.

{"custom_id":"request-120","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of production rules, and the string to evaluate is \"t4 t3 t4 t0 t2 t4 t1\". \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly. So, looking at the grammar, every rule on the left starts with a non-terminal, and on the right, either a terminal or exactly two non-terminals. \n\nThe string has seven tokens: t4, t3, t4, t0, t2, t4, t1. Each of these corresponds to a single terminal symbol in the grammar. My task is to see if this string can be derived through a series of productions starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has the following productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, starting from S, the first step is to choose one of these three options. Each of these will be a pair of non-terminals that need to be expanded further until we reach the terminals in the string.\n\nNext, I need to see how each of these can expand to produce the string. Let me look at each possible first production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n   - NT64's production is NT84 NT62. So, NT64 expands into NT84 and NT62. Then, each of these needs to expand further.\n   - NT84 has a production: NT4 NT1. \n   - NT4 is a terminal in the string? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT4 \u2192 't1', so 't1' is a terminal. Similarly, NT62's production is NT52 NT63. NT52 is 't2', and NT63 is 't4'.\n   - Wait, but the string has t4 t3 t4 t0 t2 t4 t1. Let me see the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, let me take a step back. Maybe it's better to construct the parse tree for the given string and see if it matches any possible derivation.\n\nLet me attempt to break down the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t4 t3 t4 t0 t2 t4 t1.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree with height equal to the number of steps needed to derive the string. Given that the string has 7 tokens, the height would be 6 (since for n symbols, the derivation length is between n and 2n-1). But the exact parse tree would have to match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to see if the string can be split into pairs of terminals through the productions. Since the string is seven symbols, which is odd, the first expansion must be from S producing NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84, and so on. But each of these splits needs to result in a left and right part that can generate the needed sequence.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to check each possible production and see if any sequence of expansions can produce the given string.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, let's see which non-terminals can produce a t4 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce t4 directly:\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 \u2192 't4' via NT4\u2192't1'? Wait, no. Wait, NT84's production is NT4 NT1, which are both non-terminals (since 't4' is a terminal, but in the grammar NT84 is defined as NT4 \u2192 't1' is actually a terminal symbol, but in the grammar as written, it's not clear if NT84 directly produces 't4'. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has rules like NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT64 expands into two non-terminals. Similarly, NT84 has a production NT4 NT1, which are both non-terminals? Wait no, because 't4' is a terminal. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which are both non-terminals. So NT64 is a non-terminal that can only produce NT84 and NT62, which are both non-terminals.\n\nBut the terminals are those that are directly expanded. For example, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, and both 52 and 63 are non-terminals, but wait, in the grammar, NT52 \u2192 't2', NT63 \u2192 't4' (from the rules, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier).\n\nWait, let me list the productions for each non-terminal to clarify.\n\nHere's the grammar again, grouping each non-terminal's production rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\nNT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81\nNT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27\nNT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\nNT38 \u2192 NT63 NT96\nNT14 \u2192 NT33 NT27\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\nNT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39\nNT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70\nNT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\nNT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26\nNT53 \u2192 NT39 NT80\nNT70 \u2192 NT84 NT36\nNT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\nNT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT63 \u2192 't1'\nNT47 \u2192 't1'\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\nNT86 \u2192 't0'\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nNT98 \u2192 't0'\nNT77 \u2192 't2'\nNT35 \u2192 't3'\nNT78 \u2192 't0'\nNT36 \u2192 't2'\nNT54 \u2192 't4'\nNT84 \u2192 't2'\nNT12 \u2192 't3'\nNT39 \u2192 't0'\nNT64 \u2192 't4'\nNT1 \u2192 't2'\nNT48 \u2192 't1'\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\nNT54 \u2192 't3'\nNT66 \u2192 't4'\nNT7 \u2192 't2'\nNT68 \u2192 't2'\nNT26 \u2192 't3'\nNT52 \u2192 't2'\nNT74 \u2192 't4'\nNT33 \u2192 't0'\nNT80 \u2192 't3'\nNT22 \u2192 't4'\nNT82 \u2192 't4'\nNT54 \u2192 't3'\nNT81 \u2192 't1'\nNT36 \u2192 't4'\nNT77 \u2192 't3'\nNT96 \u2192 't4'\nNT47 \u2192 't4'\nNT1 \u2192 't0'\nNT77 \u2192 't1'\nNT4 \u2192 't1'\nNT7 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, now I'm a bit confused about what's a terminal and what's a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-131","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like and how it can generate sentences. The grammar has non-terminals and terminals, each production rule being in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the top-level production starts with S, and S has three options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these non-terminals on the right side leads to further productions. The non-terminals eventually resolve into terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So, the string I'm given is 't0 t3 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4', which is a sequence of terminals. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from any of the start symbols (S) using the productions.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use a parsing technique, maybe similar to how a recursive descent parser works. I'll start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the given string step by step.\n\nLet me first figure out the structure of the start symbol. The string is a concatenation of 8 tokens. Each token is one of 't0', 't1', up to 't98' or something, but in this case, the string is 't0 t3 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4'.\n\nI think the key is to track the possible non-terminals that can produce the given sequence at each step. Each non-terminal can produce a pair of terminals or another non-terminal. So, starting with S, which can produce three alternatives. Let me look at each alternative:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nI need to see if any of these can derive the string. Since the string is 8 tokens, each production step typically doubles the length because each non-terminal can produce two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc.). Wait, no, actually, depending on the structure. But in this case, since all rules are two non-terminals except for the terminals where a non-terminal maps directly to a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the initial productions for S are S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which each of these non-terminals will eventually resolve into terminals. But perhaps the string can be built by choosing the appropriate production at each step.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: think about the fact that each production step breaks down into two parts. Since the string is a sequence, each non-terminal expansion should match a substring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model this as a tree, starting from S and expanding terminals and non-terminals to see if I can form the string. Since it's a bit complex, perhaps using a memoization table or constructing possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a table, tracking which non-terminals can generate which sequences of terminals. Since the string is 8 tokens, it's manageable.\n\nLet me consider each step:\n\nThe string is t0 t3 t2 t3 t3 t3 t4 t4.\n\nI can represent this as a list: [t0, t3, t2, t3, t3, t3, t4, t4]\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production produces exactly two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). So, the string has 8 tokens, meaning that during parsing, the number of non-terminals in the derivation must be exactly 7, because each step adds one to the length (since each non-terminal can produce two symbols, but in a chain, it adds one each time). Wait, or is it more like each non-terminal in the chain adds a split, so starting with one symbol, each production adds one. Actually, more accurately, the number of symbols in the string is the number of leaves on the parse tree, which should be equal to the number of steps plus one. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the possible productions at each step. Let's think about the first token: t0. So, the first step is to have a production that starts with the first symbol, which is t0. So, looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can generate t0?\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that some non-terminals are directly producing terminals. Let's check each non-terminal's productions:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 t4\n- NT66 \u2192 t4\n- NT68 \u2192 t4\n- NT12 \u2192 t3\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT21 \u2192 t4\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT43 \u2192 t0\n- NT14 \u2192 t3\n- NT96 \u2192 t3\n- NT39 \u2192 t0\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT97 \u2192 t4\n- NT84 \u2192 t2\n- NT1 \u2192 t2\n- NT48 \u2192 t1\n- NT33 \u2192 t1\n- NT54 \u2192 t1\n- NT66 \u2192 t4\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT68 \u2192 t2\n- NT26 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT74 \u2192 t4\n- NT33 \u2192 t0\n- NT80 \u2192 t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t4\n- NT82 \u2192 t4\n- NT54 \u2192 t3\n- NT81 \u2192 t1\n- NT36 \u2192 t4\n- NT77 \u2192 t3\n- NT96 \u2192 t4\n- NT47 \u2192 t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t0\n- NT77 \u2192 t1\n  Wait, that's conflicting. Let me make sure. Earlier, for NT96, it's given as NT97 NT39 \u2192 which resolves to t4 and 't something else? Wait, in the given grammar rules, it says:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides are given as:\n\nFor example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which eventually can produce terminals. But in the list of non-terminals, I see that some NTs map directly to terminals, like NT96 \u2192 't4', NT68 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nWait, actually, I might get confused because the grammar is large, but I need to focus on which non-terminals can produce each terminal in the string. The string starts with t0, t3, t2, etc.\n\nSo, the starting point is S, which can go to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nEach of these are two non-terminals. So, for example, choosing the first production, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, would give us a string that is the concatenation of the strings generated by NT64 and NT96.\n\nSimilarly for the other options.\n\nSo, the idea is to see if the entire string can be broken down into sequences matching these productions.\n\nGiven that the string is [t0, t3, t2, t3, t3, t3, t4, t4], perhaps I can see if this can be derived by S \u2192 NT64 NT96, since NT64 is 't4' and NT96 is 't3'. But that would give [t4, t3], which is too short. So, perhaps another production path.\n\nWait, no, actually, each production starts with a non-terminal that may in turn produce two non-terminals, which themselves can produce terminals or other non-terminals. So, maybe the string can be built recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for a path where the entire string is built by expanding the initial S step by step.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model this as a tree, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to check each non-terminal and see what they can produce.\n\nWait, but this could be time-consuming, considering the number of non-terminals. Maybe a better approach is to look for the starting symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate the process by considering each possible way to split the string into two parts, each part derived by one non-terminal from the initial S.\n\nBut since the string is 8 symbols long, it's manageable. Let's think about the first step: S can produce either NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nSo, let's take the first production: NT64 NT96.\n\nLooking at NT64, which according to the given rules, NT64 \u2192 't4'. So NT64 produces t4, which matches the first token of the string (t0). Wait, that's incorrect because the first token is t0, but NT64 produces t4. So, this doesn't match.

{"custom_id":"request-134","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string \"t2 t3 t3 t0 t3 t2 t0 t0\" can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Okay, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for parsing algorithms, but I'm not sure if it's directly helpful here, though it might help in understanding the structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the non-terminals produce other non-terminals, but some directly produce t0, t1, t2, or t3. For example, NT3 -> 't0', NT7 -> 't2', NT84 -> 't2', etc. So, each terminal in the string is determined by which production leads to it.\n\nThe string to check is \"t2 t3 t3 t0 t3 t2 t0 t0\". So, each token here must correspond to a terminal production. Let's list the positions and see if each can be matched.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't2'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't2'? Let me check all the 't2' rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT75 -> NT98 NT26, and NT98 -> 't1' or 't0'... Wait, looking through, I think NT77 is 't2'?\n\nWait, checking the non-terminals, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2' (rule exists)\n- Another rule: NT77 -> 't3'? Wait, no, let me go through each non-terminal and their productions.\n\nWait, let me list all the 't' productions:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n- NT68 -> 't2'\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> 't3'\n- NT75 -> 't2' via NT75 -> NT98 NT26, where NT98 can be 't1' or 't0', but that's a combination. Wait, no, NT75 is producing NT98 and NT26, and NT98 and NT26 are non-terminals, so it's not a terminal. So the terminal 't2' must be from a direct production, not via a chain.\n\nSo, looking through the rules, NT68 -> 't2' and NT7 -> 't2' are the direct 't2' productions. So the first token could come from NT68 or NT7.\n\nBut the string starts with 't2', so the first production must be either NT68 or NT7.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: 't2'. Let's consider the first production: S -> NT64 NT96. Then, NT64 and NT96 must produce sequences that together match the rest of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string from the top-down using the grammar, starting with S.\n\nS produces either NT64 and NT96:\n\nSo, the string starts with NT64 producing something, followed by NT96 producing something else. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT64's production:\n\nFrom the rules, NT64 -> NT84 NT62. So NT64 produces two non-terminals: NT84 and NT62.\n\nThen, those need to produce sequences that translate to the first part of the string.\n\nSo, let's parse the first part of the string with NT64:\n\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nLet's see what NT84 produces. Looking for NT84 rules:\n\nNT84 has several options, but the direct terminal is 't2' (from NT84 -> 't2'). So NT84 can go directly to 't2'.\n\nThen, NT62's production: NT62 -> 't0' directly. So that would produce 't0'.\n\nSo, NT64 would produce 't2' followed by 't0', which is 't2 t0'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't2 t3 t3 t0...', so that doesn't fit. So perhaps NT64 is not the right way. Alternatively, maybe S produces another option.\n\nWait, the first production of S is S -> NT64 NT96, but perhaps I can also check other productions of S, like S -> NT97 NT7. Let's see if that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can be broken down as S -> NT64 NT96, which breaks into NT64 and NT96. NT64 is 't2 t0' and NT96 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT96 produces.\n\nLooking at NT96: its production is NT54 NT53, and NT54 and NT53 both have multiple options.\n\nNT54: produces 't3' (from NT54 -> 't3') or via other routes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe it's better to try to see if each position in the string corresponds to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trying to see the entire string and see if it can be broken down into parts.\n\nLet me list the string again: t2, t3, t3, t0, t3, t2, t0, t0.\n\nEach position must be matched by a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo, perhaps we can start from the beginning.\n\nPosition 1: t2. Possible NTs: NT68 -> t2, NT7 -> t2.\n\nLet's try NT77? Wait, no. Wait, the direct 't2's are NT68 and NT7.\n\nWait, NT77 is 't2'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT77->'t3'? No, wait:\n\nWait, no, I need to go through each production to make sure.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLet me list all the 't' rules:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0' (multiple rules)\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- NT68 -> 't2' (two rules: NT68 -> 't2' and others)\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> 't3'\n- NT75 -> 't2' (via NT98 and NT26, but that's combining, so not a terminal)\n- NT53 -> 't2' via NT53->NT86 NT33, and NT86->'t0', NT33->'t1', but that's combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each of the non-terminal's production for a direct terminal.\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0' directly (multiple rules)\n- NT68 -> 't2' directly (some rules)\n- NT7 -> 't2' directly (some rules)\n- NT26->'t3' directly?\nWait, looking through, I don't see any rule where NT26 produces a terminal. NT26 seems to produce non-terminals. Similarly, NT75 produces NT98 and NT26, which are non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps only NT68 and NT7 produce 't2' directly. Others produce via other rules. So for the first token 't2', possible origins are NT68 or NT7.\n\nLet me attempt the first possibility: the first T2 comes from NT7.\n\nSo the first symbol is NT7 -> 't2'. Then, after NT7, the next non-terminal is NT96, as per S's production S->NT64 NT96.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S can produce multiple options. Let me clarify:\n\nThe grammar's S has three options:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo, for the first token 't2', it could have come from NT7 or NT68. Let's try S -> NT97 NT7. So, NT97 and NT7.\n\nIf the first token is NT7 -> 't2', then perhaps the second part comes from NT97. Let's see.\n\nNT97->'t2', because NT97 production is NT43 NT75. Then, NT43 and NT75 are non-terminals. Let's see their productions.\n\nNT43: what does it produce? Looking through the rules, I don't see NT43 producing a terminal directly. It seems to produce other non-terminals, so that might not be the right path.\n\nLet me try another approach: parsing the string.\n\nLet me see if I can split the string into tokens based on the rules.\n\nThe string is: t2, t3, t3, t0, t3, t2, t0, t0.\n\nLooking for the first occurrence of 't2' or 't3' or 't0' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps starting with S, which can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-155","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t2 t4 t1 t0 t0 t4 t3 t2 t3` is generated by the given grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and how each non-terminal expands.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is a non-terminal (A) splitting into two other non-terminals (B and C). The terminals are 't0', 't1', etc., and some non-terminals directly produce these terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol S, which has three production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo, any string under S must be built from two non-terminals from each of these rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it's nine tokens: t2 t4 t1 t0 t0 t4 t3 t2 t3. Since each production appends two symbols, the overall length is consistent because each step of the derivation adds two symbols, and nine is an odd number of tokens? Wait, no\u2014the string has nine tokens, which is odd. Wait, no, wait: the starting symbol S produces two non-terminals each time. So, the initial expansion is two symbols. Each production adds two, so the total number of symbols should be 2 * (n+1), where n is the depth of derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how many steps it takes. Alternatively, maybe I should write the rightmost derivation for the string.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to try to build the parse tree step by step, starting from S.\n\nFirst, pick one of the S's production. Let me pick the first one: S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nSo, I need NT64 and NT96 to produce t2 t4. Let's see what each of these can do.\n\nLooking at NT64's production rules: I see NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Wait, but I'm looking in the provided rules. Let me check:\n\nFrom the rules provided:\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT98 -> 't0'\n...\nLooking for NT64: From the provided rules:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT62 -> 't0'\n\nSo, NT64 expands into NT84 and NT62. NT84 is NT4 and NT1. NT4 is 't1'? Wait, in the rules, I see NT4 -> 't1'. So NT84 is 't1' and NT62 is 't0'. So NT64 -> 't1' 't0' = t1 t0.\n\nBut the string starts with t2, so maybe the first production isn't the right one. Alternatively, perhaps I should try another S production.\n\nLooking at S's other options:\n\nSecond S: S -> NT97 NT7.\n\nLooking at NT97: from the rules, for example, NT97 -> 't2' in one rule and 't0' in another?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the rules, NT97 appears in two places:\n\n- NT97 -> NT43 NT75\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n\nNo, wait, wait. Let me check the provided rules:\n\nLooking for NT97:\n\nIn the list, I see:\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75\nand\nNT97 -> 't2'\n\nSo NT97 can produce either 't2' directly or expand into NT43 and NT75.\n\nSimilarly, for NT7: from the rules, NT7 -> 't0'.\n\nSo, if I take S -> NT97 NT7, then NT97 could produce 't2' and NT7 produces 't0'. So combining, that would give 't2' 't0', which is the start of the string 't2 t4 t1 t0...'.\n\nWait, the string is t2 t4 t1 t0 t0 t4 t3 t2 t3.\n\nSo starting with S -> NT97 NT7, which would be 't2' and 't0', matching the first two tokens.\n\nNext, the next token is t4. So, I need to figure out the expansion for the two non-terminals that follow. But wait, in a typical left- or rightmost derivation, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to model this as a tree, where each production is a node, and the leaves are the terminal symbols.\n\nSo the entire string is t2 t4 t1 t0 t0 t4 t3 t2 t3. That's 9 tokens, so three levels of expansion because each level adds two nodes (non-terminals) per each step.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to simulate the derivation steps.\n\nAlternatively, since the starting symbol S produces two non-terminals, each of which may produce more non-terminals, so each step branches out.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try another approach: check if the string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nAlternatively, try to see which expansions could lead to the required tokens.\n\nFor example, starting with NT97 and NT7.\n\nNT97 can produce 't2' directly, and NT7 produces 't0'. So the initial part is t2 t0.\n\nBut the string is t2 t4 t1 t0..., so after 't2 t0', the next tokens should come from the expansion of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, because each application of a production replaces a non-terminal with two others, not appending. So perhaps the string is built through a series of productions where each non-terminal is replaced step by step.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think of each production as contributing two symbols to the string. So each time you expand a non-terminal, it replaces one symbol with two, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time.\n\nWait, no: in each production A -> BC, when you replace A with BC, the number of symbols increases by one. So if you start with one symbol, each production step increases the count by one. So for a string of length n, starting from S, you need n-1 productions.\n\nBut our string length is 9, so starting from S, we'd need 8 productions, which would result in a string of 9 symbols. So each step adds one symbol, which would be the case for a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to build the parse tree bottom-up or use some kind of parsing strategy, like looking for the rightmost non-terminals to expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the string and see if I can split it into segments that match the possible production rules.\n\nWait, the string is t2 t4 t1 t0 t0 t4 t3 t2 t3.\n\nLooking for the first two symbols: t2 t4. Wait, no\u2014it's t2, then t4. Maybe the first S's production is S -> NT64 NT96, but earlier I thought NT64 would give t1 t0, which doesn't match t2 t4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S -> NT97 NT7, giving 't2' and 't0' as the first two symbols, but the second symbol in the string is t4, not t0. So maybe that's not the starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try the third S production: S -> NT35 NT84.\n\nLooking at NT35: from the rules, NT35 -> 't3' in one case and 't3' as well, I think. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking for NT35, the provided rules have:\n\n- NT33 -> NT84 NT81\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n\nSo NT35 can produce 't3' directly. So if I take S -> NT35 NT84, then the first symbol would be 't3', but the string starts with t2, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Instead of looking at the first symbols, perhaps I should look for the possible ways to split the string into subparts that match production steps.\n\nLet me look for possible splits:\n\nt2 t4 t1 t0 t0 t4 t3 t2 t3.\n\nLooking at possible endpoints, the last symbol is t3, which appears several times. So perhaps the last step is some production that ends with t3.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals that can produce 't3', let's see.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT12 -> NT82 NT48\n- NT34 -> NT96 NT81\n- NT53 -> NT86 NT33\n- NT7 -> NT66 NT48\n- NT84 -> NT4 NT1\n\nWait, perhaps starting from the end, looking for the last split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, building the string backward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better idea is to track back. Let's consider the string as a sequence and see if each step can be formed by some production.\n\nThe string is: t2, t4, t1, t0,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

My goal is to see if there's a sequence of derivations starting from S that can produce this string.\n\nLet me start by seeing which non-terminals can produce t1, t2, etc. For example, NT64 -> t4, so if I have NT64, it can directly produce t4. Similarly, NT35 -> t3, NT78 -> t0, but wait, the string has a t4 and a t3 at the beginning. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has three productions: S -> NT64 NT96, S -> NT97 NT7, S -> NT35 NT84. So the first step is to choose one of these.\n\nLet's try the first one: S -> NT64 NT96. NT64 -> t4, NT96 -> t4. So the first two steps would be:\n\nS -> t4 | (something else)\n\nWait, no, the production is S -> NT64 NT96, so when we substitute, it becomes t4 t4 right away? But the string starts with t4 t1, not t4 t4. So maybe the first option isn't the right path.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The string is `t4 t1 t4 t2 t1 t3 t3 t2 t3`. So the first symbol is t4. So if we choose S -> NT64 NT96, then NT64 gives t4, and NT96 gives t4 as well if it directly expands. But in the string, the first two symbols are t4 t1, not t4 t4, which suggests that maybe this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol t4 comes from a non-terminal that isn't directly giving t4. Wait, let me check the productions again. So looking at NT96: in the grammar, NT96 -> NT54 NT53. Hmm, okay, so to get t4, the NT64 directly gives t4, but the second part, NT96, needs to be expanded further.\n\nLet me try to see how NT96 can produce t1. So NT96 -> NT54 NT53. From the given rules, NT54 produces t2 (since NT54 -> t2), and NT53 -> 't0' or 't3'. Wait, in the rules I see NT53 -> 't3', NT54 -> 't2'. So if NT53 is t3 and NT54 is t2, then NT54 NT53 would produce t2 t3. But the second symbol in the string is t1, not t2. That seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the parts:\n\nThe string is: t4, t1, t4, t2, t1, t3, t3, t2, t3.\n\nSo let's see if the starting S can produce this string. Let's take the first production S -> NT64 NT96. So NT64 -> t4, so that's good for the first symbol. Now NT96 needs to produce the rest. Let's see: NT96 -> NT54 NT53. NT54 -> t2, and NT53 can be 't3' or maybe another non-terminal.\n\nIf NT53 -> 't3', then NT54 NT53 would produce t2 t3. But the next symbol is t1, so that doesn't match. But wait, looking again, the production rules for NT53: there's a rule NT53 -> NT86 NT39, which then... Hmm, does that help? Or maybe NT53 itself can be another non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT53 is defined as NT53 -> NT86 NT39. NT86 is t0, according to the rules (NT86 -> t0). And NT39 -> 't0' or something else. Looking back: NT39 -> NT70 NT39. Wait, that's a recursive production, which could cause looping. Hmm, that's a problem because if that's the case, NT39 can derive an infinite number of tokens, which might not help us get a specific symbol.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t4 (from NT64), the next is t1. So NT96 must expand to a sequence that starts with t1. Let me think about NT96's productions. NT96 -> NT54 NT53, so that gives us NT54 and NT53. Let's see NT54: NT54 -> t2 or NT53: from above, NT53 can be NT86, which is t0, so that's t2 t0, which is not matching t1 t4.\n\nHmm, maybe starting with S -> NT64 NT96 isn't the right way because the second symbol is t1, which probably comes from another non-terminal.\n\nLet's try the second production: S -> NT97 NT7. NT97 -> NT43 NT75. NT43 is t0, NT75 is t2 or something else. So first symbol would be NT97, which expands to t0. But the string starts with t4, so that can't be right.\n\nSo the first symbol t4 must come from S -> NT64 NT96, as S -> NT97 gives t0. So we have NT64 gives t4, and NT96 is to give the remaining symbols.\n\nSo after t4 comes t1. Let's see, NT96 -> NT54 NT53. From above, NT54 is t2, and NT53 -> 't3' leads to t2 t3, which is t2 followed by t3. But the string has t1 next. So perhaps that path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT96 can be expanded further. Let's see, NT54 -> t2, and NT53 needs to produce t1. Hmm, NT53 is defined as NT53 -> NT86 NT39. NT86 is t0, and NT39 is 't0' or more. So NT53 can be t0 t0 or something else, but I don't see it ever producing a t1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Looking back at NT53's rules: NT53 -> NT86 NT39, but also, is there any other way for NT53 to produce something else? Let's recheck the grammar. Wait, no, only NT53 -> NT86 NT39 is there. So maybe there's a way forNT86 to produce something else. NT86 -> t0, so that's fixed. So that can't help us get t1.\n\nHmm, maybe the second symbol t1 comes from another part of the string. Wait, perhaps the initial choice of production is wrong. Let me try S -> NT35 NT84. NT35 -> t3, which would give the first symbol as t3, but the string starts with t4. So that can't be.\n\nWait, another production: S -> NT12 NT48. NT12 -> t3, so that starts with t3, which doesn't match. S -> NT5 NT77: NT5 is t2, so t2. But string starts with t4. S -> NT98 NT26: NT98 -> t1, t26. Hmm, maybe that's a way. Let me check NT98.\n\nLooking at NT98: NT98 -> t1, t2. So first symbol is t1, but the string starts with t4. No, that's not working.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the string is longer: t4, t1, t4, t2, t1, t3, t3, t2, t3. So 9 symbols. Let me count how many steps S can take. Each production of S adds two symbols, but with possible nested productions, more steps can produce more symbols.\n\nWait, maybe the initial production is S -> NT64 NT96. NT64 gives t4 (1 symbol), then NT96 needs to give 8 more symbols. Let's try expanding NT96.\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53. NT54 is t2, and NT53 is ... Wait, NT53 -> NT86 NT39. So now, I have t2 t0, but that's not matching the second symbol t1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-176","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t2 t2 t1 t3 t4 t4 t3 t0 t0 t3`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CNF grammar is structured such that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly. In this grammar, I see that there are some NT (non-terminal) symbols that produce a terminal. For example, NT68 can produce 't0', 't1', or 't3'. Similarly, NT97 and NT98 can produce 't1' and 't2' or 't0' etc.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is a sequence of terminals. Each token in the string must have been generated by some non-terminal's production. To approach this, I think I need to use a parsing method, such as recursive descent or using a CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is already in CNF, recursive descent might be feasible.\n\nBut before diving into parsing, maybe I should try to see if the string can be built step by step starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals: NT64 and NT96, so S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then, each of these non-terminals will produce more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, the string has 10 tokens. Let me see how long the derivation would be. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. The number of symbols increases by one each time. So starting from S, which is one symbol, each production increases the count by one until it reaches 10. So the number of productions needed would be 10 -1 =9 steps? But wait, each production step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, so after k steps, the number of symbols is 1 +k. So starting from S (1 symbol), after 9 steps, it's 10 symbols, which matches the string length.\n\nNow, let's look at the string structure: it's `t2 t2 t1 t3 t4 t4 t3 t0 t0 t3`. The first two symbols start with t2, t2. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT97 \u2192 t2, so if the first NT is NT97, and the second is something that also starts with t2. But wait, NT97 produces t2, t1, or t0. Let me check: NT97 can produce t2 (from the grammar rules), as seen here: NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, and then NT43 \u2192 t0, NT75 \u2192 NT98, etc. Wait, actually, NT97 itself can produce 't2' directly?\n\nWait, looking back: in the grammar, NT97 is part of a production. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, there's NT97 \u2192 NT79? No, wait. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNo, looking through the rules, I don't see an NT97 \u2192 't2' directly. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let's see the rules again.\n\nLooking for NT97 productions: yes, in the rules, NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, NT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14, etc. So NT97 doesn't produce t2 directly. But maybe in some combination.\n\nWait, in the string, the first two symbols are t2 t2. So perhaps both NT64 and NT96 need to produce t2 and something that can derive those t2s.\n\nWait, NT64: according to the rules, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and looking at NT64, I don't think it can produce t2 directly. Let me check NT84: NT84 can produce NT4 and NT1. Wait, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. Then NT4 \u2192 't1' (from the rules). So NT84 \u2192 t1 t1. Similarly, NT62 \u2192 't0' as per the rules NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12 and others, but looking at the NT62, do I see any rules? Wait, in the rules, I don't see NT62 directly, but looking through, under NT62, perhaps through other productions.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the provided grammar, I don't see NT62 as a terminal. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the given rules.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the terminal productions are listed as:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\nNT77 \u2192 't1'\nNT35 \u2192 't3'\nNT78 \u2192 't0'\nNT36 \u2192 't2'\nNT54 \u2192 't4'\nNT84 \u2192 't2'\nNT12 \u2192 't3'\nNT39 \u2192 't0'\nNT64 \u2192 't4'\nNT1 \u2192 't2'\nNT48 \u2192 't1'\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\nNT54 \u2192 't3'\nNT7 \u2192 't2'\nNT68 \u2192 't2'\nNT26 \u2192 't3'\nNT52 \u2192 't2'\nNT74 \u2192 't4'\nNT33 \u2192 't0'\nNT80 \u2192 't3'\nNT22 \u2192 't4'\nNT82 \u2192 't4'\nNT54 \u2192 't4' (duplicate line, I think they meant NT81?

Therefore, the first step must be either S \u2192 NT33 NT96 or S \u2192 NT98 NT26, but wait, looking at the rules, S has several options:\n\nThe start symbol S can go to:\n- NT64 NT96\n- NT97 NT7\n- NT35 NT84\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t1, which comes from NT33 or NT98. But in the initial productions, S can't directly go to those. So I must first split S into production rules that can lead into those nt's. Looking at the grammar, none of S's options directly produce t1. That's a problem because if S can't directly go to a path that starts with t1, then the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, that would mean S can't generate a string starting with t1 because the initial productions don't start with t1. But the string starts with t1, so that would immediately make it impossible. So is that the case?\n\nWait, let's recheck. S can generate NT64 NT96, which would be two non-terminals, each of which might produce their own terminals. But none of these directly produce t1 as the first symbol. So if the first token is t1, then in order to get t1, we must have a production that allows a direct or indirect path to t1 from S.\n\nWait, another approach: let's see which S productions can lead to t1. Since S is the start, let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT98 NT26, then NT98 can produce t1. So if I can derive S to NT98 and NT26, and then NT26 can produce the other parts, perhaps it's possible. Let me check the production S \u2192 NT98 NT26.\n\nLooking at the rules: S can go to NT98 NT26, yes. Now, NT98 can produce t1, which is the first symbol. Then NT26 can produce the remaining part of the string: t3 t4 t3 t2 t3 t0 t0 t3 t1.\n\nBut wait, the first part is t1, which comes from NT98. So then the rest of the string after t1 must come from NT26. So let's see what NT26 can produce.\n\nNT26 has only one production: NT26 \u2192 't3'. So the second symbol in the string after t1 is t3, which matches. Then after t3, the next symbol is t4. So the structure so far is t1 (from NT98) \u2192 t3 (from NT26). Now, the remaining string to produce is t4 t3 t2 t3 t0 t0 t3 t1.\n\nWait, but after the initial t1 and t3, there are several symbols left. However, since NT26 only produces 't3', it can't produce more symbols on its own. That suggests that the initial approach might be flawed because after handling the first part, the NT26 can't generate more than one terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Maybe the non-terminals can split into other non-terminals that can generate the required symbols. Let's try to see if there's a longer derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the S can be split into other parts. Wait, let's try going through each step.\n\nThe string is t1 t3 t4 t3 t2 t3 t0 t0 t3 t1.\n\nSo the first two symbols are t1 and t3.\n\nWe need to see how these can be generated.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT98 NT26.\n\n- NT98 can produce t1, and NT26 can produce t3. So that would give t1 t3 as the first two symbols. Good.\n\nNow, the remaining symbols are t4 t3 t2 t3 t0 t0 t3 t1.\n\nBut after that, we need to see how NT26 can produce more. Wait, no, NT26 only produces t3 as a terminal. So perhaps there's an error here because after t1 and t3, we have more symbols to derive.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the approach. Maybe the NTs can be split further into more productions. For example, after generating t1 from NT98, the other NT (from S's split) might generate the rest. Let me think.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT98 NT26. NT98 \u2192 t1 (the first symbol), then NT26 \u2192 t3 (the second symbol). Then, perhaps after that, the entire structure needs to be generated. But wait, the original string is just ten symbols: t1 t3 t4 t3 t2 t3 t0 t0 t3 t1. So after the initial two, there's eight more symbols to generate, but NT26 can't produce any further as it only goes to 't3'. So that approach would terminate too early, missing the remaining eight symbols.\n\nSo that suggests that perhaps S cannot generate the required string because after two symbols, there's no way to get more. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to split S into different non-terminals that can generate the entire string.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then NT64 can be a non-terminal, and NT96 can produce another. Let me check NT64.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT64: NT64 \u2192 't4' and also other rules: NT66 \u2192 't4', NT64 \u2192 't4', etc. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, the rules for NT64 are not clearly defined here because in the provided list, I see:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't64'\nWait, perhaps I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-192","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t3 t2 t4 t3 t3 t4 t0 t2 t4 t3 t2` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, where do I start? Let me see...\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided has a bunch of these, and some non-terminals map directly to terminals with specific values. So each production should either break down further or be replaced by a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t3 t2 t4 t3 t3 t4 t0 t2 t4 t3 t2`. That's 11 tokens, which I assume corresponds to the output of the grammar for a certain derivation. I guess each token is the result of a production step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see non-terminals like S, NT47, NT64, etc., and many of them have productions that eventually resolve to 't0', 't1', or 't2'. For example, NT35 produces 't3', NT64 \u2192 't4', and so on. So I think each non-terminal either breaks down into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and the production for S is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the first step is to split S into NT64 and NT96. Each of these can either produce terminals or go deeper.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Let's consider the structure of the string as a sequence of productions leading to the terminals.\n\nStarting from S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96, so the string should start with the sequence of NT64 and NT96's productions.\n\nLooking at NT64 \u2192 't4', so that's the first token. Then NT96 \u2192 't4' as well, but wait, looking at the grammar, NT96 has a production NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. So NT96 doesn't directly produce a single terminal; it splits into two non-terminals. That complicates things because the second token (t4) would have to come from NT96 eventually breaking down.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3, t2, t4... but according to the grammar, the initial production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the initial step is to produce t4 from NT64, and then NT96 leads to something else.\n\nWait, hold on. Let's list the productions for NT96: NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Then NT54 \u2192 't4' and NT53 \u2192 't3'. So NT96 can produce 't4' 't3'. But in the string, the second token is t2, not t4. Hmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT96 part is being processed differently, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use a parsing method, like CYK, to determine if the string can be derived from S. But I'm not very confident in doing that without going through all the steps.\n\nWait, maybe I can trace the possible derivations. The starting symbol S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't4' directly. So that's the first token. Then NT96 needs to produce something that leads to the subsequent tokens.\n\nLooking at NT96, it's only one production: NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. So to get that, NT54 and NT53 need to be expanded. NT54 \u2192 't4' and NT53 \u2192 't3'. So NT96 \u2192 't4' 't3'. But in the string, after the first t4, the next is t2, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me double-check the production rules.\n\nLooking at NT96: According to the grammar, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Yes, and NT54 \u2192 't4' and NT53 \u2192 't3'. So when S is expanded, the first part is 't4', and the second is 't4' 't3'. So the entire string from S would be 't4 t4 t3', which is the first three tokens in my case: t3, t2, t4. Hmm, but that doesn't match because the string starts with t3.\n\nWait, maybe I got the derivation wrong. Let me think again: Wait, S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the first part is NT64, which is 't4', and NT96, which is NT54 NT53, which is 't4 t3'. So S produces 't4 t4 t3'. But the input string starts with t3 t2 t4..., which is different.\n\nSo that would mean the string doesn't start with the correct sequence. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because the start symbol S produces 't4 t4 t3' as the first three tokens.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to derive the string? Let me consider possible left or right derivations, but given the structure, S only has one production, and NT96 splits into two parts. I don't see another path that would produce a 't3' in the first position if the first production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which starts with 't4' for NT64 and 't4 t3' for NT96.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is derived by leftmost or other strategies, but it still has to start with 't4' followed by 't4' and 't3'. But the string starts with 't3 t2 t4', which doesn't match. So this suggests that the string is not generated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me reconsider NT96 and how it's used. Perhaps the NT64 and NT96 can be used in a different order or have a different derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows more complex derivations where non-terminals can be expanded further. Let me look for any NT productions that might lead to 't3' at the first position.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, NT96 can produce 't4' and 't3'. But in the string, the very first token is 't3', so that would require that the first non-terminal in the parse tree is something that produces 't3'.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT35 \u2192 't3', so if S can somehow derive NT35 as the first part, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which doesn't have NT35. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to derive S in a manner where the first non-terminal is NT35, but that doesn't seem possible because S only goes to NT64 and NT96.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar allows for non-terminals to produce more than just two parts, but given the Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, meaning two non-terminals at a time. So the depth is such that each expansion adds exactly one level.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in my initial assumption. Let me try building the parse tree.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't4'.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't4'.\n\nNT53 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo overall, S \u2192 't4 t4 t3'.\n\nSo the first three tokens would be t4, t4, t3, which doesn't match the input string.\n\nBut wait, the input string is t3 t2 t4 t3 t3 t4 t0 t2 t4 t3 t2. The first token is t3, but according to this, it should be t4. So that doesn't match, which suggests that the string cannot be produced by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the productions. Let me check if any non-terminals could produce 't3' in a way that would allow the first token to be 't3'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT35 \u2192 't3', but S doesn't produce NT35. So unless there's a way for the initial S to somehow produce something else, which it can't because S's only production is NT64 and NT96.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar is ambiguous, and there's another way to produce S, but looking at the grammar, the only production for S is NT64 NT96. So I don't think that's possible.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the string is generated by a different sequence of productions, like starting with a different symbol, but according to the grammar, S is the only start symbol. So you can't start with anything else.\n\nGiven that, the first token should be 't4' from NT64, but the string starts with 't3', which doesn't fit. Thus, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a step where NT64 can derive further.

{"custom_id":"request-200","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t1 t3 t4 t3 t1 t1 t2 t1 t1 t3 t4`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can go directly to a terminal. Also, CNF requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base case where S \u2192 a, a being a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT64 NT96. Each of these NTs further produces other NTs until they reach terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So, S starts the derivation, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two others until all are terminals.\n\nThe string given has 11 tokens, so the derivation must have 10 steps (since the number of symbols increases by one each step, starting from 1 at S). Each step corresponds to replacing a non-terminal with two others, until we get to all terminals.\n\nMy initial thought is that since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to check if it can be generated by following the production rules step by step. To do this, maybe I can represent the string as a parse tree and see if it can be built according to the grammar.\n\nBut doing this manually for 11 symbols might be time-consuming. Perhaps a better approach is to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to reduce it using the inverse of the production rules. This involves looking for substrings that correspond to the right-hand sides of the production rules and then replacing them with the left-hand sides until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nSo, the string is: t1 t3 t4 t3 t1 t1 t2 t1 t1 t3 t4.\n\nWait, that's 11 tokens. Since each production step replaces one non-terminal with two, the actual number of steps would be 10, but the derivation starts with S, which is one symbol. So, the length doubles each time: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. But 11 isn't a power of two, so that complicates things. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that part.\n\nWait, no. The grammar might have multiple productions leading to the same number, but in general, each step replaces a single symbol with two, so the length increases by one each time. So starting from 1 symbol (S), each step adds one more symbol, so to get 11 symbols, we need 10 steps. That makes sense because the string length grows linearly, not exponentially.\n\nSo, each step adds one symbol, meaning the derivation goes from 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 11 symbols. But wait, that doesn't fit the typical Chomsky Normal Form, which typically has the length doubling each step, so that only applies when each production produces exactly two symbols. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, but S can produce a single terminal directly if needed, but in this case, S starts as NT64 NT96.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, so S is replaced by two non-terminals. Then each of those can be replaced by two more, etc., leading to a length that's a power of two. But the given string is 11 symbols, which is not a power of two. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion isn't strictly CNF because S produces two non-terminals, but perhaps the other non-terminals can produce terminals or non-terminals as needed. So, the overall expansion is similar to derivation trees where the total number of symbols can vary.\n\nBut regardless, the approach is to try to decompose the string step by step, looking for possible substrings that match any production rule's right-hand side, starting from the right or the left.\n\nLet me attempt this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t1 t3 t4 t3 t1 t1 t2 t1 t1 t3 t4.\n\nI'll index the positions from 0 to 10:\n\n0: t1\n\n1: t3\n\n2: t4\n\n3: t3\n\n4: t1\n\n5: t1\n\n6: t2\n\n7: t1\n\n8: t1\n\n9: t3\n\n10: t4\n\nI think starting from the left, but perhaps it's easier to look for the rightmost symbols and see if they match any production rule. Alternatively, working from the left and trying to find possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, but I might get confused. Let me consider building a parse tree from the root S and see if it can generate the string.\n\nAnother approach: build all possible strings from S and see if this string is among them. But that's impractical given the number of possibilities.\n\nSo, maybe I can work backward. Let's assume the string is generated by the grammar, and try to reduce it to the start symbol S.\n\nIn CFG reduction, we look for symbols in the string that match any production's right-hand side (RHS) and replace them with the left-hand side (LHS) non-terminal.\n\nIn our case, the RHSs are all pairs of non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal (e.g., NT1 \u2192 t2, but wait, looking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals like 't0' or 't1'. For example, NT3 \u2192 't0', NT68 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I see that NT68 \u2192 't0', for example. So some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, which is allowed in CNF.\n\nGiven that, the RHS can sometimes be a single terminal, but in the given grammar, all non-terminals except the terminals have productions where each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, that's not possible because in CNF, each production must be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but the given grammar has all productions in the form of two non-terminals, perhaps. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nFor example:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT63 NT96\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT33 NT27\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n\nNT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT39 NT80\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT84 NT36\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT63 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT86 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, looking at this, there are some non-terminals that directly produce terminals (like NT63 \u2192 't1'). So, in this case, it's not strictly Chomsky Normal Form because in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but in the given grammar, it appears that some non-terminals produce a single terminal when others produce two non-terminals. So this might not be strictly in CNF, but perhaps it's in a modified form. Alternatively, maybe I misread some of the rules.\n\nLooking at the production rules, for example:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't1' \u2013 that's direct production.\n\nSimilarly, NT68 \u2192 't0' and NT68 \u2192 't3' \u2013 wait, can a non-terminal have multiple productions leading to the same terminal? That would complicate things because it would mean non-determinism.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nSo, the problem is to see if the string can be generated by this CFG. I'll proceed by attempting to reduce the string step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the entire string and see if any of the RHSs match the end of the string."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, making parsing a bit easier. \n\nFirst, I think I need to break down the grammar and see how each symbol expands into the terminals and non-terminals. The starting symbol is S, and the grammar has several productions for S, which are:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96  \nS \u2192 NT97 NT7  \nS \u2192 NT35 NT84  \n\nSo, the string must be derived from one of these initial steps. Let's look at each possibility.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT64 NT96:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62  \nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53  \n\nNow, NT84 \u2192 NT47 NT12  \nNT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63  \n\nContinuing, NT47 has two options: NT1 NT62 or NT68 NT12. Let's take NT1. NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77 and so on. Similarly, NT62 could split into NT52 and NT63. This seems a bit complicated; maybe I should try another initial production.\n\nNext, S \u2192 NT97 NT7:\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75  \nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48  \n\nNT43 \u2192 NT1 NT62 and NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26. This also seems potential, but let's see the third option.\n\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT7 NT66  \nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1  \n\nHmm, but NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48, so this might not lead to a string with enough t2s and other t's as needed.\n\nLet me try to see which path can generate the given string. The string starts with t2 t2, so perhaps the initial S production starts with NT64 and NT96.\n\nBreaking down NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which then would be NT84 \u2192 NT47 NT12, and NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63.\n\nFrom there, NT47 can split into NT1 NT62 (let's take NT1), which is NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. Then NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3, and NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT96. \n\nThis is getting too deep. Maybe I should approach it differently. I'll try to parse the string step by step using the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t's, which are terminals. We need to find a derivation where these terminals appear in the correct order.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Let's see which can produce at least the first few terms.\n\nFirst, let's try NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62  \nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nNext, NT84 \u2192 NT47 NT12  \nNT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nNT47 can go to NT1 NT62 or NT68 NT12. Let's choose NT1:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62  \nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77  \nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3  \nNT77 \u2192 NT33 NT96\n\nWait, but the string starts with t2, so I'm not sure if this is correct because I'm hitting NT3 and NT68, which are non-terminals. Maybe trying another path.\n\nAlternatively, taking NT68 for NT47:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT68 NT12  \nNT68 \u2192 't0' or other rules. But according to the grammar, NT68 \u2192 't3', 't4', or 't2'? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, NT68's productions: NT68 \u2192 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4'. So yes, it can produce any of these terminals.\n\nWait, but in the current step, we're at NT68, so the next symbol in the string would be t0, t1, t2, t3, or t4. Looking back at the string: first is t2, then t2, then t3, etc. So, in NT68 \u2192 't2', that could match the first t2 in the string.\n\nSo, NT68 \u2192 t2.\n\nNext, the string is now t2 t2 t3...\n\nBut wait, the initial step was S \u2192 NT64 NT96, so the next symbols come from NT64 and NT96, which are both non-terminals. So NT64 expands first to NT84 NT62, which expands to NT47 NT12, which then splits into either NT1 NT62 or NT68 NT12. After that, we're at the first NT68, which produces t2.\n\nThen, the next symbols come from NT96, which after NT53 (from NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53) then NT53 can produce t0 or t1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible derivation path:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n3. NT84 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n4. NT47 \u2192 NT68 NT12 (choosing this branch)\n5. NT68 \u2192 t2 (matches the first symbol)\n6. Now, NT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\n7. NT82 \u2192 t3 (matches the second symbol)\n8. Now, NT48 \u2192 NT4 NT1. NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 't1'. So, NT4 \u2192 t1. But after t2 and t3, the next symbol is t3, but in this step, after NT82, we have NT48, which is split into NT4 and NT1. So NT4 \u2192 t1, which would be the third symbol, but in our string the third symbol is t3. Hmm, that's a mismatch.\n\nSo this path doesn't work because after t2 and t3, we get t1, but the string has t3 next.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps at step 4, instead of choosing NT68 for NT47, I should choose another production.\n\nLooking back, NT47 has two options: NT1 NT62 or NT68 NT12.\n\nIf I choose NT1 NT62:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n\nThen, NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\nNT77 \u2192 NT33 NT96\n\nWait, but NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81, which is getting more complex, and we'd be getting t2 (from NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53 \u2192 ... wait, I'm getting lost here. Maybe this path isn't leading to the string.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's pick another initial production. How about S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n\nFrom NT97, it's NT43 and NT75.\n\nNT43 has productions: NT43 \u2192 NT1 NT62 or NT47 NT5.\n\nSuppose I choose NT43 \u2192 NT1 NT62.\n\nThen, NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\nNT77 \u2192 NT33 NT96\n\nAgain, getting into more non-terminals, which may not align with the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT43 \u2192 NT47 NT5.\n\nThen, NT47 can go to NT1 NT62 or NT68 NT12.\n\nIf I choose NT68:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT68 NT12\nNT68 \u2192 t2 (matches first symbol)\nNT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\nNT82 \u2192 t3 (matches second symbol)\nNow, NT48 \u2192 NT4 \u2192 t1 (third symbol should be t3, so this doesn't match)\n\nAgain, not matching.\n\nPerhaps I should backtrack.

CNF requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar to see the allowed rules and non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string starts with t1 and t3, which suggests the string begins with the production starting with S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84 (I notice there are three S rules, but I think it's a typo, maybe S is defined with three options, but I'll proceed assuming that.)\n\nWait, actually, upon closer inspection, the user input has three options for S. So S can be NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. But then the rest of the non-terminals are defined as NT followed by numbers. Each rule starts with NTxxx \u2192 NTyy NTzz. \n\nThe string has 12 t's and numbers, but all in lowercase. Looking at the grammar, each t is a terminal, each number is part of the non-terminal's derivation. The output will be a sequence of terminals, but for the string, only the t parts are terminals, others are non-terminals (NT numbers) and need to be resolved.\n\nWait, but the string is `t1 t3 t1 t1 t1 t0 t3 t1 t2 t3 t4 t1`, which is all terminals, so the derivation path must lead from S to these terminals by expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of expansion produces exactly two non-terminals. But in our case, the string alternates between t's and non-terminals? Wait, no, the string is all t's. Wait, no\u2014the grammar's non-terminals are each leading to more non-terminals until they reach a terminal. So the string would be built by expanding each non-terminal until all the symbols are terminals.\n\nBut the string provided is only terminals, so the derivation path must have fully expanded all non-terminals into terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar's right-hand sides consist of either two non-terminals (like NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62) or a terminal (like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, but are those terminals? Wait, in the grammar, are any of the non-terminals terminals? Wait, looking at the grammar, some productions have terms like 't0', 't1', etc., but those are terminals, right? Because in the string, the input is all t's and numbers, but the grammar also has non-terminals.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think the grammar is written in such a way that when the non-terminals are expanded, they produce other non-terminals or terminals. So the terminals are 't0' to 't4' and others like 't3', but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar again. Each production is either a terminal or another non-terminal. So for example, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63. NT52 and NT63 are non-terminals. Then, when you expand them, you get more non-terminals until you hit a terminal like 't0' or 't1'.\n\nSo the string given is a sequence of 12 terminals: t1, t3, t1, t1, t1, t0, t3, t1, t2, t3, t4, t1.\n\nTo check if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if the grammar can produce a derivation that results in exactly this sequence when all non-terminals are replaced by their terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will consist of each step splitting a non-terminal into two non-terminals, until all are terminals. So for a string of length n, the derivation depth is n-1.\n\nBut in this case, the string is all terminals, so it must be that each non-terminal expansion leads directly to terminals without any deeper nesting. Or perhaps the non-terminals in the string are derived in such a way that their expansion chains directly produce the required t's.\n\nBut wait, the string is a concatenation of t's and numbers, but the grammar's terminal symbols are only 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4'. So all the string consists of these terminals. But looking at the grammar, each non-terminal is defined as producing two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals, meaning each production in the expansion must have been resolved into terminals, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by leftmost derivations where each non-terminal is expanded directly into two terminals, but that can't be because in CNF, each production must be B \u2192 CD, where C and D are non-terminals. So each expansion would split it into two non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nWait, no\u2014some productions in the grammar are B \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So for example, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, but also NT60 (if any) could have productions like NT60 \u2192 t0, but looking through the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals map to terminals:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n- NT53 \u2192 NT39 NT80\n- NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\n- NT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27\n- NT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14\n- etc.\n\nBut when I look for any production where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal, it seems none do except in some specific cases like:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces a single terminal.

Because every step would involve non-terminals.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me check the grammar rules again. I think I made a mistake earlier. Some rules do have terminals as part of their right-hand sides. For example, the production NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62: that's two non-terminals.

The only time 't' is on the right-hand side is when the production has a mix of non-terminals and terminals, but in CNF, each production must be two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if a production in the grammar has a term like NT47 \u2192 t1, that would be fine because it's a non-terminal producing a terminal. But in the given grammar, no such production is present.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the rules are all in the form of two non-terminals on the right side, except for a few that include terminals. Wait, no, all the non-terminals produce two non-terminals. For example, NT64 is replaced by NT84 and NT62, which are both non-terminals. Then NT84 is replaced by NT4 and NT1, which are terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-232","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t1 t1 t4 t4 t1 t2 t0 t0 t0 t4 t3 t2 t0\". Wow, that's a sequence to unpack. Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that sometimes terminals can be on the right side. The given grammar has several rules where non-terminals are broken down into other non-terminals, and some rules directly give a terminal. For example, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, which could be NTs that break down further. But I also see that some non-terminals directly expand into a single terminal, like NT68 \u2192 't0' or 't1', etc.\n\nThe string is a concatenation of these terminals, so 't1 t1 t4 ...' essentially. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nI think the best approach here is to model the parsing process. Since it's a tree, I can use either top-down parsing (like recursive descent) or bottom-up (like the CYK algorithm). But given that the grammar might be a bit complex, maybe top-down or a divide and conquer approach would work.\n\nLet me list out all the production rules and their terminal expansions to understand the possible paths.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which can produce three different options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo any valid string must start with one of these combinations. Let's look at each option.\n\nEach of these S options results in two NTs. Each NT can further split into more NTs until we reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with 't1 t1 t4...'. Let me check each S option's initial productions.\n\nOption 1: NT64 and NT96. Let's see what they produce.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nWait, NT64 and NT96 each split into two NTs. So the first step in this option would be to generate NT64 and NT96, each leading to more NTs. Let's see what those next steps are.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nSo NT64 leads to NT84 (which is 't4' or more NTs) and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT47 NT12 or wait, looking back: NT54 can expand into different NTs, or wait, looking at the rules, let me check.\n\nWait, let's see the rules again:\n\nLooking at NT... The rules are extensive. For instance, NT68 \u2192 't0' or 't3', but some others have more expansions.\n\nThis could get really complicated. Maybe a better approach is to model this as a tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach it as a sequence of steps. The initial step is S, which splits into two NTs. Each of those splits further, until the leaves are terminals.\n\nGiven the string's length is 14 tokens, and each production rule tends to produce a certain number of NTs, the depth of the tree would be around 14, but actually, each production can add more NTs until we reach the terminals.\n\nWait, but S produces two NTs, each of which can themselves produce two more NTs, leading to a binary tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider the production rules and see if each part of the string can be matched by a path starting from S.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step, trying to find if each 't' in the string can be matched through a series of productions.\n\nThe string is: t1, t1, t4, t4, t1, t2, t0, t0, t0, t4, t3, t2, t0.\n\nTotal of 13 tokens. Wait, counting again: after splitting the commas, it's 14 tokens:\n\nt1, t1, t4, t4, t1, t2, t0, t0, t0, t4, t3, t2, t0 \u2192 13? Wait, let me count:\n\n1. t1\n2. t1\n3. t4\n4. t4\n5. t1\n6. t2\n7. t0\n8. t0\n9. t0\n10. t4\n11. t3\n12. t2\n13. t0\n\nYes, 13 tokens.\n\nSo, let me try to see if we can find a leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nSince S produces three options, we can choose any of them. Let's try option 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nSo our first step is to produce NT64 and NT96. Each of these NTs needs to generate a certain number of tokens.\n\nLet's look at NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. Now, NT4 isn't a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, NT4 is a non-terminal. But in the rules, I don't see NT4 expanding into terminals. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT4's productions are:\n\nWait, in the initial list, I don't see any rules starting with NT4. Hmm. Did I miss it? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n- NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n- etc.\n\nIt seems NT4 isn't a starting non-terminal in any rule. So that might be a problem. Wait, unless I made a mistake in copying the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are such that I might have missed NT4. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nYes, I think I might have overlooked some. Let me go through the list carefully.\n\nI think I need to list all the rules to see if NT4 has any productions.\n\nWait, the provided rules are a list, and I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nNT48 \u2192 t1\nNT33 \u2192 t0\nNT68 \u2192 t0\nNT97 \u2192 t2\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, searching for NT4 in the rules. Let me check each one:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT1: no\n- NT66: no\n- NT64: no\n- NT53: no\n- NT7: no\n- NT68: no\n- NT97: no\n- Then, looking for NT4... Hmm, I don't see any NT4 rules. So maybe NT4 is not a non-terminal but a terminal. But in that case, why is it a non-terminal in the grammar? Or perhaps it's a terminal and I misread it.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are written with NT numbers, and the right side can include terminals. So, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking for NT4 in the right-hand side:\n\nWait, I don't see NT4 on the left side of any production. All the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 t. So, if NT4 is on the left of any rule, but in the given list, I don't see any. So perhaps NT4 is not a non-terminal but a terminal.\n\nThat complicates things because if NT4 is a terminal, then NT84 \u2192 NT4 would mean that NT84 is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal (t4), and another NT which might be a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me clarify: in the given rules, for example, NT68 \u2192 t0. So if a non-terminal NT can produce a terminal on the right, that means that non-terminal is a leaf node in the parse tree, producing that terminal.\n\nBut for NT4, if there's any rule, but none in the given list, then maybe NT4 can only produce something else if it's on the left of a production. Since I don't see NT4 on the left, perhaps NT4 is not used, or it's a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps the given rules are incomplete.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I miscounted or missed some.\n\nWait, looking again, let me check each production for NT4:\n\n- Let's go through all the lines to see if any are NT4 \u2192 something.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3\n- NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n- NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n- NT68 \u2192 t4?\nWait, no."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-235","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string `t4 t1 t1 t2 t1 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t0` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side (except for the starting symbol, which can produce a terminal). \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. The starting symbol is S, and the initial productions from S are to combinations of NTs. For example, S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. These NTs (non-terminals) then further produce other combinations until terminals are reached, such as 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals: t4, t1, t1, t2, t1, t4, t0, t1, t2, t2, t0, t3, t0. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree should be a binary tree of height related to the length of the string. The length of the string is 13, so the tree should have a height of about 4 or 5.\n\nI think about how the grammar works. Each step in the derivation consumes two symbols and replaces them with two non-terminals. So the string must be decomposable into pairs of symbols corresponding to each production rule.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward approach is to use memoization or recursive descent parsing. However, considering time, maybe it's better to see if the sequence can be split into a series of production rule applications.\n\nLooking at the string, it's important to note that each non-terminal production is two non-terminals, so the total number of symbols must be a number that allows for binary splits. Let's count the symbols: 13, which is odd. That's a problem because with each step, the number of symbols could decrease by one (since two non-terminals are replaced by two non-terminals?), but in this context, each step is about how the symbols are paired. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, in CNF, every production either is a single terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, no, CNF requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But upon closer look at the given grammar, I see that some productions end with a terminal, like NT68 \u2192 't0', or NT47 \u2192 't4'. So the actual terminals are the ones that directly produce 't0', 't1', etc., while other non-terminals split further.\n\nSo the total number of symbols in the string must be 1 plus 2^n, I think. Wait, actually, each production rule when applied reduces the count of non-terminals by one (replaces two with two, actually? No, wait: for example, if we have two non-terminals, each production replaces them with two non-terminals, so the count remains the same. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's length must be such that the number of symbols is equal to the number of productions needed. Since the string is 13 symbols long, and each non-terminal production contributes to splitting, perhaps it's better to model the possible way to split the string into the productions.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can look for the start symbol S and see how the string could be derived from it.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. So, the string must start with the result of one of these productions. Let's see if the first symbols of the string can be matched by any of these production pairs.\n\nLooking at the given string: t4 t1 t1 t2 t1 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t0.\n\nThe first production from S is NT64 NT96. So, the first step would be to derive the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT64 and NT96, then the entire string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT64 and NT96.\n\nCheck the first terminal in the string: t4. So we need to see what NT64 produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT64 can produce NT84 NT62 or NT4. Wait, according to the provided grammar, NT64 -> NT84 NT62. But wait, checking line by line:\n\nWait, let's list the productions for NT64:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT64 -> NT35\nWait, does NT64 have two productions? Let me check. Yes, line 4: NT66-> NT52 NT63.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, or a single non-terminal. The start symbol here is S, and the productions start from there. The string is a sequence of t1, t3, etc., which are terminals, so each of these needs to correspond to a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some terminals are assigned to non-terminals. For example, NT68 -> 't0', NT97 -> 't2', etc. Each production ends with a terminal, sometimes mapping from a non-terminal.\n\nThe string is a series of t's, so each step in the derivation should produce one terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a new non-terminal or ends with a terminal. So, to generate the string, each terminal must be produced by a rule that ends directly with that t.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT47 -> 't1' (Wait, I see multiple NT47 rules. Let me check all of them.)\nActually, looking at the grammar, there are several NT47 productions that eventually resolve to different terminals. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT47 -> 't1'\n- NT47 -> 't4'\n- NT47 -> 't4'\n- NT47 -> 't4'\nWait, that can't be right because NT47 can't map to multiple terminals. Maybe I misread. Let me go through each line carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar list, I see:\n\nNT47 -> 't1'\nNT47 -> 't4'\nNT47 -> 't4'\nNT47 -> 't4'\n\nWait, that can't be correct. A non-terminal can only have one production in a given form, but here NT47 is being defined multiple times with different terminals. That seems conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake in reading.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT64 NT96\nS -> NT97 NT7\nS -> NT35 NT84\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\nNT1 -> NT5 NT77\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT53 -> NT86 NT33\nNT7 -> NT66 NT48\nNT33 -> NT84 NT81\nNT38 -> NT34 NT27\nNT12 -> NT82 NT48\nNT5 -> NT68 NT3\nNT38 -> NT63 NT96\nNT14 -> NT33 NT27\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\nNT39 -> NT70 NT39\nNT24 -> NT38 NT70\nNT98 -> NT78 NT14\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\nNT75 -> NT98 NT26\nNT53 -> NT39 NT80\nNT70 -> NT84 NT36\nNT27 -> NT24 NT62\nNT3 -> NT22 NT74\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT63 -> 't1'\nNT47 -> 't1'\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT3 -> 't0'\nNT98 -> 't1'\nNT86 -> 't0'\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT77 -> 't2'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT78 -> 't0'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT54 -> 't4'\nNT84 -> 't2'\nNT12 -> 't3'\nNT39 -> 't0'\nNT64 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT48 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT54 -> 't1'\nNT66 -> 't4'\nNT7 -> 't2'\nNT68 -> 't2'\nNT26 -> 't3'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT74 -> 't4'\nNT33 -> 't0'\nNT80 -> 't3'\nNT22 -> 't4'\nNT82 -> 't4'\nNT54 -> 't3'\nNT81 -> 't1'\nNT36 -> 't4'\nNT77 -> 't3'\nNT96 -> 't4'\nNT47 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't0'\nNT77 -> 't1'\nNT4 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't0'\nNT74 -> 't3'\nNT80 -> 't2'\nNT22 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT21 -> 't4'\nNT52 -> 't4'\nNT43 -> 't0'\nNT53 -> 't2'\nNT84 -> 't0'\nNT34 -> 't4'\nNT96 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't0'\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Looking again, I see that some non-terminals have multiple rules leading to different terminals. For example, NT47 appears multiple times with different terminal assignments. Wait, no, that's not possible in a proper grammar. Maybe some lines are redundant or it's a mistake in formatting, but as per the given data, how should I proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of these lines are different versions, but I think the user provided the rules, and each line is a separate production. So each line is a separate rule. So, for example, NT47 has rules like -> NT1 NT62, which would be one production, and also maps to 't1', 't4', etc. So perhaps I need to check all rules that lead to the specific string.\n\nBut this seems complex. Another approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some rule. Let's first list all the terminals in the target string:\n\nt1, t3, t3, t3, t2, t2, t3, t4, t1, t4, t3, t2, t0, t0.\n\nEach of these must correspond to a rule in the grammar where a non-terminal directly maps to that terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's go through each production that results in a terminal:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0' and 't2' according to lines NT3 -> 't0' and NT3 -> 't2'. Wait, but a non-terminal can't have multiple terminals, so perhaps NT3 is defined to map to one of them based on the derivation path. But in Chomsky normal form, each production is a rule, so maybe some rules are alternative for the same non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the production rules that lead to terminals:\n\nLooking through each line, the grammar has lines where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal:\n\n- NT47 -> 't1' (twice)\n- NT47 -> 't4' (twice)\n- NT68 -> 't0' and 't3' and 't2' and 't4' as per multiple lines\nWait, no, looking again, each line is a separate production, so I think some lines were duplicated or it's a mistake, but let's proceed.\n\nBut this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that each rule that ends with a terminal is a production where that non-terminal can generate that terminal. So, let's see which non-terminals have rules ending in the target terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT47 can produce 't1', 't4'\n- NT68 can produce 't0', 't3', 't2', 't4'\n- NT3 can produce 't0', 't2'\n- NT97 can produce 't2' and 't1'\n- NT98 can produce 't1' and 't0' and 't3'\n- NT77 can produce 't2', 't3'\n- NT74 can produce 't4'\n- NT84 can produce 't2' and 't0'\n- NT36 can produce 't4'\n- NT54 can produce 't4', 't1', 't3'\n- NT22 can produce 't4'\n- NT82 can produce 't4'\n- NT80 can produce 't3'\n- NT74 -> 't4'\n- NT54 -> 't1' and 't3' and 't4'\n- NT62 -> 't0'\n\nHmm, this seems too many.

{"custom_id":"request-259","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t2 t2 t3 t3 t2 t1 t4 t2 t3 t2 t1 t2 t3 t3` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the productions fit this format since each S or NT has either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of terminals: `t2, t2, t3, t3, t2, t1, t4, t2, t3, t2, t1, t2, t3, t3`. My goal is to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI think a good approach here is to use derivation or maybe a parsing method. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can construct a parse tree or use a top-down approach. But with so many steps, it might get tedious. Alternatively, grouping the symbols into pairs or considering possible productions could help.\n\nWait, each production either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal. So every step reduces the number of non-terminals, moving towards terminals. Since the string has 14 symbols, it's quite long, so we need to find a consistent way to break it down.\n\nBut looking at the production rules, I notice that some non-terminals map directly to terminals, for example, NT68 -> t4, NT77 -> t3, etc. These are the base cases. So perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to these terminals.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of t2, t3, etc. Let's see if any of these t's correspond directly to a production. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT64 -> t4\n- NT77 -> t3\n- NT97 -> t2\n- NT98 -> t1\n- NT1 -> t2\n- NT7 -> t2\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT5 -> t2\n- NT47 -> t4\n- NT66 -> t4\n- NT48 -> t1\n- NT33 -> t1\n- NT14 -> t0\n- NT35 -> t3\n- NT7 -> t2\n- Etc.\n\nWait, some of the t's might be from specific non-terminals. So perhaps the string can be partitioned into segments that match these productions.\n\nBut another approach is to see if each t in the string can be traced back to a production. However, since the string is long, it's not straightforward. Let me think about the possible ways the string can be split.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be split into a sequence of terminals generated by the start symbol S. So starting with S, which has two productions:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo S can produce a combination of two non-terminals. Let's see what each of these pairs can generate.\n\nOption 1: NT64 and NT96. From the grammar:\n\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nSo S could be replaced by (NT84 NT62) (NT54 NT53). Then each of these NTs needs to be expanded further. But wait, NT64 leads to NT84 and NT62, and NT96 leads to NT54 and NT53.\n\nNow, let's look at NT84. productions: NT84 -> NT4 NT1 (from NT84: t2), and NT1 -> t2.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let's try:\n\nFrom NT84, it can be NT4 and NT1. But NT4: looking at the grammar, no NT4 exists except NT47 maybe? Wait, in the given productions, I don't see NT4 as a non-terminal. Let me check the list. Oh, yes, looking through the productions, NT4 is not listed. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions, the NTs are:\n\nNT47, NT66, NT64, NT53, NT7, NT35, NT78, NT97, NT84, NT63, etc. So NT4 is not a non-terminal; it's actually a terminal. Wait, in the original problem, NT47 is defined as producing t1, t0, etc., but I don't see NT4 as a non-terminal except in the cases like NT5 -> NT68 NT3. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial productions start with S, which splits into NTs and terminals. But in the rules provided, I don't see any production for NT4 except in one of the rules, for example:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT35 -> t3, but not NT4. Wait, wait, no, looking again: the production rules for NT are all left-hand sides, so actually, NT4 is not a non-terminal; its terminals appear as the results of other productions. So I think I made a mistake earlier by thinking NT47 produces a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, the LHS are NTs, but some of the RHS have terminals as symbols. For example, some NTs produce a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT47 -> NT1 t1. So the actual terminals are on the RHS, not the LHS.\n\nWait, that changes things. So in the grammar, when you have a production like NT47 -> NT1 t1, that means the left side is NT47, and the right side is two symbols: NT1 (a non-terminal) and t1 (a terminal). So the string is built by combinations of non-terminals and terminals, but the terminals are the final leaves.\n\nSo for S, the initial production is S -> NT64 NT96. Each of these could be further broken down.\n\nLet me try to parse the string back from the start.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to each production step. Let's try to find the root.\n\nS has three possible productions:\n\n1. NT64 NT96\n2. NT97 NT7\n3. NT35 NT84\n\nLet me see if the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to one of these NTs.\n\nFor example, looking at the string: t2 t2 t3 t3 t2 t1 t4 t2 t3 t2 t1 t2 t3 t3\n\nWait, perhaps the string is of even length. Wait, no, it's 14 symbols, which is even. Since each production of a non-terminal either splits into two NTs or a terminal and a non-terminal, depending on their rules.\n\nWait, but in our case, the initial productions for S either split into two NTs (each being two symbols) or a NT and a terminal, so the string should be of even length if we have an even number of non-terminals at each level. Hmm, but the given string is 14 symbols. Let's see how that breaks down.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal can be thought of as requiring either one or two symbols. But this depends on whether the NT's RHS is two terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal (which would require splitting further). For example:\n\nIf an NT produces a terminal and a non-terminal, that would require the non-terminal to be split in the next step, thus adding more symbols. But terminal products just add a single symbol.\n\nWait, maybe let's approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t2 t2 t3 t3 t2 t1 t4 t2 t3 t2 t1 t2 t3 t3.\n\nLet me write this as a list for clarity:\n[t2, t2, t3, t3, t2, t1, t4, t2, t3, t2, t1, t2, t3, t3]\n\nI have to determine if this can be generated by the grammar. Let's consider the start symbol S, which has three productions. Let's check each of them to see if any of them can produce the given string.\n\nFirst, S can be:\n- NT64 NT96\n- NT97 NT7\n- NT35 NT84\n\nLet me try each possibility.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT64 NT96\nSo, NT64's production:\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nSo, after first split, we have [NT84, NT62, NT54, NT53]. Now, each of these NTs may have their own productions.\n\nLet's see what NT84 and NT54 produce.\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1 (from the rule)\nNT47 -> NT1 t1\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's double-check some key points. For example, NT68 has two productions: NT68 \u2192 't0' and NT68 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT97 has two: one is NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, another is NT97 \u2192 't2'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's all 't's and numbers, like 't2 t0 t4 t2 ...'. The key is that the grammar is CNG, so the string must be structured as sequences of these terminals from two non-terminals per step, starting from S.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string step by step, starting from S and trying to see if it can derive the string. Let's consider S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So S starts with NT35 \u2192 't3' according to the productions, so after NT35, we have 't3'. Then the next part starts with NT84, which can go to 't2' via production NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, but wait, NT4 is 't1', but perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, S has three productions: NT35, NT84, etc. So let's take S \u2192 NT35 NT84. Then NT35 \u2192 't3', so the first element is 't3'. Then NT84 can produce either 't2' (since NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, which go to 't1' and 't2'? Or perhaps NT84 has more options.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 and NT84 \u2192 't2'. Let me check NT84's production: NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, and NT84 \u2192 't2'. So NT84 can either split into NT4 and NT1 or produce 't2'.\n\nSo, in the string, after 't3' comes 't0', which doesn't match 't2'. So maybe that's not the right choice. Alternatively, maybe we should try another starting point.\n\nWait, S could also produce NT97 NT7. Then NT97 \u2192 't2', and the next NT7. Let's check NT7's production: NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48. Then NT66 \u2192 't4', and NT48 \u2192 't1', so that gives 't4' and 't1'. But the string starts with 't2 t0 t4 t2 ...', so after 't2' (from NT97), we have 't0' next. That doesn't fit, since 't0' isn't part of NT7's derivation (which would give 't4' 't1').\n\nWait, another option: S \u2192 NT97 NT7. NT97 \u2192 't2' (if it can produce directly to 't2'), and then NT7: which can be NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48, which gives 't4' and 't1', so the sequence would be 't2 t4 t1...', but the string starts with 't2 t0 t4...'. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S produces NT64 NT96. NT64 \u2192 either NT84 NT62, which can go to 't3' (since NT84 \u2192 't2' and NT62 \u2192 't0'). Alternatively, NT64 could go to 't4' since directly when it's NT68 \u2192 't4', but wait, looking at NT64: in the productions, it's written as NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 and also NT68 NT1. Wait, no: looking back, it says:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT64 \u2192 NT68 NT3\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.

{"custom_id":"request-276","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to check if it belongs to the language defined by this grammar. The string is `t1 t0 t4 t2 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t4 t1 t1 t2 t0 t4`. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure often makes it easier to analyze or parse strings because each production expands one symbol into two, and terminals are the leaves.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see it's quite extensive. There are a lot of productions starting with NT followed by other NTs or sometimes terminals like 't0' or 't1'. Some of these have rules that eventually resolve into terminals, such as NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, and then NT52 and NT63 might produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of 't's and numbers, which are likely terminals. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S can produce three different options:\n1. NT64 NT96\n2. NT97 NT7\n3. NT35 NT84\n\nSo any valid string must start with either NT64 and NT96, NT97 and NT7, or NT35 and NT84. Let's look at the first two symbols of the given string: 't1' and 't0'. Wait, the first symbol is 't1', which could be from NT64 or NT47 because looking at the productions, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which then might end up as 't4' or other terminals, but NT64 is a node that leads to 't4' in some cases. But let's trace back.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't1 t0...'. So the initial production must produce something that leads to t1 and t0 as the first two symbols after expansion. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which of the NT productions result in terminals that start with 't1'? For example, NT68 \u2192 't4' or 't1' or 't3'. Let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12 \u2192 then NT47 can produce t4 or t3, depending on production.\nWait, perhaps I should build a derivation tree from the start symbol S and see if it can generate the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the steps of the productions. Let me outline possible steps.\n\nThe string is: t1, t0, t4, t2, t2, t0, t3, t4, t1, t4, t1, t1, t2, t0, t4\n\nSo 15 symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in a derivation increases the number of symbols by 1 (since each production replaces one symbol with two). Starting from S, the string length increases by 1 each time. Since S can produce two symbols initially, the number of steps (derivations) would relate to the length. But let's not get bogged down in that.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to model this as a parsing problem, trying to match the string with the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the only possibilities are binary trees, but manually constructing this would be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the validity by ensuring that each 't' in the string is produced by some NT production that leads to that 't'. But maybe a better way is to use the concept of reachability, where each terminal must be reachable from S through the productions.\n\nBut another approach is to model this as a finite automaton, but since the grammar is context-free and in CNF, a pushdown automaton would be more suitable, but without writing it out, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can build a table of possible symbols that can appear at each position given the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe the start symbol S can only produce two NT symbols initially, so the string must start with a combination that S can produce.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't1', which I think comes from NT64 or perhaps NT97. Let me check the productions:\n\nWait, looking at NT96: NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, which in turn:\nNT54 \u2192 't4' (I think? Let me check. From the grammar, NT54 \u2192 't4' as per some rule. Wait, looking at the given production list:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT54 -> 't4' (Yes, one of the rules is \"NT54 -> 't4'\")\n\nSimilarly, NT96 is involved in NT39 -> NT70 NT39, but that's a loop, not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT productions that produce terminals directly:\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are some rules that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't4'\n- NT47 \u2192 't1' or 't3'? Wait, in the grammar, there are two rules for NT47:\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62 (Wait, no, actually in the given, NT47 appears multiple times, but only once as NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62. Wait, no, in the given list:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe production rules for NT47 listed are:\n\n1. NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n2. NT47 -> NT1 NT62 (maybe a typo? Or maybe it's a different rule.)\n\nWait, checking again, the user provided:\n\nFor NT47:\n\n- S -> NT47 NT75 (I think not relevant)\n- Then:\n\nLooking at NT47: \n\n\"NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\" \n\nWait, that seems redundant. Maybe a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be another rule. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different case. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's look at the entire list provided:\n\nThe user gave a long list of production rules starting with S -> NT64 NT96, etc., then various NT_x productions.\n\nLooking through that list, for NT47, there is:\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62 (twice). Hmm, perhaps that's a mistake, but regardless, perhaps I should focus on which NTs lead directly to terminals.\n\nLooking through the list, for example:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't4'\n- NT47 \u2192 't1' (wait, looking for where NT47 ends with a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nFrom the user's provided grammar, for example, NT68 is written as:\n\n- \"NT68 -> NT47 NT12\"\n\nBut in the grammar, looking for NT47 and NT12 that perhaps end with terminals.\n\nWait, let's go through each NT's production until we find a rule that produces a terminal.\n\nLet me go through each NT:\n\n1. NT47:\n   - NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62 (twice? Or maybe duplicated)\n   - Wait, in the list, NT47 is also written again: \"NT47 -> NT1 NT62\" appears twice. So perhaps it's a typo, but in any case, NT47 seems to produce NT1 and NT62, which are other non-terminals. That might not help with terminals.\n\n2. NT68:\n   - \"NT68 -> NT47 NT12\" (multiple times)\n   - Then, checking NT47 and NT12: Do they lead to terminals?\n   - From above, NT47 leads to other NTs, so perhaps NT68 doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\n3. NT33:\n   - \"NT33 -> 't1'\" (Ah, yes, here it is. So NT33 \u2192 't1'.\n   - Similarly, other NTs:\n\n   Check NT54:\n   - \"NT54 -> 't4'\".\n\n   NT70:\n   - \"NT70 -> 't3'\".\n\n   Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me go through each production.\n\nLooking through the user's grammar list:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 (so NT52 and NT63)\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33 \u2192 So NT86 might be a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-292","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t4 t4 t3 t3 t2 t1 t2 t1 t4 t0 t3 t1 t4 t3 t2 t4`, which is quite long. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure implies that each production step either breaks a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree for any string will have a height proportional to the logarithm of the string length, which for this case, 16 symbols long, would mean a depth of 4 steps.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I need to see if there's a way to decompose it into a series of production rules starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S in the grammar is given as S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the first step is to see if the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to NT64 and NT96, which generate the first and second halves of the string respectively.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 and NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. From the string, the first two t4s might come from NT84 or NT62, but looking at the rules for NT84 and NT62, both of these non-terminals might produce terminal symbols.\n\nWait, let me list down the terminal symbols first. The terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4. The non-terminals are NT1, NT3, NT4, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9, NT12, NT21, NT24, NT26, NT33, NT35, NT36, NT38, NT43, NT47, NT48, NT5, NT52, NT53, NT54, NT62, NT63, NT64, NT66, NT68, NT70, NT74, NT75, NT77, NT78, NT80, NT81, NT82, NT84, NT96, NT97, NT98.\n\nNow, the given string is 16 symbols long, all t's. The first step is to split it into two parts after the first 8 symbols and 8 symbols. However, with CNF, each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one each time until it's fully expanded.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse strings in CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm works by filling a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the CYK algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each cell (i,j) will hold the non-terminals that can derive the substring s_i...s_j.\n2. Fill the diagonal cells (i,i) with terminals if they are directly produced by a single non-terminal; otherwise, they are empty.\n3. For each length l from 2 to n (length of string), and for each starting index i, compute j = i + l - 1.\n4. For each cell (i,j), find all production rules that have a right-hand side that includes the terminals in s_i...s_j. Specifically, for each middle k between i and j, check if there's a production NT \u2192 A B where A can derive s_i...k and B can derive s_{k+1}...j. If such a production exists, add NT to (i,j).\n5. If any non-terminal S (the start symbol) is found in the final cell of the table (like (0,n-1)), then the string is accepted.\n\nLet me try to apply this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is `t4 t4 t3 t3 t2 t1 t2 t1 t4 t0 t3 t1 t4 t3 t2 t4`. For simplicity, I'll note each symbol as a token:\n\nIndices: 0:t4, 1:t4, 2:t3, 3:t3, 4:t2, 5:t1, 6:t2, 7:t1, 8:t4, 9:t0, 10:t3, 11:t1, 12:t4, 13:t3, 14:t2, 15:t4.\n\nFirst, I'll look at all single terminals and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can compile a list for each terminal and which non-terminals produce it.\n\n- t0 is produced by NT77 (->t0), NT7 (NT7: wait, NT7 produces NT66 NT48. Oh, but in the rules I have:\n\nWait, looking back, I'll go through each production and write down which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1' \u2192 NT47 \u2192 t1? Wait, no, the rules given are:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n\nWait, some rules end with a terminal. Like:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT62 t0? No, looking at the given grammar, I need to list all non-terminals that directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list, for each terminal 'tX', which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, no, hold on, I need to look through each production rule.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\n\nS -> NT97 NT7\n\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT63 NT96\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT33 NT27\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62 (Wait, earlier it was NT47 -> NT21 NT3, but here seems to be another production.

Hmm, this might be a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that most of the rules are of the form NTnumber \u2192 NTNT, except for a few that produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So each production either combines two non-terminals or provides a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string given is composed of a series of 't' followed by digits, so 't2', 't0', etc. I notice that each production rule either breaks down into smaller parts (e.g., S \u2192 NT64 NT96) or produces a terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be derived by applying these productions.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. **Analyze the String Structure**: The string has 16 elements, each being a 't' followed by a number. Since each production rule either results in a terminal or combines two non-terminals, the structure of the string should correspond to how the non-terminals can expand into terminals through these rules.\n\n2. **Top-Down Parsing Attempt**: Starting from the start symbol S, see how it can expand into the string. S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\n3. **Check Each Production Option**:\n   - **Option 1**: Start with S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n     - NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n     - NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n     - Each of these needs to be checked if they can produce the corresponding terminal parts of the string.\n   - **Option 2**: S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n     - NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n     - NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n   - **Option 3**: S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n     - NT35 \u2192 NT33 NT84\n     - NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n   Let's consider each option and recursively check if their expansions can match the string.\n\n4. **Starting with Option 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96**\n   - NT64 expands to NT84 NT62.

So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-318","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Hmm, the grammar is a bit complex with various productions leading to terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. And the string I'm supposed to evaluate is `t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t1 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t1`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol S branches into different non-terminals, and each of those non-terminals can lead to other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Each of these is a starting point. The string starts with t0 and ends with t1, so I need to see if the derivation from S can lead to that sequence.\n\nI think I'll approach this by trying to find a possible derivation path. Since the string is 17 tokens long, and each production either replaces one non-terminal with two or a terminal, I should check the number of steps. Starting with S, each step increases the number of symbols by one (since A \u2192 BC goes from one to two). So for length 17, since S starts with 1, after n steps, length is 1 + n.\n\nWait, but each production of two non-terminals can lead to more non-terminals, so it's a binary tree expansion. For a string of length k, the number of productions needed is k-1, since each production adds one symbol. So for 17 tokens, 16 production steps. But each production step from a non-terminal can split into two.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to try and find which non-terminals can generate sequences that match parts of the target string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct the parse tree in a top-down manner, starting from S and trying to match the string from the beginning.\n\nThe string is: t0, t2, t0, t2, t4, t1, t4, t2, t3, t0, t4, t3, t4, t3, t1, t4, t1.\n\nSince S produces three possibilities, let's try each and see if any path leads to the string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the first symbols should come from NT64 and NT96.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Let's see what NT84 and NT62 produce.\n\nNT84 can produce t2 or if it's a non-terminal, I need to see further.\n\nLooking at NT84: it can produce t2, which is a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, NT84 \u2192 t2, yes. So NT84 \u2192 t2.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT47. Let's see what NT47 does: NT47 \u2192 t1 or other productions. But looking at the given rules, NT47 can produce t1, but also NT1 is a possible non-terminal for NT47. Wait, the rules for NT47 are:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62 or NT21 NT34?

NT84 \u2192 t2.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT47.\n\nSo NT62 \u2192 NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62.\n\nSo for NT62, we have to produce NT1 and NT62.\n\nBut wait, NT62 is a non-terminal, so recursively, NT47 will produce NT1 and NT62 again.\n\nThis seems like it could lead to an infinite loop if not handled properly. Wait, no, because NT62 \u2192 NT47, which depends on NT62 again. So this would lead to a loop, making it impossible to terminate unless there's another production that terminates.\n\nWait, looking at NT62, perhaps there's another rule, but in the given grammar, I don't see any other production for NT62. The rule is NT62 \u2192 NT47. So NT62 can only produce NT47, which leads back to NT62, so this would create an infinite loop. Therefore, this path (S \u2192 NT64 NT96) immediately leads to a dead end because it can't produce a terminal.\n\nSo maybe this first option is not feasible. Let's try the second option from S.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nSo the string starts with NT97 \u2192 t0 and NT7 \u2192 t1. Hmm, wait, no, NT97 \u2192 't0' according to the given grammar, yes.\n\nWait, according to the given rules:\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2' is one of the rules, but also NT97 can produce 't0' and 't1'.\n\nWait, looking at the initial grammar, under NT97 we have:\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75 and NT97 -> 't2', 't0', and 't1'?\n\nWait, no, looking again, the initial list for NT97 is:\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75\n\nNT97 -> 't2'\n\nNT98 -> NT78 NT14\n\n...\n\nWait, from NT98, but not NT97. So actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT97, the lines are:\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75\n\nand\n\nNT97 -> 't2'\n\nWait, but in the initial rules provided, I didn't see multiple rules for NT97.

Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because I mostly see two non-terminals on the left side, except for the terminals which are the 't's. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96 is a production with two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, which is allowed in CNF, but wait, actually in CNF each production can have at most two non-terminals on the right side. So yeah, this grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string I need to check consists of a series of terminals, all 't's and numbers. Wait, no, looking closer, the string is `t2 t3 t4 t0 ...` etc. So these are all terminals. Wait, no, the grammar also has a mix. For example, NT68 can produce 't0', 't1', etc. So the string is a sequence of these terminals and non-terminals derived from the grammar.\n\nThe approach I think is to model this as a parsing problem, using something like recursive descent parsing or maybe the CYK algorithm. But since I'm doing this manually, maybe tracing the derivation would be better.\n\nThe string is `t2 t3 t4 t0 t3 t2 t2 t3 t0 t3 t1 t3 t4 t4 t1 t1 t0`. That's 17 tokens. Each production rule in the grammar is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So the overall approach would be to derive the string starting from S and breaking it down into these parts.\n\nBut tracing each possibility for 17 tokens seems time-consuming. Maybe looking for patterns or checking if each segment can be derived.\n\nLet me list out the grammar productions for the terminals since those are the ones that produce 't's:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT3 \u2192 't0' and 't2' as per some rules. Wait, actually, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74: Which can be broken down further. But wait, the NT3 ultimately produces t0 or t2?

Wait, but the start symbol S can produce NT64 NT96, which is two non-terminals. Each of those may further produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, I think what I need to do is check whether the string can be entirely derived by repeatedly splitting the string into pairs of non-terminals and checking if each pair matches a production.\n\nWait, another approach is to see if the string can be generated by expanding from the start symbol S, applying the productions, and ending up with the string. But since this is a context-free grammar, and the string is entirely terminal, each step should break down into parts that match each rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a parse tree, where each step combines two non-terminals into a terminal.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be generated by checking if each pair of terminal matches the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so it's a matter of whether the start symbol can derive this string through a series of steps breaking it down into terminals. Alternatively, I can reverse the process: recursively break down the string into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me try starting from the beginning. The string starts with t2.

Let me look again.\n\nActually, looking at the grammar provided, each production is a rule, sometimes with the same left-hand side.\n\nWait, perhaps focusing on the non-terminals that directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT68 has a rule NT68 \u2192 't4'?

Each non-terminal (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) is defined in terms of other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals seem to be the 't0' to 't9' strings, so the parsing will be based on how the string's tokens can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S has multiple productions:\n- S -> NT64 NT96\n- S -> NT97 NT7\n- S -> NT35 NT84\n\nI'll consider each production separately and see if the string can be a result of any of them.\n\nLet's take the first production: S -> NT64 NT96. From the rules, NT64 is defined as NT84 NT62, and NT96 is 't4'. So, S becomes NT84 NT62 't4'. Wait, no, actually, NT64 is NT84 NT62, so the entire production is (NT84)(NT62)(t4). \n\nLooking at the grammar, NT84 can be NT4 NT1, and NT4 is 't1'. Similarly, NT62 is NT52 NT63, which are NT63. NT63 is 't1'. So tracing back, S via S->NT64 NT96 would generate something like (t1 t1)(t4), but the string starts with t1 t1, but let me not get ahead of myself.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string step by step, but I think a top-down approach would help. Alternatively, I can construct a parse tree, but given the number of tokens, maybe I can look for possible derivations.\n\nLet me write down the string tokens in order:\nt1, t1, t4, t4, t4, t3, t1, t1, t2, t1, t0, t1, t2, t1, t4, t4, t2, t0.\n\nWait, that's 18 tokens. Since each production in the grammar either introduces terminals or combines two non-terminals, the parse tree would have a structure where each non-terminal expands into two parts, except when terminals are reached.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Let me see what the string could be represented as in non-terminals.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the string starts with 't1 t1 t4 t4 t4 t3 t1 t1 t2 t1 t0...', which is 18 tokens. So, perhaps the derivation steps would involve breaking down the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, many of the NTs have terminals as their children. For example, NT3 is 't0' or 't4', NT68 is 't4', etc. Maybe I can focus on the non-terminals that produce multiple terminals.\n\nLet me find which NTs produce multiple 't' tokens. For example:\n\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63, which are nt52 and nt63. Looking at the rules, nt52 -> 't2' and nt63 -> 't1', so NT66 would produce 't2 t1'.\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62, which is nt84 (which is nt4 nt1 -> 't1 t1') and nt62 (nt52 nt63 -> 't2 t1'), so NT64 would produce 't1 t1 t2 t1'.\n- NT97 -> NT43 NT75. NT43 is 't0' and NT75 is 't3', so that's 't0 t3'.\n- NT74 -> NT33 NT27, which are 't1' and 't4', because NT33 is 't1' and NT27 is NT24 NT62. NT24 is 't4' and NT62 is 't2 t1', so actually, NT27 is 't4 t2 t1'. So NT74 would be 't1 t4 t2 t1'.\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern in the strings that can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for parts of the string that match some NT productions.\n\nLet's look at the string's initial part: t1 t1 t4 t4 t4 t3 t1 t1 t2 t1 t0...\n\nThe first two 't1's could come from NT64, which is 't1 t1 t2 t1'? Wait, no, because looking back, NT64 is NT84 and NT62. NT84 is NT47 and NT64, which is 't1' and another 't1' perhaps. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating.\n\nWait, let's clarify each NT's production into terminals. Let me make a list of the NTs and what each can produce:\n\n- NT47: 't1' (from the rules, nt47 can be 't1' in some productions)\n- NT66: 't2 t1'\n- NT84: 't1 t1' (since nt84 is nt47 and nt1, and nt47 can be 't1', nt1 is 't1' from the NT rules)\n- So, NT84 would be 't1 t1'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT35: 't3' (from rule NT35 -> 't3').\n\nNT77: 't2' (since nt77 is 't2').\n\nNT96: 't4' (because NT96 is 't4').\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me make a table for each non-terminal and their possible terminal sequences:\n\nLooking at the rules, I'll list the NT and their possible terminal sequences when they terminate directly or through other NTs.\n\n- NT47: NT47 can directly be 't1' in multiple places. So, in some cases, NT47 is 't1'. So, it's a terminal in some scenarios.\n\n- NT66: NT66 -> NT52 NT63. NT52 -> 't2' and NT63 -> 't1', so overall, 't2 t1'.\n\n- NT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. NT84 is 't1 t1' (as it's NT47 and NT1, both 't1'), and NT62 -> 't2 t1', so overall NT64 is 't1 t1 t2 t1'.\n\nWait, but NT47 is 't1' in one rule, but in the NT64 case, when NT84 expands, it would produce 't1 t1' because NT47 is 't1' and NT1 is 't1'. So NT64 would produce 't1 t1 t2 t1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 -> 't4'.\n\nLooking again at the string:\n\nt1 t1 t4 t4 t4 t3 t1 t1 t2 t1 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t4 t2 t0.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\n1. t1 t1: Could be NT64 (which is 't1 t1 t2 t1'), but that has more tokens. Alternatively, t1 t1 might be two NT47s, each being 't1', so 't1 t1' would be NT47 NT47.\n\n2. Then t4 t4 t4: So 't4 t4 t4'. Each 't4' could be from various NTs. Let's check which NTs produce 't4' directly. Looking at the rules, 't4' is produced by several NTs, such as NT12 (NT12 is 't4'), NT1 (but NT1 is 't2'), NT24 (if NT24 is 't4'?), wait no: NT24 is 't4' because from the rules, NT24 -> 't4'. NT24 is 't4'.\n\nWait, no, the NT24 rule says NT24 is 't4'. So if I have 't4 t4 t4', maybe it's NT24 NT24 NT24.\n\nBut in terms of the grammar, the NTs can only split into two parts each. So perhaps not possible. Alternatively, 't4' can come from NT84, which is 't1 t1', but that doesn't produce 't4'.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: each step in the derivation would split a non-terminal into two parts, replacing one non-terminal with two. So starting at S, which can produce three different pairs. Let's try each possibility.\n\nFirst possibility: S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 is 't1 t1 t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-332","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It's presented with a bunch of productions. The right-hand sides are either other non-terminals or terminals (like t0, t1, etc.). I see that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, so those are the leaf nodes in parsing.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t0 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t3 t0 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t1 t1 t2 t3 t0`. That's a sequence of 18 tokens, all of which are either t0, t1, t3, t2, t4. I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nMy approach might be to start from the start symbol S and see if I can expand it step by step to match the string. Alternatively, maybe I can perform a top-down or bottom-up parsing. But given the string, perhaps a top-down approach starting from S would be feasible, though it might get complicated.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, from the given grammar, S has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the first step is to pick one of these and see if the string starts with the symbols produced by NT64 and NT96, or NT97 and NT7, etc.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of 't's, so perhaps I need to look at how each non-terminal can produce a 't' or another non-terminal.\n\nLet me list out all the productions for each non-terminal:\n\nStarting with NT64:\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT4 \u2192 t1\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\n\nNT68 \u2192 't4' or other?\n\nWait, looking back, some of the productions have 't_x' as their RHS. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT96 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't4'? Or is it 't4' in more than one place?\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out each non-terminal's expansion as a tree.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to create a parse tree for the given string and see if it can be built according to the grammar.\n\nBut maybe that's time-consuming. Alternatively, since the string has 18 tokens, I can think about the number of steps needed.\n\nEach production either expands a non-terminal into two others or into a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parse tree will split into two symbols until they reach terminals.\n\nGiven that the start symbol S is a non-terminal, the first step would split into two non-terminals, and so on. The number of symbols in the derived string should be 2^n, where n is the number of splits, but in this case, the given string has 18 symbols, which is not a power of two minus one (since n steps would give 2^n -1 symbols). Hmm, 18 is not a power of two minus one, so perhaps this string cannot be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, let me think. If n is the number of symbols, then in a derivation starting from S, the number of symbols (terminals and non-terminals) would be 2^n -1, where n is the number of steps. Since the start symbol S is one node, each step replaces a node with two, so after k steps, the total number of nodes is 2^k -1, which must be equal to the number of symbols in the string (including all non-terminals). But in this problem, the given string has only terminal symbols. So, the derivation must have fully expanded all non-terminals into terminals, meaning that the number of terminals must be 2^k = (number of terminal symbols). So, if the string has m terminal symbols, m must be 2^k for some k.\n\nLooking at the string, the length is 18 terminals. 18 is not a power of two. The closest powers of two are 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). So, 18 is not a valid number of terminals, which implies that this string cannot be generated by the grammar because it doesn't fit the required structure of a derivation ending in a string of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the non-terminals can contribute to the count. Wait, no, because the given string is all terminals. So, the number of terminals should be 1 less than a power of two (since each non-terminal split doubles the number of symbols). Wait no, let me correct that. Each step where a non-terminal is split replaces one symbol with two, so the initial count is 1 (S). After k splits, the count is 1 + k*(number of splits). Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of symbols in the parse tree.\n\nIn a derivation where all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, the number of terminal symbols is 2^n -1, where n is the number of non-terminals in the parse tree. Wait, no, actually, each split increases the count by one. Starting from 1 node (S), each split (into two) increases the count by one each time a non-terminal is split.\n\nWait, to get m terminals, the number of splits needed is m-1. For example, to get 2 terminals, you need 1 split. 3 terminals after 2 splits, and so on. So, 18 terminals would require 17 splits. But wait, 17 splits would mean that the parse tree has a depth of 17, leading to 2^17 -1 symbols, which is way more than 18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. Let's clarify.\n\nEach time a non-terminal is expanded, it's replaced by two symbols. If all non-terminals are expanded to terminals, the total number of terminals is the number of leaves in the parse tree. The number of leaves is equal to 2^d, where d is the depth of the tree. So, the number of terminals must be a power of two.\n\nIn this case, 18 is not a power of two, so it's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: let's see if the grammar can produce such a string. Maybe trying to find a way to construct the string from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t0 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t3 t0 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t1 t1 t2 t3 t0.\n\nI notice that many terminals are t0, t1, etc. Let's see which non-terminals can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, the only non-terminals that produce terminals are NT1, NT3, NT4, etc. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t4\n\nNT1 \u2192 t2\n\nNT97 \u2192 t2\n\nNT47 \u2192 t4 (multiple productions)\n\nNT62 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Perhaps my earlier reasoning about the number of terminals being 18, which isn't a power of two, is correct.\n\nSo, the number of terminals must be 2^n for some n, so 18 isn't, thus the answer is No.\n\nWait, let me double-check that reasoning. Because in Chomsky normal form, each step expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the number of symbols (terminals + non-terminals) in the sentential form increases with each step. However, since we end up with all terminals, the derivation must have fully expanded all non-terminals. The number of terminals in such a case is 2^k, where k is the number of times a non-terminal was split into terminals. But 18 is not a power of 2, so it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 18 terminals, which is not a power of two, so it cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-355","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check. The string is \"t0 t3 t2 t2 t2 t2 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t2 t1 t3 t2 t3 t0 t2 t0\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means every production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided indeed only has productions that fit into CNF since each production has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal followed by non-terminals on the right. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, the terminals appear on the right side, but only single terminals. So each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nNow, my string is a sequence of terminals starting with t0 and ending with t0. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do that, I'll probably need to use a top-down parsing approach, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can derive the string by expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals according to the production rules. Alternatively, I can check if the string can be matched by the grammar using a recursive descent approach or some other method.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT64 NT96. That's the start. So S expands into NT64 and NT96. Both are non-terminals. So the first step is to split the string into parts that correspond to each non-terminal's expansion.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in CF grammars, each production leads to a tree, and the entire string must be formed by expanding all non-terminals until only terminals remain. So, for the string t0 t3 t2 t2 t2 t2 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t2 t1 t3 t2 t3 t0 t2 t0, I can imagine building a parse tree starting from S.\n\nLet me see, the start symbol S is NT64 NT96. So the first step is to split the string into two parts: one part that corresponds to NT64 and another to NT96. So the entire string must be split into two sub-strings, one derived from NT64 and the other from NT96. \n\nLet's try to split the string: The first part must come from NT64, and the second from NT96. Now, looking at the productions for NT64, from the grammar:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nSo NT64 must expand into NT84 and NT62. Both are non-terminals. Now, I'll need to split the first part of the string into two: one from NT84 and one from NT62. \n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. So NT96 must expand into NT54 and NT53. \n\nSo the string must be divided into four parts: NT84, NT62, NT54, NT53. Let's see:\n\nThe entire string is t0 t3 t2 t2 t2 t2 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t2 t1 t3 t2 t3 t0 t2 t0.\n\nSplitting into four parts, the first part is for NT84, which we'll get some initial segment, then NT62, next NT54, then NT53.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. Let's try to recursively parse the string starting from S.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nSo we start by expecting the first part to be derived from NT64 and the second from NT96.\n\n2. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So now, split the string into NT84 and NT62.\n\n3. NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. So NT84 splits into NT4 and NT1.\n\n4. NT4 \u2192 't1' (terminal). So NT4 produces t1. That's a match.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first element is t0, not t1. So that's a problem. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for where a production results in t0. Let's check where t0 is defined. Looking at the grammar rules, t0 appears as:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see t0 directly. Wait, no: Wait, in the provided rules, I think the string for NT97 is 't0', and perhaps others. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, under NT47: NT47 \u2192 't1'\n\nLooking at NT68: NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12. NT47 is 't1', so NT68 \u2192 t1 and NT12. NT12 \u2192 t3. So NT68 would produce t1 t3, which is t1 t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27. NT34 \u2192 't4', and NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62. NT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70. So this path is getting complex.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, let's see:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, no, actually looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, several NT productions lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through all the given NT productions, the ones that produce terminals are, for example:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nBut wait, in the given list:\n\nLooking for where NT leads to a single 't' terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules provided:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't immediately see all the NT rules, but for example:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, no.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which seems to be S.

{"custom_id":"request-379","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t0 t2 t0 t3 t3 t0 t4 t2 t2 t0 t1 t4 t3 t2 t1 t2 t1 t1 t1 t2` is generated by this grammar. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means that each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The grammar given seems a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals, but let's see if I can break it down.\n\nI notice that some of the non-terminals like NT47, NT48, etc., have productions that either lead to terminals (like 't0', 't1') or other non-terminals. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S and the initial productions:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nI'll need to choose which production to use. Maybe I'll start by trying the first one, S -> NT64 NT96, and see if I can derive the string from there.\n\nLooking at NT64's production: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. So NT64 expands into two non-terminals. Let's see NT84: NT84 -> NT4 NT1, which are both non-terminals. NT4 isn't defined further, but NT1 is a terminal ('t2'). Wait, NT1 is 't2'.\n\nSo, expanding NT64: NT84 and NT62.\n\nNow, NT84 expands to NT4 and NT1. NT4 isn't a terminal; perhaps it can be further expanded. Wait, NT4 isn't on the right side of any production I see. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT4. Hmm, that's a problem. That suggests that NT4 might be a dead end, maybe a problem in the current path. Alternatively, perhaps I chose the wrong initial production.\n\nLet me try a different initial production. Let's take S -> NT97 NT7. NT97 -> NT43 NT75. And NT7 -> NT66 NT48.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Maybe I should build a parse tree for the string to see if each node can be matched by the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach or recursive descent could help, but that might be time-consuming. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if there's a way the non-terminals can expand into this sequence.\n\nLet me see how the string starts. The first symbol is t0. Let's look for non-terminals that can produce t0. From the rules, I see NT68 -> t0, NT66 -> t4, NT73 -> ... Wait, maybe looking through all the non-terminals and seeing which produce which terminals.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and note which terminals they can produce:\n\n- NT68: t0, t3, t4, t1\n- NT66: t4\n- NT54: t1, t3, t0\n- NT1: t2\n- NT48: t1\n- NT33: t1, t0\n- NT5: t2\n- NT21: t4\n- NT52: t2\n- NT43: t0\n- NT53: t2\n- NT84: t2, t0\n- NT35: t3\n- NT78: t0\n- NT77: t2\n- NT7: t2\n- NT82: t4\n- NT96: t4, t3, t4\n- NT12: t3\n- NT98: t1, t0, t2\n- NT74: t3\n- NT39: t0, t3\n- NT24: t4\n- NT97: t2, t0\n- NT5: t2\n- NT27: t2\n- NT3: t0, t2\n- NT68: t3, t0, t4, t1\n- NT1: t2\n- NT48: t1\n- NT98: t1\n- NT77: t3\n- NT96: t4\n- NT47: t4, t1\n- NT68: t2\n- NT97: t2\n- NT53: t2, t2\n- NT84: t0\n- NT34: t4\n- NT96: t3\n\nWait, this seems messy. Maybe I should try building a parse tree from the start symbol S and see if the string can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps checking the symbols step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t0. Let's see which NTs produce t0:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT68 can produce t0. So perhaps the first part of the expansion is NT68. So, starting with S -> NT68... Wait, no, S doesn't go directly to NT68. S's productions are NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, NT35 NT84. So S can't produce t0 directly.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake. If S doesn't expand to a terminal directly, maybe the initial step must be one of those three productions. So I need to see if the string can be derived from any of those.\n\nLet me try the first production: S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1.\n\nNow, NT4 is a symbol I don't see in the rules. Did I miss it? Checking the rules again: I think I only see productions up to NT98 and some NT prefixes. So NT4 doesn't have any further productions. Hmm, that would mean this path leads to a dead end because NT84 can't produce more symbols. So maybe this path isn't the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT1 can produce a terminal, but in the string, after t0, the next symbol is t2, so perhaps I need to see if NT84 can produce something else. Wait, NT84 can also go to NT96 and NT0? No, looking back, NT84's productions are NT4 NT1 and also maybe NT5 NT3, but I don't see that. Wait, in the given rules, looking for NT84:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1, and that's it. So from NT84, we get NT4 and NT1. But NT4 doesn't expand. So S -> NT64 NT96 would lead to NT96. Let me check NT96's productions.\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53, and possibly other options. NT54 includes t0, t1, t3, t4. So maybe I can get a t0 from NT54, but then we still have NT53, which needs to expand.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try another initial production. Let's try S -> NT97 NT7.\n\nNT97: NT43 NT75, and NT7: NT66 NT48.\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63. NT52's production is NT22 NT45. Wait, NT22 isn't defined, but maybe NT63 is.\n\nNT63 -> 't4' according to the rules. So that's a terminal.\n\nSo let's chart this:\n\nS -> NT97 NT7\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75. Let's see what NT43 and NT75 produce.\n\nNT43: I don't see any production for NT43 in the given rules. So this path might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT97 can produce something else. Wait, looking again at NT97's production: NT68 NT39.\n\nAh, right. I think I missed that earlier. NT97 -> NT68 NT39.\n\nSo S -> NT97 NT7 can expand to NT68 NT39 NT7.\n\nNow, NT68 can produce t0, t1, t3, t4, or other things.\n\nWait, the string starts with t0. So perhaps NT68 can produce t0. So let's see:\n\nS -> NT97 NT7 \u2192 NT68 NT39 NT7.\n\nBut that's getting a bit complex. Maybe I should try building a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a list and try to break it down from the start symbol.\n\nLet me try another approach: the string is t0 t2 t0 t3 t3 t0 t4 t2 t2 t0 t1 t4 t3 t2 t1 t2 t1 t1 t1 t2.\n\nI'll go through each symbol"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, all the rules here fit that because each S production has two non-terminals, and other rules are non-terminals expanding into two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe given grammar has a start symbol S which produces NT64 NT96, etc. Each production is in CNF, which is good because it allows us to parse the string using a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if I should be using CYK here because the string is pretty long. Maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to construct the parse tree starting from S and see if it can derive the given string. Let's see.\n\nThe string starts with `t2 t2 t1 t4 ...`, which are a series of terminals. Each `tX` corresponds to certain terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some symbols expand into terminals, others into non-terminals. For example, NT64 -> 't4', NT35 -> 't3', and so on. Each NT symbol either expands to two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo, to process the string, each step in the parse tree must match a production rule of the grammar. \n\nLet me think about the structure. The start symbol S on the left has two children: NT64 and NT96. Each of these NTs will expand into some symbols.\n\nLooking at NT64, its production rules are:\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT64 -> NT12 NT3\n- NT64 -> NT52 NT63\n\nSo, NT64 expands into combinations like NT84 and NT62, etc. Similarly, NT96's production is:\n- NT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nSo, NT96 expands into NT54 and NT53.\n\nNow, let's track the string.

{"custom_id":"request-392","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string I need to evaluate is `t4 t3 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2 t4 t2 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t2 t0 t4 t4 t4 t2`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the productions fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which breaks down S into two non-terminals. Other productions like NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3 are also two non-terminals. There are some productions where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal, like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, but wait, that's two non-terminals, not a terminal. Oh, looking closer, some seem to directly go to terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't0'. So each production either expands into two non-terminals or directly to a terminal.\n\nNow, the input string consists of 21 tokens: t4, t3, t3, t2, t0, t0, t4, t2, t4, t2, t4, t3, t4, t3, t1, t2, t0, t4, t4, t4, t2. I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But maybe I can approach this step by step.\n\nThe main steps are:\n1. Identify the start symbol, which is S.\n2. The top-level productions are S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So the first two symbols of the string must come from one of these options.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t4. So I need to find which production of NT could produce a t4. Looking through the grammar, NT64 produces t4, as seen in NT64 \u2192 t4. So if the first production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then the first part is covered by NT64. Then the next symbol must come from NT96.\n\nSo the second token is t3. Checking NT96's productions, I see NT96 \u2192 t4, but that's a terminal. Or, what about NT96's rules: I see NT96 \u2192 t4, but perhaps there's a longer production? Wait, looking back, NT96 is rewritten as:\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's written as:\nNT96 \u2192 t4 (which is a terminal), or perhaps there might be longer productions? Wait, no, in the given productions, I see NT96 \u2192 t4. So NT96 can only produce t4. Therefore, if the second token is t3, it can't come from NT96, which can only produce t4. So S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would not work because the second token is t3, but NT96 can only produce t4.\n\nTherefore, maybe the first production isn't S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Let's check other options. Next is S \u2192 NT35 NT84. Looking at NT35 \u2192 t3. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, there's a production NT35 \u2192 t3, yes, so NT35 can directly produce t3. So perhaps the first two symbols are t3 (from NT35) and then something from NT84.\n\nWait, no. The first token is t4. So let's try S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So first symbol t4 is from NT64, as I thought. So the second symbol must come from NT96, which can only produce t4, but our second symbol is t3. That's a problem. So perhaps S \u2192 NT64 NT96 isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT7 could be considered. Looking at NT97's productions. Wait, in the grammar, there is NT97 \u2192 t2 or something? Let me check: NT97 \u2192 t2. So if S uses this production, the first symbol would be t2, but our first token is t4, so that's not matching.\n\nNext, let's try S \u2192 NT35 NT84. Looking at NT35: NT35 \u2192 t3. So the first token is t3, but we need t4, so that doesn't work either.\n\nHmm, this suggests that maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the grammar. Are there any other productions from S that could start with a longer sequence? Or perhaps I misread S's productions.\n\nLooking again, S has three options:\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nNone of these seem to directly start with t3 or t2, except for maybe NT97 \u2192 t2 or NT64 \u2192 t4. So the only way to start with t4 is via NT64. Therefore, S must produce NT64 NT96, leading the string to start with t4 followed by (whatever NT96 can produce).\n\nBut NT96 can only produce t4, so the second token would have to be t4, but in the string, it's t3. This seems like a dead end. Wait a minute, perhaps I'm missing a longer production for NT96? Let me check again. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any longer productions for NT96 beyond t4. So NT96 is directly t4.\n\nSo if the first two tokens are t4 and t3, it's impossible under S \u2192 NT64 NT96 because the second token has to be t4. So maybe the grammar doesn't generate this string, which would mean the answer is No. But I should make sure I didn't miss another production.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a more complex path. Let me think: Maybe the string could be derived through a series of intermediate steps beyond just S \u2192 NT64 NT96. For example, perhaps there's a way to produce the whole string using other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t4, which is from NT64, but the second token t3 comes from somewhere else. Could NT64 somehow produce t4 and the next step involve NT96 expanding into multiple non-terminals, perhaps through intermediates?\n\nLet me take a step back. Instead of trying to parse the entire string at once, perhaps I should check if t4 can be derived from NT64, then see what NT96 produces. But since NT96 can only produce t4, the second token can't be t3. So that suggests that the string doesn't start with t4 t3, so the grammar can't generate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another production for S that starts differently, but I don't see any. S has three options, and none seem to start with t3 or t2 immediately except for if I consider multi-token expansions, which I don't think apply here.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions start with a single non-terminal. So each step in the derivation consumes one non-terminal and expands it into two. The total number of terminals in the string should be equal to the number of non-terminals in the derivation steps.\n\nThe string has 21 tokens, meaning the derivation starts with S and applies 21-1=20 steps. But perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the sequence of terminals and see if they can be generated by following a series of productions. Starting with S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nSo first step: S \u2192 NT64 NT96 \u2192 t4 [NT96]\n\nBut then NT96 can only produce t4, so the second token would have to be t4, but it's t3. So that path can't be taken.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nFirst token: NT97 \u2192 t2, but the string starts with t4.\n\nOption 3: S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3 (so first token would be t3, but the string starts with t4). So none of the initial productions from S can match the string's beginning.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t4, which can only be produced by NT64, but then NT96 can't produce t3. So the string cannot be generated by this grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar has a start symbol S, and the productions are all either two symbols on the right-hand side or terminal symbols 't0', 't1', etc. Each production is in the form of two non-terminals except when a non-terminal directly becomes a 't' symbol. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, it's structured such that each production produces two other symbols, which can either be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of these t symbols: t1 t0 t4 t4 t2 t0 t4 t2 t1 t0 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t3 t2 t1 t2 t1. It's made up of t's with subscripts, so I think each 't' represents the terminal symbol at that position.\n\nFirst, I notice that the length of the string has 21 symbols. Since each production in the grammar produces two symbols, the length of the derived string is 2^(n-1) where n is the number of symbols in the string. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the number of symbols after each production step can increase exponentially. But this string is 21 symbols, which might suggest that the derivation took (log2(21)) steps, but that's not directly useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more straightforward is to model this as a parse tree where the root is S and each node is a production. Each application of a production takes a node and splits it into two children, according to the production rule.\n\nLooking at the given string, let's list the t's in order: 1,0,4,4,2,0,4,2,1,0,3,3,4,4,4,4,3,2,1,2,1.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. That is, see if the string can be divided into substrings according to the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the production rules where the right-hand side is two terminals. Or, more accurately, each production in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 x, where x is a terminal.\n\nWait, no. The grammar is given as a set of rules where S \u2192 NTxxx NTyyy, and NT rules have two non-terminals on the RHS as well. But some NT rules have a terminal on one of the RHS symbols.

I think the key here is to note that the grammar has a number of rules where a non-terminal (NTxy) is directly mapped to a terminal symbol. For example, NT63 \u2192 't1', NT47 \u2192 't1' (twice), etc.\n\nSo the strategy is to parse the given string by matching the t's with the NT rules that have a 't' as a terminal.\n\nLet me list all the NT rules that produce a single terminal:\n\nLooking through the rules, here's a list of NT rules that have a terminal as the RHS symbol:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1' (appears twice)\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0' (appears three times?)\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1' (appears twice? Wait, in the initial list, NT47 is written twice, but I think that's a typo. Let me check.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar rules in a list, possibly with duplicates. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nI see NT47 appears multiple times. For example:\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\n\nNT47 -> 't1'\n\nWait, but in the given rules, some instances of NT47 produce a terminal. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the first occurrence of NT47 is production 1: NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3. Then later in the list, there's another production for NT47: 'NT47 -> 't1'', so perhaps it's a mistake in the user's input, but looking at the last lines of the grammar:\n\n... and then:\n\nNT47 -> 't1'\n\nWait, in the list, there are several NT47 rules. This might be a mistake because in Chomsky normal form, each production should be unique. So perhaps the user duplicated some rules. But for the purpose of parsing, perhaps each rule is unique.\n\nBut for now, I can proceed by noting that some of the rules for NT produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo for NT63, it produces 't1'; NT47 \u2192 't1'; NT68 \u2192 't0'; NT98 \u2192 't1'; NT86 \u2192 't0'; NT97 \u2192 't2'; NT77 \u2192 't2'; NT35 \u2192 't3'; NT98 \u2192 't0'; etc.\n\nEach time when an NT symbol is directly converted to a terminal, that allows us to replace that NT in the derivation with that terminal.\n\nSo, the string is 21 t's. Since each application of a production in the grammar produces two symbols, the minimum number of steps to reach 21 symbols is such that 2^m >= 21, so m=5, 2^5=32. But parsing in this way is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach the problem by checking if the string can be produced by the grammar starting from S and applying the productions.\n\nGiven the string, let's see if it can be built from the terminals using the rules.\n\nStarting from S, which is S \u2192 NT64 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-411","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and I have several productions leading from S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t2 t4 t1 t0 t3 t0 t3 t1 t4 t2 t0 t0 t1 t2 t3 t3 t0 t3 t1 t3 t4 t2`. Since this string is a sequence of symbols, I suspect that each symbol corresponds to a production rule application.\n\nI think the approach here is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar through a series of derivations. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, it might correspond to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and the string can be checked using the automaton.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice some terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT47 can produce 't1' or another NT. But the string has various t's, so I need to see if there's a way to derive these t's step by step.\n\nI'll start with the start symbol S. S has three productions: NT64 and NT96, NT97 and NT7, NT35 and NT84. Wait, actually S -> NT64 NT96, S -> NT97 NT7, and S -> NT35 NT84.\n\nSo each S production combines two non-terminals, which need to be expanded further. Each production leads to two non-terminals, which in turn produce more symbols until we get terminal symbols.\n\nI think it's best to model this as a tree. The string is 21 symbols long, which suggests that each production is used once, but since it's a leftmost derivation, perhaps multiple steps are needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar can be converted into an automaton where each non-terminal represents a state, and the productions define transitions on terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see which non-terminals produce which t's:\n\nNT47 can be 't1' or 't1' (since two rules have NT47 -> 't1'), wait, no, looking back, perhaps some non-terminals have multiple rules. Wait, looking at the given productions:\n\n- NT47 -> 't1' (appears twice: line 16 and 10)\n- NT62 -> 't0' (appears as a terminal in several lines)\n- NT3 -> 't0' and 't2' (appears multiple times)\n- Similarly for others.\n\nSo the terminals are 't0', 't1', 't2', etc. The string provided is a sequence of these 't's.\n\nI think the approach is to see if the string can be matched by starting from S and expanding according to the rules.\n\nSince the string starts with 't2', let's see which non-terminals produce 't2' when they're on the left.\n\nLooking at the productions, some produce 't2':\n\n- NT52 -> 't2' (line 25: NT52 -> 't2')\n- NT74 -> 't2' (line 30)\n- NT86 -> 't0'\n- NT22 -> 't4'\n- NT77 -> 't2' (line 38)\n- NT7 -> 't2' (line 5)\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- Others?\n\nWait, in line 5, NT7 -> 't2', so if I can get to NT7, then the terminal would be 't2'. But wait, no\u2014looking at the productions, NT7 is on the left side, but when it's a rule, like NT7 -> some NT's, except in one case where NT48 -> 't1', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to model this as a state machine. Each non-terminal is a state, and the transitions are determined by the productions. The problem is that each production has either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. So, for each rule, if the rule is A -> BC, then from state A on input B, you transition to C. Or if it's A -> aC, then from A on input a, you transition to C.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, most productions have either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal followed by another non-terminal. For example, NT47 -> 't1' or another NT. But some have two NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for an automaton where each state is a non-terminal, and transitions are determined by the rules. Each production can represent a transition on terminal symbols.\n\nFor example, for a production A \u2192 a B, it would mean that from state A, on input a, you can transition to state B.\n\nSimilarly, a production A \u2192 B C would mean that from A on the input symbol which is the first symbol of B's output, you can transition, but since B may produce a string, perhaps we need to look for a unique terminal.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar can be used to build a pushdown automaton (PDA), where the stack corresponds to non-terminals, and the input is the string to parse.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, it should correspond to a deterministic PDA, which can be checked for emptiness.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the best way is to try to parse the string step by step, applying the grammar's productions.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string's t's indicate transitions between non-terminals, and we can model the possible paths through the grammar.\n\nLet me see the string again: t2 t4 t1 t0 t3 t0 t3 t1 t4 t2 t0 t0 t1 t2 t3 t3 t0 t3 t1 t3 t4 t2.\n\nI'll write down the sequence of t's for clarity:\n\n1. t2\n2. t4\n3. t1\n4. t0\n5. t3\n6. t0\n7. t3\n8. t1\n9. t4\n10. t2\n11. t0\n12. t0\n13. t1\n14. t2\n15. t3\n16. t3\n17. t0\n18. t3\n19. t1\n20. t3\n21. t4\n22. t2\n\nWait, in the string provided, I think I might have made a mistake in counting.

{"custom_id":"request-415","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes things a bit easier because each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and the production rules for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo S can be replaced by any of these combinations. Each of these combinations will then be broken down further using the other production rules until we reach terminal symbols (those with arrows pointing to 't0', 't1', etc.) or non-terminals that are defined.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t2 t1 t3 t1 t2 t1 t1 t1 t1 t4 t2 t3 t0 t3 t4 t2 t2 t3 t2 t1 t3 t2`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string. Let me see. The first step is to see if the string can be split into the parts generated by S. Looking at S's productions, the first step would be to see if the entire string starts with any of NT64, NT97, or NT35 followed by NT96, NT7, or NT84.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to approach this by working backwards. Sometimes top-down parsing is done by looking at the terminals and seeing if they fit the rule's right-hand side.\n\nLet me list the terminal tokens from the string, each separated by spaces:\n\n[t2, t1, t3, t1, t2, t1, t1, t1, t1, t4, t2, t3, t0, t3, t4, t2, t2, t3, t2, t1, t3, t2]\n\nI'll try to parse this string from the start using the grammar rules. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can use recursive descent parsing. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into parts according to the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with S, the first rule for S is NT64 NT96. So the string must start with NT64 followed by NT96. Let's see if the first part of the string matches NT64 and then NT96.\n\nLooking at the first part, does the string start with NT64? Let's check the grammar rules to see what NT64 produces. Checking the given rules:\n\nLooking for NT64: \n\nFound NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT64 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by NT84 followed by NT62. Let's see what those produce.\n\nFirst, NT84 has a rule: NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. So NT84 is replaced by NT4 and NT1. Now, NT4 is another non-terminal, which has a rule NT4 \u2192 't1'. So NT4 is replaced by 't1'.\n\nThen, NT1 has the rule NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. So NT1 is replaced by NT5 and NT77. Let's break these down.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3, and NT68 \u2192 't0', NT3 \u2192 't0'. So NT5 \u2192 't0' 't0' \u2192 't0 t0'.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT77's rule is NT33, wait no: NT77 \u2192 't2'? Wait no, looking back at the rules:\n\nWait, for NT77, looking back:\n\nNT77 appears in several places. Wait, the rules listed are:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT47 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 't2' (but I might have misread that). Wait, the list seems complicated. Let me check:\n\nActually, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't2' (from multiple rules, like S\u2192NT77 NT3 ... but maybe that's a typo. Wait, let me list the rules properly, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT77 is not directly given, but looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT77 appears in NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75 and other places.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the given rules step by step.\n\nThe list of rules seems extensive. Let me see: I'll go through each line and note the right-hand sides.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the first symbols of the string. The string starts with t2, t1.\n\nBut to parse, we'll have to see if the string starts with a combination of symbols that could be derived from S's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to check if the given string can be broken down into non-terminals that have production rules matching the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's getting complicated. Alternatively, since this is a top-down approach, let's try to apply the productions to the string.\n\nLet me see if the entire string can be produced by any of the S's expansions.\n\nS's possible expansions are:\n\n1. NT64 NT96\n2. NT97 NT7\n3. NT35 NT84\n\nSo the string must start with NT64 followed by NT96, or NT97 followed by NT7, or NT35 followed by NT84.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t2. So let's check each possibility:\n\n1. If the first is NT64 (which becomes t1 t1 t0), but the first symbol is t2, so that's a possible match? Wait, no, because NT64 is replaced by NT84 NT62, which then split into NT4 (t1) and NT1 (which is NT5 NT77). Then NT5 is 't0' 't0', and NT77 \u2192 let's see, maybe it's 't2'? If so, then NT64 would produce t1 followed by t0 t0 t2? Wait, that's getting messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial token t2 indicates the start of a particular production. Let's see:\n\nLooking for production rules that start with t2. Looking at the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't2' (does it? Let me check)\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT77 has rules like NT77 \u2192 't2', etc. Wait, let me verify:\n\nYes, there's a rule: NT77 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial NT77 is replaced by 't2', so the first symbol being t2 could be NT77.\n\nWait, but the problem is the string starts with t2, but the start symbol is S, which is based on NT64 etc., not directly on these terminal symbols.\n\nSo perhaps another approach is to work backwards from each possible start.\n\nLet me try the first option: Does the string start with NT64 NT96?\n\nIf so, then the first part would be NT64, which is replaced by NT84 NT62. Then NT84 is replaced by NT4 NT1 \u2192 t1 t1. Then NT1 is replaced by NT5 NT77 \u2192 which is 't0' 't0' plus NT77 \u2192 't2'. So NT1 becomes 't0 t0 t2' \u2192 so NT84 is t1 t1 t0 t0 t2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's structure it step by step.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for each possible production and see if the string can be split into the required parts.\n\nFirst, test if the string can be split using the first rule S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nSo check if the string starts with NT64 followed by NT96.\n\nBreaking down NT64:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 \u2192 t1 NT1.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77 \u2192 't0' NT77.\n\nNow, NT77 \u2192 't2' (from rule NT77 \u2192 t2).\n\nSo NT1 \u2192 't0 t2'.\n\nThen NT84 becomes 't1 t0 t2'.\n\nAnd NT64 becomes NT84 followed by NT62.\n\nNT62 \u2192 't0' (from its production).\n\nSo NT64 \u2192 't1 t0 t2 t0'.\n\nSo combining: S \u2192 NT64 NT96 becomes 't1 t0 t2 t0' followed by NT96.\n\nNow, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't1' (from rule NT54 \u2192 t1).\n\nNT53 \u2192 ... looking at the rules, NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33.\n\nNT86 \u2192 't0'.\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo NT53 \u2192 't0 t1'.\n\nThus, NT96 \u2192 't1 t0 t1'.\n\nPutting it all together, S \u2192 NT64 NT96 \u2192 't1 t0 t2 t0' 't1 t0 t1'.\n\nSo the output would start with t1 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-438","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to understand what I need to do step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what I know about Chomsky Normal Form. CNF is a specific form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier because each production either introduces the terminal directly or two non-terminals. Also, in CNF, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the productions are all in the form of A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, which starts at the top with S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the derivation starts from S, which expands into NT64 and NT96. Each of these is a non-terminal, so I'll need to find their productions.\n\nMy approach is to try to build the string step by step, starting from S and trying to match the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, at each step, a non-terminal will produce exactly two components, which could be either non-terminals or terminals. So I'll break down the problem by seeing how each part of the string can be derived.\n\nThe given string is: `t1 t4 t4 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t1 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t3 t1 t0 t3`.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from the grammar. Let's list each non-terminal and the productions they have. For each non-terminal, I can write down the rules. For example, NT1 can go to NT5 NT77 or 't2'. Wait, but looking at the given grammar, the productions for NT1 are:\n\nNT1 -> NT5 NT77\nNT1 -> 't2'\n\nAlso, looking at NT3, it can produce 't0' and also NT22 NT74 and NT5 NT77. Hmm, this might get complicated as there are multiple options.\n\nI think I need to model the derivation as a tree, expanding S and then each non-terminal, keeping track of how the 't's are produced. Given the length of the string (21 tokens), I need to see if it can be broken down correctly.\n\nLet me start by writing down the top-level (S):\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nSo the first two symbols are 't's from NT64 and NT96. Let me look at what NT64 and NT96 produce.\n\nLooking up NT64:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nBut NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nAnd NT62 \u2192 NT38 NT70?\n\nWait, no, let's get this right. Since this is a tree, I can choose which production to take at each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to model each non-terminal's possible terminal outputs when expanded. Each non-terminal N can be thought of as a sequence of terminals (through production chains) that it can generate.\n\nBut this might take too long manually, especially given the length. Instead, perhaps I can look for which non-terminals can produce the required 't's in the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the entire string as a concatenation of the productions, ensuring that the order of t's matches.\n\nBut another approach is to look for patterns in the string and see if they can be broken down into the non-terminals' productions.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to proceed by starting with the first t1. Looking at the string, it starts with 't1', so I need to see if the initial symbols lead to that.\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96. Let's see what NT64 can produce. NT64's rule is NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nLooking at NT84's rules: NT84 \u2192 't2' or NT4 NT1.\n\nWait, but NT84 has two productions: NT84 \u2192 't2' [from the given data] and NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nSimilarly, NT62's rule is NT62 \u2192 NT38 NT70? Wait, no, I think I need to look back.\n\nWait, perhaps the first NT64 expands to NT84 and NT62.\n\nLooking at NT64's productions:\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96\nOther lines:\n\nLooking for NT64:\n\nIn the data, I see:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nSo NT64 can produce NT84 and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT96's rules:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\nNT54 \u2192 't4' [from line 10: NT54 \u2192 't4']\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33 [line 13: NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33]\nAnd NT53 also has other rules: line 15: NT53 \u2192 NT80 NT81 and line 34: NT70 \u2192 NT84 NT36, etc. Wait, perhaps I should list all rules for each non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to list all productions for each non-terminal. This will help me see the possible expansions.\n\nList of non-terminals: S, NT1, NT3, NT4, NT64, NT96, etc. I'll list their productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3 (line 4) and NT1 NT62 (line 19)\n3. NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 (line 2)\n4. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 (line 1)\n5. NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33 (line13), NT80 NT81 (line34), NT39 NT80 (line39), NT78 NT14 (line25), and others?\nWait, maybe it's better to go through each line and note each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is taking too long, and manually building the tree isn't feasible. Instead, perhaps I can simulate the parsing process using a top-down approach, using the given string and the grammar.\n\nAnother idea: Since the string has 21 tokens, let me note their positions:\n\n1: t1\n2: t4\n3: t4\n4: t4\n5: t3\n6: t3\n7: t3\n8: t1\n9: t4\n10: t1\n11: t3\n12: t0\n13: t1\n14: t4\n15: t3\n16: t4\n17: t3\n18: t1\n19: t4\n20: t3\n21: t1\n22: t0\nWait, wait, no, the string is length 21. Let me recount: the string given is:\n\nt1 t4 t4 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t1 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t3 t1 t0 t3.\n\nWait, no, the user provided the string as:\n\n`t1 t4 t4 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t1 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t3 t1 t0 t3`\n\nCounting these, there are 23 tokens. Wait, but looking back: the user wrote the string as:\n\n`t1 t4 t4 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t1 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t3 t1 t0 t3`\n\nYes, that's 21 tokens, with an extra space perhaps. Wait, let me count:\n\n1. t1\n2. t4\n3. t4\n4. t4\n5. t3\n6. t3\n7. t3\n8. t1\n9. t4\n10. t1\n11. t3\n12. t0\n13. t1\n14. t4\n15. t3\n16. t4\n17. t3\n18. t1\n19. t4\n20. t3\n21. t1\n22. t0\n23. t3.\n\nWait, that's 23. But perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the commas: the string given is:\n\nt1 t4 t4 t4 t3 t3 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t1 t4 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t3 t1 t0 t3.\n\nSo that's 23 tokens. Hmm, but perhaps in the problem it's correct, but maybe I misread.

{"custom_id":"request-460","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex with a lot of production rules, so I need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It consists of the start symbol S and several non-terminals (like NT1, NT2, etc.) which eventually produce terminal symbols 't0', 't1', 't2', and 't3' in various combinations. The given string is a sequence of these t's: `t2 t3 t1 t4 t4 t0 t3 t2 t4 t3 t2 t4 t4 t1 t1 t2 t1 t2 t1 t3 t3 t4 t3 t0`. That's quite long, so the derivation will probably take many steps.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means every step in the derivation adds exactly one symbol. So, starting from S, we'll generate two symbols at a time until we reach the full string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces two non-terminals: either NT64 and NT96, NT97 and NT7, or NT35 and NT84. Depending on which production we take, each of those non-terminals will produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI notice that the first production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Let's assume we take that first since it starts with NT64, which seems to lead to t4, which is present in the string.\n\nNT64's production is either NT84 and NT62, or it can go directly to t4. Since the string starts with t2, maybe NT64 will need to produce NT68 and NT12, but I should check the productions carefully.\n\nWait, looking back, NT64 has two options: either NT84 and NT62 or directly t4. Hmm, actually, I think the grammar allows for both. So if NT64 goes to t4, that would produce a 't4', but in the string, the first symbol is 't2', so maybe we need a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider. Maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT7 is the right production because NT97 might lead to t2, and NT7 could lead to t2 as well. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT97 can go to NT43 and NT75. NT43 has options, and NT75 goes to NT98 and NT26. Checking NT98, it can go to NT79 (wait, no, in the productions listed, NT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14). Maybe it's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps starting with another production.\n\nLet me try mapping possible derivations. The string starts with t2, so let's see what non-terminals can produce t2.\n\nLooking at the rules, the non-terminals that directly produce t are:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t4: no, that's 't4'.\n\nWait, no, looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t2 (from the productions, NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48, and earlier productions from NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, which could eventually lead to terminals. Wait, no, looking at the productions, I see that some non-terminals immediately produce t's. For example, NT68 \u2192 t4, NT3 \u2192 t2, NT7 \u2192 t2, etc.\n\nWait, in the given string, the first symbol is t2. So either NT2 or something that produces t2 is involved.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals directly produce 't2':\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t4? No, that's 't4'. Wait, no, from the list:\n\nWait, actually, looking carefully, in the productions, some non-terminals are directly assigned to t's. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT7 \u2192 t2 (from NT7 \u2192 t2? Wait, no, NT7 produces NT66 and NT48, but I think I might be misreading. Let me look back.\n\nWait, the grammar shows:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48.\n\nBut NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63.\n\nWait, but further down, there's NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, which are non-terminals, so they don't produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking through all non-terminals, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT7 \u2192 at some point, a production will eventually lead to 't2', but does any non-terminal directly produce 't2'? Let's check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, it seems that NT3 \u2192 't2' and NT7 \u2192 't2' via a path? No, NT7's productions are NT66 and NT48, which are further non-terminals that go to more symbols. Wait, in the given rules, for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48,\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63,\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT22 NT62,\n\nNT22 \u2192 't4' maybe?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree, but this can take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a top-down approach, starting from S and expanding until I reach the string.\n\nLet me attempt a step-by-step expansion.\n\nStarting with S, the possible first steps are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nLet's consider each possibility and see if the string can be matched.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nNT64 has two options:\n\na) NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nb) NT64 \u2192 t4\n\nCase 1a: NT64 \u2192 NT84 and NT62.\n\nNow, we have to expand NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84's production is:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT4 is a terminal, which is 't1' according to the given rules.\n\nNT1 has two options:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n\nCase 1a1: NT4 \u2192 't1'\n\nSo, from NT84, we get T1 at the end. Then, we have to expand NT1.\n\nIf NT1 \u2192 't2', then the first symbol of the string (t2) is matched.\n\nSo, so far, we have:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 't1' NT62 \u2192 't1' (from NT4) and then need to expand NT62.\n\nNT62's production is:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT36 or NT62 \u2192 't0'\n\nCase 1a1a: NT62 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo, adding 't0' after 't1', we have 't1 t0'. But the actual string starts with 't2 t3 t1 t4 t4...', so this path is invalid.\n\nCase 1a1b: NT62 \u2192 NT84 NT36\n\nExpanding NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 \u2192 't1' 't2', so 't1 t2'\n\nThen NT36 expands to NT77 and NT15? Wait, no, NT36 is a non-terminal. Looking back, I don't see a direct production for NT36. Wait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the list shows:\n\nNT36: NT77 \u2192 't2'\nNT77 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81 \u2192 which leads to more terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all NT productions with their terminals if any.\n\nLooking through the rules again, let's list each non-terminal and whether it produces directly to a terminal.\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT7 \u2192 NT66 and NT48 (but eventually, does it lead to a terminal or other non-terminals?)\nWait, perhaps NT7 can't produce terminals directly. Similarly, NT1 \u2192 't2' or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the only direct terminals in the grammar are for NT3 ('t2'), NT1 ('t2'), and NT68 which can produce 't0' or 't4', etc. Wait, wait, looking back at the list provided:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT7 \u2192 perhaps not directly; NT7 is 'NT66' and 'NT48' which are further expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I was misinterpreting earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-458","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t4 t3 t0 t3 t1 t3 t2 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t2 t1 t0 t2 t4 t2 t2 t4 t1 t4`.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure simplifies parsing and makes it easier to generate strings from the grammar because each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's structured in CNF except for a few parts. Wait, actually, all the productions seem to be of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> t. So yes, it's in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which breaks down two non-terminals into two others or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t4 t3 t0 t3 t1 t3 t2 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t2 t1 t0 t2 t4 t2 t2 t4 t1 t4`. So, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nTo approach this, I'll try to build the parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a full binary tree, where each non-terminal has exactly two children, which are either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level productions. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. So, the initial step is choosing one of these options.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is `t4`. Let's see which productions can lead to `t4` at the start.\n\nLooking through the productions for the terminals:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 t4\n- NT54 \u2192 t4\n- NT64 \u2192 t4\n- NT97 \u2192 t2 (so not t4)\n- NT74 \u2192 t4 (but NT74 isn't in the top-level productions; S's first option is NT64 NT96)\n- NT96 \u2192 t4 (from NT96's production: NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, which then leads to terminals)\n- Wait, no. Looking at the productions, NT96 is derived as NT54 NT53, which then breaks down further. But the direct terminals for NT96 might not be t4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the given grammar, each non-terminal production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, for NT96, for example, we have NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, which are non-terminals. So, NT96 produces more non-terminals, which in turn may produce terminals. However, the only way to get a terminal directly is through productions that end in a single terminal, like NT64 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSimilarly, NT47 \u2192 't4', NT54 \u2192 't4', NT64 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo, in the initial step, the first part of the string starts with t4. Let me see which productions can produce t4. From the start symbol S, the first production is NT64 NT96. So, if S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then the first two elements would come from NT64 and NT96. Let's see what NT64 and NT96 produce.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't4' (from the given productions: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which then further break down, but wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-474","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I should understand the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the analysis, and we can use algorithms like CYK parsing efficiently.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice several non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) and some terminals denoted by 't0', 't1', etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t4 t1 t0 t2 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t2 t3 t1 t1 t3 t1 t4 t3 t3 t4 t2 t2 t2 t4 t0 t1`.\n\nThe grammar's S production has three possible rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the string must be generated by expanding one of these starting productions. Each of these starts a derivation, so I'll need to check if any of these can lead to the given string.\n\nLet's look at the first production: S \u2192 NT64 NT96. The terminals are t4 (from NT64) and t4 (from NT96). The string starts with t4 t1, which doesn't match, so this production can't possibly generate the given string because after t4, it needs another t4, but the string has t1 next. So this production is out.\n\nMoving on to the second production: S \u2192 NT97 NT7. NT97 is 't2', and NT7 is 't0'. So the string starts with t2 t0, but the given string starts with t4. Thus, this production also can't generate the string.\n\nThe third production: S \u2192 NT35 NT84. NT35 is 't3', and NT84 is 't2'. The string starts with t4, so S35\u2192t3 t2 is not a match. Therefore, none of the starting productions match the first two characters of the string, which are t4 t1. \n\nWait, but hold on. The given string is t4 t1 t0 t2 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t2 t3 t1 t1 t3 t1 t4 t3 t3 t4 t2 t2 t2 t4 t0 t1. If the starting production is not matching, maybe the string isn't generated by the grammar. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial productions don't start with the required terminals. Or maybe I've misassigned NT35 or NT84. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT35 and NT84:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't3' (from production NT35 -> 't3')\n- NT84 \u2192 't2' (from production NT84 -> 't2')\n\nSo when we use the third starting production S \u2192 NT35 NT84, the initial symbols are 't3' 't2', which would need to match the start of the string. But the string starts with t4, so that's a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, none of the starting productions of S can produce the initial 't4' of the string. That means the string cannot be generated by this grammar. So the answer is No.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other possibilities or rules. Since it's CNF, the string must start with a production of two non-terminals, each of which must expand to the following terminals. Since none of the starting productions start with t4, the string can't be formed.

Now, given that, I need to parse the string `t0 t3 t1 t3 t3 t4 t0 t3 t3 t3 t0 t4 t1 t1 t3 t0 t2 t1 t2 t1 t0 t4 t0 t4 t1` through the grammar to see if it's derivable.\n\nParsing a string in CNF can be done using the CYK algorithm or recursive descent, but since the string is relatively long, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which according to the first two rules, can produce NT64 NT96 or NT97 NT7. Looking at the production rules for NT64 and NT97, it's likely that each of these NTs will derive into some sequence of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with `t0`. Let's see which NTs produce `t0`. Looking at the grammar, I see that:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT52 \u2192 NT52 NT2 (But wait, looking at the grammar, NT52 \u2192 NT52? No, in the grammar, it's not clear. Wait, let's list all the productions with terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 't0' (Wait, no, looking at the lines: 'NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62' and other lines like 'NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63', but towards the end, I see 'NT66 \u2192 't1', no, wait, in the top, the last lines:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT64 NT96\n\nThen, looking through all lines, I see:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce a single terminal:\n\nLooking at the lines: \n- NT52 \u2192 NT52 NT2 \u2192 Wait, no, the lines are:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar provided:\n\nIt looks like the grammar is a list of production rules.

Each 't' must have been generated by a production where both non-terminals resolved directly to a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should note that productions like NT63 -> 't1' and NT3 -> 't0' are direct terminals. So, any NT that produces directly to 't' must be expanded into that 't'.\n\nBut in this grammar, there are also loops, like NT39 -> NT70 NT39, which is a Left Recursion. But since this grammar is in CNF, and assuming it's a proper CNF, Left Recursion isn't allowed, so maybe these are handled via some method like the CYK algorithm or by rewriting the grammar to eliminate left recursion.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT39 -> NT70 NT39 and NT39 can be 't0'. So it's a recursive rule. But in the provided list, it's written as NT39 -> NT70 NT39, which is Left Recursive, but perhaps that's allowed here because eventually, another path (like NT70 -> ... -> 't0') can be used. Not sure if it's a problem, but since the string uses 't0' and others, maybe it's manageable.\n\nSo, my goal is to see if I can parse the given string using this grammar. Let's take the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI'll consider it step by step. The string is:\n\nt2 t1 t0 t3 t0 t2 t0 t3 t3 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t1 t3 t0 t4 t3 t2 t1 t2 t0 t4 t4 t1\n\nThat's 27 tokens, which might mean the derivation is of depth 5 steps (since in CNF, the maximum number of steps is log2(n), but in this case, the string's length is 27, which isn't a power of 2, making it a bit tricky.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string provided is a sequence of t's with indices like t0, t1, etc. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars produce strings by expanding non-terminals (like S, NTx, etc.) into other symbols. My goal is to see if the given string t0 t4 t3 t0 ... can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce NT64 NT96 or other combinations like NT47, NT1, etc. So the first step is to see if any of these productions can lead to the given string.\n\nThe string starts with 't0', so I should look for non-terminals that produce 't0'. From the grammar, I see that NT26, NT54, NT74, NT81, and NT96 can produce 't0'.

Let me count them: 1. t0, 2. t4, 3. t3, 4. t0, 5. t0, 6. t2, 7. t4, 8. t4, 9. t0, 10. t1, 11. t3, 12. t4, 13. t1, 14. t3, 15. t2, 16. t3, 17. t2, 18. t0, 19. t0, 20. t0, 21. t0, 22. t4, 23. t4, 24. t1, 25. t0, 26. t4.\n\nSince S produces a sequence of two non-terminals, we can think of the string as being built from two separate parts. Alternatively, maybe more, but likely two. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the initial expansion is S -> NT64 NT96, which both produce a string ending with t4 each? Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62: which from the rules, NT62 -> t0, and NT84 -> NT4 NT1. Then NT4 -> t1, and NT1 -> t2. So NT64 would eventually produce a string that's the concatenation of what NT84 and NT62 produce.\n\nWait, maybe I should find a way to parse the string into possible sequences that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each token can be matched by the grammar's rules. But that's complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to try to see if each token in the string can be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. Let's check each token:\n\nt0: yes, from NT26, NT54, NT74, NT81, NT96, etc.\nt4: yes, NT47, NT68, NT98, NT24 (if it produces t4 later)\nt3: yes, NT34, etc.\nt2: yes, NT22, etc.\nWait, but some non-terminals have multiple outputs, so maybe the string is a concatenation of symbols that can be generated by the grammar's rules.\n\nBut considering the length, it's 28 tokens. Since each production step typically doubles the number of symbols, it's possible that the parse tree is more than 3 levels deep. However, without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string corresponds to a specific derivation. Let me look at the start symbol S, which can produce two non-terminals, so the string should be the concatenation of the derivations of two parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each part of the string is generated by one of the productions. Let me consider the first token t0, so perhaps the first part of the string is generated by a non-terminal that produces t0, and the second part also by another non-terminal.\n\nBut to proceed step by step, perhaps I should consider the production rules and see if I can parse the string back to S.\n\nWait, maybe I can model the string as a series of non-terminals, then check if each can reduce to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t_i corresponds to a non-terminal, so the string is a concatenation of outputs from two branches starting from S.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to check each possible production and see if the string can be split into sections that match the possible outputs.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the possible sequences of t's that each production can generate. For example, looking at NT1, which can produce 't2', and in the given string, after t0 comes t4, then t3, etc.\n\nWait, let's see. Maybe the string can be divided into two main parts, each corresponding to the two parts generated by S.\n\nSo S -> NT64 NT96, so the string is the concatenation of what NT64 generates and what NT96 generates.\n\nLet me see what NT64 and NT96 can produce.\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62: Let's see NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1: So NT4 -> t1, NT1 -> t2. So NT84 would produce \"t1 t2\".\n\nNT62 -> t0: So NT64 would generate \"t1 t2 t0\".\n\nWait, no, because NT64 is NT84 NT62, which would generate \"t1 t2 t0\".\n\nThen NT96: NT96 -> 't4'. So the entire expansion would be \"t1 t2 t0 t4\", which is 4 tokens. But our string starts with t0, so that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT66's production again.\n\nWait, let me make a table of all the non-terminals and their possible t outputs.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT26: 't3'\nNT54: 't3'\nNT66: 't4'\nNT74: 't4'\nNT96: 't4'\nNT24: NT38 NT70, and then those produce t4, t0 respectively?\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all non-terminals and the tokens they can produce.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT2 -> NT4 NT77 (but no 't' output)\nNT4 -> t1\nNT1 -> t2\nNT7 -> t2\nNT68 -> t0\nNT3 -> t0 (wait, earlier I thought it was multiple, but in the given rules, NT3 can produce t0, t0 again?)\n\nWait, let's list each non-terminal and their t outputs:\n\n- NT68: t0\n- NT7: t2\n- NT1: t2\n- NT98: t0\n- NT47: t1 initially, but also other productions like 't4' (wait, no)\n\nWait, the rules provided are specific, so let's list each non-terminal and the terminals they can produce:\n\nFrom NT2 onwards:\n\nNT2: produces 't4' via NT34 NT27?

{"custom_id":"request-515","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t1 t1 t4 t4 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t4 t4 t2 t0 t0 t4 t1 t0\", and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I know that context-free grammars can be parsed using techniques like the CYK algorithm, but I'm a bit rusty on that. Alternatively, maybe I can break down the problem by looking at the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's quite extensive. The top-level rules are S -> NT64 NT96, S -> NT97 NT7, and S -> NT35 NT84. So, the start symbol S can derive into these pairs. Each of these NTs seems to lead into other non-terminals until they reach the terminals 't0', 't1', etc., or some other rules that split further.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate consists solely of 't's and 't's with numbers, like t0, t1, etc. So, I should check if each 't' in the string can be derived from the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at each rule, some of the NTs directly go to terminals. For example, NT66 -> NT52 NT63, and then each of those might eventually lead to terminals. It might be tedious, but perhaps I can look for a way to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I can reconstruct the derivation starting from S. The string has 26 tokens, which suggests a specific structure. Given that each rule leads to two NTs, and each NT can lead to more, perhaps the string is a binary tree of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to assign indices to each token in the string and see if each can be generated from the grammar. Let's list the tokens in order: 1 t1, 2 t1, 3 t4, 4 t4, 5 t1, 6 t2, 7 t4, 8 t0, 9 t1, 10 t4, 11 t2, 12 t3, 13 t0, 14 t4, 15 t2, 16 t3, 17 t0, 18 t4, 19 t4, 20 t4, 21 t2, 22 t0, 23 t0, 24 t4, 25 t1, 26 t0.\n\nI need to see if each of these strings can be formed. Let me think about the start S, which can be T1T2 or other combinations. Maybe the string starts with a T1 or T0 somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the highest symbols that could generate these. For example, S can generate NT64 NT96, meaning each NT would derive into something, perhaps ending up with the string's tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can spot a pattern. The string has several alternating t0s and t1s, followed by t2s and t4s. Maybe some paths in the grammar can handle this.\n\nAnother approach: each 't' in the string must correspond to a rule that reduces to a single terminal. So each step in the derivation must produce a terminal or further split into more terms.\n\nBut wait, the grammar's rules only produce non-terminals until they reach a terminal. So to get the string, the entire string must be generated by the grammar by breaking down all the non-terminals until only terminals are left.\n\nPerhaps I can represent the string as a series of terminals and see if they can be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ... t1 t0. That would require t1 and t0 somewhere in the grammar. Looking at the rules, NT77 -> t2, NT97 -> t2, NT47 -> t4, etc. Wait, but are there any rules that directly produce t1 or t0?\n\nLooking back at the rules, NT47 -> t1, and NT68 -> t0, and NT3 -> t2, etc. So some rules produce t0, t1, t2, etc.\n\nBut in the string, we have multiple t1s followed by t4s and so on. Maybe I need to find a way to parse the string by breaking it into parts that can be generated by each of the grammar's rules.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe the CYK algorithm can help, but I don't remember all the details. Alternatively, I can try a top-down approach, starting from S and seeing if I can generate the string by expanding S's rules.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to look for the structure of the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two symbols, so each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one (each non-terminal becomes two, which can then become more or end).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to try to match the string against possible intermediate symbols.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the string can be considered as a sequence generated by the grammar, perhaps starting with S expanding into NT64 and NT96, each of which can go deeper.\n\nWait, let's see: S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nNow, NT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62, and nt62 -> NT52 NT63.\n\nWait, this might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be split into sub-parts that are generated by each rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to look at the entire string and see which parts could be generated by which rules.\n\nLet me try to think of the possible way to map the string to the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t1, t1, t4, t4, t1, t2, t4, t0, t1, t4, t2, t3, t0, t4, t2, t3, t0, t4, t4, t4, t2, t0, t0, t4, t1, t0.\n\nThat's 26 tokens. S in the grammar is S-> NT64 NT96, meaning that the string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT64 and NT96.\n\nSo, perhaps I should split the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT64 and NT96. Let me see how long each part is. Since S is NT64 NT96, the total number of symbols would split. Let's count the symbols, assuming each production is at a certain level.\n\nWait, another thought: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a single non-terminal. The start symbol S can derive for each step into two parts, each of which is a non-terminal. Then, each of those can derive further.\n\nTherefore, the parse tree for the string would have a root S, with two children, each leading into the derivations of NT64 and NT96.\n\nSo the string is the concatenation of the derivations of NT64 and NT96. Therefore, the entire string must be the concatenation of two parts: part from NT64, part from NT96.\n\nSo, let me see: what's the first symbol, t1. Let me look at NT64's possible rules.\n\nLooking at NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Then, each of those go further.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think recursively. Let me try to break the string into possible parts that could correspond to NT64 and NT96.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is structured as some combination that matches S's rules.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can assign indices and see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive approach: the string starts with t1, so let's see if any rule can generate t1. Looking at the rules, NT47 -> t1, but NT47 is another non-terminal.\n\nSo, to generate t1, it must be via NT47, which then needs to be split into two NTs that can produce t1 and another symbol, but in the string, the first symbol is t1, followed by t1.\n\nWait, maybe that's possible. But let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to implement the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming, and since it's a thought process, maybe I can outline the steps.\n\nIn CYK, you first preprocess the string into a matrix, then for each position, check possible rules. Given the size, it's 26 tokens, so 25 positions? Hmm, not too bad.\n\nBut perhaps I can try to do a portion of it.\n\nLet me consider the first two symbols t1 t1. What rules produce two symbols starting with t1.\n\nLooking, NT47 -> t1, so maybe NT47 is part of a possible rule.\n\nBut in CNF, each rule splits into two NTs, so perhaps the pair is NT47 and NT47, giving t1 t1.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT47 has several rules, including NT47 -> nt21 nt62, and also -> nt66 nt52,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-512","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I have to determine if a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t1 t2 t4 t1 t4 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t3 t4 t1 t4 t4 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t3 t3 t4 t0 t2 t1`, and the grammar has several production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It starts with the production `S -> NT64 NT96`, `S -> NT97 NT7`, and `S -> NT35 NT84`. So the start symbol S can be rewritten into combinations of NT followed by another NT with numbers as subscripts. Each of these NTs leads to further productions, ultimately terminating in terminal symbols 't0', 't1', 't2', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every non-terminal (NT) seems to have only two productions: either two NTs or a terminal symbol. For example, NT47 can produce either NT21 NT3 or 't1'. Similarly, others follow the same pattern\u2014some non-terminals split into two non-terminals, and others directly go to a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminal symbols: t1, t2, t4, etc., ending with t1. Each symbol is separated by a space, so the string is a series of 27 tokens. \n\nI know that in a CNF grammar, each production replaces a single non-terminal with either two non-terminals or directly with a terminal. So parse trees for this grammar are binary\u2014each node has exactly two children if it expands further. That means the length of any string generated by the grammar must be of the form 2^n + 1, where n is the number of steps in the derivation. Wait, no, actually, no: since S starts with two non-terminals, each expansion step increases the depth of the parse tree, and the total number of terminals is the number of leaves, which is 2^k for k steps. But the initial expansion is two NTs, so each step replaces a non-terminal, so the length could be up to 2^m, but in our case, the string length is 27, which is an odd number. Hmm, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. The string is longer than 16 but shorter than 32. Wait, perhaps that's not the right way to think about it because the number of steps would require the string length to be 2^n, but I might be mixing that up.\n\nWait, maybe that approach isn't the best. Instead, perhaps building an automaton or using dynamic programming to check if the string can be reduced by the grammar step by step.\n\nLet me see: since each NT leads to either two non-terminals or a terminal, the string can be processed by checking if each terminal can be matched with the corresponding NT production, considering the steps from the start.\n\nBut with such a long string, it might be better to think about the grammar's behavior. Each non-terminal ultimately produces a sequence of terminals, possibly with some branching, but since it's CNF, it's a strictly binary tree.\n\nMoreover, each production leads to either a terminal or two non-terminals, so perhaps the entire string can be generated by repeatedly substituting each non-terminal according to the first option until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a recursive descent parser, where each function checks whether a substring can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, for each symbol in the string from the start, see if it matches any production that starts with a non-terminal. Wait, no\u2014each step replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S, each step, we expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo for the string to be generated, it must correspond to a series of expansions starting from S, resulting in the string, which is 27 terminals. Since S produces two non-terminals, any derivation will require that the number of non-terminals at each step reduces by one, except when they split into two. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering the length. Each time a non-terminal is split into two, the number of components increases by one. Initially, from S, we have 1 non-terminal. After the first expansion, we have 2 non-terminals, so 1 more node. After that, each non-terminal that splits adds one more. So starting with 1 non-terminal, each split increases the count by one. To get 27 terminals, the number of non-terminals before the last step would be 27 + ... Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the string must be such that it can be built by a series of expansions. The starting symbol S can produce two non-terminals, which can each then produce two more or terminals. So the total length would be 2^k, where k is the number of splits. For example, S (1) \u2192 NT1 NT2 (2) \u2192 four NTs (3) \u2192 eight (4), etc. But the string has 27 symbols, which is not a power of two. So perhaps 27 can be represented as 2^4 + 15= 16 +15, but that doesn't fit the binary tree expansion. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, more accurately, starting from 1 (S), each split of a non-terminal into two non-terminals increases the count by one. So if we have n non-terminals, and one of them splits into two, n becomes n+1. We start with 1, and to reach a string of 27 terminals, we must split non-terminals until we have 27.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as: when you have a string of m symbols, to reach the next possible step, it must have been derived from a non-terminal split, so m must be m' +1, where m' was the number before the split.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: each production that replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals doubles the number of terminals, and then those new non-terminals can themselves split, leading to further expansion. So the number of possible terminals is 2^k, where k is the number of steps of splitting. But in our case, the string has 27 symbols, which is not a power of two. Since 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 27 falls between them, so perhaps it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the string length is 27, which is not equal to 2^k for any integer k, so it can't be generated by this grammar.

Looking at the grammar, it mostly follows this structure, so that\u2019s good.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions from S are:\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the string must start with the combination of two of these NTs. Let's break down the string step by step, but I might need to consider all possible derivations from S.\n\nEach NT symbol can be expanded into other NTs or terminals. I might have to map out the possible expansions for each NT involved in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t2, which is a terminal. I need to find which NT produces a t2. From the grammar, let's see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't2' (from the given rules)\n- NT26 \u2192 't3' (Wait, no, looking at the provided rules, NT26 is 't3'? Or wait, let's check:\n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, I need to make sure I have the right terminals for each NT. Let me list each NT that ends in a terminal:\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't2'\n- NT47 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't4'\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n- NT74 \u2192 't4'\n- NT84 \u2192 't2' (because NT84 \u2192 NT46 NT4 is not there, wait no: looking again, I have to look at each rule.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule carefully:\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62 (but NT1 is 't2')\nNT68 -> NT67? No, looking: NT68 \u2192 't4'\nNT77 is 't3' or 't2'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n- NT47 \u2192 't4' (from NT47 -> 't4') - no, wait, in the given, it says NT47 -> 't4' in one rule, but also NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which leads to 't2' and 't4?\n\nWait, no, in the given rules, there are multiple entries for NT47. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62 (first line)\nand\nNT47 -> 't4' (last line)\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Because each rule is one production. So if I see N47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which itself leads to 't2' and 't4', but also N47 has a production to 't4'. So I think that's a mistake in the provided rules. Because in CNF, each rule must be atomic\u2014either a non-terminal or a terminal. So I think the user might have made an error in the rules because N47 has two different rules: one is producing two non-terminals, another is producing a terminal.\n\nI think that's a mistake. So for now, I'll assume that each rule is correctly specified, but in the case of N47, if it can produce either NT1 NT62 or 't4', which would mean during parsing, the parser has choices.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I should assume that each NT's rules are correct as given, despite any possible duplication or inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, the user may have intended for each production to produce only one thing, but the provided rules have some that produce multiple non-terminals. So, for the sake of correctness, perhaps I should adjust my approach.\n\nBut perhaps that's a mistake on my part, so perhaps I should ignore the conflicting rules or treat only one of them, but that's unclear. Maybe it's better to proceed, assuming that the production for NT47 can either produce NT1 NT62 or 't4'. So in that case, at some point during the derivation, the grammar might choose either path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the provided rules, and some of them are meant to be productions, others are terminals. To clarify, perhaps in the provided rules, each line is a separate rule, so N47 can be either of the two. So for example, N47 can expand to NT1 NT62, or it can expand to 't4'.\n\nWait, but in CNF, terminals can only appear as atoms, not combined in rules. So having N47 \u2192 NT1 NT62 is not permissible because it needs to produce a single terminal. Therefore, I think that's an error because in CNF, each production must have a single non-terminal on the left-hand side, and either a single terminal or two non-terminals on the right.\n\nThus, in the provided rules, N47's two rules must both be allowed, but that would mean N47 can produce either NT1 NT62 or 't4'. So that's acceptable in CNF because some rules can lead to terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, given that, I'll move forward.\n\nNow, the string starts with t2. Let's see which NTs produce t2:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t3 (I thought earlier, but let me check again: looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT77: \u2192 't3' or another rule?\n\nWait, in the provided rules, looking for 't2' and 't3' endings:\n\nAh, there are a few:\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't4' (last line)\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo the t2 occurs in N97 and t3 in N77, but not directly in N47.\n\nWait, but N77 produces 't3' in one of the rules, as per the last line perhaps?\n\nLooking at the provided rules again:\n\nLet me list all NTs and their productions to find the terminals:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT64 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT67: Not present, maybe.\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't3'?\n\nWait, let me look at the list again:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT4 -> 't1'\n\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't3' (from \"NT26 -> 't3'\")\n\nWait, no, looking, I see a few lines:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\n\nWait, perhaps I'm focusing too much on the NTs. Let me see which NTs have terminal productions.\n\nFrom the provided rules, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT64 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't3' (from the line looking at \"NT26 -> 't3'\" perhaps.)\n\nWait, I need to find each NT's terminal production.\n\nLooking at each line after S:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-538","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols: `t4 t3 t2 t1 t1 t1 t0 t1 t4 t2 t1 t0 t1 t3 t1 t0 t2 t1 t3 t4 t2 t1 t3 t2 t3 t0 t4 t4`.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which helps because each production is either a single symbol or two symbols on the right-hand side. So, each step is straightforward.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the entire string must start with NT64 NT96. Let me check the first part of the string. The first t4 corresponds to NT64. From the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So after NT64, we have NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 needs to be converted. Looking at the productions, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. So after NT84, we should have NT4 and NT1. Let me see the string: after t4, it's t3, t2, t1. Hmm, that might not align. Wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. The string is in the order of the symbols, so T4 should come first, followed by NT3, etc. But NT64 becomes NT84 NT62, so after T4, we should have NT4 NT1 followed by NT62.\n\nWait, but NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, so in the string, after T4, the next should be T3, but wait, NT4 is actually something else. Let me check the productions for NT4. From the grammar, NT4 can only be transformed into 't1'. So T4 is part of NT64's production, right? Because NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit directly.\n\nHold on, maybe I should approach this step by step for each part of the string. Let me try to parse the string step by step, replacing the symbols back into NT production rules.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT64 NT96. So S generates t4 t2 (from NT64 \u2192 t4, NT96 \u2192 t2). Wait, NT96 is in the grammar as NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Then NT54 \u2192 NT1 NT26, but that might complicate. Wait, maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the string as a sequence of tokens and see if they can be reduced by the grammar rules.\n\nThe given string is: t4 t3 t2 t1 t1 t1 t0 t1 t4 t2 t1 t0 t1 t3 t1 t0 t2 t1 t3 t4 t2 t1 t3 t2 t3 t0 t4 t4.\n\nLet me list them in a sequence:\n\n1: t4\n\n2: t3\n\n3: t2\n\n4: t1\n\n5: t1\n\n6: t1\n\n7: t0\n\n8: t1\n\n9: t4\n\n10: t2\n\n11: t1\n\n12: t0\n\n13: t1\n\n14: t3\n\n15: t1\n\n16: t0\n\n17: t2\n\n18: t1\n\n19: t3\n\n20: t4\n\n21: t2\n\n22: t1\n\n23: t3\n\n24: t2\n\n25: t3\n\n26: t0\n\n27: t4\n\n28: t4\n\nNow, let's see. The starting symbol is S, which is NT64 NT96, which is t4 and something. So the first t4 is correct. Now, NT96 is t2, so the first two tokens are correct as S starts with t4 t2.\n\nLooking at NT64, it decomposes into NT84 NT62 (t4 \u2192 t4 t1). Wait, actually, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which is t4 followed by t1? Because NT84 is 't4' and NT62 is 't1'? No, wait, looking at the grammar, NT64's productions: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 is 't4', NT62 is 't2'. Because in the grammar, NT84 corresponds to 't4' and NT62 is 't2'?\n\nWait no, in the grammar, some NTs are directly replaced by a single symbol, like NT68 \u2192 't4', NT47 \u2192 't4', etc. So for NT64, the production is NT84 NT62. Now, the NT84 is 't4', and NT62 is 't2'?\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, for example, NT47 is 't4' and NT68 is 't4' as well. So when looking at NT84: from the grammar, NT84 \u2192 NT47 NT1. But wait, looking at the grammar, the production is NT84 \u2192 't4'. Wait, no, I might be getting confused. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NTs are directly mapped to 't' with indices:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1'\nNT66 \u2192 't4'\nNT64 \u2192 't4'\nNT53 \u2192 't2'\nNT96 \u2192 't4'\nNT47 \u2192 't4'\nNT68 \u2192 't4'\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nNT84 \u2192 't2'\nWait, I think the direct mappings are provided. For example:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't4'\n- NT47 \u2192 't4'\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT63 NT96\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT33 NT27\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n\nNT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT39 NT80\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT84 NT36\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT63 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1' (again?)\n\nWait, looking for all the symbols that are directly given. So any NT that ends up being replaced by a terminal symbol is one of the 't's. The rest have productions to NT pairs.\n\nSo, for NT64, the production is NT84 NT62. Now, NT84 is a direct replacement. Looking at NT84: in the grammar, NT84 \u2192 't2' (in the line NT84 \u2192 't2'). So NT84 becomes 't2'. Similarly, NT62 is a production: NT62 \u2192 't0'. So when we expand NT64, it becomes 't2' 't0'. So the initial part would be t2 t0, but wait, our string starts with t4. That's a problem because the string starts with t4, but according to S \u2192 NT64 NT96, the first symbol should be the 't' corresponding to NT64, which is t4. But if NT64 is 't2', then S would start with t2, not t4. But the string starts with t4. So maybe my initial analysis is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-556","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It seems to have several production rules starting from 'S'. The initial productions are:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\nS -> NT97 NT7\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the string starts or ends with any of these NT's followed by another. Now, looking at the string: it starts with 't2 t1 t2 t4 ...' so maybe it's derived from one of the S productions.\n\nBut wait, the grammar is in CNF, so each production has exactly two non-terminals. The right-hand side of the string seems like a series of terms, but in the grammar, each production results in two non-terminals. So, perhaps I should parse the string into pairs and see if each pair matches any production.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string to make it clearer:\n\n1. t2\n2. t1\n3. t2\n4. t4\n5. t3\n6. t4\n7. t2\n8. t3\n9. t3\n10. t4\n11. t1\n12. t0\n13. t0\n14. t4\n14. t4\n15. t3\n16. t2\n17. t2\n18. t0\n19. t1\n20. t0\n21. t3\n22. t1\n23. t4\n24. t0\n25. t4\n26. t4\n27. t2\n28. t2\n\nWait, the 14th position in the string seems incorrect. Let me count again:\n\nThe string is: t2 t1 t2 t4 t3 t4 t2 t3 t3 t4 t1 t0 t0 t4 t4 t3 t2 t2 t0 t1 t0 t3 t1 t4 t0 t4 t4 t2 t2.\n\nWait, that's 27 tokens. So it's an odd number. But in the grammar, each step in the derivation produces two symbols. So the number of symbols (excluding the starting symbol) should be a power of two minus one. Let me check: 2^4 is 16, so 15 symbols, but we have 27. So that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps each production can lead to multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar can produce more symbols through intermediate steps. Each production is a binary tree expansion, so the number of symbols could vary based on the derivations.\n\nBut maybe instead of focusing on the count, I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, looking for possible matches to the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t2. So I need to find what non-terminals can produce 't2'. Looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT74 -> 't4'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT68 -> 't2'\n- NT22 -> 't4'\n- NT82 -> 't4'\n- NT74 -> 't3'\nWait, no, actually, I need to look for rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. So from the given grammar, the rules that produce terminals are:\n\nNT7 -> 't2'\n\nNT74 -> 't0'\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT52 -> 't2'\n\nNT68 -> 't2'\n\nNT22 -> 't4'\n\nNT48 -> 't1'\n\nNT33 -> 't1'\n\nNT66 -> 't4'\n\nNT7 -> 't2'\n\nNT68 -> 't2'\n\nNT26 -> 't3'\n\nNT52 -> 't2'\n\nNT74 -> 't4'\n\nNT33 -> 't0'\n\nNT80 -> 't3'\n\nNT22 -> 't4'\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT21 -> 't4'\n\nNT52 -> 't2'\n\nNT43 -> 't0'\n\nNT53 -> 't2'\n\nNT84 -> 't0'\n\nNT34 -> 't4'\n\nNT96 -> 't3'\n\nNT62 -> 't0'\n\nWait, I might have missed some. Let me list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT7 -> t2\n\nNT74 -> t0\n\nNT5 -> t2\n\nNT52 -> t2\n\nNT68 -> t2\n\nNT22 -> t4\n\nNT48 -> t1\n\nNT33 -> t1\n\nNT66 -> t4\n\nNT68 -> t2\n\nNT26 -> t3\n\nNT74 -> t4\n\nNT33 -> t0\n\nNT80 -> t3\n\nNT22 -> t4\n\nNT5 -> t2\n\nNT21 -> t4\n\nNT52 -> t2\n\nNT43 -> t0\n\nNT53 -> t2\n\nNT84 -> t0\n\nNT34 -> t4\n\nNT96 -> t3\n\nNT62 -> t0\n\nSo more accurately, the rules that produce t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, etc., are NT7:t2, NT74:t0, NT5:t2, NT52:t2, NT68:t2, NT22:t4, NT48:t1, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbol is t2. So one possibility is that the first NT is NT7, which produces 't2', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's from a production that eventually reduces to t2.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each NT symbol in the grammar can represent a node that can be broken down further until the terminals are reached. So, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be built starting from S and expanding each step.\n\nLet me consider the string token list again:\n\nt2, t1, t2, t4, t3, t4, t2, t3, t3, t4, t1, t0, t0, t4, t4, t3, t2, t2, t0, t1, t0, t3, t1, t4, t0, t4, t4, t2, t2.\n\nWait, that's 27 tokens. Since each production goes from two symbols to two, it's doubling each time, so the number of tokens should be a power of two minus one. 15 (2^4 -1), 31 (2^5 -1). 27 isn't matching those. That might mean there are some intermediate steps where some non-terminals don't split further, or perhaps it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be considered as a series of pairs, but 27 tokens make it a bit tricky. Perhaps it's better to see if the sequence can be built by starting at the beginning and seeing which productions can match.\n\nLet me try to build the string step by step. Starting from S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nSo S becomes NT64 NT96. Now, I need to expand each NT in the string.\n\nLooking at NT64 and NT96. From the grammar rules, we have:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nSo substituting, NT64 becomes NT84 NT62, and NT96 becomes NT54 NT53. Now, the string becomes NT84 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nNow, let's expand each NT in this new string.\n\nStarting with NT84:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\n\nSo it becomes NT4 NT1 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nExpanding NT4:\n\nNT4 -> ?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT4, which is a problem. Wait, in the given grammar, each non-terminal is defined, so let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT4 is part of the expansion. Now, what is NT4's expansion? Going through the rules, I don't see an explicit rule for NT4, so perhaps it's a terminal or maybe I missed it. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the rules provided, I don't see a direct rule for NT4. So maybe NT4 is a non-terminal that eventually leads to terminals. If that's the case, perhaps NT4 can expand to other non-terminals, and so on, until terminals are reached.\n\nSo, since NT4 is not in any of the direct rules, perhaps that branch stops, meaning that S can't produce the given string because it's stuck with NT4 which can't expand further. That would mean the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem states that the string is provided, and I need to evaluate whether it's generated by the grammar. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar rules are in the form where each rule either combines two non-terminals or a non-terminal becomes a terminal.\n\nThe initial string starts with 't2', and the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT97 NT7 or S \u2192 NT66 NT96, etc. Wait, no\u2014the grammar starts with three options: S \u2192 NT97 NT7, S \u2192 NT66 NT96, or S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nWait, wait, looking back, yes, the grammar has three initial rules for S:\n\nS -> NT97 NT7\nS -> NT66 NT96\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the string must start with two symbols, either the combination of NT97 and NT7, etc. But the string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must come from the expansions of these non-terminals.\n\nLet me think step by step.

{"custom_id":"request-577","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is `t3 t0 t3 t1 t2 t4 t0 t2 t0 t1 t1 t0 t1 t0 t4 t3 t0 t3 t0 t1 t3 t4 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t2 t0 t3`, and the grammar is provided. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that there are several NT (non-terminal) productions. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which immediately branches into three different options:\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these branches leads to NT productions that eventually terminate with terminal symbols 't0', 't1', and others. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from S by following these production rules.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of t terms: t3, t0, t3, t1, t2, t4, t0, t2, t0, t1, t1, t0, t1, t0, t4, t3, t0, t3, t0, t1, t3, t4, t4, t0, t1, t2, t2, t2, t0, t3.\n\nI'll start by considering the structure of S and the possible ways the string could be formed.\n\nFirst, I notice that S can produce different pairs. Looking at the string, perhaps the first part starts with NT64 NT96, so S's first production.\n\nNT64 produces NT84 NT62. So, after S, we have NT84 and NT62. Now, looking into NT84: NT84 can produce NT4 NT1, which then becomes 't1' and 't2' respectively. Wait, but looking at the rules, NT84 is defined as NT4 NT1. NT4 is 't1' and NT1 is 't2' (as per the given rules: NT4->t1, NT1->t2). So NT84 would be t1 followed by t2, making 't1t2'.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t3, so perhaps that's a dead end. Alternatively, maybe NT64 is different. Wait, looking back, the grammar has multiple NT64 productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT64, in the provided rules:\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nWait, but another rule for NT64 is not directly given; looking, the user provided rules: I see NT64 -> NT84 NT62, as per the problem statement. So S -> NT64 NT96 would produce NT84 NT62 NT96.\n\nWait, no, S -> NT64 NT96, so the next step is to expand each of those NTs.\n\nExpanding NT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\nExpanding NT96: Let's check the rules for NT96. Looking through the rules, I see NT96 -> NT54 NT53.\n\nSo now, the string would be built from t3, t0, t3, t1,... Let's see if I can map this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S uses another production. Let me consider S -> NT97 NT7. NT97: in rules, NT97 is defined as NT43 NT75. NT75 is NT98 NT26. NT98 is NT47 NT14, and so on. But the string starts with t3, so not sure if this would map.\n\nAnother possibility is S -> NT35 NT84. NT35 is defined as NT35 -> NT38 NT84. Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT35 -> NT84 NT81.\n\nWait, wait, looking again: the user's grammar lists:\n\nNT35 -> NT84 NT81.\n\nSo S could also branch into NT35 and NT84. But the string starts with t3, t0, etc., which suggests perhaps a different path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's useful to try to trace the derivation.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt3 t0 t3 t1 t2 t4 t0 t2 t0 t1 t1 t0 t1 t0 t4 t3 t0 t3 t0 t1 t3 t4 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t2 t0 t3.\n\nThis is a sequence of 33 symbols, all t's with subscripts.\n\nFirst, let me consider how the grammar could produce such a sequence. Since the start is S and S branches into three possible pairs, I'll have to see if any of the possible expansions from those three pairs could yield the given string.\n\nLet me start with the first production: S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nExpanding NT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nExpanding NT96: NT96 -> NT54 NT53.\n\nSo S would beNT84 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nWait, but that would require NT84, NT62, NT54, NT53 to all be expanded into terminal symbols. However, each of these might produce two NTs, so perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each step doubles the number of NTs until terminals are reached. But I need to see if the string can be built by a series of such expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree would help, but given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to see if I can reconstruct the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the t0 and t3 parts in the grammar. For example, looking for where 't3' occurs as a terminal. From the user's rules, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't1'\n- NT35 -> 't3' (since NT35 is defined as NT38 NT84, and earlier, looking at the user's rules, NT38 has a production NT34 NT27, which eventually leads to t3 when NT34->'t3' and NT27->'t4'?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for 't3' in the rules where a NT produces a terminal 't3'. Checking the user's rules, I see:\n\n- NT74 -> 't3'\n- NT38 -> 't3' in some rule? Wait, in the user's grammar, I see NT38->'t3'? Let me check: Looking back, the user's rules include:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT33 -> 't1'\n- NT38 -> 't3'\nAh, so in the rules, there is NT38 which can produce 't3' (from NT38->nt34 nt27? Wait no, looking at the user's rules, it's:\n\nNT38 rules: \n\nWait the user's grammar includes:\n\nNT38 -> NT34 NT27\nand then for NT34: NT34 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no. Let me check.\n\nUser's rules:\n\nNT38 -> NT34 NT27.\n\nWait, and in the rules, NT34 is a terminal?\n\nLooking through the user's grammar rules, I don't see NT34->anything else except maybe in other rules.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, for NT34: I see it's a terminal in the rule for NT81: NT81->'t3', but I don't see NT34 having any production, which would mean NT34 is a terminal (as per Chomsky Normal Form, all terminals are length 1, so non-terminals have production rules with two non-terminals, and terminals are single letters.\n\nWait, to clarify, in CNF, all non-terminals have production rules that produce two non-terminals. Terminals are just themselves. So any NT that eventually leads to a terminal in the rules must have a production path that ends in a terminal. So looking through the user's rules, some NT rules ultimately result in a terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT47->t1 (from the user's rules: NT47->'t1')\n\n- NT68->t3\n\n- NT97->t2\n\n- NT1->t2\n\n- NT4->t1\n\n- NT74->t3\n\n- NT35->'t3' (from NT35->NT38 NT84, but then NT38->something? Wait, no: looking at user's rules, NT35 is NT38 NT84, but I don't see NT38 being a terminal. Wait, perhaps there's a deeper expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each rule has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side.

{"custom_id":"request-595","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string `t2 t1 t2 t2 t2 t0 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t4 t1 t2 t0 t4 t4 t3 t2 t3 t3 t1 t4 t1 t2 t1 t0 t3 t2 t1 t4` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems all the production rules are either generating two non-terminals or terminal symbols directly. So, the structure seems appropriate.\n\nThe string consists of a series of t0, t1, ..., t9 symbols. I notice that in the grammar, some non-terminals are directly tied to these tokens, while others are connected through longer paths. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which then eventually leads to 't4' and 't4'. \n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string from left to right using a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent parsing might be feasible. I can try to break down the string into parts that match the non-terminals, checking at each step if the current substring corresponds to any of the grammar rules.\n\nLet me consider how S can be split. From the grammar, S has three productions: NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, and NT35 NT84. Each of these would lead to different sequences of tokens. For instance, NT64 \u2192 t4 and NT96 \u2192 t4, so the production S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would result in t4 t4. Similarly, I'll have to check if the string can be broken down using one of these options multiple times.\n\nLooking at the string: t2 is the first token. None of the direct productions under S start with t2, except perhaps if some other non-terminal leads back to t2. For example, NT7 \u2192 t2. But looking at the grammar, NT7 is only in the production S \u2192 NT97 NT7. So, S could be split into NT97 and NT7. \n\nSo, first, I'd split S into NT97 and NT7. Now, I need to check if the next tokens can be parsed by these non-terminals. NT7 \u2192 t2 (as per some rule), so the first token t2 could be generated by NT7. The next parts would need to expand into the remaining tokens.\n\nBut wait, the production for S would be S \u2192 NT97 NT7, which would generate a sequence that starts with whatever NT97 leads to and then NT7, which in this case is t2. But looking at NT97's productions, perhaps NT97 leads to t2 or other things. Wait, some rules for NT97: like NT97 \u2192 NT68 NT3, or NT97 \u2192 t2. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, line-by-line: NT97 has several rules. One of them is NT97 \u2192 t2. So, S can produce t2 t2 t2... perhaps? Wait, no. Because S is split into NT97 and NT7. So, if NT97 \u2192 t2, and NT7 \u2192 t2, then the whole production S \u2192 NT97 NT7 would produce t2 t2. But in the string, it starts with t2 t1..., which doesn't match t2 t2. So that suggests that maybe S cannot start with that. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. S has multiple productions, so let's list all S options again:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96 \u2192 \"t4\" and \"t4\" as per NT64 \u2192 t4, NT96 \u2192 t4\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7 \u2192 So, NT97 has rules that can produce t2, t4, etc., and NT7 \u2192 t2. So the combination would lead to t2 followed by whatever NT97 and NT7 produce.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t2. Let's see if any S production can start with t2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 t4, so S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would start with t4 t4. The string starts with t2, so this production is not relevant.\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7: The first symbol is t2 (from NT7?), but maybe NT97 produces something else. For example, if NT97 \u2192 t4, then Nt97 is t4, Nt7 is t2, which would give t4 t2, but the string starts with t2 t1. So that doesn't fit.\n  \nTherefore, perhaps the correct production is S \u2192 NT35 NT84. Let's check NT35 and NT84's possible outputs. From the grammar, NT35 \u2192 't3'. So the first production would contribute 't3'. But the string starts with t2 t1, so that's not a match. So S \u2192 NT35 can't be the start.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT7. Let's see what NT97 can do. NT97 \u2192 t2, t4, or other combinations. If NT97 is t4, and NT7 is t2, then the sequence starts with t4 t2. But the string starts with t2, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the first step involves a longer expansion. Let's think. Maybe S is NT97 NT7. The string is longer than 2 tokens, so there's more to come. Let's break it down.\n\nThe first token is t2: suppose NT7 is producing t2. So S \u2192 NT97 NT7 would require that the next token, the second one, matches the next symbol in NT97's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT97's rules, for example: NT97 can be t2, t4, and other combinations. Let's see, does NT97 produce t1? Let me check the grammar rules again for NT97. Looking at the list:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT97 \u2192 t4 and another rule NT98 \u2192 t2, but NT97 is on lines like line 12: NT84 \u2192 't2', line 17: NT97 \u2192 t2, line 27: NT98 \u2192 t1, line 34: NT47 \u2192 t2? Wait, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, in the grammar list, looking for NT97: \n\nI see lines 19 and 21:\n\n- line 19: NT12 -> NT82 NT48\n- line 21: NT5 -> NT68 NT3\n\nWait, the relevant ones are near the top:\n\nOh wait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals:\n\nWait, let me think about the grammar. The non-terminals listed are S and a bunch of NT followed by digits or similar, and some have production rules that produce terminals like t0, t1, etc.\n\nLooking back line by line:\n\nLooking for NT97: \n\n- Line 12: NT47 -> t2? Or is it line 29: NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62? Wait, the list:\n\nLet me look for NT97 in the grammar.\n\nAh, I see:\n\nLine 12: NT97 \u2192 t4\n\nWait no:\n\nWait, actually looking at the grammar, the part of NT97's rules is:\n\nLooking back, the user input is a detailed list.\n\nLooking for NT97:\n\n- Line above NT84 \u2192 t2: The line before that is NT3 \u2192 t0, etc. Let's look through all the grammar list:\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look at each NT and see if they have any t symbols in their production rules.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT64 \u2192 t4\n\nNT1 \u2192 t2\n\nNT47 \u2192 t2 (from line 47: NT47\u2192t2?)

That's a lot of tokens, so I need to figure out a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll recall Chomsky normal form. These grammars have production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. Since it's in CNF, the derivation process can be thought of as building a binary parse tree from the string upwards, starting from the root symbol, which is S in this case.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its productions are all combinations of two NTs (non-terminals).

The string is `t0 t4 t1 t4 t2 t4 t3 t0 t1 t0 t1 t4 t3 t1 t0 t4 t4 t4 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t2 t3 t3 t1 t1 t2 t0`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That makes parsing a bit more straightforward, although it can still be complex. Also, since it's in CNF, the parse tree will be such that each node has exactly two children, except the leaves which are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT64 NT96 according to the first rule. So, the root of any parse tree should be S, meaning the string must start with t64 and t96, where t64 and t96 are specific productions that generate 't' symbols.\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, the productions for NT64 and NT96 directly produce 't' symbols. For example, NT64 is 't4', NT96 is 't4'. So, when S expands to NT64 NT96, that immediately produces t4 t4. But looking at the string, it starts with t0 t4 t1, which doesn't match t4 t4. Hmm, that might be a problem. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding which NTs correspond to which t's.\n\nWait, no, I should look more carefully. Let me see the production rules for the NTs. For example, NT64 is defined as 't4' according to the rule. So, when S expands to NT64 NT96, that would mean the string starts with the terminals generated by NT64 and NT96, which are both 't4'. So the string should start with t4 t4. But the given string starts with t0. That seems like a contradiction. So perhaps the grammar doesn't generate this string. But wait, maybe there's a way for the NTs to derive t0 through other productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to represent the string as a sequence of t symbols and see if it can be generated by the grammar. Since each production in CNF splits non-terminals into pairs, each step doubles the number of symbols. But perhaps that's too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a binary tree, since each production in CNF splits into two, leading to a binary tree structure. Each step, the number of symbols can grow by a factor of 2, but it's more about the structure.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider the possible derivations. Let's try to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of terminals derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string is `t0 t4 t1 t4 t2 t4 t3 t0 t1 t0 t1 t4 t3 t1 t0 t4 t4 t4 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t2 t3 t3 t1 t1 t2 t0`. That's a long string with 35 tokens, each being t followed by a number.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production step produces two terminals, but that might not be the case. Let me check: Each production in CNF can have non-terminals on both sides, so perhaps they're transformed into terminals through other productions.\n\nWait, for example, NT96 is defined as 't4'. So any NT96 production in the parse tree would lead to t4.\n\nSimilarly, NT64 is 't4', so any NT64 would produce t4.\n\nBut looking at the given string, it starts with t0 t4. So, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT96 NT64, leading to t4 t4, but that's not matching the string which starts with t0 followed by t4.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Unless perhaps NT96 isn't the one that's directly producing t4. Wait, no, the rule for NT96 is 't4'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the production rules again to see which NTs produce t0, t4, etc.\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't0' (twice)\n- NT4 \u2192 't1'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n- NT68 \u2192 't2' (from another rule)\n- NT98 \u2192 't1', 't0', 't3', 't2'\n- NT38 \u2192 't3', 't2'\n- NT39 \u2192 't0'\n- NT47 \u2192 't4' (multiple times)\n- NT64 \u2192 't4'\n- NT96 \u2192 't4' (multiple times)\n- NT70 \u2192 't4'\n- NT54 \u2192 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4'? Let me check: NT54 has two rules: one is 't4' and another is 't3'. Wait, the rules for NT54 are: 't4', 't3'.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me parse the rules properly.\n\nLooking at the full list:\n\nNT97: t2, t1\nNT47: t4, t1, t62 (but these are likely typos since the user may have made a mistake, but let's assume as per the data)\nWait, perhaps the user provided the rules in a compact form, but it's a bit hard to see. Alternatively, maybe it's better to structure it as per the standard CNF.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check which NTs can derive t0, t4, etc.\n\nFrom the rules, t0 is produced by:\n\n- NT3\n- NT68\n- NT39\n\nt4 is produced by:\n\n- NT47 (multiple times)\n- NT64\n- NT54 (once)\n- NT70\n\nt1 is produced by:\n\n- NT4\n- NT1\n- NT77 (from another rule)\n- NT48\n- NT5\n- NT33\n- NT38\n- NT62\n- NT97\n\nt2:\n\n- NT7\n- NT52\n- NT74\n- NT5\n- NT22\n- NT26\n- NT68\n- NT82\n- NT22 again\n\nt3:\n\n- NT12\n- NT33 (multiple times)\n- NT38 (multiple times)\n- NT54\n- NT96\n- NT39\n- NT98\n- NT78\n\nt other numbers aren't in the string, so we can ignore them.\n\nSo, to have the string generated, each 't' in the string must be derived by some combination of the NT productions.\n\nBut the first two symbols in the string are t0 t4. Let's see if we can get those.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT96 NT64, which gives t4 t4, but we have t0.\n\nSo perhaps S must expand differently, but according to the given grammar, S only has two productions: NT47, NT64 NT96, etc. Wait, no, looking again, the S productions are:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\n\nS -> NT97 NT7\n\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nWait, so the start symbol can expand to any of these three possibilities: NT64 and NT96, NT97 and NT7, or NT35 and NT84.\n\nSo, to get t0 t4, perhaps the initial split isn't S \u2192 NT97 NT7, which would give t1 t2, since NT97 \u2192t2 and NT7 \u2192t2?\n\nWait, wait, no: NT97 \u2192 't2', but wait looking at the rules:\n\n- NT97 has two productions: 't2' and 't1'. Wait, that can't be. Because in the given rules, NT97 has two entries: \n\nLooking at the data: line by line after grammar:\n\nNT97: t2, t1.\n\nWait, no, that can't be, because each production is for a rule.

For example, several lines down:\n\nLine 2: nt33 has 't1' twice.\n\nAnyway, perhaps for NT97, it has two productions: 't1' and 't2'?\n\nIf that's the case, then S \u2192 NT97 NT7 would produce t1 (from NT97) and then the other symbols from NT7. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nWait, looking back, the original grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S.\n\nIt can expand to:\n\n- NT64 NT96\n\n- NT97 NT7\n\n- NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these would then expand"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-612","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with a problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember CNF has specific structural rules where each production is either a single terminal, a pair of non-terminals, or a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided looks a bit complex with a bunch of rules. The productions start with S and go on to various non-terminals like NT, with different symbols on the right side. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's with some numbers, specifically: `t2 t4 t0 t0 t1 t2 t3 t2 t3 t4 t3 t1 t0 t1 t3 t1 t2 t0 t0 t3 t0 t4 t3 t1 t0 t0 t4 t4 t3 t0 t4`.\n\nI think the first step is to parse the string into its individual symbols and see how each can be derived from the grammar. The string contains t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, so I'll need to see if there are any productions that produce these. \n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, most of the rules produce 't's, but some NTs produce pairs of NTs which might eventually lead to 't's when expanded. For example, NT47 can become 't1' or split into other NTs. So the string must be constructed by these nested NT productions that resolve to 't's at the end.\n\nLet me try to think recursively. The top symbol is S, which directly expands into two NTs: either NT64 and NT96, or NT97 and NT7, or NT35 and NT84. Each of these NTs can then be replaced either by a single 't' or by further splits.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t2. So, I need to find a production that can produce t2. Let me scan through the grammar for any NT that directly becomes t2. Scanning through the rules, I notice that NT97 becomes t2 (rule NT97 -> 't2'). So that's one possibility.\n\nNext, considering that S can produce NT97 and NT7. Wait, S -> NT97 NT7 is one of the options. So, if the first symbol is t2 (from NT97), the second would be NT7, but the second symbol in the string is t4. Hmm, NT7 in the grammar leads to 't2' (rule NT7 -> 't2'). So that can't be t4. Alternatively, maybe I need a different path.\n\nWait, or perhaps the string is built by a series of expansions. Let me consider the string step by step. The string starts with t2, t4. So maybe the first part of the string comes from an NT that splits into two NTs, each of which produces t2 and t4.\n\nLooking for an NT that can split into two parts: one that becomes t2 and another that becomes t4. For example, looking for NTs where one can produce t2 and the other t4. Or perhaps a production that directly includes t2 and t4 through a split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part of the string comes from NT97 (t2) and then another NT that eventually becomes t4. Let me check NT96. Wait, NT96 is in a production where it's a non-terminal, but I don't see NT96 directly producing a t, but perhaps through other steps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking for an NT that can produce t2 and then another NT that produces t4, or a combination of NTs that together produce t2 followed by t4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach this using a top-down parsing method, starting from S and trying to match the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can go to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Let's explore each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's try S -> NT97 NT7. The production NT97 is 't2' and NT7 is 't2' (from the rule NT7->t2). But the string starts with t2 followed by t4. So perhaps this path isn't correct.\n\nNext, try S -> NT35 NT84. NT35 -> 't3' (from NT35 -> 't3'), and NT84 -> 't4' (from NT84->'t4'). So combining them would give 't3 t4'. But the string starts with 't2 t4', so that's a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, S -> NT64 NT96. NT64 -> 't4' (from NT64->t4), and NT96 can produce 't4'? Looking at NT96's rules: NT96 -> NT54 NT53, which both produce symbols. Wait, NT54 can produce 't4'? Let me check: NT54 has rules like -> 't1', 't3', etc. Wait, looking at the NT rules:\n\nLooking back, I see that NT54 has a rule -> NT84 NT62. Wait, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, under NT54, it says: NT54 -> 't4' appears only under other productions, like S->NT35 NT84 (which is part of the grammar, but NT54 is not directly in those). Let me check the full list.\n\nIn the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT35 -> 't3'\n\nNT54 -> 'other rules, but does it include 't4'? Looking at the list:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I don't see a direct production for NT54 that results in 't4'. Instead, NT54 seems to produce things like 't3', 't0', etc. Hmm. So maybe NT96, which splits into NT54 and NT53, and I see that NT54 might not directly produce t4, but perhaps through further splits.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to parse the string recursively, step by step, to see if each symbol can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start with the first symbol, t2. So the first step is to produce t2. Looking at the grammar, the options are:\n\nNT can directly produce t2 with NT97 (rule NT97->t2) or maybe other NTs? Let's see: in the list of rules, NT97 is the only one that produces t2 directly. So the first NT must be NT97, which gives t2.\n\nAfter that, the next symbol is t4. So after producing t2, we need to produce t4. Let's consider what comes after NT97.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S->NT97 NT7. So after NT97 (producing t2), the other NT is NT7. Let's see what NT7 produces. NT7 has a production to t2, or to NT66 NT48. So to get t4, we might need another path.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the first NT97 leads to t2, and the next NT97 or something else leads to t4. Alternatively, maybe S isn't involved, but let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is produced by a different initial S production. Let me try S->NT64 NT96. NT64 produces 't4' (directly), and NT96 leads to NT54 NT53. Now, both NT54 and NT53 can produce various symbols. Let's track this.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the top-down approach. Maybe another way is to see if the entire string can be generated by using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the string is quite long, maybe the approach is to model it as a parse tree, but that might be too time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for possible derivations that can generate this string. Let's see if each symbol can be matched by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t2 t4 t0 t0 t1 t2 t3 t2 t3 t4 t3 t1 t0 t1 t3 t1 t2 t0 t0 t3 t0 t4 t3 t1 t0 t0 t4 t4 t3 t0 t4.\n\nWait, no, wait, looking back, the actual string is:\n\n`t2 t4 t0 t0 t1 t2 t3 t2 t3 t4 t3 t1 t0 t1 t3 t1 t2 t0 t0 t3 t0 t4 t3 t1 t0 t0 t4 t4 t3 t0 t4`.\n\nThat's a long string. Each symbol is part of the string, so each should be covered by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to model the parsing step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is t2. So we need an NT that produces t2: NT97.\n\n2. So the first part is S->NT97 NT7.

{"custom_id":"request-639","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. The string I'm supposed to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens and a few numbers, but I think the numbers just represent some kind of labels, not actual strings. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, which has three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these productions starts with NT followed by a number. I notice that each NT... rule eventually produces a 't' followed by either 0, 1, or 2. For example:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- etc.\n\nSo, each NT production leads to a terminal symbol 't' and a number. My string consists of a sequence of these 't' and number combinations. \n\nLet me count how many tokens are in the string. It's 38 tokens, alternating between 't's and numbers. Each production rule in the grammar leads to exactly one terminal symbol. So, each step in the derivation reduces two non-terminals into a terminal. Therefore, the length of the string must be related to the number of steps in the derivation.\n\nThe start symbol S, in each production, has two non-terminals. So S -> NTa NTb. Each NTa and NTb can be expanded further. Each NT produces a terminal. Therefore, each production from S would produce two tokens. But in the string, the total number of tokens is 38. \n\nHowever, if I think about the derivation, each application of a rule adds one token. Starting from S, which has length 1 (since it's a non-terminal, but in the string, it's considered as the initial point). Let me model the derivation steps. \n\nEach step in the grammar consumes two non-terminals and produces one token. So starting from S, the initial step would produce two tokens (since S -> NTa NTb), leading to the count increasing by one each time a rule is applied. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each rule replaces two non-terminals with one terminal, so each rule application reduces the count of non-terminals by one but increases the count of terminals by one. \n\nActually, the number of terminals in the generated string should be one more than the number of times a production is applied. Since S starts with two non-terminals, and each application replaces a non-terminal with a terminal (and a possible non-terminal), but wait, each rule from NT... goes to a terminal. So each NT production directly gives a terminal. So each S production (there are three) would directly give two terminals. \n\nWait, no. Let's clarify. Because S can directly derive NTa NTb, which are two non-terminals. Then each NTa and NTb must be expanded into a terminal. So each S production would lead to two terminals. Therefore, each S production when fully expanded would result in two tokens. Since there are three S productions, but each S is applied once, it's unclear how the string is built.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar is such that each S production leads to a string of two terminals, but the problem is that the string is longer, so it must be built by combining these. Wait, perhaps the grammar is ambiguous or uses multiple productions in a way that the derivation can produce a longer string. \n\nWait, no. Each S production is S -> NTx NTy. Each NTx and NTy produce exactly one terminal. So each S production leads to exactly two terminals. So to get a string of 38 tokens, we'd have to have a derivation that starts with S and expands via each production, but perhaps through multiple levels.\n\nWait, no. The grammar is context-free, so each step replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, each NT production (which are the rules starting with NT, like NT3, NT64, etc.) all produce a terminal. So each application of an NT rule reduces two non-terminals to one terminal. So each time we apply an NT rule, we are adding a terminal.\n\nBut starting with S, which can be expanded into two NTs, each of which can be expanded into a terminal. So for example, S -> NT64 NT96, which then becomes two terminals. But the string is longer, so perhaps there are more layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the grammar has more layers, and each S production is part of a larger derivation. For example, each NTo rule can produce a terminal, but perhaps other NT rules can produce more NTs, leading to a tree that eventually all leaves are terminals. So the total number of terminals in the string is the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is 2^n where n is the number of splits. But that doesn't seem to fit here as 38 is not a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated by a series of S productions, but each S can be applied in any order, building up the string step by step.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string's length must be such that it's one less than a power of two. For example, a derivation could start with S (1 non-terminal), then each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, leading to 2^n non-terminals. To get to terminals, each non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. So the number of terminals would be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is 2^{k-1} where k is the number of steps. But 38 is not a power of two; 2^6=64, 2^5=32. So 38 isn't matching that, which might suggest that the string isn't in the language. But perhaps that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for multiple left or right derivations, and the string can be formed by different orders. So maybe the string's structure can be matched by the grammar's non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLet me look at the string: it starts with t4, t3, t1, t3, t2, t0, etc. Each t is followed by a number. I need to see if the NT rules can produce this sequence.\n\nLooking at some NT production rules:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't1' (Wait, I don't see NT4 in the initial rules listed. Hmm, maybe it's part of the larger context.)\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT68 -> 't4'\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT47 -> 't1' (Wait, earlier in the NT47 rules, I see:\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\nNT21 -> NT33 NT27\nNT33 -> NT84 NT81\nNT81 -> NT36 NT22\nNT36 -> NT47 NT12\nNT12 -> NT82 NT48\nNT48 -> NT1 NT47\nNT1 -> NT5 NT77\nNT77 -> NT3 NT1\nAnd so on, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be built by going through these rules. For instance, starting with NT47, it can be transformed into NT21 and NT3. Then NT3 -> 't0', but in the string, the first token is 't4', so perhaps this path isn't used.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: It ends with '... t0 t4 t0'. Let's see if there's a way to get to t4.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, NT68 -> 't4', NT64 -> 't4', NT96 -> 't4', etc.\n\nLooking for 't4', perhaps starting with NT68. NT68 -> 't4'. Then to get 't4', the preceding part must derive to NT68.\n\nBut how does NT68 get derived? Looking at the rules, NT68 can be broken down into other NTs. Looking at NT68 rules:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\nNT12 -> NT82 NT48\nNT48 -> NT1 NT47\nNT1 -> NT5 NT77\nNT77 -> NT3 NT1\n\nThis seems like a loop: NT68 -> NT47 NT12, which leads into NT5 and NT77, which eventually go back to NT3 and NT1.\n\nBut in the string, we have t4 after t3, which might be part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken into parts. Let's parse the string. It's t4, t3, t1, t3, t2, t0, t0, t3, t0, t3, t1, t3, t2, t0, etc. It's quite long, so maybe it's better to see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t corresponds to a step in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, to derive a string, we can only expand non-terminals step by step until we get all terminals. Each expansion step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The key is that the number of symbols in a rule application increases by one each time, starting from 1 for each non-terminal's productions to eventually reach the length of the string.\n\nThe string has 35 tokens, so the derivation should take exactly 35 steps because each step increases the count by 1. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again: starting with the start symbol S, which is a non-terminal, each production adds exactly one non-terminal or a terminal. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. So the number of symbols in the sentential form increases by one each time. Wait no, actually, starting with S as a single symbol, each production replaces one non-terminal with two others. So the length grows from 1 to 2, 3, etc. Wait, no, that's not right. Each replacement increases the length by one because one non-terminal becomes two. So after n steps, starting from 1 symbol, you have 1 + n symbols.\n\nWait, no, let me get this straight. The initial length is 1 (just S). After one replacement, if S is replaced by two non-terminals, the length becomes 2. Then each of those non-terminals can be replaced, possibly adding more symbols. But in this case, the start symbol S in this grammar seems to produce two non-terminals, so the initial expansion from S would produce two non-terminals, each of which could then produce more.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT1 followed by NT64, NT96, etc. Wait, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\nOr other similar options.\n\nWait the given grammar is:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\nS -> NT97 NT7\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nWait, the initial productions for S seem like S produces two non-terminals, each of which then could be further expanded.\n\nWait, but the process for a context-free grammar in CNF for a string of length n is that the number of productions needed is 2^(n-1). So for a string of length 35, we would need 2^34 productions, which is exponentially large. That's obviously not feasible, so I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait no, that's not correct. In a context-free grammar using binary expansion (each non-terminal produces two symbols), the minimum number of steps to derive a string of length m is m-1, but this depends on the specific productions.\n\nWait, no, each step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, so the length increases by 1 each time. So starting with 1 symbol (S), after n steps, you have 1 + n symbols. So for a string of 35, you need 34 steps.\n\nBut in reality, each non-terminal expansion creates two new symbols, so the number of non-terminals can grow exponentially. Wait, but in this case, perhaps not because some productions stop at terminals.\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm conflating the number of production steps with the length of the string. Each production step can only replace a single non-terminal, but each replacement can produce two non-terminals, leading to an increase in symbols. So for S to generate a string of length 35, you would have to have 34 expansion steps.\n\nSo perhaps I should check if the number of non-terminals matches the length of the string or something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the string has 35 tokens, which would mean that the starting symbol S must produce two non-terminals, each of which must be expanded until terminals are reached, and the total count must add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the structure of the grammar and see if each part of the string can be broken down into the allowed productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, all the non-terminals on the left (like NT47, NT12, etc.) eventually produce 't0' or 't1'. So each non-terminal must ultimately produce a single 't'. So to generate the string, each non-terminal expansion must lead to a sequence that sums up to the correct 't's in order.\n\nLooking at the string: `t1 t0 t2 t4 t3 t1 t1 t0 t4 t1 t1 t4 t4 t3 t0 t0 t4 t1 t1 t4 t4 t1 t0 t1 t0 t4 t4 t1 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0`\n\nBut wait, the non-terminals don't produce t2, t3, t4, etc. Wait, looking back at the grammar, all the non-terminals eventually produce either 't0' or 't1' when they resolve into terminals. For example:\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53, and NT54 -> NT4 NT1, NT47->NT1, etc. Let's see if any non-terminals in the grammar produce a t2, t3, t4, etc.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT21\n\nBut then NT21 -> NT52 NT62\n\nAnd NT52 -> NT75 NT26\n\nWait, does any non-terminal produce a t2, t3, t4? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce t2, t3, t4:\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75, but NT43 -> NT0, etc. Wait, does any non-terminal have a production that includes a terminal other than t0 or t1? Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I only see 't0' and 't1' as terminals. So every step in the grammar only produces t0 or t1, so the entire string should only contain t0 and t1. But the given string has t2, t3, t4 as well. So that means the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains t2, t3, t4, which are not part of any non-terminal's productions.\n\nWait, let me confirm by checking all the rules:\n\nThe only terminals in the grammar are t0 and t1.

Starting from the beginning, each symbol in the string (like t0, t4, etc.) must correspond to either a terminal production or be the result of a production that can derive a sequence starting with that symbol.\n\nLet me go through the string token by token and see if I can match each with a production that either directly produces that token or leads to it through a series of productions.\n\nFirst token: t0. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT64 -> t4, NT68 -> t0, NT7 -> t2, NT48 -> t1, NT3-> t0, NT78->t0, NT97->t2, etc. So t0 can come from several non-terminals.\n\nLet's take the first production: S -> NT64 NT64. Wait, no, looking back, the initial grammar S has several options, but looking at the initial rules:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\n\nWait, no, the grammar provided is:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\n\nS -> NT97 NT7\n\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nThen for NT47, NT1, etc. So to start, S can be divided into two non-terminals, leading to something that produces the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by simulating a top-down parse. Since it's CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each node is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Each non-terminal has exactly two children.\n\nSo the first step is to see what S can produce. S can be split into two non-terminals, so from S, the first token must come from the first part (NT64 or NT97 or NT35). Wait, no, the first token is t0, so let's see which non-terminals can produce t0. Looking at the grammar, NT3, NT77, NT54, NT97, etc., can produce t0.\n\nWait, I think I need to represent the string as a list and simulate the parse step by step. Let's try that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the string can be matched by any leftmost derivation starting from S. Starting with S, each step produces two symbols until we reach the entire string.\n\nWait, the string is 38 tokens long. Each production either produces one terminal and consumes one, or produces two non-terminals. So let me think about the steps.\n\nStep 1: S can be split into two non-terminals. So the first token in the string must be the result of a derivation starting with one of these. Let me check for each possible production of S.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT64 NT96. So from S, the first step would produce NT64 and NT96. Now, the first token is t0. Let's see what NT64 can produce. From the grammar, NT64 -> t4, but that doesn't help because we need t0. Alternatively, is there a way for NT64 to go through another production? Wait, no, because in the given grammar, NT64 directly produces t4 and t6 (wait, no, the grammar only has NT64 -> NT84 NT62 and NT64 -> t4). Oh, I see: NT64 has two rules: -> NT84 NT62 and -> t4.\n\nSo to produce t0 starting with S, let's see: if S -> NT64 NT96, then the first part is NT64. To get t0 from NT64, it can't, because NT64 can only produce t4 or NT84 NT62. But t8 and t62 are other symbols. So that path doesn't produce t0.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT97 NT7. Let's see NT97. Looking at the grammar, NT97 -> t2. So NT97 can produce t2, but our first token is t0. So that path won't produce t0 either. Because NT97 can only be t2. So that rules out NT97 as the start for the first token.\n\nOption 3: S -> NT35 NT84. Now, NT35. From the grammar, NT35 -> t3. So the first part would produce t3, but our string starts with t0. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, are there other options for NT35? Let me check. The grammar includes:\n\nNT35 -> NT96 NT84. Oh, yes, so NT35 can produce t3 by either NT35 -> t3 or via NT96 NT84. Since both lead to t3 (since NT96 may not directly, let me check what NT96 produces. Wait, NT96 -> t54 NT53. Hmm, but t54 would be another symbol. So if NT35 uses the two-symbol rule, then the first token would be the first of NT35's output, which might not be t3 immediately.\n\nWait, but inCNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So NT35's rules are: NT35 -> t3 or NT96 NT84. So when S is split into NT35 and NT84, the NT35 can either produce t3, leading to the first token being t3 or, if it's split further, produce NT96 NT84. But then we have more symbols to process.\n\nWait, but our string's first token is t0, so none of these S options can directly produce t0. That's a problem because S is the starting symbol, and the first derivation from S must produce the first token, t0. \n\nSo perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe I should check if the string starts with any possible production from S that can derive t0.\n\nWait, let me re-express this. The first token in the string is t0. So starting from S, the first step in the derivation must produce a t0. Is that possible with any of S's productions?\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96: The first part is NT64, which can produce t4 or NT84 NT62. Neither leads to t0.\n\n2. S -> NT97 NT7: NT97 can produce t2, NT7 can produce t2. Neither is t0.\n\n3. S -> NT35 NT84: NT35 can produce t3 or NT96 NT84. NT96 -> t54 or NT53. Not t0.\n\nHm, none of these seem to directly produce t0. Wait, are we allowed to have lookaheads or something? Or is there a way that the combined derivation from S can result in t0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in reading the grammar rules. Let me go through the grammar again to ensure I have it right.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT47 -> NT21 NT3\n- NT1 -> NT5 NT77\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT53 -> NT86 NT33\n- NT7 -> NT66 NT48\n- NT33 -> NT84 NT81\n- NT38 -> NT34 NT27\n- NT12 -> NT82 NT48\n- NT5 -> NT68 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-654","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because that structure makes parsing easier. Let me break down what I know.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a set of production rules. The start symbol is S, and the goal is to see if the given string can be derived from S through a series of these productions. The string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, which I assume are the terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols 't0', 't1', or 't2'. For example, NT68 can produce 't3', 't4', etc. Some of them produce other non-terminals, which would be part of the intermediate steps in generating the string.\n\nThe string provided is: `t3 t4 t1 t0 t3 t1 t2 t2 t4 t2 t2 t2 t0 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t2 t3 t3 t0 t4 t1 t2 t3 t2 t2 t1 t0 t1 t4 t2 t1`.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using methods like recursive descent or the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar seems complex, maybe a top-down approach or look for possible derivations.\n\nLet me note that the entire string is 37 tokens long. The grammar's top rule is S, which splits into two NTs, so the string should have a length that can be broken down into pairs. Wait, each production of S is two NTs, so the string length should be a multiple of two steps. The string here is 37 tokens, which is odd, so that might already be a problem. But 37 is odd, but the grammar's initial S is two symbols. Wait, but in every step, the number of symbols can increase because non-terminals are replaced, so the length can vary, but since each production is two symbols, perhaps the number of symbols can grow exponentially. Wait, no, because each production can produce one or two symbols. So the initial S is two symbols, and each step can potentially add more. Hmm, not sure if the initial length being odd is an issue, but let's proceed.\n\nI think a bottom-up approach might be better here. Let's start from the given string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar's reverse rules.\n\nLooking at the reverse mapping, if we can find any production that directly produces the substrings in the given string, we can work backwards.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals in the string: t3, t4, t1, t0, etc. So the number of terminals is 37. Wait, no, that's the number of symbols in the string. So 37 symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a list and try to match it against the grammar's productions. Let me try to see.\n\nStarting with the string, I can look for symbols that directly correspond to a single production. For example, some terminals are directly produced by non-terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nLooking at the reverse mapping, for example: NT68 -> 't3', 't4', etc. Similarly, other non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the first step is to check if the first token can be matched by any non-terminal production.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S -> NT64 NT96\n\nSo S splits into two non-terminals. The first two symbols in the string are 't3' and 't4'. So, for S to generate this, the first NT64 must produce 't3' and NT96 must produce 't4'. Or alternatively, maybe both NTs produce these terminals, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but each NT can produce a sequence of terminals or other NTs. So perhaps the first NT64 would need to break down into 't3' and NT96 would break into 't4', but NT96 in the rules is 't4' or other combinations. Wait, no, looking at NT96, the rules for NT96 are 't4' and other combinations.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT64 and NT96:\n\nLooking back, the rules are:\n\nFor NT64:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nAnd NT62 -> ?\n\nLooking at NT62, the only rule is NT68 -> t4, and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, wait, I need to make sure I parse all the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT68 has several productions, including NT68 -> 't4', etc.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be reduced step by step by matching the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nLet me attempt this.\n\nThe string is: t3 t4 t1 t0 t3 t1 t2 t2 t4 t2 t2 t2 t0 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t2 t3 t3 t0 t4 t1 t2 t3 t2 t2 t1 t0 t1 t4 t2 t1.\n\nI think I'll try to parse from the beginning.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t3. Let me look at all the NTs that produce t3.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT64 -> t4 and others, but does it produce t3?

{"custom_id":"request-678","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens: `t1 t2 t1 t0 t3 t3 t4 t3 t2 t3 t2 t1 t2 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t1 t2 t2 t0 t2 t3 t2 t2 t3 t4 t3 t0 t0 t4 t3 t3 t4`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. The problem also lists several productions where non-terminals are replaced by 't' tokens, like NT64 -> t4, etc. So, my goal is to see if these productions can generate the given string.\n\nI notice that the grammar starts with S -> NT64 NT96, so any valid string must begin with the symbols derived from NT64 and NT96. Each of these NT rules can then lead to more symbols until the terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at NT64 and NT96, each has productions ending with 't4', 't2', 't4', and 't4' respectively. So, the first two tokens should be either t4, possibly branching through other non-terminals. But in the string, the first token is t1, not t4. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps NT64 or NT96 can produce other terminals. Let me check the productions provided. NT64 -> NT84 NT62, NT66 -> NT52 NT63, NT68 -> NT47 NT12, etc. But none of these seem to directly produce a terminal; all are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided NT productions, I see some that directly go to terminals:\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63 (not a terminal)\n- NT35 -> 't3'? Wait, no, looking back, I see NT35 -> 't3'. So if NT35 is involved, it can produce t3.\n\nWait, the string starts with t1, which isn't directly produced by any NT rule, because all S rules lead to NT64 and NT96, which themselves produce non-terminals until terminal symbols are reached.\n\nWait, looking at the list again, some rules have terminals. For example, NT68 -> NT47 NT12: no terminal. But NT33 -> NT84 NT81: no terminal. NT27 -> NT24 NT62: no. But looking further, I see NT3 -> 't2', NT98 -> 't1', NT97 -> 't2', etc. So actually, some NT rules produce 't' tokens.\n\nSo, the string must be built by expanding these NT rules until all are replaced by 't's according to the productions.\n\nBut the first token is t1. So, which NT rule can produce t1? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the list:\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12: no\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't1'\n- NT14 -> NT33 NT27: no\n- NT78 -> 't0'\n- NT77 -> 't2'\n- NT47 -> 't4', 't4' as per some rules\n- NT68 -> 't0' in another rule\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT77 -> 't1'\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't1' (but ends up producing t0 via another path)\n- NT27 -> 't1' (again, perhaps in a certain path)\n- Others might produce t3, t4, etc.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing a direct production for t1 except for NT48 -> 't1', NT97 -> 't2' (but t1 comes from other rules). Wait, no. Looking at the list:\n\nWait, the user provided a lot of rules, but when looking for terminal symbols, it's only when a rule is in the form X -> 'tX' where X is a digit. For example:\n\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n- NT68 -> 't0' \u2192 So NT68 can produce 't0'.\n- Similarly, NT47 -> 't1' (looking at the list again: NT47 has two options, one is NT48 NT1, another is 't1'. Wait, in the initial list, the user wrote:\n\n NT47 -> NT1 -> NT62\nand\n NT47 -> 't1'\n\nWait, actually, the user provided a lot of NT rules that go to other NT rules, but some also have productions to 'tX'. For example:\n\nNT68 is explicitly written as NT68 -> 't0' and also as NT68 -> NT47 NT12.\n\nSimilarly, NT47 has a production NT47 -> 't1', so NT47 can produce 't1'.\n\nSo, in the given string, the first token is t1. That would require that one of the NT rules produces t1. Looking at the NT production rules, yes:\n\nNT47 -> 't1'\n\nSo, the first step is S -> NT64 NT96. Then, each NT64 and NT96 must derive into sequences that produce the rest of the tokens.\n\nBut let's map it out step by step. The string is 38 tokens long. Since it's CNF, each production is either two NT rules or a terminal.\n\nGiven that each NT production in CNF leads to two NT rules or a terminal, the derivation will involve leftmost or rightmost expansions. But since the string is long, it's probably a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me consider that the string must be derived by expanding S into NT64 NT96, each of which then expands further into non-terminals, until the terminals are reached.\n\nBut the first two symbols are t1 and t2. So, S -> NT64 NT96, which then must expand to produce t1 followed by t2, but how?\n\nEach step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, starting from S, we have:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nNow, the first NT64 (A) and the second NT96 (B) need to expand into the first few tokens.\n\nThe first two tokens are t1 t2, so nt1 (from NT64's expansion) should produce t1, and then nt2 (from NT96's expansion) should produce t2, but let's see the structure.\n\nWait, but how do the NT64 and NT96 themselves derive into t1 and t2?\n\nLooking at NT64 -> NT84 NT62 and NT96 -> NT54 NT53, etc. Let me see if these can produce t1 and t2.\n\nWait, let me think about NT64 first. From the grammar:\n\nNT64 can expand into NT84 and NT62. Then, these can further expand:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT62 -> NT52 NT63\nNT4 -> NT7 NT (others)\nWait, this might not be productive. Alternatively, NT96:\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nNT54 -> 't4'\nNT53 -> 't2'\n\nSo, NT96 could immediately produce t4 t2. But in the string, after the first t1 comes t2, not t4.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the NT productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided a list of NT rules, some with 't' terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the first NT64 expands into something that leads to t1, and NT96 expands to lead into t2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, and then NT64 is replaced in such a way that it produces a t1 as the first token, and NT96 is replaced to produce t2 as the second token.\n\nBut looking at the possible expansions, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT rules can be applied in different orders, but without knowing the exact derivation, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the number of steps makes sense. Since the string is 38 tokens, and each step in the derivation (assuming leftmost) reduces the number of non-terminals by one, the initial S is two non-terminals. But this might not be the way to approach it, as CNF derivations can vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by a specific sequence of NT expansions that lead to the terminals in the given order.\n\nGiven that, it's complicated, but perhaps the string starts with t1, which comes from NT47 -> 't1', but how can that be if S is NT64 NT96? Unless there's a way for NT64 and NT96 to expand into sequences that eventually reach NT47.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT96"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-680","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me take this step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single non-terminal symbol or two non-terminals. That should help in parsing the string efficiently, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm just doing this manually, I'll try to see if I can find a way step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and it has three productions:\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo, S must start any derivation, and the string we have starts with t4, t0, etc. Let me see what each part of the grammar converts to in terms of terminals.\n\nLooking at all the symbols, many non-terminals reduce directly to terminals. For example, NT66 becomes 't4', NT7 becomes 't2', NT1 becomes 't2', etc.\n\nBut for now, I think the best approach is to see if the string can be split into parts that match the possible productions of the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t4 t0 t1 t1 t3 t1 t1 t3 t3 t0 t3 t1 t4 t1 t2 t1 t3 t0 t4 t4 t1 t1 t3 t1 t2 t3 t4 t3 t1 t3 t2 t1 t0 t0 t3.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens. Starting from the beginning:\n\nt4, t0, t1, t1, t3, t1, t1, t3, t3, t0, t3, t1, t4, t1, t2, t1, t3, t0, t4, t4, t1, t1, t3, t1, t2, t3, t4, t3, t1, t3, t2, t1, t0, t0, t3.\n\nThat's 35 tokens in total.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S, which is a production of two non-terminals, each of those would generate a sequence of terminals. Let me see if I can find a way to split this string into two parts, each corresponding to the first step of a production.\n\nEach production step adds two non-terminals, each of which can be further expanded.\n\nGiven that, let's see if I can match the string by considering the first step as S -> NT64 NT96, S -> NT97 NT7, or S -> NT35 NT84.\n\nI'll evaluate each possibility.\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96: Both NT64 and NT96 are non-terminals. Let's see what each could produce. Looking at NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Then NT84 is a terminal ('t2') and NT62 is another non-terminal. NT62 -> 't0'. So NT64 would produce 't2 t0'. NT96 -> NT54 NT53. NT54 is 't2' and NT53 is 't2', so that's 't2 t2'.\n\nPutting those together, S -> NT64 NT96 would become 't2 t0 t2 t2'. Let me see if the string starts with that. The first four tokens are t4 t0 t1 t1. Doesn't match 't2 t0 t2 t2'. So this production is unlikely to be the starting point.\n\n2. S -> NT97 NT7: NT97 -> 't2' and NT7 -> 't2', so combining, this would produce 't2 t2'. But the string starts with t4, so this is also unlikely.\n\n3. S -> NT35 NT84: NT35 -> 't3' (since looking at the productions, NT35 -> 't3'), and NT84 -> 't2' (since NT84 -> NT4 NT1 and NT4 is 't1', NT1 is 't2', but wait, let me check: NT84's production is NT4 NT1. NT4 -> 't1', NT1 -> 't2'. So NT84 would be 't1 t2', but in the data provided, looking for NT84 -> 't2'? Wait, no, in the productions, I see NT98 -> 't1', but for NT84, maybe I need to check all the productions for NT84.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT84 -> NT4 NT1. Then NT4 is 't1' and NT1 is 't2', so NT84 -> 't1 t2'. Similarly, NT35 is a terminal 't3' because I see NT35 -> 't3'.\n\nWait, let me confirm: NT35's production is \"t3\". So S -> NT35 NT84 would expand to 't3' followed by 't1 t2', making the string 't3 t1 t2'.\n\nWait, but let me see the actual string. It starts with t4 t0 t1 t1. So the production would start with 't3 t1 t2', but the string starts with t4, so this production is also unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again at NT35 and NT84.\n\nLooking through the input:\n\nThe grammar productions given are:\n\nNT35 -> 't3'\n\nSo yes, it's 't3'. NT84's production is NT47->?, but looking back, the top-level productions don't mention NT84 as a non-terminal. Wait no, the given grammar defines several non-terminals, including NT84.\n\nLet me look at NT84. The productions include:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1.\n\nLooking for NT4 and NT1's productions: NT4 -> 't1', NT1 -> 't2'. So NT84 would produce 't1 t2'.\n\nTherefore, S -> NT35 NT84 would produce 't3 t1 t2'. But the string starts with 't4', so this production is not matching the start of the string.\n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe the first production isn't the one we're using. Alternatively, perhaps my initial assessment is wrong, and I need to consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is longer than 35 tokens. Wait, 35 tokens would require at least two steps: S is replaced by two non-terminals, each of which can be terminals or non-terminals. So each step could lead to a string that's longer, but for a string of length 35, it's going to be a number of steps that sum up to 35.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to consider if the overall string can be split into components that are in the language. For example, perhaps the string can be divided into subparts that are each generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try building a parse tree manually.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps check if all tokens can be derived from the grammar. Let's see how each token can be represented as a non-terminal or terminal.\n\nLooking at each token in the string:\n\nt4: produced by NT47, NT35 (since according above data, NT35 is 't3') or NT92?\n\nWait, I think I need to see for each token, which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t0: look through the productions, let's see which NTs produce t0. NT54 -> t1, NT80 -> t3, NT66 -> t4, NT7 -> t2, etc. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the data provided, many non-terminals produce terminals. Let me list all the non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through the provided data:\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT68 -> 't4'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT64 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT48 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT54 -> 't1' ?

But wait, looking back, under NT68's definition, I see:\n\nWait, in the data provided, some lines are:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\nBut in the given list, there's a line:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, looking back at the data provided, I see:\n\nLooking for terms where NT_x -> t_x:\n\nLooking through the 50-some lines, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT53 -> 't2'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT47 doesn't directly produce a terminal; it's only when replaced by other non-terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t1 t2 t0 t0 t1 t2 t4 t4 t3 t3 t0 t2 t0 t3 t1 t2 t3 t0 t2 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t0 t0 t1 t0 t4 t4`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has specific characteristics: all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, and every non-terminal symbol must have at least two non-terminals as its right-hand side. Additionally, in CNF, each production expands one symbol into two symbols, which means the string must have a length that's a power of two minus one because each expansion doubles the number of symbols. \n\nLooking at the given string, let's count the number of tokens: it's 44, which in binary is 101100 and 44 -1 is 43, which isn't a power of two minus one. Wait, 2^6 = 64, so 64-1=63. 44 is much less than 63, and it's not of the form 2^n -1. For example, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63 are lengths for CNF. So 44 isn't one of them. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check the grammar to make sure I'm not missing something. The grammar starts with S, and each production expands S into two NT symbols. So S \u2192 NT64 NT64, for example. Then each of those NTs can expand into other NTs until we get to the terminals, which are t0 and t1.\n\nEach expansion increases the number of symbols by one. So starting from S (1 symbol), each expansion adds one, so the total length must be a power of two. But the grammar is in CNF, so each step doubles the number of non-terminals, leading to the total length being a power of two. For example, if we have n productions leading to a string, the length should be 2^n.\n\nBut in this case, the string length is 44, which isn't a power of two. Wait, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 44 is in between, so it's not a power of two. That means the string can't be generated by this grammar because it's not the correct length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as the derivation being n steps where the length goes from 1 (S) to a string of length 2^n, but the string length here is 44, which isn't a power of two. So, even if I try to derive the string, the length must match a power of two, which 44 does not. Therefore, the answer is definitely 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string's length is 44, which is not a power of two.

Let's list all the productions that end with terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 TT4\n- NT4 \u2192 TT1\n- NT68 \u2192 TT4 (multiple entries, but all lead to 't' with some index)\n- NT63 \u2192 tt0\n- NT47 \u2192 tt1 (multiple entries)\n- NT1 \u2192 tt2\n- NT7 \u2192 tt2\n- NT77 \u2192 tt3\n- NT96 \u2192 tt4\n- NT84 \u2192 tt2\n- NT53 \u2192 tt2\n- NT22 \u2192 tt4\n- NT52 \u2192 tt2\n- NT74 \u2192 tt4\n- NT80 \u2192 tt3\n- NT26 \u2192 tt3\n- NT97 \u2192 tt0\n- NT98 \u2192 tt1\n- NT82 \u2192 tt4\n- NT81 \u2192 tt1\n- NT36 \u2192 tt4\n- NT77 \u2192 tt3\n- NT7 \u2192 tt0\n- NT84 \u2192 tt0\n- NT34 \u2192 tt4\n- NT62 \u2192 tt0\n- NT68 \u2192 tt0\n- NT74 \u2192 tt3\n- NT96 \u2192 tt3\n- NT1 \u2192 tt0\n- NT77 \u2192 tt1\n- NT4 \u2192 tt1\n- NT7 \u2192 tt0\n- NT74 \u2192 tt3\n- NT80 \u2192 tt2\n- NT22 \u2192 tt3\n- NT5 \u2192 tt2\n- NT21 \u2192 tt4\n- NT52 \u2192 tt4\n- NT43 \u2192 tt0\n- NT53 \u2192 tt2\n- NT84 \u2192 tt0\n- NT34 \u2192 tt4\n- NT96 \u2192 tt3\n- NT62 \u2192 tt0\n- NT68 \u2192 tt2 or tt3 or tt0, depending on production.\n\nWait, some non-terminals expand to multiple terminals. Let's list each NT and what each can produce in terms of terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT4 \u2192 t4\n- NT68 \u2192 t4 (various productions, but all lead to 't0' or 't1' depending)\nWait, no, wait: Let me check each production again.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking at the productions for each NT:\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT47 NT96 \u2192 which expand to t4 and t84 (but t84 can be multiple things). Hmm, maybe this approach is too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards, considering the productions for each terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nt3 can come from NT3 (since in the productions, NT3 \u2192 \"t3\"), or from other non-terminals that eventually derive to t3. Similarly for other t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help, but given the length of the string, it's 36 tokens, it's tedious.\n\nAnother approach: check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar, considering all possible productions. For example, each 't' must be reachable from at least one of the start symbols through the productions.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which can derive NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, etc. Each of those non-terminals must then derive a sequence of terminals, matching the string.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to check each production to see which terminals they can generate. Let's list each NT and their possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t3 (from NT3 -> 't3')\n\nNT4 \u2192 t4 (from NT4 -> 't4')\n\nNT68 \u2192 t0, t1, t2, t3, etc.? Let me check all NT68 productions:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12 \u2192 NT47 can be 't0' or 't1' (e.g., NT47->'t1'), NT12->'t3'. So t0 t3? Or other combinations.\n\nWait, this might take too long. Maybe a better approach is to note that each 't' in the string must be derivable from one of the NTs.\n\nLet's list all the 't's in the string and see if each is produced by some NT.\n\nThe string is: ['t3', 't1', 't3', 't4', 't2', 't1', 't4', 't0', 't3', 't4', 't4', 'o0', 'o0', 't3', 't3', 't4', 't1', 't2', 't0', 't0', 't4', 't2', 't1', 't4', 't1', 't3', 't3', 't3', 'o0', 'o0'].\n\nWait, 't0' is given multiple times. Let's check each unique 't':\n\n- t0: Can come from NT66, NT64, NT53, NT80, NT77, NT54, NT68, NT22, NT7, NT98, etc.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for all NTs that produce 't0':\n\nFrom the provided productions, I see:\n\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63. Wait, does NT52 produce anything? Let's see NT52 productions:\n\nNT52 -> NT54 NT63 \u2192 NT54 -> t4; NT63 -> t0. So NT52 can produce t4 t0.\n\nBut does any NT directly go to t0? Yes:\n\n- NT66 (is there a production? Let me check): I see NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 \u2192 which are terminals or other NTs. Wait, do any NTs directly produce t0?\n\nLooking at all the productions, some NTs are replaced by terminals:\n\nNT47 is replaced by NT1, which when replaced can lead to t1 or t3, etc. Wait, no NTs directly produce t0 except NT66.\n\nWait, the productions that end with terminals are:\n\n- NT68 has several productions, including NT68 \u2192 't0', 't1', 't2' etc.?\n\nLet's check each NT and see which terminal they can produce.\n\nLooking for NTs that directly produce 't0' via a production:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, which is 't4' and 't0' \u2192 so indirectly can produce t0.\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 nt84 produces 't2' and nt62 can produce 't0'.\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33 \u2192 nt86 produces 't0' and nt33 produces 't1' \u2192 so indirectly t0.\n- NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75 \u2192 nt43 produces 't0' and nt75 can produce 't0' (via NT98\u2192nt97\u2192't2'), wait no NT98 is nt98\u2192 nt78, which then leads to nt78\u2192't0'.

{"custom_id":"request-715","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of t's and numbers. Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form looks like. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This means that every production rule on the left side is binary (two non-terminals) or directly generates a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that most non-terminals have production rules that break them down into two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, and each non-terminal like NT64, NT96, etc., seem to have their own productions. However, some rules directly produce terminal symbols or 't's and numbers, which are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nMy task is to parse the given string using this grammar. The string is `t4 t3 t1 t1 t2 t3 t2 t4 t2 t3 t4 t2 t0 t0 t0 t3 t1 t4 t4 t2 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t1 t0 t4 t4 t0 t1 t2 t1 t2`.\n\nI think the best approach here is to model this as a parsing problem using the grammar, trying to see if we can derive the string by expanding the non-terminals step by step. Since it's a CNF grammar, we can use a recursive descent parser or perhaps a top-down approach, but given the structure, it might be easier to track the possible non-terminals at each step.\n\nAnother way is to represent the string as a sequence of terminals and see if the top symbol of the stack (in a bottom-up parsing approach) can match any production rule. However, since I'm doing this manually, I'll try a different approach by looking at the grammar's structure and seeing if the string can be built by recursively applying the production rules.\n\nLet me start by examining the production rules for each non-terminal to identify which can generate the given t's and numbers.\n\nFor example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and both NT84 and NT62 can produce terminals or other non-terminals. Similarly, some non-terminals directly produce 't' values. Let's see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n- NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n- NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81\n- NT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27\n- NT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\n- NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\n- NT38 \u2192 NT63 NT96\n- NT14 \u2192 NT33 NT27\n- NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n- NT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39\n- NT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n- NT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n- NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26\n- NT53 \u2192 NT39 NT80\n- NT70 \u2192 NT84 NT36\n- NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\n- NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT63 \u2192 't1'\n- NT47 \u2192 't1'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT3 \u2192 't0'\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n- NT86 \u2192 't0'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\nHmm, I notice some inconsistencies here. For example, NT68 has two production rules: one that produces 't0' and another that produces 't3'. Wait, that seems conflicting, but perhaps that's a typo in the given rules. Or maybe NT68 can only produce 't0' or 't3' based on different paths. I should probably check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12 is one rule, but then there are other rules where NT68 appears as:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT63: but wait, NT63 is another rule where NT63 can produce 't1' or also NT63 \u2192 't1' and other possibilities? Wait, the given rules include NT63 \u2192 't1', and also NT63 is only present in rules like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 and NT70 \u2192 NT84 NT63, etc. So perhaps I need to see all the rules a non-terminal can have.\n\nWait, let me list all production rules for each non-terminal:\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nThen NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\nNT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81\nNT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27\nNT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\nNT38 \u2192 NT63 NT96\nNT14 \u2192 NT33 NT27\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\nNT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39\nNT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70\nNT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\nNT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26\nNT53 \u2192 NT39 NT80\nNT70 \u2192 NT84 NT36\nNT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\nNT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT63 \u2192 't1'\nNT47 \u2192 't1'\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\nNT86 \u2192 't0'\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nWait, that can't be right. So NT68 has multiple rules: NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12, NT68 \u2192 't0', and NT68 \u2192 't3'. That's conflicting because in one production, NT68 can be 't0', in another 't3', which suggests that perhaps in this grammar, NT68 can switch between these rules depending on something else. But in a context-free grammar, a non-terminal can have only one production. So maybe I misread.\n\nLooking back, the production rules:\n\nNT68 appears in these rules:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1: this is separate.\n\nOther rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12: perhaps this is a production when the first production option for NT68 is chosen.\n\nThen, NT47 \u2192 't1' in one rule and it also has a production to NT1 NT62? Wait, in the initial grammar, S is the start symbol, which is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So NT64 and NT96 are non-terminals. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 and NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nWait, in this grammar, it's possible that some productions for the same non-terminal have multiple expansion paths. But in a context-free grammar, a non-terminal can have only one right-hand side. So I'm confused because I'm seeing multiple rules for NT68. Let me check the original grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar as provided, the non-terminals and their rules are listed one after another. Each production for a non-terminal is in the form X \u2192 ...\n\nWait, I think I see the confusion. For example, under NT68, is there only one production or multiple? Looking back:\n\nNT68 has two rules:\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nBut in a CNF grammar, that's allowed as different productions. So each of these is a separate production for NT68. So NT68 can produce 't0', 't3', or perhaps something else depending on other rules. Wait, actually, let me count all the production rules for each non-terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\n- NT68: two rules, producing 't0' and 't3'.\nWait, that's not correct.

Wait, no, looking again, I think each rule is either on the left or directly terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules that produce terminals and see if I can work backwards or downwards.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT27 can go to 't4'.\nNT3 can go to 't2'.\nNT96 can go to 't4'.\nNT12 goes to 't3'.\nNT52-> 't2'.\nNT74-> 't4'.\nWait, but I'm seeing a lot of rules where non-terminals produce a terminal and a non-terminal, or two non-terminals.\n\nThis is a bit tricky, but perhaps I can find if the entire string can be constructed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assign possible non-terminals to the string segments. Let's think about it as building the string from the start, but that might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use dynamic programming or memoization to see if it's possible, but I might not have time for that here.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the possible derivation steps. Starting from S, which can go to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 can produce 't4'.\n\nNT96 can produce 't4' (from NT96->'t4').\n\nSo if S->NT64 NT96, and each is 't4', that gives t4 t4, which is only part of the string.\n\nBut the string starts with t4 t3 t4..., so maybe S->NT64 is correct, but after that, we get t4, then maybe the second part is different.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me try the first production.\n\nWait, let's check the entire string's first few tokens:\n\nStarts with t4 t3 t4 t3 t3 t0...\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any non-terminals start with t4 or t3?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT47 can produce t1 or NT1 NT62.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, I notice that NT47 can go to 't1' and also in several rules, NT47 is being used as a non-terminal. For example, NT47 -> NT1 NT62, and also NT47 -> NT68 NT12 (but wait is that correct? Wait, no, I think it's that NT47 is on the left, but some other rules are on the right. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me re-express the grammar more clearly. Each line is a production where the symbol on the left is rewritten as the symbols on the right. So, for example:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\n\nS -> NT97 NT7\n\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nAnd so on, down to the terminals.\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT68 -> 't0', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, for instance, NT1 can produce 't2' or the non-terminal NT5 NT77.\n\nBut wait, in the rules, NT1 has the production NT1 -> NT5 NT77 and also NT1 -> 't2'. So that non-terminal can either produce 't2' or go into other non-terminals.\n\nSo, the idea is that each non-terminal can be replaced by two non-terminals (like a grammar in CNF), or sometimes a terminal. So, perhaps the derivation can be constructed by choosing the correct non-terminals and their terminals.\n\nLet me try to think of possible steps.\n\nThe string is t4 t3 t4 t3 t3 t0 t4 t0 t4 t2 t3 t3 t1 t2 t0 t2 t4 t4 t4 t2 t3 t0 t3 t3 t3 t0 t3 t1 t4 t2 t1 t2 t3 t0 t3 t3 t0.\n\nThat's 34 tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps it would help to write down the possible non-terminals that can produce each token.\n\nLooking through the rules for each terminal:\n\nFor example, looking for which non-terminals can produce t4:\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules:\n\n- 't0' is produced by NT68, NT47, NT64, NT27, NT98, NT39, NT37 (does that exist? No, looking at the list: let me check.)\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules, here's where terminals are:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 -> 't4'\n- NT27 -> 't4'\n- NT3 -> 't2' (but wait, NT3 is a terminal and on other rules)\n- Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

{"custom_id":"request-734","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's start by breaking down what the problem is asking.\n\nFirst, the grammar has several production rules. Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) has rules that define how it can expand into other symbols. The terminals are 't0', 't1', etc., which I assume are the end symbols of the language.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t3 t1 t1 t0 t4 t1 t1 t2 t3 t2 t2 t0 t3 t3 t2 t2 t4 t2 t3 t1 t0 t1 t0 t1 t3 t0 t1 t3 t0 t4 t0 t2 t3 t0 t1 t4 t0 t1`. That's quite a long string! I need to parse this string and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal. That simplifies parsing a bit because each step in the derivation increments the string by one or two symbols, but in reality, in CNF, each production is length 2, so each step adds one terminal if the non-terminal can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, the productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production can expand into either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nTherefore, when generating the string, each expansion either introduces two non-terminals (which will themselves expand further) or directly add a terminal symbol.\n\nGiven that, the standard approach to check if a string is generated by a grammar in CNF is to perform a kind of top-down parsing, breaking down the string into parts that match the terminals produced by the rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t3, t1, t1, ..., ending with t1. So we can think of this as a sequence that must be built by the grammar.\n\nBut with 39 symbols, it's quite long. Maybe I can start by grouping the string into possible pairs or sequences that could be generated by the non-terminals, working backwards from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, and S has three production rules:\n- S -> NT64 NT96\n- S -> NT97 NT7\n- S -> NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these rules produces two non-terminals. So, the first step would be that the string must start with the two terminals generated by these two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production can only handle one symbol at a time, but since S has two non-terminals in each case, the derived string will be built by expanding each of those non-terminals.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I can look for the possible non-terminals that can produce a terminal symbol, matching the string's order.\n\nLooking at the production rules, let's see which non-terminals directly correspond to a terminal:\n\n- NT64 can produce 't4' because according to the rules, NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Wait, but each of these is a non-terminal, right? Wait no, looking back, the last part says NT64 -> 't4' because in the production NT64 was later defined to 't4' via another rule. Similarly, NT12 -> 't3', NT54 -> 't3', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list of production rules, some NTs map directly to terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\nNT3 -> 't0'\nWait, actually, looking at the very end of the given grammar:\n\nNT77 -> 't2'\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT98 -> 't1'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT98 -> 't0'\nNT77 -> 't1'\nNT47 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT48 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT54 -> 't1'\nNT66 -> 't4'\nNT7 -> 't2'\nNT68 -> 't2'\nNT26 -> 't3'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT74 -> 't4'\nNT33 -> 't0'\nNT80 -> 't3'\nNT22 -> 't4'\nNT82 -> 't4'\nNT54 -> 't3'\nNT81 -> 't1'\nNT36 -> 't4'\nNT77 -> 't3'\nNT96 -> 't4'\nNT47 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't0'\nNT77 -> 't1'\nNT4 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't0'\nNT74 -> 't3'\nNT80 -> 't2'\nNT22 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT21 -> 't4'\nNT52 -> 't4'\nNT43 -> 't0'\nNT53 -> 't2'\nNT84 -> 't0'\nNT34 -> 't4'\nNT96 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't0'\n\nOh wait, each NT rule may have a mix of NTs and terminals, but the terminal symbols are listed after the arrows. For example, NT35 -> 't3' because NT35 produces t3. Similarly, NT66 -> 't4' because NT66's production leads to t4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each production like NT35 -> 't3' means that NT35 can be replaced by 't3', a terminal. So, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, it's a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, each terminal in the string must come from a production that directly produces that terminal. Therefore, I can map each terminal in the string to the possible non-terminals that can produce it, and try to see if the sequence can be built by combining these.\n\nBut parsing a long string manually might be tedious. Maybe I can look for the structure of the string. Let me see the first few symbols: t3, t1, t1, t0, t4, t1, t1, t2, t3, t2, etc.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S, which expands into two non-terminals. So the first step is that the string must be generated by expanding these two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start rules:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these produces two non-terminals. The first symbol in the string is t3. So I need to see which of these non-terminals can produce t3.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT97 -> 't2' (from NT97 -> 't2'), but first symbol is t3, not t2.\n\n- NT35 -> 't3' (from NT35's production, which is 't3').\n\n- NT64 -> I think NT66 produces to 't4', but NT64 might produce 't4' as well. Wait, looking at the rules, NT64 is not directly a terminal; it's NT64 -> NT84 NT62. So NT64 can only produce non-terminals until it eventually maps to a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 -> 't4' in some cases. Wait, the direct terminal productions are:\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT66 -> 't4' because in the list, I see NT66 -> 't4'? No, wait, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list, NT35 -> 't3', NT66 -> 't4', NT77 -> 't2', NT26 -> 't3', NT54 -> 't3', NT81 -> 't1', NT84 -> 't0', etc. So the terminals we can have are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4.\n\nSo in the first step, S can produce NT35 (which is t3) and NT84 (which is t3 as well). Wait, but S's first rule is S -> NT64 NT96. So if I pick the second rule (S -> NT97 NT7), then the first two symbols must be generated by NT97 and NT7.\n\nBut the string starts with t3. Let's see if any of the non-terminals in the first expansion can produce t3.\n\nLooking at the first rule: S -> NT64 NT96. Let's see NT64 and NT96.\n\nNT64's production: Looking through the rules, I see NT64 -> NT84 NT62. NT84 -> 't0', NT62 -> 't0' (since NT66 is 't4'?

{"custom_id":"request-731","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t3 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t3 t3 t2 t1 t4 t0 t0 t0 t4 t1 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t1 t2 t1 t2 t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t2 t0 t2 t1 t3 t3`. \n\nFirst, I recall that context-free grammars (CFGs) can be analyzed using methods like the CYK algorithm, which checks if a string is in the language generated by a CFG. But given that, I think setting up a CYK table might be the way to go here. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. The rules provided all seem to fit this structure, either producing two non-terminals or a single terminal like `t0`, `t1`, etc. \n\nThe starting symbol is `S`, which initially expands into `NT64 NT96` (S -> NT64 NT96). Each of these NTs then can further expand according to the rules. My plan is to parse the string from left to right, grouping the tokens into pairs that match the NT productions.\n\nThe string has 35 tokens, which is an odd number. Since each production rule for NTs produces two symbols (another NT or a terminal), the parse tree should have a structure where each NT splits into two, leading to an even number of tokens. However, 35 is odd, so that immediately raises a red flag. I might need to double-check if this is correct or if I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me consider: the initial S is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Each NT64 and NT96 would then produce something, and so on. Each step splits into two parts, so the total number of symbols (including non-terminals and terminals) should double each time. For example, starting with S (1 symbol), then 2 symbols after S's first expansion, then 4, 8, etc. So the total number of symbols should be a power of two. But 35 isn't a power of two. 32 is 2^5, but 35 is beyond that. Hmm, this suggests that the string cannot be derived from S because the number of symbols is not a power of two, right? Because in CNF, the size of the parse tree must result in the string length being 2^n.\n\nLet me confirm: the grammar is in CNF because each production has exactly two symbols on the right. So for any string, the length should be 2^k for some k. Here, the string has length 35, which is not a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. \n\nBut wait, is that always the case? Let me think about it. For S \u2192 NT64 NT96, the top level has two NTs. Each of those could produce a terminal or NTs. If each NT produces a terminal, then the total would be four symbols. But in this case, maybe some of the NTs produce more NTs. However, the string length is 35. \n\nWait, actually, the string is a sequence of terminals, and each step in parsing reduces the number of NTs. So from S, we get two NTs, each of which can either produce two NTs or a terminal. So the total number of symbols in the string should be 2^n where n is the number of levels. But if a NT produces a terminal each time, the total would be 2^m where m is the number of splits. \n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let me think differently. The start symbol S can't produce a string of length 35 because each production step adds one symbol each time it's split. Let me try to think in terms of the number of symbols in the parse tree. Each production adds one more symbol. So, starting with S (1 symbol). Then, expanding each NT, if they both produce two NTs, it's 3 symbols. Wait, no. Maybe I should model the parse as the number of symbols in the sentential form.\n\nEach production in CNF increases the number of symbols by one. So starting with 1 symbol (S), each production increases it by one. For example:\n\n- S produces NT1 NT2: two symbols.\n- If each of those NTs then produces a terminal, total is four symbols.\n- But if one NT continues to produce more NTs, the count changes.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back. In CNF, the number of steps needed to derive a string of length n is such that n must be 2^k. Because each expansion step in CNF (since each production is two symbols) doubles the number of symbols, but that's not quite accurate. Let me visualize the parse tree.\n\nEach node in the parse tree is a symbol, and each terminal is a leaf. The height of the tree determines the number of symbols. For example:\n\n- A tree of height 1 (just S) has 1 symbol.\n- A tree of height 2 would have two symbols.\n- A tree of height 3 would have four symbols at the leaves.\n- Height h would have 2^(h-1) symbols.\n\nBut in this case, the string is 35 symbols, which isn't a power of two. So it's impossible to derive a string of length 35 with a grammar that requires the number of symbols to be a power of two. \n\nSo, even without looking at the specific grammar, the string length being 35, which is not a power of two, suggests that it cannot be generated by any grammar in CNF. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 35 tokens, which is not a power of two. In a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, the length of the generated string must be a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-757","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens like 't0', 't1', etc., and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a production form where each non-terminal symbol expands into two non-terminals, or a terminal symbol. The grammar provided has rules like S -> NT64 NT96, which fit CNF since each non-terminal (like NT64, NT96) will eventually break down into terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of tokens: 't1', 't2', 't3', etc. My goal is to check if this string can be generated by applying the grammar's production rules step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the rules can be broken down into combinations of non-terminals, such as NT64 and NT96. Each of these non-terminals then breaks down into other non-terminals until we get to terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nI'll need to parse the string from the beginning, trying to match the productions. But parsing context-free grammars can be complex without a clear algorithm, so maybe I'll approach it by checking whether the sequence of terminals can be represented by the grammar's generating process.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't1'. Looking at the rules, some non-terminals produce 't1', like NT96 -> t1 and NT68 -> t1, etc. So 't1' can be part of the string if it's produced by some rule.\n\nThe next token is 't2'. Let's see, NT96 can produce 't2' when combined with other rules? Or maybe NT47 can produce 't2'? Wait, NT7 -> t2, and then looking at how NT7 is generated. From the rules, NT7 -> NT66 NT48, and NT66 -> NT52 NT63, etc. But that seems a bit deep. Maybe I should work backwards.\n\nAlternatively, the string can be viewed as a series of steps where each 't' is produced by a specific non-terminal. The challenge is to see if the sequence can flow from S through the non-terminals to the terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see whether each token in the string can be matched by some production rule, considering the context. But since the grammar is in CNF, each rule is applied by replacing a non-terminal with two others, so we need to see if the string can be built up by such steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the order of tokens. For example, S starts with NT64 and NT96. So the first symbols generated should be t1 (from NT64) and t2 (from NT96). Let's check the string starts with 't1 t2', which matches NT64 -> t4 and NT96 -> t4? Or wait, looking at the rules, NT64 -> NT84 NT62, which then maybe eventually leads to t4. Similarly, NT96 -> NT54 NT53, which then lead to 't4' and 't3'. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is S -> NT64 NT96. So the first two symbols should be whatever NT64 and NT96 produce. Let me look at the rules:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nThen, for NT84: NT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT62 -> NT52 NT63\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use a parse tree approach or apply the CYK algorithm, but that's time-consuming.\n\nAnother thought: Since this is a CNF grammar, we can use the fact that it's a binary tree structure. Each step splits a node into two, and the lowest level are the terminals.\n\nLet me check each rule for the terminals in the string. For example, 't1' can come from NT68, NT47, NT7, etc. Each path must be consistent with the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't1'. So that could come from any non-terminal that directly produces 't1'. For the second token, 't2', which could come from NT7 (t2), as per the given rules (NT7 -> t2). So after 't1', 't2' would be generated if NT7 is on the stack.\n\nBut how does that connect back to S? S is at the top, so the first productions from S would have to generate these tokens. So S -> NT64 NT96 would produce two parts. Let's see: NT64 -> t4 (as per the rules, NT64 appears as the left side of two rules, but in the given, NT64 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, no in the rules, NT68 -> t0, NT64 -> t4? Or is that part of the rules?\n\nWait, looking more carefully: The rules have NT66 -> t4, NT68 -> t2, etc. Wait, looking at the bottom of the rules: \"NT66 -> 't4'\", so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT96 -> t4 as per the rules. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided:\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT54 -> NT51 NT80 (Wait, no, looking at the rules, some are missing. For example, in the list above, there's \"NT64 -> NT84 NT62\", \"NT54 -> t1\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list each production rule where each non-terminal on the left expands into two non-terminals, except when it's a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, the provided rules seem to have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. For example, some rules have 't0' or 't1' as the right-hand side, meaning those are terminal symbols.\n\nSo, for example:\n- NT66 -> 't4' is a terminal.\n- NT47 -> 't1' is terminal.\n- NT1 -> 't2' is terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S, which can be NT64 and NT96. So the string begins with whatever NT64 and NT96 expand into. In the given string, the first token is 't1' followed by 't2'. So perhaps:\n\n- NT64 expands to 't1' and something else, and NT96 expands to 't2' and something else.\n\nBut wait, S -> NT64 NT96, so NT64 and NT96 produce the first two symbols. So if the string starts with 't1 t2', that would mean NT64 -> 't1' and NT96 -> 't2'. Let's check the production rules for NT64 and NT96.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT64 appears in NT64 -> NT84 NT62 and NT54 -> NT51 NT80 (Wait, no, looking at the list, \"NT5 -> NT68 NT3\", \"NT39 -> NT70 NT39\", etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the user provided a mass of rules, some of which are in the form of non-terminals expanding into other non-terminals, and some of which expand into terminals. So:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT66 -> 't4'\nNT64 -> 't4'\nNT54 -> 't1'\nNT47 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't3'\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT48 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT96 -> 't4'\nNT47 -> 't4'\nNT14 -> 't3'\nNT77 -> 't1'\nNT4 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't0'\nNT74 -> 't3'\nNT57? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to write down the production rules for each non-terminal, categorizing them into terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the rules again:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-751","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is long, consisting of a sequence of t followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, and all productions are left-recursive. The grammar provided fits this form. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, and all other rules like NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3, etc., follow this structure. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t4 t0 t1 t4 t2 t3 t3 t3 t1 t1 t4 t2 t3 t3 t1 t3 t0 t1 t1 t1 t3 t3 t1 t1 t2 t2 t3 t0 t0 t1 t1 t3 t4 t4 t0 t4 t0 t1`. \n\nMy goal is to parse this string using the given grammar and see if it can be fully generated. Parsing with a top-down approach, like using the CYK algorithm, is a common method for such problems. Alternatively, I can try to construct a derivation starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI notice that the start symbol S can produce two NT symbols, such as S \u2192 NT64 NT96 or S \u2192 NT97 NT7, etc. Each NT symbol can further produce other NT symbols or terminal symbols. The right-hand sides of the grammar rules often end in t0, t1, or t2, which are terminals, meaning these are the leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of these terminals. Each step of the grammar production uses two NT symbols to produce the next two terminals. So, the length of the string must be a power of two times the number of non-terminals expanded. Alternatively, it's more about the number of steps in the parse tree.\n\nBut since the string has a specific structure, maybe I can look for how the t's combine based on the grammar. Each non-terminal production leads to a pair of terminals, but some non-terminals lead to t's. For example, let's look at the production NT68 \u2192 t4. Similarly, NT47 \u2192 t4, NT64 \u2192 t4, etc. \n\nSo, each non-terminal that produces a terminal does so for specific t's. To get the entire string, it's a matter of traversing the grammar tree from the start symbol until all terminals are reached and they match the given string.\n\nBut doing this manually for such a long string is error-prone. Maybe I can count the number of t's in the string and see if it's possible based on the grammar structure.\n\nThe string given is: Let's count the t's. It's 40 symbols long. Each production step in the grammar produces two symbols. Each non-terminal can lead to two terminal symbols or another pair of non-terminals. So, assuming that all non-terminals are expanded, the string length should be a product of the number of steps, but it might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string length must be a power of two, but 40 isn't a power of two, so that might suggest it's invalid. Wait: Let's see: 40 divided by 2 several times. 40 \u2192 20 \u2192 10 \u2192 5. But 5 isn't a power of two, so it's impossible to reach 40 terminals starting from S, which produces only two symbols each time. So maybe the string can't be generated because 40 isn't a power of two multiplied appropriately.\n\nWait, no, because each step can produce two symbols, so the maximum possible length of the string would be 2^n, where n is the number of layers in the parse tree. But 40 is not a power of two. Let's check:\n\n2^5 = 32, 2^6=64. 40 is in between, so it's not a power of two. That suggests that the string length is impossible, so the answer is No.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think again: S produces two NTs each time. Each of those NTs could produce two more NTs or a terminal. So the maximum number of terminals is 2^k for some k. 40 isn't a power of two, so it's impossible. Therefore, the string isn't in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string has a length of 40, which is not a power of two.

But maybe my initial understanding is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple ways to get to t4 t2 somewhere down the parse tree. Let me check if any production could lead to t4 t2.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I want to see if any combination of two NTs can produce t4 and t2 in any order. Let me look for symbols that can produce t4 and t2.\n\nFrom the end symbols, 'NT66' produces t4, and 'NT64' produces t4. For t2, 'NT7', 'NT77' produce t2, among others.\n\nWait, maybe there's a production that combines t4 and t2. Let's check each production:\n\nLooking for a production that has two terminals, one t4 and one t2. Let me go through each NT rule:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 t4: So if another rule produces t2, they could combine.\n\nSo, perhaps a rule that produces t4 and t2 in some order. Let me check all NT rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 t0\n- NT33 \u2192 t1\n- NT68 \u2192 t0\n- NT14 \u2192 t3\n- NT27 \u2192 t4\n- NT84 \u2192 t0\n- NT36 \u2192 t2\n- NT54 \u2192 t1\n- NT81 \u2192 t1\n- NT96 \u2192 t4\n- NT47 \u2192 t4\n- NT21 \u2192 t4\n- NT52 \u2192 t4\n- NT53 \u2192 t2\n- NT80 \u2192 t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t4\n- NT82 \u2192 t4\n- NT74 \u2192 t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t2\n- NT77 \u2192 t1\n- NT4 \u2192 t1\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT80 \u2192 t2\n- NT22 \u2192 t3\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT21 \u2192 t4\n- NT52 \u2192 t4\n- NT43 \u2192 t0\n- NT53 \u2192 t2\n- NT84 \u2192 t0\n- NT34 \u2192 t4\n- NT96 \u2192 t3\n- NT62 \u2192 t0\n\nWait, there's NT53 \u2192 t2 and NT52 \u2192 t4. So if we have NT52 \u2192 t4 and NT53 \u2192 t2, that would produce t4 t2, which is the start of the string we have: t4 t2.\n\nSo, NT52 \u2192 t4 and NT53 \u2192 t2. Therefore, the production NT52 NT53 \u2192 t4 t2.\n\nBut in the grammar, is there a rule that produces NT52 and NT53 together? Checking the productions:\n\nLooking across all NT rules, I don't see any production that directly results in NT52 NT53 as a pair. All productions have NT on the left and exactly two NTs on the right, except maybe some that terminate early, but in this case, they are all in CNF, meaning two non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the idea is that to get NT52 and NT53, one would have to derive from some other NT.\n\nWait, NT52 is defined as NT52 \u2192 NT521 NT522. Let me check each of their productions.\n\nLooking at NT52, it's not in the list. Wait, the user only provided the NT's on the left and their productions. Let me check if NT52 is listed. I think I made a mistake earlier; looking back, the grammar rules are:\n\nI think in the grammar provided, NT52 is not explicitly listed. Instead, looking at the provided rules:\n\nLet me scan for 'NT52'. Oh, here it is:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT521 NT522\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, looking back through the provided grammar rules, I don't see NT52.

{"custom_id":"request-778","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it simplifies things a bit. The string to evaluate is: `t3 t1 t4 t2 t4 t4 t1 t3 t4 t1 t4 t4 t2 t1 t1 t1 t4 t1 t0 t4 t4 t0 t4 t2 t3 t2 t2 t2 t3 t2 t2 t4 t1 t4 t4 t3 t0 t3 t1 t2`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The grammar has three productions for S:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo to derive the string, it must start with one of these combinations. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t3. Let's check each option:\n\n- For S -> NT64 NT96, I need to see if NT64 and NT96 can produce t3.\n- For S -> NT97 NT7, similarly, check if these can produce t3.\n- For S -> NT35 NT84, check NT35 and NT84.\n\nLooking at the rule definitions:\n\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT84 -> t2\n- NT62 -> t0\n\nSo NT64 would produce t2 t0. But the first symbol is t3, so this path doesn't fit.\n\nNext, NT97 -> NT43 NT75. \n\n- NT43 -> t0\n- NT75 -> NT98 NT26\n\nLet me see what NT98 and NT26 produce. \n\n- NT98 -> t1 (from NT98 -> 't1'), so NT98 -> t1.\n- NT26 -> t3, so NT26 -> t3.\n\nSo NT75 -> t1 t3, meaning NT97 -> t3 t1 t3. But the first symbol is t3, so the first part is okay, but the second is t3, but actually, NT43 is t0, so wait. Wait, NT97 -> NT43 NT75, which is t0 and then t1 t3. So overall, t0 t1 t3. The string starts with t3, so this might not fit unless I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the grammar rules more carefully. Let me check each rule step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to parse the string back into the grammar. Starting from S, I need to see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals according to the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t3. Let's see which NT can produce t3.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT4 -> t1\n- NT7 -> t0\n- NT12 -> t3\n- NT14 -> NT33 NT27, which would be t0 t3 (from NT33->t0, NT27->t3)\n- NT21 -> t4\n- NT22 -> t4\n- NT26 -> t3\n- NT33 -> t0 or t1\n- NT34 -> t4\n- NT35 -> t3\n- NT43 -> t0\n- NT52 -> t2\n- NT54 -> t3\n- NT62 -> t0\n- NT68 -> t1 (from NT68->'t1'), but some rules have more symbols. Wait, some rules of NT68 have more symbols, like NT68->NT47 NT12. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a tree starting from S.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t1, t0, etc. Since each production in the grammar is binary (A->BC), the string must be a sequence that can be divided into pairs. Let's see if the string has an even length. Counting the symbols:\n\nLooking at the string: \"t3 t1 t4 t2 t4 t4 t1 t3 t4 t1 t4 t4 t2 t1 t1 t1 t4 t1 t0 t4 t4 t0 t4 t2 t3 t2 t2 t2 t3 t2 t2 t4 t1 t4 t4 t3 t0 t3 t1 t2\".\n\nCounting: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=42 symbols. So even? 42 is even, so it's possible.\n\nNow, let's try to match the string with the grammar.\n\nStarting with S->NT35 NT84 because the string starts with t3, and NT35->t3.\n\nSo first part is NT35 and the second is NT84.\n\nNT35->t3 directly, so that's the first symbol.\n\nNow, NT84->t2, so next symbol should be t2. The string's second symbol is t1, which is a problem because NT84->t2. So this path doesn't work. Therefore, S cannot produce this string using NT35 NT84.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nWait, the rule NT35->t3 is correct, as per the provided grammar. So NT35 produces t3. Then NT84 produces t2, so the first two symbols should be t3 t2, but the string is t3 t1. So this path is invalid.\n\nSo that means S cannot produce this string with the NT35 NT84 production.\n\nNow, try the next option: S->NT97 NT7.\n\nNT97->NT43 NT75, and NT7->66 NT48.\n\nWait, let's look at NT97's rules. The rule NT97->t1 t0 t3? No, looking back: NT97->NT43 NT75, and then we need to see what NT43 and NT75 generate.\n\nNT43->t0, and NT75->NT98 NT26.\n\nNow, NT98->t1, and NT26->t3. So NT75->t1 t3. Therefore, NT97->t0 t1 t3.\n\nBut our string starts with t3, not t0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rule. Let me check NT7.\n\nWait, NT7->66 NT48, and NT48->t1, but according to the rules, NT48->t1. But the initial NT7 is derived from NT7->66 NT48, so NT7 would produce NT66 NT48, which in turn produce t4 (from NT66->t4) and t1. So NT7 would produce t4 t1, which is t4 followed by t1. The first symbol is t3, so not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting lost. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe string is long, so perhaps I can break it down.\n\nThe first two symbols are t3 t1. So perhaps, the first production is S->NT35 NT84, but NT84-> something that starts with t1. Let me see NT84's rules.\n\nFrom the rules, NT84->NT4 NT1. NT4->t1, NT1->t2. So NT84->t1 t2. Therefore, after NT35 t3, the next symbol would be t2, but the string's second symbol is t1, which doesn't match. So S->NT35 NT84 isn't working.\n\nNext, S->NT97 NT7. NT97 as we discussed is t0 t1 t3. So starting with t0, but string starts with t3. So no.\n\nThird option: S->NT35 NT84 didn't work, so S->NT12 NT24.\n\nWait, no, the third option is S->NT35 NT84. That didn't work, so the only other option is to see if any of the other productions could lead to the correct symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should try to see which of the initial symbols can be generated by which non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the possible non-terminals that can generate each t_i:\n\nLooking through the rules, for each NT, their productions:\n\n- NT4 -> t1\n- NT7 -> t0\n- NT12 -> t3\n- NT14-> NT33 NT27 (t0 t3)\n- NT21->t4\n- NT22->t4\n- NT26->t3\n- NT33->t1 (from NT33->t1) or t0 (from NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.

Terminals can't be on the left side of the production. So, to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a way to derive it using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some symbols like NT3, NT4, etc., are rewritten into t's with specific indices (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4).

So for example:\n\nNT47 -> 't1' implies that if NT47 appears, it can now be replaced by 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT68 -> 't0' means that NT68 can be 't0'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t4, so looking for NT's that can produce 't4'.

The grammar and the string are both provided, but they look pretty complicated. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule either has two terminals and nothing else, or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and it seems that the grammar transitions through various NT (non-terminals) until it reaches terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t0 t3 t2 t0 t2 t0 t3 t4 t3 t3 t4 t1 t1 t0 t0 t1 t3 t0 t2 t1 t1 t3 t2 t4 t1 t1 t4 t3 t0 t1 t3 t1 t4 t1 t1 t2 t1 t0 t2 t3 t0.\n\nHmm, this is a long string. I think the approach here is to use the parse tree method or some kind of top-down parsing, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can simulate the process of deriving the string using the productions or check if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nWait, since each production in CNF has either two non-terminals or two terminals, the number of symbols in the string formed by a non-leaf node in the parse tree must be a power of two. But looking at the given string, let's count the number of tokens: let's see, the string is a series of 't's and numbers, separated by spaces. Counting them: 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 39 tokens. Hmm, 39 is an odd number, which would suggest that if it's a derivation starting from S (which produces two non-terminals), then the total number of nodes would have to be 2^n, but 39 is not a power of two. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no\u2014each production can either replace a symbol with two, but in a leftmost derivation, each step replaces a single non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time you do that. So starting from S, which is one symbol, then after one step, two symbols, then three, four, etc. But that doesn't directly help because the given string is the final output; maybe I should think about how the terminals are generated.\n\nWait, another thought: each production in CNF with two non-terminals requires two steps to resolve completely into terminals. So each time a non-terminal is expanded, it produces two more symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. So the total number of symbols in the final string should be 2^n, where n is the number of times a non-terminal was expanded beyond the start. But the given string has 39 symbols. 39 is not a power of two. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So that suggests that this string cannot be generated by the grammar because the total number of symbols isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, but let me check: maybe I'm confusing the depth of the parse tree with the count of symbols. The height of the parse tree corresponds to how many expansions happened. The number of leaves in a parse tree is the number of symbols, which would be 2^h, where h is the height. So for example, h=5 would give 32 symbols, h=6 gives 64, etc. 39 isn't a power of two, so it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string.\n\nSo, even without checking further, the fact that the string length is 39, which isn't a power of two, suggests that it's not generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string has 39 symbols, which is not a power of two (e.g., 2^5=32, 2^6=64).

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step because it's a bit tricky for me.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has a few specific rules: each production is from a single non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal. All non-terminals except the start symbol have productions that lead to terminals. So, the start symbol is S, and it's in the first production: S -> NT64 NT96. That's a two-part production, which fits CNF.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of tokens: t4, t4, t0, and so on. I notice that the string starts with two t4s. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start production S -> NT64 NT96, so the first step is NT64 and NT96. Each of these is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals, except when they end up as terminals.\n\nLet me look at NT64 and NT96. NT64 produces NT84 NT62, and NT96 produces NT54 NT53.\n\nWait, so S first becomes NT64 NT96, which is [t84 t62] [t54 t53]. But the string starts with t4 t4, which is different. So maybe NT64 and NT96 don't directly give me the start of the string. Alternatively, perhaps one of these branches later produces t4 t4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a wrong initial assumption. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the string starts with t4 t4, so maybe NT64 or NT96 is the one that produces a t4. Let me check their productions.\n\nLooking at NT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Neither of these produce t4. Wait, looking for where NT64 leads to a terminal. From the list, I see that NT64 -> NT84 NT62. But none of those are terminals; NT84 and NT62 are non-terminals. So NT64 can't directly produce t4.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again. Oh, wait, in the productions, NT64 leads to NT84 NT62, which don't produce t4. But looking elsewhere, NT84 has a production NT84 -> NT4 NT1, which then leads somewhere. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me see if any of the non-terminals in the NT64 or NT96 paths produce t4.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that NT48 -> t1, NT47 -> t1, etc. But where does t4 come from?\n\nWait, let me look at NT84: NT84 has several productions. One of them is NT84 -> NT4 NT1. Then there's NT84 -> NT54 NT53. And NT84 also leads to t2: NT84 -> t2. Oh, wait, that's it! No, wait, looking back, under NT84, the productions are: NT84 -> NT4 NT1, NT84 -> NT54 NT53, and NT84 has another entry: NT84 -> t2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check the provided productions.\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\nYes, under NT84: NT84 -> t2.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me scan through the list. Wait, there's a line saying NT84 -> t2. Yes, so NT84 can produce t2. So, in that case, in some paths, NT84 leads to 't2'.\n\nBut wait, that's not t4. So maybe t4 is produced by a different non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the list of non-terminals, I see NT68: NT68 can lead to 't0' and 't3'. Oh, so NT68 can produce t0 and t3 but not t4. Then, let's look for other non-terminals that can produce t4.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly leads to t4. So maybe t4 is produced by a combination of productions that aren't directly terminals, but that's possible since in CNF, you can have non-terminals that produce other non-terminals, so t4 is a terminal, which is allowed.\n\nSo, in the string, the first t4 must come from some non-terminal that can produce t4. Wait, but looking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t4. The possible terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, and t4. Oh wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking again: the productions include NT68 -> 't4'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the provided list:\n\n- NT68 -> 't4'?\n\nNo, I don't see that.

So, looking through, under NT54: one production is NT54 -> t1 and another is NT54 -> t3. But wait, wait, let me check the list again.\n\nLooking at the list, under NT54:\n\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT78 -> 't0'\n- NT22 -> 't0'\n- NT39 -> 't0'\n- NT64 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't2'\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't1'\n- NT54 -> 't1' (so NT54 can produce t1)\n- NT66 -> 't4'\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT68 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> 't3'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT74 -> 't4'\n- NT80 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't4'\n- NT82 -> 't4'\n- NT54 -> 't3' (so NT54 can also produce t3)\n\nSo, NT54 can produce t1, t3, but not t4.

The productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96\nS -> NT97 NT7\nS -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the initial step is to figure out what each of these NTs eventually produces in terms of terminals (the 't's) because the string is made up of 't's and numbers. \n\nI notice that some of the NT symbols (like NT3, NT5, etc.) directly produce a terminal, for example, NT68 -> 't0'. Others produce other non-terminals. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from any of these productions.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t2 t1 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t3 t2 t3 t2 t1 t0 t3 t1 t2 t4 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t2 t4 t2 t3 t1 t3 t1 t1 t2 t0 t3 t2 t2 t1 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t2`.\n\nThat's a pretty long string of 41 symbols. My job is to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to model this as a parsing problem, where I try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals (except for cases where they produce a terminal, but wait, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal). Wait, no: in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some of the NTs on the left are producing two NTs on the right. For example, S -> NT64 NT96. So each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut in this case, all the productions seem to be two non-terminals except when they have a terminal on the right. For instance, NT68 -> 't0' is a production, so it's a single terminal.\n\nSo, for the string given, which is all 't's except for some numbers like t0, t1, etc. But actually, looking at the string, it's all 't's and numbers connected as tokens. Wait, no: the string is a sequence of tokens like 't2', 't1', 't3', and so on. So each token is a single letter followed by a number, or perhaps it's a single character? Wait, looking more carefully, the string is `t2 t1 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t3 t2 t3 t2 t1 t0 t3 t1 t2 t4 t3 t3 t4 t4 t4 t2 t4 t2 t3 t1 t3 t1 t1 t2 t0 t3 t2 t2 t1 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t2`. Wait, each token is a single alphanumeric character, probably representing symbols. But the NT productions include 't0', 't1', 't2', etc., so each 't' followed by a number is a single symbol in the string. So the string is a sequence of symbols that can include these 't(n)' symbols.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in this context, each 't' is a terminal, so each 't2', 't1', etc., is just a single token. So the entire string is a list of tokens, each of which is a 't' followed by a number, but actually, each symbol is a single 't' followed by a number, making them individual terminals.\n\nBut let me clarify: the string is a sequence of 41 symbols, each being a 't' followed by a number, right? For example, 't2', 't1', etc. So each symbol is treated as a separate terminal. So, for instance, 't0' is a terminal, 't1' is another terminal, etc.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 41 terminals, each being something like 't0', 't1', 't2', etc.\n\nNow, the grammar starts with S, which can produce various combinations of non-terminals. For example, S can produce NT64 NT96, which would each have to be expanded into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nBut given that the grammar's productions have non-terminals only appearing in pairs, the string must be built in a way that each 'S' expansion, through various intermediate steps, leads to the string.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to approach this by trying to see if there's a way to parse the string using the productions provided. However, this might get complicated because the grammar has over 40 productions, and some may not lead to the desired symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific pattern or path that generates this string. Let me see if there's a way to reduce this step-by-step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if all the 't's in the string correspond to possible expansions. Each production in the grammar either ends in a terminal (like NT68 -> 't0') or continues further.\n\nSo, let me consider the leftmost symbols and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is 't2'. Looking at the productions, which NTs can produce 't2'?\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT64 -> 't4' (no)\nNT96 -> 't4' (no)\nNT7 -> 't2' (Yes)\nNT97 -> 't2' (Yes)\nSimilarly, other NTs:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't2' \u2705\nNT97 -> 't2' \u2705\nNT22 -> 't4' (no)\nNT34 -> 't4' (no)\nNT7 -> 't2' \u2705\nNT98 -> 't0' (no)\nWait, let me go through all the NTs to see which can produce 't2':\n\nLooking through all the 'ntX' productions:\n\nNT7 -> 't2' \u2705\nNT97 -> 't2' \u2705\nNT68 -> 't0' (no)\nNT21 -> 't4' (no)\nNT98 -> 't1' (no)\nNT12 -> 't3' (no)\nNT35 -> 't3' (no)\nNT96 -> 't4' (no)\nNT47 -> 't1' (no, unless there's another option)\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT47 -> 't1' \u2705\nWait, no, let's check:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\nNT21 -> 't4'\nSo wait, NT47's production is NT21 NT3. Then, NT21 -> 't4' and NT3 -> 't2'.\n\nWait, no: The productions for NT21 and NT3 are:\n\nNT21 -> NT47 NT77\nNT54 -> 't3' (no, wait, no. Let me list all the NT productions.\n\nWait, to avoid confusion, let's list all NT productions and see which can produce 't2'.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to check if each 't' in the string can be generated by some NT in the grammar.\n\nSo, starting with 't2' as the first symbol. As I saw, NT7 and NT97 can produce 't2'.\n\nNow, moving to the second symbol, which is 't1'. So after 't2', we have 't1'. Let's see if after NT7 or NT97, the next expansion can produce 't1'.\n\nCase 1: First symbol comes from NT7 -> 't2', then the next symbol is 't1' from NT97 -> 't2'. Wait, but we can't switch NT7 to produce 't1'. Alternatively, perhaps the production S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire expansion path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to think of the string as a series of steps, each corresponding to a production.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parsing problem. For example, using a recursive descent parser, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of each symbol in the string as being matched by some NT in the grammar or as a terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the string given, each symbol is a 't' followed by a number, so each is a single terminal. So, for example, 't2' is a terminal, 't1' is another, etc. So, the parser must process the entire string by expanding non-terminals accordingly.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-839","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is `t0 t2 t1 t2 t3 t3 t0 t4 t3 t4 t0 t1 t2 t0 t2 t0 t2 t3 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t3 t2 t2 t1 t2 t3 t1 t4 t0 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar better. The grammar starts with S and has several productions, some of which are terminal symbols like 't0', 't1', etc. I notice that some non-terminals (NT) are defined recursively, so they probably generate certain sequences of terminals. \n\nI should probably build a parse tree or trace the way the string is generated step by step. The string is quite long, so doing this manually might be tedious, but let's start by looking for the longest possible sequences first.\n\nThe first symbol in the string is 't0'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT3 is 't0'. So I can start with NT3. The production for NT3 is NT98 and NT39. So I need to see if 't98' and 't39' generate the remaining string after 't0'.\n\nThe remaining string after the first 't0' is t2 t1 t2 t3 t3 t0 t4 t3 t4 t0 t1 t2 t0 t2 t0 t2 t3 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t3 t2 t2 t1 t2 t3 t1 t4 t0 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4.\n\nNext, let's look at NT98 and NT39.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT98 can be derived from NT78 and NT14, or NT77 and NT26, or NT98 and NT26. Wait, no, actually looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT98 -> NT78 NT26\nNT98 is also in another rule with NT78, so maybe I can break it down that way.\n\nWait, but I think I'm confusing the rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I find:\n\nNT98 -> NT78 NT26\n\nSo the first step for NT98 is to split into NT78 and NT26. Let's process these.\n\nSo for NT78, checking the grammar, there's a rule NT78 -> NT97 NT39.\n\nSo NT78 expands into NT97 and NT39.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules again:\n\nWait, actually, I think I need a better approach. Perhaps I should map out all the productions to see which non-terminals lead to terminals, and which continue to split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if the string can be parsed by checking if each segment corresponds to the productions.\n\nLet me try to process the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't0', which comes from NT3. So after NT3, the production is NT98 NT39, so both NT98 and NT39 should generate the rest of the string.\n\nSo let's process the string as follows:\n\n1. t0 (from NT3)\nRemaining string: t2 t1 t2 t3 t3 t0 t4 t3 t4 t0 t1 t2 t0 t2 t0 t2 t3 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t3 t2 t2 t1 t2 t3 t1 t4 t0 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4.\n\nNow, NT98 and NT39 need to generate the remaining string.\n\nLet's break down NT98 first. The rule for NT98 is:\n\nNT98 -> NT78 NT26\n\nSo we can split NT98 into NT78 and NT26, which start generating the next parts of the string.\n\nSo after NT98, the first two symbols are from NT78 and NT26.\n\nLooking at NT78, its production is:\n\nNT78 -> NT97 NT39\n\nSo now, we have to process NT97 and NT39 next.\n\nBut wait, the first symbols after t0 are t2 t1 t2... Wait, perhaps I should consider that starting with NT98, the first token would be determined by NT98's production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the string after the initial t0.\n\nThe first part after t0 is 't2 t1 t2 t3 t3 t0 t4 t3 t4 t0 t1 t2 t0 t2 t0 t2 t3 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t3 t2 t2 t1 t2 t3 t1 t4 t0 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4'.\n\nNow, this string starts with 't2 t1 ...'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first non-terminal after t0 would be either NT78 or NT77 because:\n\nWait, NT98 produces NT78 NT26, so the first symbol after t0 (from NT98) would be the first symbol from NT78.\n\nWhat does NT78 produce? Its production is NT97 and NT39. So the first symbol is from NT97.\n\nLooking at NT97's production: NT97 -> NT47 NT1.\n\nSo NT97 splits into NT47 and NT1. The first symbol is from NT47.\n\nWhat does NT47 produce? From the grammar rules, NT47 can be NT21 NT3, or NT1 NT62, or maybe other options. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, checking the grammar rules:\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\nSo there might be other rules too. Let me see:\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT47 has two main productions:\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\nSo the first symbol after NT47 is determined by which production it takes.\n\nBut NT47 can't split into more non-terminals directly if we have a string like 't2 ...' after the initial t0. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the longest possible match of the string, starting from the beginning, and see if it can fit any production.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: 't0 t2 t1 t2...'.\n\nBut 't0 t2 t1 t2' doesn't immediately match any production. So perhaps the initial steps involve parsing recursively.\n\nWait, perhaps start by identifying each non-terminal and how the string can be generated.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a parse tree. Each symbol in the string must be generated by the leaves of the parse tree, following the productions.\n\nLet me try to parse step by step:\n\nThe first symbol is 't0' generated by NT3.\n\nSo, the initial tree is NT3 -> NT98 NT39.\n\nNow, the next two symbols should be the first symbols generated by NT98 and NT39.\n\nThe next symbols after 't0' are 't2', so the first symbol after the initial 't0' is 't2'.\n\nSo perhaps NT98 generates 't2', and NT39 generates the rest starting with 't1' or something like that.\n\nWait, let's check the production for NT98. It can be:\n- NT98 -> NT78 NT26\n- Or other rules, but maybe the most relevant is NT98 -> NT78 NT26.\n\nSo, the first symbol after 't0' is 't2', which is part of the expansion of NT98 (since NT98 generates NT78 and NT26). Let's see how 't2' appears.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26's production is NT22 NT62. That doesn't give 't2', so perhaps it's from NT78.\n\nWait, NT78's production is NT97 NT39. So the next symbols are generated by NT97 and NT39.\n\nLet me see: NT97 is part of NT78's expansion. NT97's production is NT47 NT1.\n\nSo, after NT98, the next part is NT78 (which splits into NT97 and NT39) and then NT39.\n\nBut this seems getting too tangled. Maybe a better way is to look for the symbols in the string and see which parts correspond to each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, think incrementally: after 't0', the next symbol is 't2' from NT98. So the next non-terminal after 't0' is NT98, which splits into 't2' and another part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly. Maybe I should check each symbol step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the grammar has S -> NT64 NT96, and some other rules which seem to expand into terminals (like 't0', 't1') and some non-terminals. \n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terms separated by spaces: `t2 t2 t2 t2 t1 t4 t2 t3 t3 t1 t0 t3 t1 t4 t2 t4 t4 t4 t4 t0 t1 t1 t4 t0 t3 t2 t4`. It seems like this string is a sequence of terminals, which should have been generated by replacing all non-terminals in the grammar down to terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A is a non-terminal. So every step either replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or directly to a terminal.\n\nGiven that, I can model this as a parsing problem. I can represent the string as a list and try to parse it using the grammar rules.\n\nBut wait, directly trying all possible derivations would be too time-consuming. Instead, perhaps I can model this as a parsing process where I start from S and try to expand non-terminals until all tokens are consumed.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. **Identify the non-terminals and terminals**: The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, except those that directly map to 't0' or 't1' as terminals. The terminals are the 't's with numbers.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4' etc. Wait, no, the grammar has some rules where NT68, NT74, etc., directly become 't0' or 't1'. So, in the string, whenever a 'tX' appears, it must have been produced by a rule where the NT goes directly to that terminal.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of 't's with indices from 0 to 4. Each of these 't's must be matched by a production rule for the corresponding NT.\n\nFor example, NT68 can produce 't0', so the 't0' in the string must come from NT68.\n\nNow, the string is a list of ['t2', 't2', ..., 't4'], which is 35 tokens long. I need to see if this list can be produced by S.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT64 NT96 according to the first production rule.\n\nSo S -> NT64 NT96. Then each of these NT64 and NT96 must produce a certain sequence of terminals, and their combination should exactly match the string.\n\nSo let's break this down:\n\nFirst, NT64 and NT96 are both non-terminals. Each must be expanded into a sequence of terminals, and when combined, their concatenated expansion should be the string.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT62 -> t0\nSo NT64 can be NT84 NT62, which then becomes NT84 t0. So to expand NT64 into terminals, NT84 needs to be expanded.\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT4 is 't1', and NT1 is 't2' as per the rules? Wait, wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example NT68 -> t0, NT97 -> t2, NT98 -> t0, NT1 -> t2, NT48 -> t1. So NT48 is a rule that goes to t1.\n\nWait, let me list the direct terminals:\n\nNT1 -> t2\nNT48 -> t1\nNT5 -> t2\nNT7 -> t0\nNT66 -> t4\nNT74 -> t3\nNT75 -> t1\nNT77 -> t3, t2, t1, etc.\n\nWait, but it's getting a bit complicated. Let me instead list all NT rules that directly go to terminals:\n\nNT68 -> t0\nNT97 -> t2\nNT98 -> t0\nNT1 -> t2\nNT47 -> t4\nNT53 -> t2? Wait, no, NT53 -> NT86 NT33, but looking further, NT53 can produce t2 when the right expansion occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a mapping of each NT to its possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a bottom-up approach would help. Let's start from the string and see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nBut since S is two non-terminals, the string should be the concatenation of two derived strings from two NTs.\n\nSo the string is 35 tokens. Let's split it into two parts: the first part comes from NT64 and the second from NT96.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT4 is 't1', NT1 is 't2', so NT84 -> t1 t2.\n\nNT62 -> t0. So overall, NT64 -> t1 t2 t0.\n\nNow, the first three tokens of the string are t2 t2 t2. But according to NT64 expansion, it should be t1 t2 t0. That doesn't match. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT4 -> t1\nNT1 -> t2\nSo NT84 -> t1 t2\nNT62 -> t0\nSo NT64 -> t1 t2 t0.\n\nBut the string starts with three t2s: positions 1,2,3 are t2,t2,t2. That's 't2 t2 t2'. However, according to NT64, the expansion starts with t1, followed by t2, then t0. So the first three tokens would be t1,t2,t0, which doesn't match t2,t2,t2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong starting point. Maybe the split between NT64 and NT96 is not the first and next parts, but perhaps the full 35 tokens are somehow derived from NT64 and NT96 in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT64 and NT96 produce longer sequences that when concatenated give the 35 tokens.\n\nBut let's take the string:\n\nt2 t2 t2 t2 t1 t4 t2 t3 t3 t1 t0 t3 t1 t4 t2 t4 t4 t4 t4 t0 t1 t1 t4 t0 t3 t2 t4.\n\nLet me try to see if this can be split into two parts that each start with the first production of their respective NTs.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently. Maybe the entire string is a single expansion from S, which is NT64 NT96. So the expansion must be the product of NT64 and NT96's expansions.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, the concatenation of NT64's expansion and NT96's expansion must be the given string.\n\nEach NT has a production. Let's reconstruct how NT64 and NT96 can expand into the first three tokens.\n\nFrom the initial problem, the string starts with t2 t2 t2.\n\nLooking at NT64's expansion: it starts with NT64 -> NT84 NT62, which as per above gives t1 t2 t0. So the first three tokens should be t1, t2, t0. But the string starts with t2, t2, t2. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe the string is meant to be a single series of NT expansions, but perhaps the way the NTs are split isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that perhaps NT64 and NT96 can have more complex expansions. Let me see:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\n\nNT4 -> t1\n\nNT1 -> t2\n\nSo NT84 -> t1 t2\n\nNT62 -> t0\n\nSo NT64 -> t1 t2 t0\n\nThat gives the first three tokens of the string as t2, t2, t2. But the expansion gives t1, t2, t0. So that doesn't match. Therefore, S's first expansion would lead to a first part that starts with t1, which doesn't match the string starting with t2.\n\nWait, but maybe the NT64 has a different production. Let me check the grammar again. The grammar defines NT64 as only:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNo other rules for NT64. So there's no other way to expand NT64. So the expansion is fixed as NT84 NT62, leading to t1 t2 t0.\n\nSo if the string starts with t2, it's not possible for it to be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's and numbers, which I assume are the terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. It starts with the start symbol S, which can produce combinations of NT1 through NT98. Each NT symbol then produces either another pair of NT symbols or a 't' followed by a number. For example, S -> NT64 NT96. The NT64 and NT96 must be expanded until they reach terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t0 t3 t2 t3 t2 t4 t1 t1 t1 t3 t4 t1 t4 t0 t4 t3 t0 t1 t0 t3 t0 t4 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t4 t0 t4 t0 t0 t0 t1 t2 t2 t1 t0 t4 t4 t2 t0`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with multiple 't0's. Looking at the grammar, some NT rules produce 't0's. For example, NT66, NT68, NT74, and others have rules that can produce 't0'. \n\nI'll start from the top-down approach. The start symbol S can only produce combinations of two NTs, like NT64 and NT96. So each production of S will generate two NTs, which need to be expanded further until we get terminals.\n\nGiven that the string starts with 't0 t0 t0...', let me see which NTs can produce 't0'. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62 (both NTs)\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n- NT74 -> NT33 NT27\n- NT77 -> NT1 NT62\n- NT26 -> NT3 NT27\n\nNone of these directly produce 't0'. Wait, no, the production for NT68 is 't4' as per the last part of the grammar: NT68->'t3'. No, wait, looking again: \n\nThe grammar seems a bit long. Let me check the productions again. \n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some NTs produce 't0', 't1', etc. For example:\n\n- NT68 -> 't4' (Wait, the last lines are:\nNT68 -> 't4', \nNT97 -> 't2',\nNT86 -> 't0',\nNT68 -> 't3', \nNT97 -> 't0',\nNT77 -> 't1',\nNT4 -> 't1',\nNT7 -> 't0',\nNT74 -> 't3',\nNT80 -> 't2',\nNT22 -> 't3',\nNT5 -> 't2',\nNT21 -> 't4',\nNT52 -> 't4',\nNT43 -> 't0',\nNT53 -> 't2',\nNT84 -> 't0',\nNT34 -> 't4',\nNT96 -> 't3',\nNT62 -> 't0'\n\nSo, NT62 -> 't0'. \n\nLooking back, S -> NT64 NT96. So NT64 and NT96 each have their own rules. Let's expand NT64 and NT96.\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62. Both are NTs. Then NT84 -> NT4 NT1, and NT62 -> 't0' (since NT62 -> 't0'). Now I need to expand NT4 and NT1.\n\nNT4 -> 't1'. NT1 -> 't2' (from the production NT1 -> 't2'). So that gives us 't1 t2'. Now, NT84 expansion leads to 't1' and NT1 leads to 't2', so the full expansion of NT64 is: NT84 (t1) NT62 (t0) which is t1 t0.\n\nWait, but NT64's production is NT84 NT62, so the expansion of NT64 would be the concatenation of the expansions of NT84 and NT62. Since NT84 is 't1' and NT62 is 't0', the expansion of NT64 is 't1 t0'.\n\nNow, looking at NT96: NT96 -> 't4'. So, NT96 is directly 't4'.\n\nPutting it together, S -> NT64 NT96 would expand to 't1 t0 t4'.\n\nHmm, but the string starts with 't0 t0 t0...', so 't1 t0 t4' doesn't match. This suggests that S's first production doesn't generate the starting string.\n\nLet me consider the other productions of S.\n\nThe other S produce:\n\n- S -> NT97 NT7: Now, NT97 is 't2' and NT7 is 't0' (as per NT7 -> 't0'). So S would expand to 't2 t0'.\n- S -> NT35 NT84: NT35 and NT84. NT35 -> 't3' (from NT35 -> 't3'), NT84 -> 't1' (from NT84->'t0'?) Wait, wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, NT84's production is 't0'? Or wait, I think NT84's rules:\n\nFrom the last part:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1 (so not a terminal yet), and later on, NT84 is also defined as NT62 -> 't0', NT82 -> 't4', etc. Wait, no, I think the original grammar only has the NT symbols listed as rules, not the terminals. Let me re-express this.\n\nWait, the grammar is provided as a list of productions, where the left-hand side (LHS) is the non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) can include both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar is all in Chomsky Normal Form, so each RHS is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the productions like NT64 -> 't0' or 't1' would be present.\n\nLooking through the list of productions:\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT97 -> 't0'\n- NT86 -> 't0'\n- NT68 -> 't4' (is this a typo?

{"custom_id":"request-851","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of 't's, which are terminals, and non-terminals which are expanded into these terms based on the production rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall how CNF works. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure makes parsing easier, especially with algorithms like CYK, but since I'm approaching it manually, I need to see if the string can be broken down according to the given rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which has three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these productions starts with a pair of non-terminals, so I need to check if the string can be divided accordingly. The string is: t0 t3 t0 t0 t0 t3 t3 t0 t0 t2 t2 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t0 t3 t4 t2 t1 t3 t1 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t0 t4 t4 t2 t0 t3 t4\n\nLet's see, the total length is 45, which is an odd number. Since each production of S is two non-terminals, this would imply that the leftmost derivation should have an even number of non-terminals at each step, leading to an even-length string. But this is 45 symbols, which is odd, so it seems impossible. Wait, that can't be right because maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me recount. The string is \"t0 t3 t0 t0 t0 t3 t3 t0 t0 t2 t2 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t0 t3 t4 t2 t1 t3 t1 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t0 t4 t4 t2 t0 t3 t4\" \u2014 that's 45 tokens. Since each application of production rules for S starts with two non-terminals, the number of symbols in the string must be even, but 45 is odd, which suggests it cannot be derived from S, which only expands into two non-terminals at each step.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me think again. S is the start symbol, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So starting from S (1 symbol), each step increases the number of symbols by 1. So after n steps, the number of symbols is 1 + n. For S to derive a string, the number of steps must be even because each production for non-terminals adds two symbols, so the total length would be 1 + 2n. For example:\n\n- Start: 1 symbol.\n- After one production (assuming S \u2192 NT1 NT2), it's 2 symbols.\n- Each further production step for each non-terminal would increase the count by 1 each.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals (increasing the count) or a terminal (fixing the count). So, more accurately, if all productions are terminals except for one, the total length could vary, but in this case, the grammar has many non-terminals, so it's more complex.\n\nBut in the case of S, which has three productions all consisting of two non-terminals, each expansion of S would produce four non-terminals. Wait, no, S can produce three different pairs of non-terminals. So each production for S adds two symbols, so starting with S (1 symbol), each replacement adds one non-terminal? No, each production is S \u2192 A B, so after one step, it's two non-terminals, each can be expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the overall parity. Since S is the start symbol and it produces two non-terminals, the string length derived from S in any number of steps must have a specific parity.\n\nLooking at the production rules, all non-terminals produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals generated by expanding the non-terminals. Each non-terminal, when expanded, can produce more non-terminals or terminals. So the length of the string can vary, but the key is that each terminal is a single token.\n\nHowever, the starting point is that the initial productions for S are all pairs of non-terminals. So the leftmost symbol is a non-terminal, which starts the chain.\n\nSo, each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. The string is built by replacing non-terminals with their respective rules until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo the number of terminals in the string must be equal to 1 + 2n, where n is the number of productions applied. So total number of terminals is odd because 1 + 2n is always odd. However, the given string has 45 terminals, which is odd, so that doesn't immediately rule it out.\n\nBut let's dig deeper. Each non-terminal in the grammar has a production that either leads to more non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT47 can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. Similarly for others.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated, we need to see if there's a way to parse the string token by token, expanding non-terminals according to the rules.\n\nLet me look at the string structure:\n\nt0 t3 t0 t0 t0 t3 t3 t0 t0 t2 t2 t1 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t0 t3 t4 t2 t1 t3 t1 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t4 t2 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t0 t4 t4 t2 t0 t3 t4\n\nIt's a long string, so I need a strategy. One approach is to try to split the string into pairs that could be the result of a production.\n\nSince each production for S starts with two non-terminals, perhaps I can start splitting the string into pairs and see if each pair matches any of the productions.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo the first two symbols after S would need to match the first symbols of these productions.\n\nThe string starts with t0. So we need to see what NT64, NT97, etc., produce.\n\nLooking into the non-terminals:\n\nNT64 can produce t4 (from NT64 -> t4) or other non-terminals if possible. Wait, in the given grammar, NT64 has production NT64 -> NT84 NT62, which are both non-terminals. Then each of those can be expanded further. So NT64's productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the production rules for non-terminals, some of them have productions that directly go to a terminal, others split into two non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\nNT53 -> NT86 NT33\nNT98 -> NT78 NT14\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\nNT7 -> NT66 NT48\nAnd so on.\n\nBut there are also productions where a non-terminal goes directly to a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-876","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All the productions start with S, which is the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that S starts by producing combinations like NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, and so on. Each production seems to be splitting into two non-terminals at a time. Some of these non-terminals are then further broken down into other non-terminals, while others directly translate into terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: \"t0 t2 t2 t2 t3 t1 t0 t4 t1 t0 t2 t4 t4 t3 t3 t2 t0 t2 t1 t0 t3 t0 t4 t1 t4 t4 t2 t4 t0 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t0 t1 t0 t3 t2 t3 t2 t1 t1 t1 t3.\"\n\nNow, my task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length should be 2^n + 1 (including start symbol transformations), but let me check that first.\n\nWait, actually, for a CNF grammar, each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. So, the number of symbols in the derived string (excluding the start symbol's direct replacement) is a power of 2. But considering that each step can result in branching, the total number of tokens might be 2^k, but in this case, the string's length is quite long\u2014let me count.\n\nCounting the tokens in the string: each 't' followed by a number is a single token, so the length is 39 tokens. Hmm, 39 is not a power of 2. The powers of 2 up to 32 and 64: 32 is 2^5, 64 is 2^6. 39 isn't a power of 2, so perhaps that's an immediate red flag, but not necessarily a sure conclusion because sometimes the derivation could be more complex.\n\nWait, no, in a typical leftmost derivation, each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal. So, starting from S, which produces two non-terminals, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, replacing one with two. So, from S, after one step, we have two non-terminals. After two steps, each of those could produce two non-terminals each, so up to four. But in the end, the string is all terminals, so each non-terminal must directly produce a terminal at some point.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-terminals in the derivation tree can vary, but the number of terminals in the end depends on how many non-terminals were expanded and when. So perhaps the number of terminals corresponds to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is a number equal to 2^k for some k, or perhaps variable if not restricted.\n\nWait, but 39 is an odd number, which would imply that it can't be a perfect power of 2. So that might indicate that the string isn't possible because each production adds one non-terminal and each step increases the total number of non-terminals by one. So starting from one (S), each production leads to two, so the total number of non-terminals after k steps is 2^k. But when you have terminals at some point, each terminal is added without increasing non-terminals. So the number of tokens in the end is between 2^k and 2^k + something, but the string's length is 39, which isn't a power of 2 or easily derivable from it. So maybe this is a no.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Actually, in CNF, the number of terminals in the generated string should satisfy that the number of non-terminals is (n-1), where n is the number of terminals. Because each non-terminal is replaced by two, so each step adds one more symbol. So n = m + 1, where m is the number of non-terminals in the final string.\n\nBut in CNF, for a string of length n, the number of non-terminals in the derivation tree would be (n - 1). So, for 39 terminals, the number of non-terminals should be 38. But that's a bit abstract. Maybe I'm mixing up the concepts.\n\nAlternatively, each non-terminal leads to two, so the number of leaves is 2^k, where k is the number of times a non-terminal split. Since the grammar is CNF, each step splits one non-terminal into two. So, the length of the string (all terminals) would be 2^k, where k is the number of productions used starting from S.\n\nWait, so for example, starting with S (1 non-terminal), first production gives two, so string could have 1 or 2 symbols? No, wait, no, because to reach terminals, each non-terminal must be expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the entire thing. The string is 39 tokens. If the grammar is in CNF, the number of non-terminal symbols in the derivation trees should be such that the total number of tokens is 2^k, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: I can try to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is given, I can attempt to find a derivation from S to the given string. But that might take a long time given that it's 39 tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for patterns in the grammar. Let me try to see what the start symbol S can produce. From S, it can go to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. So each of these are combinations of two non-terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with t0, then t2, etc. So perhaps I can see if the first few tokens can be generated by any of these productions.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nWhat do NT64 and NT96 produce? From the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, and NT54 \u2192 NT1 NTNT... Wait, let's follow that.\n\nWait, let me try to work this out step by step. It might be time-consuming, but let's try to build a parse tree.\n\nAnother approach: build a top-down parse starting from S. Let's see.\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNow, the string starts with t0, which corresponds to NT64 or NT96, etc.\n\nLooking at NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So after S\u2192 NT64 NT96, each of these non-terminals need to produce the respective terminals.\n\nNT64: NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, then NT4\u2192t1. NT62 \u2192 t0. So NT64 produces t1 t0.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. NT54 \u2192 NT1 NT68. NT1 \u2192 t2. NT68 \u2192 t4. So NT54 is t2 t4. NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33. NT86 \u2192 t0. NT33 \u2192 t1.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to see what the initial parts of the string would look like.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then we start with NT64 and NT96 each producing their terminals. NT64 would produce t1 t0 (from NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, then NT84\u2192NT4 NT1, which is t1\u2192t1; and NT62\u2192t0. So t1 t0: t1 t0.\n\nWait, no, actually, the productions would be in sequence. So, after NT64, which is NT84 NT62, which would produce t1 (from NT84) followed by t0 (from NT62). So the output for NT64 is t1 t0.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. NT54 \u2192 NT1 NT68, which is t2 t4 (since NT1\u2192t2 and NT68\u2192t4). Then, NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33, which is t0 t1 (since NT86\u2192t0 and NT33\u2192t1). So putting that together, NT54 \u2192 t2 t4, and NT53 \u2192 t0 t1. So NT96 \u2192 t2 t4 t0 t1.\n\nSo, putting it together: S \u2192 NT64 (t1 t0) and NT96 (t2 t4 t0 t1).

The string is a sequence of t0, t1, t2, etc., which I assume are terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The given grammar is in CNF because all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n\nI need to see if the given string can be derived from any of these starting productions by applying rule replacements until all symbols are terminals. The string starts with t0 t0, so let me look at which non-terminals can produce t0.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT68 \u2192 t0, NT97 \u2192 t2, NT3 \u2192 t0, NT77 \u2192 t3, etc. So t0 can come from NT68, NT3, or maybe others. But looking closer, the production NT3 is \u2192 NT22 NT74, which then can produce t4 or t3, so maybe NT3 won't directly produce t0. So t0 is directly from NT68 or any other non-terminal that directly maps to t0.\n\nWait, the production NT68 \u2192 't0', yes. So the first step would involve replacing S with one of its productions. Let's say I take S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then I need to see if I can derive the string from NT64 and NT96.\n\nLooking at NT64: \u2192 NT84 NT62.\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\nNT4 is a terminal? No, wait, NT4 is a non-terminal because I don't see any rule for it. Wait, the production NT4 is not in the list. Hmm, did I miss that? Let me check the grammar rules again. Oh, the grammar provided lists all the productions. I see NT47, NT66, etc., but NT4 is not present. So NT4 must be treated as a terminal, but wait, in the given grammar, all non-terminals are on the left side, so NT4 is not a terminal. Or is it? Wait, maybe the grammar doesn't have any rules for NT4, so perhaps it's a terminal.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-examine the grammar. The productions are:\n\nFor example, NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3.\nSo NT47 is a non-terminal. NT21 is another, and NT3 is another. So NT4, NT5, etc., are non-terminals only if they're on the left of a production. Wait, looking through, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nNT47 \u2192 NT47's productions\nNT35 \u2192 't3'\nNT78 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, but in the production list, NT47 isn't mentioned except as a rule for others. So if a non-terminal like NT47 has a production, it's a non-terminal. But if a symbol like 't4' is a terminal, it's a terminal. So maybe 't0', 't1', etc., are terminals, and the rest are non-terminals unless they're defined as terminals.\n\nBut in the grammar provided, the only terminals are those where a non-terminal leads directly to a terminal symbol. For example, NT68 \u2192 't0', so NT68 is a non-terminal that produces 't0'. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 't1', so NT77 is a non-terminal that produces 't1'.\n\nSo now, looking at the string, the first symbol is 't0' which must come from a non-terminal that directly produces it, like NT68 or maybe others.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only way to get t0 is through NT68, NT3 (if NT3 directly produces t0?), but I don't see a production for NT3 except NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74. So NT3 can't directly produce t0. So the first 't0' must come from NT68.\n\nSo let's start by expanding S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNow, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\nNT4: Do I have a production for it? No, so I think NT4 is a terminal, but wait, the production for NT4 isn't listed. So perhaps NT4 is undefined, meaning it cannot produce anything, making this path invalid. So maybe S \u2192 NT64 NT96 leads to dead ends because NT4 isn't defined as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, S could be expanded as S \u2192 NT97 NT7. Let's try that.\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2' (directly). So the first part of the string is 't0', which comes from somewhere else. But if we take S \u2192 NT97 NT7, the first symbol is 't2', which doesn't match the given string starting with 't0'. So that path doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 't0' comes from another path. Wait, perhaps I need to try another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for which non-terminals can produce 't0'. So let's collect all NTs that have a production leading directly to 't0'. From the grammar, NT68 \u2192 't0', NT35 \u2192 't3', etc. Wait, NT53 \u2192 't2', NT62 \u2192 't0'?\n\nLooking through:\n\nLooking at each production, when a non-terminal is followed by a 't' symbol, that's a terminal production. So:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't4', so NT66 can produce 't4'.\nNT7 \u2192 't2', so NT7 can produce 't2'.\nNT68 \u2192 't0', so NT68 can produce 't0'.\nNT33 \u2192 't1'? Wait, no: NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81, both non-terminals except when it's a terminal. Wait, no, looking back, each production ends with a terminal or is two non-terminals except the terminals like 't0'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.

{"custom_id":"request-898","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminal symbols here look like 't0', 't1', etc., and some like 'NT47' are non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S produces NT64 NT96. So the string generated by S must start with whatever NT64 and NT96 produce. Looking at NT64, it has a production NT84 NT62, and NT62 produces NT54 NT62. Wait, that seems like a recursive production. NT62 -> NT54 NT62 could lead to an infinite loop. But in the string provided, I see a 't4' followed by 't3' and other tokens, so I'm not sure if that's an issue.\n\nNext, let's look at the terminals in the string: t3, t3, t3, t0, t3, t1, t2, t2, etc. Each terminal corresponds to some production. I need to see if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. \n\nFor instance, NT3 is a production that leads to 't0', which matches some of the 't0's in the string. Similarly, NT7 leads to 't2', which appears in the string. I should check if all the non-terminals can be expanded correctly step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: t3 t3 t3 t0 t3 t1 t2 t2 t4 t3 t2 t4 t2 t2 t3 t4 t4 t2 t2 t0 t3 t4 t0 t3 t0 t4 t3 t2 t1 t0 t2 t2 t0 t3 t0 t3 t2 t1 t0 t0 t0 t0 t3 t4 t3 t0. \n\nLet's parse from the start symbol S:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT4 is in the terminal, which is 't0', so 't0' matches the third 't0' in the string.\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nThis seems to get complex. Maybe instead of expanding, I should look for a way to assign each token to a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 'tXY' corresponds to a production for a non-terminal. So, for example, if I have 't3 t3 t3', each 't3' could come from a specific non-terminal that expands to that sequence.\n\nI notice that 't3' appears multiple times. Looking at the productions for non-terminals, I see NT7 \u2192 t2, NT98 \u2192 t1, NT97 \u2192 t2, etc. Wait, but the string has 't3's. Let me check all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT47 has two entries: one as NT47 \u2192 t0 and another as NT47 \u2192 t4. Similarly, NT68 \u2192 t2, t3, t4 depending on the production. Oh, I see. Each non-terminal can have multiple productions leading to different terminals.\n\nSo, to assign the string, I need to find a way to match each terminal and possibly backtrack if necessary. It's like a parsing problem.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are terminals. The challenge is to see if the given string can be constructed by the grammar.\n\nLet me pick the first part of the string: t3 t3 t3 t0. If the first t3 is from NT7 \u2192 t2, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps it's from NT84 \u2192 t4 and some other expansion, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token in the string represents a non-terminal that directly produces that terminal. So, if the string is t3 t3 t3 t0..., then each t3 must be from some production that outputs t3. Looking at the productions, I see that NT47 can be t0, t3, or t4. Similarly, NT7 can be t2. Wait, where do 't3's come from?\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- NT47 can be t0, t4, or t3.\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT96 \u2192 t3\n- NT1 \u2192 t2\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT70 \u2192 t3\n- NT27 \u2192 t2\n- NT62 \u2192 t0\n- NT53 \u2192 t2\n- NT66 \u2192 t4\n- NT84 \u2192 t0\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list all non-terminals and their possible terminal outputs:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 t0 (once), t4 (another), t3 (another)\n- NT66 \u2192 t4\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 t0 (from NT84 \u2192 t0) followed by t0 (from NT62 \u2192 t0)\n  So NT64 would produce t0 t0\n- NT68 \u2192 t0 (from NT47 \u2192 t0), or t2 (from another production)\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT84 \u2192 t0\n- NT33 \u2192 t1 and t0\n- NT96 \u2192 t3\n- NT97 \u2192 t2, t2, t4\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe this is too time-consuming. Maybe I should consider that each 'tX' corresponds to a specific non-terminal's production.\n\nGiven that the grammar has multiple non-terminals leading to each term, perhaps the string can be split into tokens that match these productions.\n\nBut another approach is to note that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So the string's length should be such that it can be built by expanding the start symbol S, which initially produces two non-terminals (since S \u2192 NT64 NT96). Each of these can produce two more, and so on, leading to 2^n symbols at each step.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string. The string has 37 tokens. Starting from S, which gives 2 symbols, then each can split into 2, so after n steps, it's 2^n symbols. We need 2^n = 37, but 37 is not a power of 2. However, some symbols may be leaves (terminals), so not all steps have to split.\n\nWait, in an expansion, some non-terminals produce terminals, stopping the splitting. So the total number of leaves (terminals) can be more than a power of two, but the exact count depends on how many non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nGiven that some non-terminals produce only terminals (e.g., NT3 \u2192 't0'), while others produce two non-terminals, the string length can vary. But in this case, 37 is possible if the grammar expands enough times.\n\nBut focusing on the content, let's see if each terminal can be matched. For example, the first few tokens:\n\nt3, t3, t3, t0.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that produces t3, then another, and so on.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT47 can produce t3, but other NT's also produce t3. For example, NT33 can produce t1 and t0, so that's not helpful. Maybe NT36 \u2192 t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should better list all possible ways each terminal can be produced:\n\n- t0: NT3, NT62, NT84, NT96, NT66, NT47 (multiple times)\n- t1: NT77 (occurs twice), NT21, NT68, NT74, NT3, NT98, NT1, others\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to look for any production that can produce 't3'.\n\nFrom the provided productions:\n\nLooking for any production ending with 't3'. Wait, I don't see any. Let me check:\n\nThe productions only show NT47 \u2192 t0, t4, etc. Wait, no 't3' productions? Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back: \n\nIn the productions, I see:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't3'\n- NT47 \u2192 't3' \n- NT64 \u2192 t0\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT78 \u2192 t0\nWait, let me check all productions:\n\nLooking through each production that ends with a terminal:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 t0\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT74 \u2192 t4\n- NT33 \u2192 t1\n- NT54 \u2192 t1\n- NT66 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF has two main rules: S can produce two non-terminals, and non-terminals produce two non-terminals or a terminal. This grammar seems to have several production rules that lead to terminals (denoted by 't' followed by numbers) and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce combinations of NT and T, like NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, etc. Each of these non-terminals eventually leads to a terminal string after expanding.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of t's and numbers. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's likely structured in a way where each t represents a single terminal step. My goal is to see if the given string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S according to the rules.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to build the string step by step, starting from S and applying the productions until I reach the given string. Alternatively, since this could be very lengthy, perhaps I can find a pattern or see if the string can be segmented into parts that match the rules.\n\nLet me list some key points:\n\n1. The grammar consists of non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) that expand into other non-terminals or directly into terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n2. The string is a sequence of these terminals, each of which must correspond to a direct expansion of a non-terminal in the grammar.\n3. The problem is essentially to parse the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven the length of the string, a full bottom-up or top-down parsing might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for possible substring matches that could correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me try to identify which non-terminals correspond to which terminals:\n\nLooking at the production rules, for example, NT64 -> NT84 NT62, which eventually leads to 't4' and 't0' because NT84 is 't2' but wait, wait. Looking closer, NT84 -> NT4 NT1, and NT4 -> 't1', NT1 -> 't2', so NT84 would expand to 't1 t2', right? Hmm, but in the string, 't4' appears. How do we get 't4'?\n\nWait, I think I need to map all the non-terminals to their terminal sequences. Let me list each non-terminal and its expansion:\n\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12, but both NT47 and NT12 can produce t's. Let's see: NT47 -> 't1' or other? Wait, NT47 has productions like NT1 or NT2, but no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the productions, most non-terminals have only one production except some. For example, NT68 -> 't4' and 't3'? Wait, no, check the given rules again.\n\nWait, the grammar as given is a set of production rules:\n\nLooking back, for NT68, there's a rule NT68 -> 't4' and another NT68 -> 't3'? Or is it that each line is a separate production? Wait, the grammar is written as a list, each line is an alternative production. So for example, S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, etc.\n\nBut for NT68, looking through all the rules, I see multiple lines where NT68 is on the left. For example:\n\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT53 -> NT86 NT33\n- NT75 -> NT98 NT26\n- NT70 -> NT84 NT36\n- NT27 -> NT24 NT62\n- NT3 -> NT22 NT74\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n- NT97 -> NT43 NT75\n- NT84 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT63 -> 't1' [Wait, NT63 is directly 't1'? Or does it have NT3 on the right? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some non-terminals seem to directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT63 -> 't1'\n- NT47 -> 't1'\n- NT68 -> 't4'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't1'\n- NT86 -> 't0'\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't0'\n- NT77 -> 't3'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT78 -> 't0'\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't2'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT39 -> 't0'\n- NT64 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't2'\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't1'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT66 -> 't4'\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT68 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> 't3'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT74 -> 't4'\n- NT33 -> 't0' [Wait, does this mean NT33 can produce 't0'? But elsewhere NT33 -> NT84 NT81. So NT33 has two rules: one producing 't0' and another producing NT84 NT81. But in context, when a non-terminal has multiple rules, each rule is an alternative, so NT33 can either be 't0' or expand into NT84 NT81. However, in this case, NT84 is a non-terminal, so that rule would lead to further expansion. Similarly, NT33 can directly go to 't0'.\n\nThis is crucial because the presence of two rules for a non-terminal means it can sometimes produce a terminal or a combination. So, for NT33, it can either directly produce 't0' or go into NT84 NT81.\n\nSimilarly, NT36 has a production NT36 -> 't4'.\n\nSo, considering this, I'll need to parse each t in the string and see if it can be matched by a non-terminal's terminal output.\n\nLet me also note that in the given string, 't0' appears multiple times. So I need to ensure that there's a production path that can reach 't0' from S through the grammar.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I should try to see the entire string as a sequence of terminals and check whether it can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of building a parse tree. However, due to time constraints, maybe it's better to look for a way to segment the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's production rules.\n\nLet me attempt to break the string into sections that might correspond to the non-terminals' expansions.\n\nLooking at the given string: t0 t2 t4 t3 t1 t3 t2 t0 t0 t2 t2 t3 t2 t0 t2 t1 t1 t0 t1 t0 t1 t1 t0 t4 t2 t2 t1 t4 t0 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t4 t2 t2 t3 t4 t0.\n\nThat's a long string. Let me write it out to make it clearer:\n\nt0, t2, t4, t3, t1, t3, t2, t0, t0, t2, t2, t3, t2, t0, t2, t1, t1, t0, t1, t0, t1, t1, t0, t4, t2, t2, t1, t4, t0, t1, t4, t1, t3, t0, t2, t4, t0, t0, t1, t4, t3, t4, t2, t2, t3, t4, t0.\n\nI need to find if this can be derived from S.\n\nStarting from S, which can produce two NTs. So the first step is to split the string into parts that can be produced by NT1 and NT2 from the S production.\n\nFirst production of S: NT64 NT96.\n\nWhat do NT64 and NT96 produce?\n\nLooking:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.

{"custom_id":"request-912","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which simplifies things because all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the symbols are non-terminals (like S, NT47, NT1, etc.) except for several 't's and numbers like t0, t1, etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't's and numbers: `t4 t4 t4 t4 ...` and so on. \n\nFirst, I should check if the grammar allows these terms. The grammar has several production rules that produce specific terminals. For example, some rules produce t0, t1, t2, etc. So, it's possible that the string can be generated, but I need to make sure the structure of the string corresponds to the possible derivations.\n\nLet me list out some of the terminal productions to see the possible terminals:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 t1 (multiple times)\n- NT34 \u2192 t4\n- NT48 \u2192 t1\n- NT97 \u2192 t2\n- NT66 \u2192 t4\n- NT64 \u2192 t4\n- NT78 \u2192 t0\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT96 \u2192 t4\n- NT80 \u2192 t3\n- NT77 \u2192 t3 or t1\n- NT33 \u2192 t1 or t0\n- NT1 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT68 \u2192 t4 or t3 or t2\n- NT14 \u2192 t0\n- NT75 \u2192 t0\n- NT98 \u2192 t1, t0, t2, etc.\n- NT53 \u2192 t2 or t0\n- NT84 \u2192 t2, etc.\n\nEach of these terminals can be used in the production rules. The starting symbol is S, which produces S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the initial step is to have S lead to NT64 and NT96. Both of these are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT64's production: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT64 will expand into NT84 (which is another non-terminal) and NT62. \n\nNT84 produces t2, which is a terminal, and NT62 can produce various non-terminals. Let's see what NT62 does: NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63. NT52 expands to NT5 NT26, and NT5 is t2, while NT26 can be NT24 or NT26 again. Wait, looking at NT26: nt26 \u2192 nt24 nt62?

Let's see NT24's rules: From the grammar, I don't see NT24 directly, but looking back in the given grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar includes:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n\nAnd NT38 has several options. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT24:\n\nIn the grammar, it says NT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70.\n\nThen NT38 can be 't4' or 't3' or something else.\n\nWait, no. NT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27 or NT34 NT27, but wait, from the user\u2019s grammar:\n\nLooking at NT38's production: \n\n\"NT38 -> NT34 NT27\nNT12 -> NT82 NT48\n...\nOther rules include NT38 -> NT63 NT96, but no, wait, that's not correct.

{"custom_id":"request-931","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules and the string. The grammar has several NT rules that eventually derive into terminal symbols 't0', 't1', 't2', etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these t's: `t2 t3 t0 t4 t4 t4 t1 t2 t0 t1 t0 t1 t0 t1 t4 t1 t0 t1 t2 t1 t1 t3 t2 t2 t4 t4 t2 t4 t2 t0 t1 t4 t1 t4 t4 t3 t2 t1 t1 t3`.\n\nThis is a long string, so checking step by step might be tedious, but I can try to find patterns or look for any inconsistencies.\n\nStarting with the grammar's start symbol S, which can be rewritten in three ways: S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, or S \u2192 NT35 NT84. Let's consider each possibility.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96: I'll need to derive the string starting with the symbols leading to NT64 and NT96. Looking at the NT64 rule: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So, NT64 would expand into two parts. Then NT84 is part of NT64, and NT62 is another. But I don't know NT84 and NT62's rules yet. Wait, I should check all the given rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, NT63 \u2192 't1', and NT52 \u2192 't2'. So if I have a path like NT66, it can be 't2 t1'. Similarly, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT84 needs to be expanded.\n\nFrom the rules, NT84's possible expansions include NT47 NT1, which then breaks down into NT47 \u2192 something and NT1 \u2192 something. Let me see:\n\nNT47 can go to NT21 NT3, and NT21 is not a terminal. Checking NT21, it's not in the production rules. Wait, but looking again, the user might have made a typo because in the provided rules, I don't see NT21. Let me check all the provided rules again.\n\nLooking through the list, NT21 isn't mentioned. Hmm, that might be an issue. Or perhaps I misread. Let me go through the rules carefully.\n\nThe user provided a list of productions, each under headings like 'NT47 -> ...', etc. Looking through, I don't see NT21. So NT21 isn't defined, which could mean it's a typo or perhaps it's supposed to be another NT. Similarly, NT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39 can't be applied infinitely, so perhaps it leads to a loop, but that might indicate that the grammar is infinitely recursive, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string starts with t2, t3, t0, etc., perhaps I can trace back from the t's to see if they can be generated by the grammar rules.\n\nGiven that the t's come from specific NT rules that expand into the terminal symbols, I can map each t to its NT rule and see if the order and combinations make sense.\n\nFor example, t2 could come from NT68 or maybe NT27. Let me check:\n\nLooking through NT production rules:\n\n- NT68 goes to 't4', 't3', 't2', 't1', etc. Wait, from the provided rules:\n\nNT68:\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT1\n- NT68 \u2192 't4'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT68 \u2192 't2'\n- NT68 \u2192 't1'\n\nSo NT68 can be t0, t1, t2, t3, t4.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62. NT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70, which then can go on. It's getting complicated.\n\nGiven the string starts with t2, perhaps it comes from NT68. Let's assume S expands into NT64 NT96. Then NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So the first part would be NT64 generating NT84 and NT62.\n\nLooking at NT84, possible rules:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT47 NT1\n- NT84 \u2192 't4'\n- NT84 \u2192 't3'\n- NT84 \u2192 't0'\n- NT84 \u2192 't2'\n\nIf NT84 is 't2', then perhaps NT84 is mapped accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, NT62 can be 't0' according to the rules.\n\nSo the string starts with t2 (from NT84) and then t0 (from NT62), which matches the beginning of the string: t2 t3 t0... Wait, wait, that's an inconsistency because the first two symbols are t2 and t3, but NT84 and NT62 together could generate t2 and then next symbols from NT62.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider pairs. Let me think. Each production is a binary split, so every symbol in the derived string corresponds to a terminal in the expansion of each non-terminal.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT64 NT96, the derived string would be the combination of NT64's expansion and NT96's expansion.\n\nEach NT's expansion could produce a sequence of t's, so the entire string is the concatenation of these sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the entire string to be split into units generated by each NT's expansion. Each NT can produce a certain string, and when combined from S's productions, the overall string should be matched.\n\nBut this approach might take too long, given the string length. Maybe I can look for patterns or possible contradictions.\n\nLooking deeper into the rules, I notice that some NTs are in cycles. For example:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3\n\nBut there's no NT21 in the provided rules, which might be an error or if it's intentional, perhaps it's a base symbol, but since it's not defined, it's unclear. Similarly, NT98's rules might lead to a cycle, but that's complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each NT may expand into a fixed t-symbol, except for cases where they can produce multiple t's or new NTs. Wait, looking at some rules:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63. NT52 \u2192 't2', NT63 \u2192 't1', so NT66 \u2192 t3? Wait, no, because NT66 expands into 't2' and 't1', but the rule itself is NT66 \u2192 't2' 't1', but wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, the user's rules for NT66 say NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63. Then each of these can be further expanded. NT52 \u2192 't2', NT63 \u2192 't1', so NT66 \u2192 t2 t1.\n\nBut in the string, I'm looking for sequences of t's that might match this.\n\nAnother example: NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. NT43 and NT75 can be expanded further.\n\nBut perhaps instead of tracing, let's consider the overall string structure.\n\nThe string is: t2 t3 t0 t4 t4 t4 t1 t2 t0 t1 t0 t1 t0 t1 t4 t1 t0 t1 t2 t1 t1 t3 t2 t2 t4 t4 t2 t4 t2 t0 t1 t4 t1 t4 t4 t3 t2 t1 t1 t3.\n\nNotice that this string contains several t3, t4, etc. I should check if each t in the string can correspond to possible NT expansions.\n\nFor instance, t3 can come from NT5, NT23, NT24, NT68, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3, which is two rules: NT68 can be 't2', 't3', 't4', etc. So NT5 \u2192 something that produces two t's (since NT68 is a terminal). So NT5 would generate two t's at once.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 \u2192 NT38 NT70. Let's see NT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27, which then can be further broken down.\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be split into parts where each part is a possible expansion of an NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a specific sequence that doesn't match any of the NT rules.\n\nWait, looking at the first few t's: t2 t3 t0.\n\nIs there a way for the grammar to produce t2 followed by t3? For instance, let's say S \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-932","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the components here. The grammar provided consists of production rules, and each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, which fits the CNF definition since each production has a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. Wait, no, in CNF each production has two symbols on the right, which can be terminals or non-terminals, but in some definitions, they are restricted to non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the grammar is strictly in CNF where both sides are non-terminals, but in this case, the rules sometimes have terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So perhaps this isn't a strict CNF, but rather a slight variation. I'll proceed assuming that the grammar allows for such productions as given.\n\nNext, the string we need to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' symbols: `t0 t3 t4 t2 t0 t2 t3 t4 t4 t1 t2 t4 t4 t4 t1 t2 t0 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t3 t3 t3 t0 t3 t1 t4 t3 t1 t2 t1 t4 t2 t2 t4 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t3 t0 t0 t1 t1`.\n\nSo the task is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can approach this by trying to parse the string using a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm, or alternatively, construct the parse tree starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production from S is S \u2192 NT1 NT96, among others. Wait, no, actually looking back, the grammar options for S are three:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7\n\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nBut wait, in the initial list, S is rewritten in three ways, each combining two non-terminals. So the first step is to consider which of these three production rules in the S set can be used to start generating the string.\n\nEach of these options involves two non-terminals, so I think the first step in the parsing would be applying one of these productions and then trying to match the generated structure against the string.\n\nWait, but all the non-terminals in the grammar seem to have their own productions, which can either split into more non-terminals or eventually become terminals (the 't's). So perhaps I can model this as a series of steps building the string, replacing non-terminals with their productions until all non-terminals are replaced by 't's.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the given productions, for example, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. But then NT54 produces 't4' and NT53 produces 't2' or something else? Wait, no, looking at the given production rules, some of the options are 't0', 't1', 't2', etc., which are terminals. So in the rules, when a non-terminal is written as, say, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, that doesn't directly resolve to a terminal, so I need to see all the way down until a terminal is produced.\n\nWait, maybe the best way is to represent this as a tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals. Then, the string is a series of these terminals, and the grammar needs to produce exactly that.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, and this continues until we reach the terminals. Each production of a non-terminal either is a terminal itself or splits into two non-terminals.\n\nSo the given string is a sequence of t0, t3, t4, t2, etc. So the first question is: what's the string length? Let's count: 41 tokens? Wait, the string given is:\n\nt0 t3 t4 t2 t0 t2 t3 t4 t4 t1 t2 t4 t4 t4 t1 t2 t0 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t3 t3 t3 t0 t3 t1 t4 t3 t1 t2 t1 t4 t2 t2 t4 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t1 t3 t0 t0 t1 t1.\n\nWait, actually, the exact string is given as a sequence of these tokens. So starting from S, each step should create a structure that matches the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But since the grammar is provided, I can try to map out how the non-terminals could produce the given string.\n\nLet me consider the string as a list of terminals, and the start non-terminal S can produce two non-terminals, which themselves can produce the required sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree bottom-up, starting from the terminals and working up to derive the start symbol S.\n\nWait, but considering the complexity, maybe looking for patterns in the production rules can help. For example, the first production for S is NT64 NT96. So S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which would then each of those have to derive sequences that combine to form the input string.\n\nLooking at the input string, it starts with t0, t3, t4, t2, etc. So perhaps S's first production, NT64 and NT96, should each generate some part of the string.\n\nBut NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, according to the given rules. NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. NT4 is given as producing 't1', and NT1 is given as producing 't2'. So if I follow this, NT84 becomes t1 t2. Similarly, NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63. NT52 \u2192 NT52 is still a non-terminal, but wait, NT52's production is NT52 \u2192 NT52 \u2192 Wait, no, look back.\n\nWait, the productions include things like NT52 \u2192 NT52, which might indicate a circular production, causing infinite loops, but perhaps I should check each non-terminal's productions to see if any can produce a terminal string.\n\nWait, let's take each non-terminal and see if it can be expanded to a terminal string.\n\nFor example, NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12. NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which then each of those would be split again. This could go on indefinitely unless somewhere it hits a non-terminal that can be expanded into a terminal. But looking through the given rules, some non-terminals do have terminals in their productions, like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, where maybe NT52 can be a terminal? Wait no, NT52's production is NT52 \u2192 NT52, which is infinite.\n\nWait, no, in the given rules, for example, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, and then NT52 \u2192 NT52. Hmm, that suggests that NT52 can only produce itself, which is a problem because it needs to terminate into a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list some productions to see if any non-terminal can be expanded into a terminal. For instance, NT68 is given as NT47 NT12, and NT47 is NT1 NT62. So NT1 is either 't2' or another non-terminal. Checking the rules: NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. Hmm, both are non-terminals. NT5 is NT68 NT3, again non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, some non-terminals directly lead to terminals:\n\nLooking at the ending rules, for example:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT80 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't0'\n\nAnd others. Wait, perhaps I can list out where each non-terminal leads to:\n\nLooking through the given productions, for each non-terminal, if any of its right-hand sides contain a terminal, it can be expanded into that terminal.

The string is a sequence of tokens, each potentially representing a node in the derivation tree. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's structured where each production starts with S and goes through various NT (non-terminal) symbols until it reaches terminals ('t0', 't1', etc.). My string to evaluate is a series of these 't' tokens: t2 t4 t4 t0 t3 t2 t1 t3 t1 t2 t1 t0 t2 t3 t1 t0 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t4 t4 t0 t3 t0 t3 t3 t4 t3 t4 t0 t3 t2 t1 t1 t4 t3 t4 t1 t4 t1 t1 t4 t4 t2 t2 t0 t2.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production is to two non-terminals at the top level, except the start symbol which may produce terminals as well. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol S has productions like S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, etc. So S can go to two NTs, each of which can go further until terminals are reached.\n\nThe string is long, but perhaps I can look for the production rules that start with the given tokens. Let's see, the string starts with t2 t4 t4. I'll need to check if there's a production that can derive t2 t4 t4.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, each non-terminal has a production that either goes to two other non-terminals or ends with a terminal. For example, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, and NT54 \u2192 t4, NT53 \u2192 t4? Wait, from the given rules, I see NT54 has two different productions: one to 't4' and another to 't3'? Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nWait, looking back, each rule is under NT followed by the non-terminals it produces. The rules for NT54 are two: one says NT54 -> 't4' and another NT54 -> 't3'. Oh, so NT54 can produce 't4' or 't3'. Similarly, other non-terminals have multiple productions.\n\nWait, so to get t2, I need to find a non-terminal that produces t2. Let's check all the rules for t2.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48, but neither of those directly produce t2. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, under NT, some produce t's.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each rule has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, S branches into several combinations. Each of these NTs then expands further, often into other NTs until they hit a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's a sequence of t's followed by numbers. Each t followed by a number seems to correspond to a specific production in the grammar. For example, NT47 \u2192 t1 or t2 based on the rules.\n\nI should map each part of the string to the possible NT productions. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t2 t1. So, the first two t's. Since the grammar is CNF, each step produces two symbols. So, starting from S, which is two NTs, the first two symbols should come from the replacement of those two NTs.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S's options are NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, NT35 NT84.\n\nEach of these, when replaced, should produce the string starting with t2 t1.\n\nLet's take each possibility:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96: Let's see what NT64 and NT96 produce. From the rules:\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 NT1 (Wait, NT4's production isn't listed. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Looking back, in the production list, there's NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, but nothing for NT4. That might be a mistake, or maybe I need to check again. Wait, in the rules provided, there's \"NT47 -> NT1 NT62\", but \"NT4 -> t1\". Ah, yes, looking through the list, I see \"NT4 -> t1\". So NT4 is a terminal 't1'.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t2 t1 at the beginning. Let's consider S \u2192 NT97 NT7 because that might give us a t2 and the rest. \n\nLooking at NT97: From the rules, there's NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. NT43 \u2192 NT0? Wait, no, let's see the rules. Looking through, I see NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, and NT43 \u2192 NT0? No, checking the list, I don't see NT43. Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n- NT43 isn't listed as expanding further, but NT43 isn't a terminal; perhaps it's a non-terminal that doesn't expand, but in the given rules, NT43 isn't present. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking through all the rules, I don't see NT43 or NT77, etc. as non-terminals. Wait, perhaps the string corresponds to the non-terminals that do expand, and the t's represent terminals.\n\nWait, the string is all t's followed by numbers, like \"t2 t1 t4 t2...\". So each t followed by a number is a terminal symbol.\n\nI think I need to map each tX as a terminal. So, for example, t2 is a terminal, t1 is another, and so on up to perhaps t9, t0, etc. So, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and the other non-terminals are the NTs with no terminals.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals. Each step in the grammar must generate two terminals or NTs until we reach the start symbol.\n\nGiven that, the grammar is a binary tree, each node having two children, until leaves are terminals.\n\nSo, the string is of length 45. Since each production is a split into two, starting from S, the number of productions should be log2(45), but that might not be needed. The important thing is whether the string can be split into a valid derivation path.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step either splits a non-terminal into two symbols (possibly mixing NTs and terminals) or terminates when a terminal is produced.\n\nBut this might be complex. Maybe a better approach is to look for the start symbol and see if it can derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for the possible terminals starting from S.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nWe'll check each possibility to see if they can lead to the string starting with t2 t1.\n\nFirst, let's look at S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75.\n\nWait, NT43 is not in the initial productions, so perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, in the initial rules, the NTs are defined as:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT63 \u2192 't1'\nNT47 \u2192 't1'\nWait, no, some NTs are terminals like NT4 \u2192 t1, NT3 \u2192 t0, etc.\n\nSo, in the first case, S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nLet's see what NT97 and NT7 produce.\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75.\n\nWait, but NT43 isn't defined as a production. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, maybe the initial list of rules was incomplete. Wait, looking back, the user provided a long list of rules. Let me check:\n\nThe user's list starts with S -> NT64 NT96 and so on, then a long list of NTs and their productions. After that comes a list of NTs with their production being a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the rules are in a list, and then later on, each NT is defined to produce a terminal. For example, looking through, some NTs are terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t1\n- NT3 \u2192 t0\n- NT98 \u2192 t1\n- NT97 \u2192 t2\n- NT77 \u2192 t2\n- NT98 \u2192 t0\n- NT77 \u2192 t1\n- NT47 \u2192 t1\n- NT25 -> wait, did I mention NT25? I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking through the rules more carefully, in the end, we have:\n\nNT4 -> t1\nNT7 -> t0\nNT74 -> t3\nNT80 -> t3\nNT22 -> t4\nNT54 -> t3\nNT81 -> t1\nNT36 -> t4\nNT77 -> t3\nNT96 -> t4\nNT47 -> t4\nNT1 -> t2\nNT77 -> t1\nNT7 -> t0\nNT74 -> t3\nNT80 -> t2\nNT22 -> t3\nNT5 -> t2\nNT21 -> t4\nNT52 -> t4\nNT43 -> t0\nNT53 -> t2\nNT84 -> t0\nNT34 -> t4\nNT96 -> t3\nNT62 -> t0\n\nWait, perhaps the list was cut off, but the idea is that some NTs are terminals, others are non-terminals. So, let's see.\n\nBack to the string: It starts with t2 t1. Let's see which production can lead to that.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nNT97, according to the rules, is \u2192 NT43 NT75. But if NT43 and NT75 are non-terminals, then we'd get t2 t2 if their productions lead to terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps S \u2192 NT97 NT7, and NT97 \u2192 t2 (if it directly produces t2?) But looking at the rules, NT97 is in the initial list, so it's a non-terminal. Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through the initial rules, I see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nAnd for NT97, in the long list, I see:\n\nNT97 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-970","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals, which can be considered as strings of length 1.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar and the string. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t4 t4 t1 and so on. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, and S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So S must start the string. Let's see which of these are the first part of the string.\n\nThe first symbols are t4 t4 t1. Looking at the productions, NT64 can produce t4, because NT64 \u2192 t4. Wait, let me check that. Under NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. But then NT84 can be broken down: NT84 \u2192 t2, and NT62 \u2192 t0. So NT64 would produce t2 t0, which doesn't match t4. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me look at the productions for NT64. Oh, in the given grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. But there's another production for NT84: NT84 \u2192 t4. So maybe I need to go further down. Let me see what NT64 does. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, NT84 \u2192 t4, and NT62 \u2192 t0. So NT64 would ultimately produce t4 t0. Wait, but in the string, after t4 comes another t4. So if S starts with NT64 (which would be t4 t0), but the string starts t4 t4, so that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe S uses a different production.\n\nLet me look at the options again. The possible first productions for S are NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, and NT35 NT84. Let's see what each of these produces.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 t4 t0. So the first two symbols would be t4 t0, but the string starts with t4 t4, so that's not matching.\n\nNext, NT97 \u2192 NT98 NT26. Wait, no: the grammar says NT98 \u2192 t0. Wait, let's check NT97. NT97 \u2192 t2, because in the list, NT97 \u2192 t2. So if the first production is S \u2192 NT97 NT7, then the first symbol would be t2, but the string starts with t4, so this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with a sub-production of S that uses a different rule. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assessment.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the string again. The string is: t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t3 t2 t2 t4 t1 t1 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t4 t0 t2 t0 t2 t3 t0 t4 t4 t2 t3 t2 t4 t4 t3 t1 t1 t0 t t0 t4 t1 t3 t4 t1 t1 t4 t4 t3 t1 t2 t3 t3 t3.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by trying to build the string from the bottom up, using a CYK algorithm approach since the grammar is in CNF. But since the string is quite long, this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about which parts of the string can only come from specific non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string starting with t4 t4 t1. Let me see if I can find a production for a symbol that leads to t4 t4 t1. But that's more than two symbols, so perhaps it's built from a non-terminal that expands into a sequence that starts with t4 t4 t1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build the parse tree step by step. Starting from S, which can be NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT96 \u2192 t4. So NT64 would be t4 t0 (since NT84 \u2192 t4, NT62 \u2192 t0). Meanwhile, NT96 \u2192 t4. So the concatenation would be t4 t0 t4, which is t4 t0 t4. The string starts with t4 t4. So that doesn't match. So maybe S can't derive the string via this production.\n\nNext, try S \u2192 NT97 NT7. NT97 \u2192 t2, NT7 \u2192 t0. So the string starts with t2 t0, which doesn't match the string which starts with t4 t4. So this path is not possible.\n\nThird option: S \u2192 NT35 NT84. NT35 \u2192 t3, NT84 \u2192 t4. So the initial symbols would be t3 t4, but the string starts with t4 t4, so that doesn't match either.\n\nHmm, none of the initial S production rules are starting with t4 t4, so that suggests that the string might not be in the language. But wait, that can't be right because maybe S uses a different production that combines multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe the first production isn't the one that's leading to the initial t4 t4. Maybe the string comes from a deeper derivation. For example, the string's first t4 could come from a higher-level non-terminal that eventually leads to t4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows multiple S productions to be used in a way that the initial non-terminals produce the t4's. Let me think.\n\nWait, looking at NT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48, which may not be relevant. Let me see NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. NT84 \u2192 t4, NT62 \u2192 t0. So NT64 leads to t4 t0. So S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would lead to t4 t0 followed by whatever NT96 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with t4 t4, so perhaps the first t4 is from NT64, and the next t4 comes from somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe the NT64 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the initial steps. Let me think again about the first possible step.\n\nIf S starts with S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then NT64 \u2192 t4 t0, NT96 \u2192 t4. So the entire right-hand side is t4 t0 t4. So the first three symbols would be t4 t0 t4. But the string starts with t4 t4 t1. So that's a mismatch. Therefore, that production is unlikely to be the starting point.\n\nIf S starts with S \u2192 NT97 NT7, which gives t2 t0. Doesn't match.\n\nIf S starts with S \u2192 NT35 NT84, which gives t3 t4. Also doesn't match.\n\nSo none of these initial productions match the string's starting symbols. Does that mean the string cannot be derived? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the parsing isn't done from the top, but perhaps a higher-level production is used that eventually leads to the starting t4's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production is derived from a deeper structure. Let me see the entire hierarchy.\n\nLooking at NT64 again: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 t4 t0.\n\nLooking at NT96: NT96 \u2192 t4.\n\nSo if we use S \u2192 NT64 NT96, that would lead to t4 t0 t4, which is three symbols.\n\nBut the string starts with t4 t4 t1, which is three symbols. So that could be a match for the first three symbols. Let's see:\n\nt4 (from NT64) t0 (from NT64) t4 (from NT96). But the string is t4 t4 t1. So that doesn't match because the second symbol here is t0, not t4.\n\nHmm, that suggests that this production is not the right path. Maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production S uses another rule, but wait, the only options for S are those three. So maybe the string starts with a different rule that I'm not considering.\n\nWait, maybe the string isn't starting with S \u2192 NT64 NT96. But that would mean that S isn't the start here. But S is the start symbol, so it must generate the entire string. So I'm confused.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the parse tree is built in a way that the first symbols come from deeper productions.

{"custom_id":"request-5","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t2 t2\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems all the non-terminals on the left have two non-terminals on the right, except for a few that produce terminals directly, like NT68 -> 't0' and so on. So it's mostly in CNF.\n\nThe string I'm testing is \"t2 t2\". I notice that the string consists of two 't2' tokens separated by a space. Wait, but in the context of a CFG, I think the space is just a separator for the input; the actual derivation should result in a sequence of terminals without spaces. But maybe I should treat it as the string being 't2' followed by another 't2', so I can treat it as \"t2t2\" for the purposes of parsing. Or perhaps each 't' is a separate terminal symbol, but the context seems to treat sequences as concatenated. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I should proceed by checking the derivation without worrying about the space.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, and S has three production rules: NT1 is derived from NT64 and NT96, S can be NT97 and NT7, or S can be NT35 and NT84. So the initial step is to see which rule applies to produce S.\n\nLooking at the string \"t2 t2\", which would be two terminals. So perhaps each 't2' is a result of a non-terminal that produces either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let's try to see if any rule can directly produce 't2', but looking at the production rules, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't2'. So the two 't2's must be the result of two separate productions, each of which must derive into 't2'.\n\nWait, but looking at the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't2'. So maybe each 't2' comes from a non-terminal that can produce a terminal, but in this case, no NT produces a terminal with t2. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the production rules, NT97 \u2192 't2' is present. Oh, so NT97 can produce 't2'. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 't1', but that's not helpful here.\n\nSo, perhaps the first 't2' is produced from NT97, and the second 't2' from another NT97. But wait, does the grammar allow for NT97 to be the starting point and produce two 't2's? Let me think.\n\nLooking at the start rule: S can be NT97 and NT7. If S is derived as NT97 and NT96, but that's not helpful for two 't2's. Alternatively, S can be NT97 and NT7, but that would produce NT97 NT7, which might not get us anywhere. Or S could be NT35 and NT84, which I don't see producing 't2's.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's a way for T to produce more than one terminal. Another approach is to see if any non-terminals can produce two 't2's. For example, if a non-terminal X \u2192 NT97 NT97, and NT97 \u2192 't2', then X would produce 't2 t2'. So if S can produce X, then S can give us \"t2 t2\".\n\nBut looking at the production rules of S, the start symbol S only goes to NT97 and NT7. So unless NT97 can be split into two NT97s, I don't think that's possible. Because S directly splits into two non-terminals, each of which is either NT97 or NT7 or the other options, but in this case, we need each of those to be NT97.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: S has three options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nIf I want to get two 't2's, perhaps S must be split into two parts, each of which leads to 't2'. For example, both parts could be NT97, each producing 't2'. So S needs to produce NT97 and NT97. But looking at S's rules, none of the rules produce two NT97s. The first rule produces NT64 and NT96, neither of which is NT97. The second rule is NT97 and NT7, which is one NT97 and one NT7. The third rule is NT35 and NT84, which don't include NT97.\n\nSo, unless there's a way for NT97 to be derived from another non-terminal that splits into two NT97s, but looking at the grammar, that doesn't seem to be the case. Let me check: Do any of the non-terminals have a rule like NT97 \u2192 NT97 NT97? Looking through the production rules, I don't see any such rule. So NT97 only directly produces 't2' and can't be further split into more NT97s.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get 't2 t2' is if S can produce NT97 and NT97, but none of the S's production options allow that. So the string \"t2 t2\" cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's an intermediate step where NT97 is part of a larger derivation. Let me try to see if any other non-terminal can lead to two NT97s. For example, maybe some other non-terminal can derive into NT97 and another NT, and then further split into more NT97s.\n\nLet me check the production rules again. For example, NT97 is in the left-hand side of one rule and the right-hand side of others. But none of the other non-terminals seem to directly produce NT97 except via terminal production.\n\nLooking at NT97 \u2192 't2', which is a terminal, so I can't split that further. So all other non-terminals that depend on NT97 would ultimately derive to 't2' as well, but without a rule that allows NT97 to be split, I can't get two 't2's from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not just two 't2's but maybe more complex. Wait, no, the input is clearly two 't2's separated by a space, so treated as two separate terminals. So I can't have S deriving into two NT97s because S's rules don't allow that.\n\nAnother angle: suppose S is derived as NT97 NT7. But NT7 would have to produce something, maybe a terminal. Looking at NT7's production rules, NT7\u2192 NT66 NT48. Then NT66\u2192NT52 NT63, which both seem to go further. It doesn't seem to terminate in 't2'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is derived as NT35 NT84. But then NT35 is S->N35 and N84. Let's see: NT35's production is \u2192 N33 NT84. And N84's rule is \u2192 N4 NT1. N4 is \u2192 N1, N1 \u2192 N5 NT77, and so on, which don't lead to 't2's.\n\nHmm, seems like no path leads to 't2' except directly, and S can't choose to split into two N97s. Therefore, I think the string \"t2 t2\" is not generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-28","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t2 t4 t1` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Let me start by understanding what each rule does and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nFirst, the top-level rules are S -> NT64 NT96, S -> NT97 NT7, and S -> NT35 NT84. So S is the start symbol and it directly expands into one of these pairs. Since my string starts with `t2`, I need to see if any of these initial expansions lead to that.\n\nLooking at S, the three options are:\n\n1. NT64 NT96\n2. NT97 NT7\n3. NT35 NT84\n\nI think I need to check each of these to see if they can produce the string `t2 t4 t1`.\n\nLet me start with the first option: NT64 and NT96.\n\nFrom the rules, I see NT64 -> NT84 NT62 and NT96 -> NT54 NT53. So NT64 expands into NT84 and NT62, and each of these can be further expanded.\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1, and NT62 is a terminal 't0'. So NT64 leads to NT84 (which becomes 't4' and 't1') and NT62 ('t0'). So the sequence would be t4 t1 t0.\n\nWait, but my string is t2 t4 t1. That's not matching. So maybe this path isn't the one.\n\nNext, let's look at the second option: NT97 and NT7.\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75 and NT7 -> NT66 NT48.\n\nLooking at NT43: NT43 -> NT17 NT96? Wait, no, checking the rules, NT43 isn't directly in the list. Wait, I see a line NT14 -> NT33 NT27, but nothing for NT43. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check all the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nNT43 is a terminal 't0' according to the rules: NT43 -> 't0'. So if NT97 -> NT43 NT75, then NT97 becomes t0 and NT75.\n\nNow, NT75 -> NT98 NT26. So NT75 becomes t1 and NT26 (since NT98 is 't1' according to the rules, and NT26 is 't3').\n\nSo expanding this, NT97 becomes t0, NT75 becomes t1, and NT26 becomes t3. So the expansion would be t0 t1 t3. But we need t2 t4 t1. That doesn't match.\n\nSo this path also doesn't fit.\n\nNow, let's see the third option: NT35 and NT84.\n\nNT35 -> NT33 NT84, and NT84 -> NT4 NT1.\n\nNT33 is a terminal 't1' (from NT33 -> 't1'), and NT84 becomes 't4' and 't1' (from NT84 -> NT4 NT1, where NT4 is 't1').\n\nWait, no: NT84 -> NT4 NT1, and NT4 is 't1', so NT84 becomes t1 and t1. Then NT35 would be NT33 (t1) and NT84 (t1 t1), so t1 t1 t1 t1. That's more t1's, but I need t2, t4, t1.\n\nHmm, maybe this isn't the right path either.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the NT84 expansion. Let me double-check. NT84 is 't4' because in the rules, NT84 is defined as 't4'. Wait, no: looking at the rules, I see NT84 -> NT4 NT1, and NT4 is 't1', so NT84 becomes 't4' and 't1', which combines as t4 t1. So NT35 would be NT33 (t1) and NT84 (t4 t1), leading to t1 t4 t1. So the string would be t1 t4 t1.\n\nBut our input string is t2 t4 t1. So that still doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I need to track where the t2 comes from. Let me look at the other expansion options.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for other non-terminals that expand into t2.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT7 -> NT66 NT48. Wait, NT66 is 't4' (from NT66 -> 't4'), and NT48 is 't1' (from NT48 -> 't1'), so NT7 becomes t4 and t1. No t2 there.\n\nWait, wait. Looking back at the rules, I see NT5 is 't2'. Wait, but NT5 is defined as NT14 -> NT33 NT27 (which is 't0' and 't4'), but perhaps I need to see if any non-terminal expands into t2.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT77 -> 't2', so any production that leads to NT77 would be t2.\n\nSo maybe I need to find a path where a non-terminal expands to NT77, which becomes t2.\n\nBut in the initial S expansions, none of the options seem to produce NT77 directly. Let me see.\n\nLooking back at the initial S rules:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96: leads to t4 t1 t0, no t2.\n\nS -> NT97 NT7: leads to t0 t1 t3.\n\nS -> NT35 NT84: leads to t1 t4 t1.\n\nNone of these produce t2. So that's a problem. So perhaps none of the initial S expansions can lead to t2. Therefore, the string `t2 t4 t1` can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a deeper expansion. Let me see if any of the non-terminals can lead to t2 through longer expansions.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't2'.\n\nSo any non-terminal that can expand to NT77 would produce a 't2'.\n\nLooking at the productions leading to NT77, I see NT17 -> NT? Not sure, but maybe none.\n\nLooking further, NT75 -> NT98 NT26, and NT98 -> 't2', so NT98 is 't2'. So if there's a production that leads to NT98, it would produce t2.\n\nLet me see if any initial S expansions can lead to NT98.\n\nLooking at S's initial rules, none directly involve NT98, so perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to work backwards from the string `t2 t4 t1`.\n\nIf the string is t2 followed by t4 followed by t1, maybe I can see if each symbol can be produced by a non-terminal expansion.\n\nt2 is produced by NT77. So the first symbol t2 must come from NT77.\n\nThen, the rest of the string after t2 would be t4 t1, which would come from the other part of S's expansion, but since S has two parts, each expansion being a pair.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. S can expand into NT64 and NT96, but I need to see if each part can produce the required symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built by concatenating the results of two productions. Since S is a concatenation of two non-terminals, each of those can generate a part of the string.\n\nSo for example, if S -> A B, then A generates the first part and B the second. So for the string `t2 t4 t1`, perhaps A generates `t2` and B generates `t4 t1`, but since each symbol is generated by expanding a pair of non-terminals, maybe I need to break down each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is t2 followed by t4 followed by t1, which would correspond to two expansions.\n\nWait, but each expansion only produces two symbols. So perhaps the string `t2 t4 t1` has three symbols, which would require two expansions: one for the first symbol and another for the next two, but that might not fit.\n\nWait, no. Since each step in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the number of non-terminals decreases by one each time, so the number of terminals in the string would increase by one each step.\n\nWait, actually, starting from S (one symbol), each expansion increases the number of symbols by one. So to get a string of length n, we need n-1 expansions.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to try to see if each symbol in the string can be derived from a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if any rule leads directly to the string.\n\nWait, looking back, none of the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-27","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the string `t4 t1 t2` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can be used to generate strings through a series of production rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the non-terminals (like S, NT47, etc.) are defined in terms of other non-terminals, except for some that directly expand into terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. So, the terminals here are t0, t1, and t2, each appearing in various production rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t4 t1 t2`. Since this is a sequence of three symbols, I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial productions from S are:\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nBut wait, none of these produce directly into the terminals t4, t1, t2. So, I think the correct approach is to check if there's a way to derive the string from any of these S productions through a series of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the production rules for S. Oh, no, S seems to be the top-level symbol that branches into non-terminals. So I need to find a path from any of S's productions down to the terminals in the string.\n\nWait a second, looking at the production rules for NT47, I see it can expand into 't4'. Similarly, other NTs expand into t0, t1, etc. So perhaps I can trace the possible sequences that lead to the target string.\n\nLet me consider each production of S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n   - NT64 expands into NT84 NT62\n   - NT96 expands into NT54 NT53\n   So, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n             NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n   Now, breaking down further:\n   - NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n   - NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n   - NT54 \u2192 NT84 NT81 (Wait, but NT54 also has another production NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, etc.)\n   Hmm, this seems a bit tangled. Let me try mapping a path for `t4 t1 t2`.\n\nWait, another approach: For the string `t4 t1 t2` to be generated, each token should come from a sequence of productions that ultimately produce that token. So, perhaps the parse tree would be S \u2192 NTsomething NTsomething \u2192 ... \u2192 t4 \u2192 t1 \u2192 t2.\n\nBut actually, in Chomsky normal form, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals until you reach leaves like 't0', 't1', etc. So, to get t4, t1, t2, I need to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as a series of substitutions. For example, each step produces two symbols, so the string's length is 3, which implies two substitution steps.\n\nWait, the initial S production would lead to a string of two symbols, each from NTs, which in turn would each expand into two symbols, leading to a total of four, etc. But here, we only have three symbols, which suggests an odd number of substitutions. Hmm, that's odd. Normally, using CFGs in Chomsky normal form, the number of symbols in the string would be 2^n, where n is the number of substitution steps. Starting from S, the initial substitution gives two symbols, then four, then eight, etc. So, the string length would have to be a power of two. But here, the string has three symbols, which isn't a power of two, so maybe it's impossible. But wait, that can't be right because the examples given in the grammar expansion show that some strings can have more varied lengths. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me clarify.\n\nThe string's length can be arbitrary because the grammar allows for non-terminals that produce terminals beyond the two-step expansion. But actually, in Chomsky normal form, each step produces exactly two symbols, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal. Wait, wait. No, actually, Chomsky normal form requires all productions to be non-terminals to exactly two non-terminals or terminals as a single symbol. Wait no, that's incorrect. Chomsky normal form requires each production to be either A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So, each production can produce a single terminal or two non-terminals, which then each produce another symbol.\n\nSo, when you expand S, the first step will produce two non-terminals, which then each produce two non-terminals, leading to four, and so on. Thus, the number of symbols in the string must be a power of two. Because each non-terminal step increases the number of symbols by a factor of two.\n\nWait, but the given string has three symbols, which isn't a power of two. That would mean that it's impossible to derive it because the number of symbols should be a power of two. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the expansions work.\n\nWait no, actually, in some cases, non-terminals can expand into a mix of terminals and non-terminals. So for example, a non-terminal might produce a terminal in one production and non-terminals in another. But in this grammar, let's look at the terminals. For example, NT64 can expand into NT84 and NT62, both of which are non-terminals. But NT3 expands into t2 and t4. Oh, hold on! NT3 can produce t2 and t4, so these are actual terminal symbols.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the non-terminals with terminals. So, let's list all the NT productions to see which ones directly produce terminal symbols. For example:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\nNT34 \u2192 NT24 NT27\nNT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27 and also NT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27 (duplicate)\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT74 \u2192 NT1 NT62\nNT52 \u2192 NT56 NT52? Wait, no, look at the NT52 \u2192 NT74 NT26.\nWait, no, perhaps NT34 is a non-terminal that eventually can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for NTs that directly produce terminals, like:\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\nBut also, NT78 \u2192 NT36 NT96\nWait, perhaps I should list all NTs that can directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the last lines, some NTs like NT68 are defined as:\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 't1'\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nWait, looking back, the user listed a series of lines that have NT... \u2192 t0, t1, etc. For instance, some lines are:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, perhaps some of these lines indicate that certain NTs produce terminal symbols. So, for example, NT24 \u2192 't4', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT27 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nSo, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, then that means that in the derivation, that non-terminal can be a leaf. So, for instance, if NT24 \u2192 't4', then in a derivation, we can have NT24 appear and be replaced by 't4'.\n\nWait, looking through the given NT production rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't4'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n- NT48 \u2192 't1'\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n- NT54 \u2192 't3'\n- NT81 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n- NT68 \u2192 't2'\n- NT26 \u2192 't3'\n- NT74 \u2192 't4'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT43 \u2192 't0'\n- NT53 \u2192 't2'\n- NT84 \u2192 't0'\n- NT34 \u2192 't4'\n- NT62 \u2192 't0' (if I find NT62 somewhere)\n- Wait, in the given rules, do I see NT62?

Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The user provided a list of all the non-terminals and their productions. Some non-terminals like NT4, NT5, NT6, etc., seem to eventually resolve to terminals like 't0', 't1', or characters from other letters, but I can ignore those because they're part of the reduction steps but not directly part of the string we're evaluating.\n\nThe string in question is \"t4 t1 t0 t1\". Since the grammar is in CNF, each step will involve replacing a single non-terminal with two others or a terminal. To check if the string can be derived, I can try to parse it using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, can produce NT64 NT96. So the first step is that S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Each of these can then be expanded further.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT64 becomes NT84 and NT62. Then, each of these can be further expanded. \n\nNT84 has a production that eventually leads to 't2', but wait, looking at the productions, NT84 is listed as producing NT4 NT1 and also directly producing 't2'. So I can choose which production to take each time. Similarly, NT62 can produce NT68 NT63 or 't0'. \n\nIf I take NT62 \u2192 't0', then that contributes 't0' to the string. Now, going back to NT84: it can produce 't2', so that would be the next part. So now I have 't2' and 't0'. \n\nNext, I need to consider the other part, NT96, which is part of the initial S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Now, NT54 can produce 't4', and NT53 is listed with several productions. Looking at NT53, it can produce NT86 NT33, or 't3', or NT80 NT80, or other paths.\n\nIf I take NT54 \u2192 't4', that's 't4' added to the string. So now, the string being built is 't4 t2 t0...'. Wait, no, because NT96 is producing two symbols, so after NT96 expands to NT54 and NT53, each of these will produce a symbol or non-terminals that produce symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about how the entire string \"t4 t1 t0 t1\" is built. Each terminal symbol in the string corresponds to the terminals produced by the non-terminals. Since the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which are two symbols, each will be expanded through productions until they become terminals.\n\nSo, for the string, each step should be expanding each non-terminal into the required symbols to match the string. Let me try to parse from the string backward because some leftmost or rightmost derivations might help.\n\nThe string is four symbols: t4, t1, t0, t1. Since the start symbol S can produce two non-terminals, and the string is four symbols, perhaps each non-terminal needs to produce two symbols.\n\nSo, the initial S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nLet's see:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT84 produces 't2' or NT4 and NT1 (which is 't2') and NT62 can produce 't0', so that's 't0'.\n\nSo, NT64 \u2192 NT84 (\u2192 't2') and NT62 (\u2192 't0').\n\nThen NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't4'. So that's 't4'.\n\nNT53 has several production options. It could produce 't3', but wait, we need 't1' for the second symbol. So maybe taking NT53 to produce NT77, which then produces 't1'. Alternatively, perhaps other paths.\n\nWait, NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33. Then NT86 \u2192 't0' orNT68 NT12, etc. Alternatively, if NT53 is 't3', but that's not helpful. Hmm, this might be getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should track the steps.\n\nStart: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 't2'.\n\nNT62 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo the first two symbols are 't2 t0', but our string starts with 't4 t1'. That doesn't match. Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work.\n\nWait, perhaps NT62 can produce more than just 't0'. Let's check:\n\nLooking at NT62's productions:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63 or 't0'.\n\nBut NT52 is in the grammar, and looking at NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT47 NT12 or 't2'.\n\nIf we take NT52 \u2192 't2', then NT62 would be 't2 t0'? No, because NT62 can only produce 't0' or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try expanding S.\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nNow, each of these needs to produce two symbols, so we need four in total. So let's see:\n\nNT84 can produce either 't2' or NT4 NT1. If it produces 't2', then the first symbol is 't2'. But our string starts with 't4', so that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT84 can be another path. Wait, looking at NT84's productions, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 or 't2' (among others? Let me check the provided list again.\n\nWait, in the user's provided grammar, under NT84, there's nt84 -> nt4 nt1 and nt84->t2. Are there others? No, it seems. So NT84 can only produce 't2' or the combination of NT4 and NT1, which are 't4' and 't1' respectively.\n\nSo, if NT84 is replaced by 't4' and 't1', that gives us two symbols: 't4' and 't1'. Then, the string starts with those two. Then, looking at NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Let's see: NT54 can produce 't4', and NT53 can produce... let's check NT53's productions.\n\nFrom the list provided earlier, NT53 has several options:\n\n- nt53 -> nt86 nt33\n- nt53 -> t3\n- nt53->nt80 nt80\n- etc.\n\nSo, if we take NT53 \u2192 't1' (if such a production exists, but looking back, the provided NT53 is nt53->nt86 nt33, nt53\u2192t3, etc. Wait, do any of the NT53 productions produce 't1'? Let me check:\n\nThe user provided lines for NT53:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n- NT53 \u2192 NT80 NT80\n- NT53 \u2192 't2'\n\nI don't see a production for NT53 that results in 't1'. So maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nWait, the user's list:\n\n- NT53 -> NT86 NT33\n- NT53 -> NT80 NT80\n- NT70 -> NT84 NT36\n- NT78 -> NT70 NT36\n- NT77 -> NT98 NT26\n- NT39 -> NT70 NT39\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n- NT97 -> NT43 NT75\n- NT84 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT63 -> 't2'\n- NT47 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't2'\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier. Wait, looking for 't1' productions:\n\nWait, the user's list includes:\n\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n- NT97 -> NT43 NT75\n- NT84 -> NT4 NT1\n- etc.\n\nBut I don't see any NT53 -> 't1' production. So perhaps the second symbol is 't1' from somewhere else."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-41","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the string `t4 t4 t0 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT3, etc.) that eventually produce terminal symbols (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4) through production rules. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t4 t4 t0 t3`. Each 't' represents a terminal symbol, so I need to trace these symbols back through the grammar to see if a leftmost derivation can produce this sequence.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n1. S can be rewritten as NT47 NT96. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT47 NT96.\n\nNow, let's look at NT47. There are multiple production rules for NT47. One of them is NT47 \u2192 NT68 NT12. Another is NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: NT47 \u2192 NT68 NT12.\n\nLooking at NT68, it can produce 't4'. NT12 can produce 't3'. So, if I take NT68 \u2192 t4 and NT12 \u2192 t3, then the first two symbols (from NT47) would be t4 t3. However, the provided string starts with t4 t4, so this path doesn't match. Let's see if the other option for NT47 gives a t4.\n\nOption 2: NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62.\n\nNT1 can produce t2, and NT62 can produce 't0'. So that would give t2 t0, which doesn't match the starting t4 t4. Another option for NT47 is NT47 \u2192 NT47 NT47, but that would complicate things, and I don't think it helps here.\n\nAnother option is NT47 \u2192 NT97 NT75. Let's see what NT97 and NT75 produce.\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. NT43 can produce t0, and NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26. NT98 \u2192 t1, and NT26 \u2192 t3. So NT97 would be t0 t1 t3, but that's more than two symbols. Hmm, not helpful for the initial t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look elsewhere. Maybe S can be rewritten in another way to start with t4.\n\nAnother production of S is S \u2192 NT97 NT7. Let's see what NT97 and NT7 produce.\n\nNT97 \u2192 t1 (from the rules, NT97 \u2192 t1 directly). NT7 can produce t0. So combining these gives t1 t0, which doesn't start with t4.\n\nAnother production of S is S \u2192 NT35 NT84. NT35 can produce t3, and NT84 can produce t2. So that's t3 t2, also not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT47 production rules: There's NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which gives t2 and t0 respectively. Another option is NT47 \u2192 NT48 NT1. NT48 \u2192 t1, and NT1 \u2192 t2, so that's t1 t2.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT97 \u2192 t1, which we already considered. Wait, perhaps I'm not considering all possible paths correctly. Maybe the initial S \u2192 NT47 NT96 is correct, but I'm missing a path for NT47 that gives t4 t4.\n\nWait, let's look at NT47 again. There's a production NT47 \u2192 NT68 NT12. NT68 can produce t4, and NT12 can produce t3. So that's t4 t3, but the string starts with t4 t4. So that's not matching. However, what if there's another production for NT47 that gives two t4s?\n\nLooking again: NT47 \u2192 NT68 NT12 gives t4 t3, which doesn't help. NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62 gives t2 t0. Another option is NT47 \u2192 NT48 NT1, which is t1 t2. Hmm, none of these seem to produce t4 t4.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe the initial S isn't S \u2192 NT47 NT96. Let's check the production rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT47 NT96, NT97 NT7, NT35 NT84, etc. So S can produce various combinations. The initial assumption that S \u2192 NT47 NT96 is correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to derive this string. Let me consider each step carefully.\n\nAnother approach is to see if all four t's can be generated by the grammar. Let's try to build the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t4 t4 t0 t3.\n\nWe can model this as applying productions four times, each step expanding a non-terminal.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT47 NT96.\n\nNow, NT47 can be split into parts. Let's see:\n\nNT47 can be:\n\n- NT68 NT12: t4 and t3 (but that doesn't fit the first t4 and t4)\n- NT1 NT62: t2 and t0\n- NT48 NT1: t1 and t2\n- NT33 NT54: but NT33 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, NT47 can also be NT33 NT54, but I need to check if those produce t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a way to get two t4s from NT47. Maybe through a chain of productions.\n\nLet me consider the possibilities:\n\nNT47 can be NT47 NT47, but that gets complex quickly. Alternatively, maybe NT47 can produce t4 via another path. Let me check if any of the production rules of NT47 result in two t4's.\n\nLooking at the list, none of the production rules for NT47 seem to produce two t4's directly. The earliest I get a t4 is from NT68 or other non-terminals derived from it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find a possible derivation of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption about S \u2192 NT47 NT96 is correct, but I need to explore further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if S can produce another structure. Let me list the possible S productions and see which ones could lead to t4's.\n\nLooking back, another S production is S \u2192 NT53 NT80. NT53 can produce t2, t3, etc. NT80 can produce t3. That doesn't help with t4.\n\nAnother S production: S \u2192 NT74 NT26. NT74 can produce t3, t0, etc. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the initial S \u2192 NT47 NT96 is not the right path, but another production for S might give t4 t4 earlier.\n\nLet me check other S productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84: NT35 \u2192 t3, NT84 \u2192 t2 \u2192 t3 t2, no.\n\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7: t1 t0.\n\n- S \u2192 NT66 NT48: NT66 \u2192 t4, NT48 \u2192 t1 \u2192 t4 t1.\n\n- S \u2192 NT78 NT14: NT78 \u2192 t0, NT14 \u2192 t1 \u2192 t0 t1.\n\n- S \u2192 NT75 NT98: NT75 \u2192 t3, NT98 \u2192 t1 \u2192 t3 t1.\n\n- S \u2192 NT53 NT80: t2, t3 \u2192 t2 t3.\n\n- S \u2192 NT54 NT53: t1, t2.\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t4's except through NT47 and NT68.\n\nSo going back, S \u2192 NT47 NT96, then NT47 must produce two t4's. Let me see how that could happen.\n\nLooking at NT47's rules again:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT68 NT12: t4 and t3 \u2192 t4 t3.\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62: t2 and t0 \u2192 t2 t0.\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT48 NT1: t1 and t2 \u2192 t1 t2.\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT33 NT54: NT33 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at NT33's rules: NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81. NT84 \u2192 t2, and NT81 \u2192 t1. So NT33 \u2192 t2 t1.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 \u2192 t1. So NT47 \u2192 NT33 NT54 \u2192 t2 t1 t1.

{"custom_id":"request-64","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t0 t0 t3 t0 t1` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. Each production has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the initial productions which might have two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I should parse the grammar to see how the string can be broken down. The string has five tokens: t0, t0, t3, t0, t1. Each of these corresponds to specific non-terminals. My approach is to work backwards from the grammar, seeing which productions can lead to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only terminals are the t's (like t0, t1, etc.) listed in the productions. So I need to find sequences of terminals that can form the string.\n\nLet me list the relevant productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT68 -> 't4'\n- NT3 -> 't2' and 't0' (seems inconsistent, but I'll cross-check)\n- NT97 -> 't0', 't2', 't1' (multiple t's)\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't2'\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT39 -> 't0'\n- NT74 -> 't4'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT96 -> 't4'\n- NT47 -> 't4'\n- NT84 -> 't0'\n- NT64 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't2' (Wait, earlier it's said NT1 -> 't2', but let me check: in the grammar, NT1 has multiple productions, so perhaps the initial ones are non-terminals. Wait, in the initial productions, S -> NT64 NT96; then, looking at the non-terminals, I need to check if any of the 't's are non-terminals or actual terminals. Wait, this is confusing. The grammar entries are like S->NT64 NT96, and for some NTs, they reduce to terminals or other NTs.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. Each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals (left-hand side) or two terminals. So, for example, S -> NT64 NT96, so S can derive two non-terminals. But when a non-terminal produces a terminal, like NT68 -> 't4', that means in the derivation, when you have NT68, it can be replaced by the terminal t4.\n\nWait no, no. Wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC, A->B, or A->C, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So in the given grammar, the productions are either of the form NTx -> NTy NTz (A->BC) or some are directly mapping NTs to a single terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT68 -> 't4' \u2192 So NT68 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal 't4'.\n\nSimilarly, NT97 -> 't1' and others produce 't's.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some NTs directly produce a terminal, like NT68, NT3, NT7, etc. I need to figure out a way to parse the string by working backward.\n\nThe string is t0 t0 t3 t0 t1.\n\nLet's see the structure. The string is five tokens, which could be the result of a derivation tree that's a binary tree with three levels. Since S is the start symbol, which is a non-terminal, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, until we get to terminals.\n\nThe string has five tokens, so the number of nodes in the parse tree is 5, which implies a certain way to split the string. Since each production splits into two, the number of non-terminals in the derivation reduces by one each time, so the derivation would have a parse tree of height 3: S at the top, then each production splits into two, so the string is generated after three splits.\n\nAlternatively, the number of non-terminals in the S's production would be two, and each step they split into two, so the string's length would be 2^k, but here it's 5, which is not a power of two. That suggests that some of the productions might have used a rule that directly creates a terminal, leading to a variable number of splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split in a certain way, with some steps using direct terminal replacements.\n\nLet me think: the string is [t0, t0, t3, t0, t1]. Let's see possible splits.\n\nOption 1: The last two terminals (t0, t1) could come from a production where NT64 produces t0 and NT62 produces t1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the last production is something like NT96 -> t4 (but in our case, t1 is present). Alternatively, looking at the NT productions, perhaps I can find a path where the string can be formed.\n\nLooking at the NT96 production: NT96 -> 't4', but wait, in the given grammar, some NTs reduce to a single terminal:\n\nFor instance, NT68 -> 't4', NT3 -> 't0', 't2', 't1'.\n\nWait, looking carefully, for example:\n\nNT96 is defined as NT54 NT62. But wait, that's a production where NT96 can be replaced by NT54 and NT62. But none of these seem to directly produce a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be built using other NT rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into pairs that match the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string corresponds to S, which produces NT64 and NT96. Let me check the grammar: S -> NT64 NT96. So S starts with NT64 and NT96.\n\nNow, each of these can be further expanded. Let's see:\n\nNT64 is defined as NT84 NT62.\n\nNT62 is defined as NT52 NT63.\n\nWait, this seems to be getting complicated. Let me try to find the paths step by step.\n\nAlternative approach: try to build a parse tree for the string t0 t0 t3 t0 t1.\n\nSince S produces NT64 and NT96, let's see what those produce.\n\nLooking at NT64: it's NT84 NT62.\n\nLooking at NT62: it's NT52 NT63.\n\nNow, NT52 is a production NT52 -> NT21 NT3.\n\nAnd NT63 is NT52 NT63? Wait, no. Looking again:\n\nThe grammar shows:\n\nNT52 -> NT21 NT3\n\nWait, perhaps I'm better off looking for possible splits where the string can be divided into two parts that can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: the string is t0 t0 t3 t0 t1.\n\nLet me see if the last t1 can come from NT96 or some other non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT96 is defined as 't4' in one of the productions? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, there are several NT definitions that produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-90","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string `t4 t3 t0 t4 t0 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is given, and it consists of a set of production rules. Each rule has a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. The string provided is a sequence of terminals: t4, t3, t0, t4, t0, t3. My goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all the rules here are in that form, which is good because it simplifies the parsing a bit.\n\nNext, I'll look at what the start symbol S can produce. The rules for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, any valid string generated by this grammar must start with either NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Wait, but the string starts with t4 and t3, which are terminals. So, maybe I need to see if S can derive into a sequence that leads to t's.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The start symbol S is a non-terminal, right? So to produce terminal strings, the non-terminals must be rewritten into terminals or further non-terminals until all leaves are terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, many of the NTs produce other NTs or are terminals. The terminals in the NT productions are things like 't0', 't1', up to 't9', which are the terminals. So, each NT production eventually leads to a terminal or another NT.\n\nGiven that the string is `t4 t3 t0 t4 t0 t3`, which is six terminals, I need to find a derivation where S eventually becomes this sequence.\n\nSince S can only directly produce two NTs, maybe I pick one of the S's and see if it can derive into the entire string.

{"custom_id":"request-85","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string `t1 t0 t0 t3 t0 t3` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, most of the rules are of the form like S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which seems to follow this. Then there are some terminal productions like NT47 \u2192 't1' etc.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t1 t0 t0 t3 t0 t3`. This is a sequence of six tokens. Each token corresponds to a terminal symbol, which comes from the right-hand side of the rules.\n\nI think I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the start symbol using the grammar rules. Since it's in CNF, the parse tree will be binary, and each node has exactly two children (except leaves, which are terminals).\n\nThe start symbol is S. From the grammar, S can produce:\n\n1. NT64 NT96\n2. NT97 NT7\n3. NT35 NT84\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t1. Hmm, let's see which non-terminals produce t1.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT47 \u2192 t1, NT68 \u2192 t1, NT97 \u2192 t2 (but wait, the grammar says NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, and looking at the rules, NT97 isn't directly producing t2. Wait, the rules show that NT97 is broken down further. Similarly, NT98 \u2192 't1' in some rules, but actually, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't1'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT97 \u2192 't2' [Wait, no, the rule is NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, and then looking at NT43 and NT75:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't0' (from NT43 \u2192 't0') and NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26. NT98 is 't1', and NT26 is 't3'? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list out all terminal productions to see what each non-terminal can expand into.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't1' (rule: NT47 -> 't1')\n- NT68 \u2192 't1' (NT68 -> 't3' somewhere? Wait no, the rules say NT68 -> NT47 NT12, and NT47 is 't1', NT12 is 't3' (because NT12 -> 't3'), so NT68 produces t1 + t3, which combines into t13? Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, each production's right-hand side is a sequence of non-terminals, which in turn produce terminals. So when generating the string, each rule application appends a terminal or another non-terminal which then expands further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree from the string. The string is t1 t0 t0 t3 t0 t3, which is six tokens. Let's see how this could be built.\n\nS is the start symbol, and its rules are S \u2192 NT64NT96, S \u2192 NT97NT7, S \u2192 NT35NT84.\n\nThe first token is t1. Let's check each rule for the first production.\n\n1. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Looking at its rules: NT84 \u2192 't2' (since NT84 \u2192 't2' as per the rules) and NT62 \u2192 't0'. So NT64 would produce t2 t0. But the first token is t1, so this path is likely not the right one.\n\n2. NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. Now, NT43 \u2192 't0' and NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26. NT98 \u2192 't1' (from NT98 \u2192 NT47 NT26, and NT47 \u2192 't1', NT26 \u2192 't3', so NT98 produces t1 t3. Then NT75 would be 't1 t3' followed by NT26, which is 't3' \u2192 so NT75 \u2192 't1 t3' + 't3' = 't1 t3 t3'? I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to start from the string and see if it can be broken down into non-terminals that match the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t1 t0 t0 t3 t0 t3.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce three options. The first token is t1, so let's see if any of the first productions of S can lead to t1.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT64 NT96: NT64 as above produces t2 t0, so that's t2 t0. But the string starts with t1, so that's not a match.\n\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7: NT97 would produce t2 t3 (from NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, which leads to 't0' and 't1 t3'), so that would be t2 t3, which doesn't match the first t1.\n\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84: NT35 \u2192 NT84 NT81 (from NT35 \u2192 NT84 NT81). NT84 \u2192 't2', NT81 \u2192 't1'. So NT35 produces t2 t1. Then NT84 is 't2', so the first rule S \u2192 NT35 NT84 would produce 't2 t1 t2'. The string starts with t1, so that's not a match either. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the parsing process.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire production tree. Alternatively, maybe I can try to find a way to build the string by expanding the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem as a series of productions that would generate the string.\n\nGiven the string is t1 t0 t0 t3 t0 t3:\n\nLet me note that each step in the grammar can only produce two non-terminals, which are then expanded into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I can model this as applying production rules step by step.\n\nStarting with S.\n\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84 (since the other options don't lead to t1 as the first symbol)\n\nSo S expands to NT35 NT84, which would produce t2 t1 and then t2.\n\nWait, but that's getting a bit confusing. Maybe instead, I can think of the entire expansion as a series of rule applications.\n\nWait, another approach: since the string is six tokens, we can model it as three levels of expansion, since each step in the grammar is binary.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to construct possible derivation trees.\n\nLet's try starting with the start symbol S.\n\nS can be S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So the first step is S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals can be expanded.\n\nNT35 expands to NT84 NT81, so that's two non-terminals, which would become NT84 \u2192 't2' and NT81 \u2192 't1', so that's 't2 t1'.\n\nThen NT84 is another non-terminal, which is 't2'.\n\nWait, wait, no, because the first production S \u2192 NT35 NT84 would expand NT35 into NT84 NT81. So S \u2192 NT35 NT84 would become (NT84 NT81) and NT84. Wait, then the expansion would be NT84 NT81 and NT84.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down.\n\nEach non-terminal in the string must be expanded according to its production rules. Let's take each token and see if they can be derived from some non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t1 t0 t0 t3 t0 t3.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals that produce each terminal:\n\n- t0: NT7 \u2192 't0' (NT7 is a terminal here), NT30\u2192?

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S.

The first step is to generate a parse tree starting from S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nThe string is `t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t0 t4`. Each step in the grammar produces two non-terminals, so the number of symbols should be a multiplication factor of 2 each time. Since the string has 7 tokens, which is odd, I might need to consider how many reduction steps are possible, but in this case, since every production splits into two, the depth would determine the number of leaves.\n\nWait, actually, each production in CNF doubles the number of symbols. But starting from S, which is a single symbol, the number of symbols after one expansion would be 2, then 4, 8, etc. So the length should be a power of two. The given string has length 7, which is not a power of two, which already suggests it's not possible. But wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows mixing different production rules. Let me check the possible derivations.\n\nStarting from S, let's say we choose the first production: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.

Wait, the provided grammar has various NT transitions, but I see NT3 \u2192 't0', NT68 \u2192 't0', NT97 \u2192 't2', etc. But for NT4, I don't see a production rule. Hmm, that might be a mistake in the question. Wait, no, let me check all the rules again. Let me go through the rules:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I don't see a rule for NT4. Wait, perhaps it's not present. So if NT4 is not defined, then that path is invalid.

NT35 \u2192 't3' according to the rules: 'NT35 -> 't3''. NT84 \u2192 't2' as per 'NT84 -> 't2''. So combining them, NT35 NT84 would directly become 't3 t2'. That's one possibility. But the string we have starts with 't1', so that path might not be the way.\n\nWait, no, let me check again.

So if NT1 can expand to a terminal, but in this case, the string starts with 't1', which suggests that somewhere along the way, there's a production that generates 't1' directly or via some steps.\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I see NT47 has multiple rules. For example, NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, or NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62. Wait, maybe NT47 can eventually lead to 't1' through a chain.\n\nWait, let's try this path: Start with S \u2192 NT64 NT96. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Then NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. If NT4 has a terminal, but I don't see a rule for NT4. Wait, looking again, none of the rules mention NT4. So perhaps this path is invalid.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the string can be generated via a specific sequence of productions. Let's try to decompose the string: t1, t3, t3, t3, t3, t0, t4.\n\nEach step in the derivation must split into two symbols, so the number of symbols should start at 1 (S), then 2, then 4, 8, etc. But the string given has 7 symbols, which is 7, which is not a power of two, so it's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Since each production in CNF splits into two symbols, the number of symbols in the derived string must be a power of two. The string has 7 symbols, which isn't a power of two, so it's impossible.\n\nSo regardless of the grammar, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string `t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t0 t4` has 7 symbols, which is not a power of two.

So, the task is to determine whether the string `t1 t0 t4 t4 t3 t0 t4` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar follows this structure, with various non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of terminals: t1, t0, t4, t4, t3, t0, t4. So, the first step is to figure out how this string could be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nI'll need to consider each of these productions and see if they can lead to the target string. Let's approach each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first production: S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So, if I can derive `t1 t0 t4 t4 t3 t0 t4` from NT64 and NT96, then this path is viable. Let's see what each of these non-terminals can expand into.\n\nNT64's productions:\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n- NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81\n- NT54 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\n- NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n- NT70 \u2192 NT84 NT36\n- NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62\n- NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n- NT53 \u2192 NT39 NT80\n- NT70 \u2192 NT84 NT36\n- NT22 \u2192 NT82 NT48\n- NT82 \u2192 NT42 NT66 (Wait, I don't see NT42 here. Maybe I missed something. Let's check NT42. Oh, looking back, NT47 has productions, but I don't see NT42 in the given rules. So, this might be an issue.)\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake because NT42 isn't present in the given grammar. Looking back at NT47's productions, it doesn't have a production where NT47 \u2192 NT42 NT3. So, perhaps I was wrong in thinking that NT47 can expand to something involving t2 or t0. Let me double-check the NT47 entries.\n\nLooking at the list, under NT47, the only production seems to be NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which maps to t2 and another non-terminal. So, if NT47 leads to t2, maybe that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, some NT's have multiple rules. For example, NT70 expands to NT84 NT36, and then each of those have their own rules. So, perhaps I can model each non-terminal and see how they derive to the terminals.\n\nLet's start building the parse tree. The string is 7 symbols long, so the derivation should have 7 steps from the root S.\n\nBut with the given grammar, each step (except the first) could involve multiple symbols. So, perhaps a bottom-up approach would be better, checking if the string can be split into two parts that each can be derived.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each expansion step increases the string length by 1. Since S \u2192 NT...NT..., each production adds exactly two symbols when fully expanded. Wait, no. In CNF, each production is two non-terminals, and when they expand, each non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals, until the non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the expansion. Let's think about it: each production in CNF is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, if we have a non-terminal that eventually expands into a terminal, each expansion step combines two symbols. Therefore, the length of the string derived from a single non-terminal is determined by the number of expansion steps.\n\nBut in this case, for a string of length 7, which is odd, perhaps it's constructed from multiple starting symbols? Or maybe I'm complicating it. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet's pick the first production S \u2192 NT64 NT96 and see if we can derive the string step by step.\n\nNT64 expands to several options. Let's see each NT64 production:\n1. NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n2. NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n3. NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81\n4. NT54 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n5. NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n6. NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n7.

Let me try to list all NT64's productions more clearly.\n\nLooking back, the user provided a long list with some entries duplicated, but I can focus on NT64:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 (entry 4)\n- NT64 \u2192 NT96 (entry 7? No, NT96 is a terminal? Wait, no. The initial entry was S \u2192 NT64 NT96, but in the grammar, NT96 can expand into NT54 NT53, which then expand further.\n\nWait, I think I need to parse the grammar correctly. Let's list all NT64's productions as per the user's input.\n\nLooking through the user's input, the NT64 productions are:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 (entry 4)\n- NT64 \u2192 NT96 (entry 7? Let me check: Yes, entry 7 is NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. So, NT96 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal?\n\nWait, the user's grammar has some NT's that expand into terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 t0, t1, etc. So, some NT's are terminals. But for S \u2192 NT64 NT96, if both NT64 and NT96 are non-terminals, their expansions continue until they reach terminals.\n\nSo, let's consider S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 has several options.

So let's try to see if any of the start productions can lead to the string through 7 steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down approach could help, but it might be complex without a parser.\n\nAn alternative is to model this as a parsing problem, checking if the string can be accepted by the grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem and the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S and has several productions. Each non-terminal (like NT1, NT3, etc.) eventually produces a sequence of terminals (like t0, t1, t2, etc.) or other non-terminals. Some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, while others require further expansion.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t4 t3 t0 t2 t0 t4 t0 t3`. I'll denote this as t4, t3, t0, t2, t0, t4, t0, t3.\n\nMy goal is to see if there's a derivation path in the grammar that starts from S and ends up with exactly these tokens.\n\nLet me look at the production rules again:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSince each S production consists of two non-terminals, I need to check all possible options and see which one can expand into the desired string. However, the string has 8 tokens, which is even, so it's possible that the two non-terminals in the S production each expand to 4 tokens each.\n\nLet me consider each S production:\n\n- Option 1: S -> NT64 NT96\n- Option 2: S -> NT97 NT7\n- Option 3: S -> NT35 NT84\n\nI'll check each option to see if any of them can generate the string.\n\nStarting with Option 1: S -> NT64 NT96\n\nNT64's production: NT64 -> NT84 NT62\nSo NT64 will expand into NT84 and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT96's production: NT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nSo the first step for this option would be S expanding into NT64 NT96, which then expands into NT84 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nNow I need to see if these four non-terminals can further expand into the 4 tokens starting with t4, t3. Let's look at each:\n\nNT84, NT62, NT54, NT53.\n\nLooking at NT84's productions:\n- NT84 -> NT4 NT1 (but that's two more non-terminals)\n- NT84-> NT12 NT96 (also two)\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT84 has several productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT84's productions are:\n- NT84 -> NT47 NT53 (two non-terminals)\n- NT84 -> NT12 NT96 (two)\n- NT84 -> NT1 -> 't2' (terminal)\nWait, actually, the given grammar shows:\n\nNT84's productions are:\n\n- NT84 -> 't4' (terminal t4)\n- NT84-> 't2' (terminal t2)\n- etc. Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the grammar has lines where NT84 is a non-terminal. Wait, the original grammar has lines like:\n\nNT84 -> 't4', but more importantly, NT84 can also be a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal that can produce terminals?\n\nWait, in the grammar, some lines are NT followed by something and then an equals sign with a terminal, like NT3 -> 't0'.\n\nWait, but looking back, the grammar is presented as a set of production rules, but when I saw the grammar, each line is a rule where the left side is a symbol (a non-terminal) and the right side can be a string of symbols (terminals and non-terminals).\n\nWait, the grammar is in a format where sometimes a non-terminal (like NT84) can produce a terminal. So in the list, I see lines like:\n\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT3 -> 't0'\nNT47 -> 't1'\nAnd so on. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT84 has the production 't4' (terminal t4).

{"custom_id":"request-141","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t2 t0 t3 t2 t4 t0 t2 t0 t2`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The key point is that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, to check if the string is in the language, I can perform a kind of parsing or use the CYK algorithm, but maybe a simpler approach since the string isn't too long.\n\nBut wait, the grammar here is given with all the production rules. Let me look at the structure.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which in the grammar has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, S expands into two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals must eventually expand into terminals, and the string is a sequence of terminals. So the process is to see if following these expansions leads to the given string.\n\nThe given string is `t2 t0 t3 t2 t4 t0 t2 t0 t2`. Let's count the tokens. There are 9 tokens. Each non-terminal expansion in CNF produces two symbols, so the string length should be 2^n where n is the number of expansion steps from the start symbol. But here, the length is 9, which isn't a power of two (since 8 is 2^3 and 16 is 2^4). That might mean that some of the earlier productions involved terminals, but in CNF, all productions except terminals are two non-terminals. Hmm, but in the grammar, some of the non-terminals directly go to terminals like NT66 -> 't4', NT7 -> 't2', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the entire derivation step by step, tracking how the non-terminals expand into the string.\n\nThe string is `t2 t0 t3 t2 t4 t0 t2 t0 t2`. Let's try to write it as a sequence: t2, t0, t3, t2, t4, t0, t2, t0, t2.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar has specific productions. Let's list all the NTs and their possible productions, including when they produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63  \nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62  \nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12  \nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48  \nNT74 \u2192 NT43 NT75  \nNT77 \u2192 NT39 NT77  \nNT78 \u2192 NT70 NT26  \nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1  \nWait, some of the Nts directly go to terminals. For example, NT64 \u2192 't4', NT68 \u2192 't4', and so on. Wait, looking back, the initial user message has a list of rules, some of which are NTs going to terminals. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the list includes lines like:\n\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63\n- NT64 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't0'\n- NT22 -> 't4'\n- NT82 -> 't4'\n- NT74 -> 't3'\n- NT21 -> 't4'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT43 -> 't0'\n- NT84 -> 't0'\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't3'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT78 -> 't0'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT54 -> 't1'\n- NT68 -> 't2'\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't0'\n- NT77 -> 't1'\n- NT35 -> 't3'\n- NT78 -> 't0'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\nWait, perhaps I need to parse each line correctly. For instance, looking at each line:\n\n- S -> NT64 NT96\n- S -> NT97 NT7\n- S -> NT35 NT84\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62 (Note: Also, in the rules, some have Nt followed by 't', like NT68 -> 't4'\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\nNT64 -> 't4' (so NT64 is a terminal, producing 't4')\nSimilarly,\n\nLooking quickly, I think some Nts directly produce terminals for short strings. However, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nGiven the string has 9 elements. Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion step after S gives two symbols. Starting with S, which is two symbols, each of those could be non-terminals or terminals. But in our case, the string is nine symbols, which is odd. So, the process would be:\n\nLevel 0: S \u2192 two symbols.\nEach symbol can be NT or terminal.\n\nBut considering our string length, 9, we have to see how it's built.\n\nAlternatively, to model it, each non-terminal is expanded into either two symbols. Let's consider the string as a sequence of terminals, and see if it can be broken down into the production steps.\n\nLet me try to parse from left to right.\n\nThe string is: t2, t0, t3, t2, t4, t0, t2, t0, t2.\n\nLet's think recursively to check if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe first step is starting from S. The grammar starts S as NT64 NT96 or NT97 NT7 or NT35 NT84. We'll need to see which of these can produce the string.\n\nLet me check each branch:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96: Let's see if NT64 and NT96 can produce the string when combined.\n\nBut our string starts with t2, so NT64 must produce something that starts with t2. Checking the rules for NT64:\n\nFrom the rules, NT64 can go to 't4' or also expand to NT84 NT62.\n\nSo, there are two possibilities:\n\na) NT64 \u2192 't4', which would be the first symbol, but our string starts with 't2', so this can't be. So S \u2192 NT64 ... is not the right path because NT64's expansion would lead to 't4' as the first symbol.\n\nb) NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So, instead, NT64 would produce two symbols. So, perhaps the string starts with t2 coming from NT64 \u2192 ...? Wait, no: NT64 would itself be an internal part of the string. Wait, let me correct.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then the string would be whatever NT64 produces followed by whatever NT96 produces. So, our string has the first symbol as t2. So, either NT64 produces t2 or if it's a non-terminal, the first token of the string would be the first symbol from NT64's expansion.\n\nBut NT64's direct expansion is only 't4' or as a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, that complicates things because if NT64 is a non-terminal that can only produce terminal t4 or two other non-terminals, then in the first step, S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would produce t4 and something else, which doesn't match t2. So this path is invalid, meaning S \u2192 NT64 ... is not the path to take.\n\n2. Next, S \u2192 NT97 NT7: Let's check if either of these can produce the string.\n\nLooking at NT97 and NT7 in the rules:\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2' (from NT97 -> 't2') and NT7 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT97 NT7, then the string would start with the expansion of NT97 (t2) followed by NT7 (t2), and so on. So, the initial part of the string would be t2, t2, which matches the first two symbols. But our string starts with t2, t0, so this doesn't fit. So this path is also not valid.\n\n3. The third option is S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nNow, NT35 and NT84's expansions:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT35 -> 't3' and NT84 can go to NT4 NT1 or if it's a terminal, it's 't0' or 't2'. Wait, no, checking NT84's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string is generated by expanding symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, to generate any string, S must be expanded first, and from there, each NT can be further expanded. The given string is a sequence of t's, meaning each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal. \n\nEach production leads to two terminals or two non-terminals. Since the string is a series of t's, I think each NT must derive a single t. Let's see how that works.\n\nWait, let me look at the NT productions. Some of the NTs expand into two NTs, and some expand into a single terminal symbol. For example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. But in the string, I only see t's, so probably each NT along the way must eventually produce a terminal. \n\nI need to find a derivation from S to the given string. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. The given string is `t1 t2 t3 t3 t3 t0 t1 t0 t1`.\n2. The string has 9 symbols, so the derivation should consist of multiple steps, each expanding non-terminals into pairs until the final step results in nine terminals.\n\nWait, but wait: each step of expansion replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, either two non-terminals or two terminals. So starting from S, each expansion increases the number of symbols by 1. So, for example:\n\n- Starting with S (1 symbol), after one expansion, say S \u2192 NT64 NT96, we have 2 symbols. Each of those could be further expanded.\n\nBut the target string has 9 symbols, which means the number of expansions should result in 9. Let's see: each step can double the number of symbols, but in this case, it's not straightforward because some productions expand a single NT into two symbols, which could be either NTs or t's.\n\nWait, let's model this. Starting with 1 symbol (S), each expansion can lead to 2 symbols. To reach 9 symbols, which is an odd number, that suggests that the number of expansions might involve some steps where a NT is expanded into two t's. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. Let's consider the structure of the grammar and see if the given string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal can derive either two non-terminals or a terminal:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 or t4\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 or t4\n- NT54 \u2192 NT51 NT53 or t4 (Wait, but in the rules, NT54 is shown as NT54 \u2192 NT84 NT80 or t3?

Wait, the rules are:\n\nNT47: two options, sometimes leading to t's.\n\nI think I should list all the NT rules to see which ones lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77 | 't2'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (since under NT68 and others)\nWait, checking each NT:\n\nWait, let me make a list:\n\n1.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. There are several NT rules and terminal replacements. Each NT (like NT1, NT3, etc.) leads to other NT productions or terminals like 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', etc. The string to analyze consists of a sequence of these terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the minimum number of steps needed to derive a string of length n is n-1. Here, the string has 10 terms, so it would require at least 9 productions. That's a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or a way to parse it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can approach this as a parsing problem. I can try to build a parse tree for the string and see if it's possible under the given grammar.\n\nLet me look at the string again: t4 t1 t1 t3 t3 t4 t2 t2 t0 t2.\n\nEach step starts with the start symbol S, which goes to NT64 NT96. So the initial production would split into two parts: the left-hand side (NT64) and the right-hand side (NT96).\n\nEach of these NTs will then expand into their respective productions, and so on, until they reach terminals.\n\nI can consider the string as a sequence of 10 t's and try to see if it can be broken down into the possible non-terminals and their expansions.\n\nLet me index the string as positions 0 to 9:\n0: t4\n1: t1\n2: t1\n3: t3\n4: t3\n5: t4\n6: t2\n7: t2\n8: t0\n9: t2\n\nI need to see if there's a way to split this string into a form that matches the grammar. Starting with S \u2192 NT64 NT96, so the string should be the concatenation of NT64's derivation and NT96's derivation.\n\nLooking at the possible productions for NT64:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT64's expansion is another pair of non-terminals. Let's see what NT84 and NT62 produce.\n\nNT84 has several productions:\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 (same as above)\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT81\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 or NT4 NT81.\n\nWait, looking at the given rules:\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 (duplicate)\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT81\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 or NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT81.\n\nSo for NT84, it can be either NT4 followed by NT1 or NT4 followed by NT81.\n\nNT4 is a production that immediately goes to 't1'. So NT4 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo for NT84, if it's NT4 \u2192 t1, then the second part is NT1. Let's check NT1 productions.\n\nLooking at NT1:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\n- NT1 \u2192 NT68 NT3 (this could be interesting)\n- NT1 also has \u2192 't2'\n- \u2192 't0'\n- \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, actually in the given grammar, the rules under NT1 are:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nNT1 \u2192 NT68 NT3\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT1 -> 't0'\n\nSo NT1 can be a terminal directly as t0 or t2, or it can go into further non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT62 can be broken down. Looking at NT62 in the grammar:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63.\n\nSo NT62 splits into NT52 and NT63.\n\nNT52 has a production that goes to 't2', so NT52 \u2192 't2'.\n\nNT63: Let's check the rules for NT63. It's in the grammar as NT63 \u2192 't2'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSo putting it together, NT62 \u2192 't2' 't2'.\n\nWait, wait. Because NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63, and NT52 \u2192 't2', NT63 \u2192 't2', so the entire NT62 \u2192 't2''t2' \u2192 t2 t2.\n\nSo going back to NT84: Let's see if it's NT4 followed by NT1, or NT4 followed by NT81.\n\nIf it's NT4 followed by NT1, then the first part is t1, and the second part depends on what NT1 becomes.\n\nOr if it's NT4 followed by NT81, which is NT4 \u2192 t1 and NT81 \u2192 ... Let's see what NT81 produces.\n\nLooking at NT81's rules: NT81 \u2192 NT36 NT81, but it also directly goes to 't1', or in another rule, NT36 \u2192 't4' as one of its productions.\n\nWait, that might not be directly applicable. Let me check the provided rules again:\n\nThe given NT rules:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 (again, same)\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT81\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 or NT4 NT81.\n\nSo when NT84 is expanded, it's either t1 (from NT4) and then NT1, or t1 and then NT81.\n\nSimilarly, for NT81:\n\nLooking at the given rules, NT81 \u2192 NT36 NT81, but that seems recursive. Also, check the initial list:\n\nWait, do any rules have NT81 as a terminal or as a combination?\n\nLooking through the rules, I think NT36 is \u2192 't4', but that's under the NT36 rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the NT rules again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nThen, we have:\n\nNT47 has multiple productions, including several that expand into 't0' or 't1' etc. But for our current analysis, the relevant chains are more in NT84 and others.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the entire derivation as a parse tree and see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each position in the string can be assigned to a non-terminal that can generate that terminal at that step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using symbol precedence. Let's consider that the string is built by expanding the grammar step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the string is 't4 t1 t1 t3 t3 t4 t2 t2 t0 t2'.\n\nGiven the starting point S, the initial expansion is NT64 NT96.\n\nSo the first step: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNow, NT64 expands to NT84 NT62 (as per the rule). NT96 expands to NT54 NT53.\n\nSo the string becomes (NT84) (NT54 NT53). Then each of these will further expand.\n\nWait, perhaps it's helpful to attempt a recursive descent approach, where we try to match the string from the start and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, check if the entire string can be divided into the first part matching NT64's production and the second part matching NT96's production.\n\nBut considering that NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, let's see:\n\nSo the string starts with t4, which needs to be part of NT64's expansion.\n\nNT84 \u2192 t1 (if NT4 \u2192 t1) followed by something. Wait, but looking back at NT84, it can be NT4 NT1 or NT4 NT81. NT4 is 't1'.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT84 can be NT4 NT1, which are 't1' followed by NT1, or NT4 NT81, which is 't1' followed by NT81.\n\nSo if NT84 is 't1' followed by NT1, and the first token is t4, this wouldn't fit. Because the first token in the string is t4, but NT84 would either be t1 followed by something or t1 followed by something else, but not t4.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because NT84 in the grammar is only going to emit t1, but the first token in the string is t4. So NT84 can't start with t4 in this case. Wait, am I looking at the NT rules correctly?\n\nLooking at the provided NT rules:\n\n- NT84 is defined by several"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-168","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t2 t0 t4 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t3`. \n\nLet me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, efficient.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it consists of multiple production rules for various non-terminals (NTx and S) that eventually expand into terminals (t0-t9 and others) or other non-terminals. My task is to see if the string can be derived through a series of these expansions.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the production rules to understand the structure:\n\n- The start symbol S has three production rules:\n  1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n  2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n  3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar will start with either the concatenation of NT64 and NT96, NT97 and NT7, or NT35 and NT84. Each of these non-terminals will then produce either more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string we're checking is `t2 t0 t4 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t3`. Let's count the number of tokens: 10 in total. So the derivation must result in exactly 10 terminal symbols, meaning each step adds a terminal or a non-terminal, but ultimately, it stops at 10.\n\nSince the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, the first step will produce two symbols. Each rule will generate more until all are terminals. To get a string of 10 terminals, we'll need 9 productions (since each production after the start can either add more non-terminals or replace them).\n\nBut this approach might be too vague. Maybe I should use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse strings given a grammar in CNF. Let me try to outline how to apply CYK.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by initializing a table where each cell C[i,j] represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring s[i..j]. The steps are:\n\n1. Parse the string from left to right.\n2. For each substring of length l (starting from 1 up to n, the length of the string), compute the possible non-terminals that can derive that substring.\n3. If the start symbol S is in C[1,n], the string is accepted.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe I can approach this by trying to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t2 t0 t4 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t3`. Let's note the order: t2, t0, t4, t1, t0, t2, t0, t2, t0, t3. That's 10 symbols.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S produces either NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. So the first two symbols must be derived from one of these production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t2 t0. Let's check which rules produce these.\n\nChecking each production rule:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Further, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. NT4 is a terminal 't1', and NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3, which eventually leads to 't4' and 't0'. Let's see if this can produce t2 t0.\n\nWait, this might be getting too complex. Maybe a better approach is to look for all possible ways the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to one of the three initial productions of S.\n\nSince the string is `t2 t0 t4 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t3`, splitting it after the first symbol would give `t2` and the rest, which is `t0 t4 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t3`. But the initial productions of S require two non-terminals, so the split should be at some point, not just after the first.\n\nWait, the first production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the first part would be NT64 and the second NT96. Do these non-terminals produce t2 and t0 respectively?\n\nLooking at NT64: The production is NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Then, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. NT4 \u2192 't1' and NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. Then NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3, which is 't4' and 't0'. So NT64 would produce 't1' and then more. But this doesn't seem to lead directly to 't2' and 't0'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each initial production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96: If this is the case, NT64 must produce the first symbol, and NT96 must produce the second symbol. But looking at NT64's productions, it starts with NT84, which is 't1' or something else? Wait, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. NT4 is 't1', and NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. So perhaps NT64 can't produce t2, meaning this split might not work.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7: So the first symbol would be NT97 and the second NT7. Let's see if NT97 can produce t2 and NT7 can produce t0.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. NT43 \u2192 't0', so that's a terminal. Then NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26. NT98 \u2192 't1' or other?\n\nWait, NT75's production is NT98 NT26. NT98 \u2192 't1', and NT26 \u2192 't3'. So NT75 can produce 't1' and 't3', but NT75 itself is a concatenation of those. I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider all possible non-terminals and see if any can derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for which non-terminals can produce a terminal of t2. Let me check which non-terminals derive t2.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see several non-terminals that directly produce 't2':\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n- NT22 \u2192 't4' \u2192 wait, no, NT22's rule is NT33 NT74, but NT74 \u2192 't4'. Hmm, not t2.\n- NT26 \u2192 't3' \u2192 no\n- NT48 \u2192 't1' \u2192 no\n- NT39 \u2192 't0' and 't3' \u2192 no\n- NT68 \u2192 't4' \u2192 no\n- NT97 \u2192 't2' (directly) as per NT97 \u2192 't2' (from the rules, the last few are NT97 \u2192 't2' and others). Wait, no. Wait, the rules given are a bit complex with some non-terminals expanding into 't' symbols directly. Looking at the given rules:\n\nLooking more carefully, some non-terminals are directly linked to 't' symbols:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't2' (from NT77 \u2192 't2')\n- NT4 \u2192 't1'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n- NT68 \u2192 't2' (from NT68 \u2192 't2' in a rule? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the rules provided, some non-terminals expand directly into 't's:\n\nFor instance, some non-terminals have rules like NT97 \u2192 't2', NT77 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nSo, many non-terminals can produce a 't2' when expanded. So the key is to find a way in the string to have 't2' as the first or second symbol, depending on the split.\n\nThe string is t2 t0 t4 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t3. So the first two symbols are t2 and t0. Let's see if the leftmost derivation can start with NT97 nt7.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nIf NT97 produces 't2' and NT7 produces 't0', then we can get t2 t0 as the start of the string. Let's confirm:\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2' (from rule NT97 \u2192 't2'). No, wait, looking back at the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n- NT43 \u2192 't0'\n- NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n- NT26 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits that because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Good.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which means S must eventually produce these two NTs. So the string must correspond to the concatenation of two sequences, each generated by NT64 and NT96 respectively.\n\nLooking at NT64 and NT96, each is a non-terminal that eventually leads to a string of terminals. Let me check their productions.\n\nStarting with NT64: It can be derived via various productions, eventually ending with a terminal or another non-terminal until it results in 't4' or others. Similarly, NT96 can generate a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nI'll need to construct the parse tree for the string, breaking it down into the components generated by NT64 and NT96.\n\nThe string is: t4 t1 t1 t2 t4 t0 t4 t0 t2 t0 t3.\n\nLet me split it into two parts: the first part from NT64 and the second from NT96.\n\nNT64: Looking at the productions for NT64, eventually it must reach a terminal. Looking through, I see NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT62 \u2192 t0. But wait, what about NT84? NT84 has productions like \u2192 NT4 NT1 and \u2192 t2. So from NT84, we can get t2 or another non-terminal.\n\nBut the string starts with t4, which seems to require another path, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's examine each non-terminal and see the sequences they can produce.\n\nLooking at NT64: The productions are:\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT84 can produce NT4 NT1 or t2\n- NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63 or t0\nWait, but the string starts with t4, which is the start of NT64. Looking back, I think I might have mixed up the initial NTs.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT47 and others as non-terminals, and some also have terminal outputs. For example, NT64 \u2192 t4. No, wait, looking at the productions, I see NT64 can lead to NT84 NT62, and NT62 can lead to t0 or other ns, but there's also NT47 and more non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking at the list, actually, some NTs are assigned to terminals. For instance, looking at the productions:\n\nNT64 \u2192 t4 is not there. Wait, no, let's check all the terminals in the given productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t0\nNT68 \u2192 t0\nNT97 \u2192 t2\nNT84 \u2192 t2\nNT36 \u2192 t4\nNT47 \u2192 t1 (I think this is correct, as the user has specified NT47 \u2192 't1' and 't2')\n\nWait, no, the initial productions in the problem are in the form S \u2192 NT64 NT96, and then a list of rules. Some of these rules are NTV \u2192 t. For example, NT64: looking, the user has a list where NT64 might have a production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, in the given productions, for NT64, there is a line \"NT64 -> NT84 NT62\". Then for NT84, we have \"NT84 -> NT4 NT1\" and \"NT84 -> t2\" among others. But the string begins with t4. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial call is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Let me see what NT64 can produce. From the productions, for NT64:\n\nNT64:\n- \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- Is there any production for NT64 that ends directly in a terminal? From the given list, looking for NT64:\nLooking, the productions for NT64 are:\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nBut let's check the other non-terminals: Are any of these terminal? From the list, some non-terminals when they expand, produce terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 t0, NT68 \u2192 t0, etc.\n\nWait, but NT64 is not listed as any terminal except for its sub-productions. So probably, to get t4, perhaps NT47 has a production leading to t1, and another leading to t2.\n\nLooking for t4 in the terminals produced:\n\nLooking through each rule, the ones that produce t4 are:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t4\n- NT47 \u2192 t1 and t2 (but not t4)\nWait, no, looking, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t1, NT36 \u2192 t4, NT3 \u2192 t0, NT64 \u2192 not directly, but through NTVs.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should sketch the possible breakdown.\n\nThe string is t4 t1 t1 t2 t4 t0 t4 t0 t2 t0 t3.\n\nThat's 11 terminals.\n\nSince S starts as NT64 NT96, each of these non-terminals must generate a part of the string.\n\nSo, the string is divided into two parts: the first part by NT64 and the second by NT96.\n\nSo, first, NT64 should generate the first sequence, and NT96 should generate the second.\n\nLet me focus on NT96 first since it appears in the start symbol.\n\nNT96 has a production: NT96 \u2192 NT78 NT14.\n\nWait, so NT96 must expand into NT78 and NT14.\n\nNT78: Looking through the productions, NT78 \u2192 NT12 NT70.\n\nWait, that seems a lot, but perhaps this is a recursive path.\n\nWait, the production for NT96 is NT78 NT14, and I don't see NT96 directly leading to a terminal, so it must expand into more non-terminals.\n\nLet's see:\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT12 NT70\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT1 NT66?

{"custom_id":"request-186","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t2 t0 t4 t0 t2 t1 t2 t2 t2 t0 t3`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in CNF has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I notice that most non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, but some go directly into terminals, which are also specified. For example, NT68, NT3, NT97, etc., all directly map to terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t2, t0, t4, t0, t2, t1, t2, t2, t2, t0, t3. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation trees for any string will be binary, meaning each node is an application of a production to two symbols.\n\nI'll try to build the parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT64 NT96. \n\nLet's break down each step:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which becomes NT64 NT96. So the first two symbols of the string must be generated by NT64 and NT96. Looking at the production for NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT64 generates t4 and 62? Wait, actually, looking back, NT64 is mapped to 't4', right? Wait, no, in the productions, NT68 is 't4' or 't3' etc. Let me check the given productions:\n\nWait, looking back, in the productions:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nBut wait, in the given grammar, for NT64, it's written as NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Then, at the bottom, NT64 is set to 't4'. So, NT64 \u2192 't4'. So when NT64 is used, it produces a single terminal 't4'.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 is another non-terminal. Looking at the productions, NT96 appears in S's production and in NT36, which is a production: NT36 \u2192 NT77 NT96. NT36 is mapped to 't4' via NT36 -> 't4'; no. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar has a bunch of terminals as the right-hand sides. Let's list all the terminals and their corresponding t's:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\nNT68 \u2192 't4'\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nNT48 \u2192 't1'\nNT36 \u2192 't4' (appears in NT54 \u2192 't3', but elsewhere? Wait, the productions list has some lines like:\n\nNT36 -> 't4' (in line: NT77 -> 't3')? No, perhaps I should go step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer to list all the non-terminals and their productions, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, I can map each step.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is t2. Let me see NT64 expands to 't4' based on NT64 \u2192 't4'? Or wait, looking back:\n\nThe user input for the grammar shows lines like NT64 -> NT84 NT62, but further down, there are entries such as NT64 -> 't4'. For example:\n\nIn the provided grammar, for NT68: \"NT68 -> 't4'\", \"NT36 -> 't2'\", etc. So each non-terminal resolves to exactly one terminal or expands into two non-terminals. So, NT64 produces 't4', and NT96 produces something else.\n\nWait, looking at the string, first symbol is t2. But S starts with NT64, which produces 't4' as per NT64 \u2192 't4'. But the string starts with t2, which can't be produced by NT64. So that would immediately mean that the string cannot be generated by this grammar, right? Because the first symbol is t2, but S's first component is NT64, which produces 't4', not 't2'.\n\nWait, this seems like a problem. Let me double-check:\n\nThe grammar's production for NT64: \"NT64 -> 't4'\" (wait, looking again: does NT64 actually expand into a terminal, or does it go further? Let's check the lines:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT54 -> 't3'\nBut for NT64, the lines are:\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT68 -> NT54 NT53\n\nWait no, at the bottom of the grammar, I see lines like NT64 -> 't4', NT12 -> 't3', etc. So yes, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. So for example, NT64 is one of them: let's find where NT64 is in the list. Let me list the bottom productions:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT54 -> 't3'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT48 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT54 -> 't1'\nNT66 -> 't4'\nNT7 -> 't2'\nNT68 -> 't2'\nNT26 -> 't3'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT74 -> 't4'\nNT33 -> 't0'\nNT80 -> 't3'\nNT22 -> 't4'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT21 -> 't4'\nNT52 -> 't4'\nNT43 -> 't0'\nNT53 -> 't2'\nNT84 -> 't0'\nNT34 -> 't4'\nNT96 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't0'\nNT77 -> 't3'\nNT70 -> 't8' ? Wait, no, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, actually, the problem statement lists all the productions, with some lines like NT36 -> 't2' and others like NT38 -> NT34 NT27. So for example, NT36 produces 't2', NT54 produces 't3', and so on.\n\nSo, in the grammar given, NT64 is one such non-terminal that produces a terminal. Looking through the bottom lines:\n\n- NT64 -> 't4'\n\nYes, line: \"NT64 -> 't4'\"\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> 't3', etc.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the first step is that S expands into NT64 and NT96. So the string's first element is generated by NT64, which is 't4' according to the grammar. But in the given string, the first symbol is 't2', which doesn't match 't4'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine: The start symbol is S, which splits into NT64 and NT96. Both must produce a symbol each.\n\nSo, for the string to start with 't2', either NT64 produces 't2' or NT96 produces 't2', but both contribute to the first part of the string. Wait, no: S \u2192 NT64 NT96, so the string starts with whatever NT64 outputs, followed by whatever NT96 outputs. So if the string starts with t2, then NT64 must output t2 and NT96 must output the second symbol.\n\nBut looking at NT64's production: it's only a terminal 't4' (line NT64 -> 't4'). So NT64 cannot produce t2. Therefore, the first symbol can't be t2 if the production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, because NT64 outputs 't4'.\n\nSo that would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is t2, which can't be produced by NT64, which must be t4.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different way. Perhaps the NT96 part produces a non-terminal that goes into 't2' eventually. Let me think: S produces NT64 and NT96. NT64 is 't4', so the string starts with t4. But our string starts with t2. So unless NT96 can produce a longer sequence that starts with t2, but the first token would be t4 followed by NT96's tokens. So if NT96, for example, started with a t2, but in the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires all productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, most of the productions indeed follow this structure, and some terminals like 't0', 't1', etc., are directly part of the productions. So the grammar seems correctly in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to check is composed of terminals. My task is to see if there's a derivation in the grammar that results in this exact sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThis makes me think that the overall strategy might involve working backwards from the start symbol S and trying to break down the string into parts that match the productions. Alternatively, I can attempt to parse the string using the grammar, keeping track of possible splits at each step.\n\nLet me recall the start symbol. The grammar starts with S, so the first step would be to see what S can produce. Looking at the productions, S can only produce NT64 NT96, as far as I see in the given rules. So S directly splits into NT64 and NT96.\n\nNow, each NT (non-terminal terminal?) is a non-terminal, right? So both NT64 and NT96 can be further expanded. Let me check what each produces.\n\nLooking up NT64's production: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Okay, so that's two non-terminals. Similarly, NT96 has NT54 NT53. So now, each of these non-terminals will need to expand further.\n\nSo, the string will ultimately consist of expanding each of these step by step and ensuring that the terminals match the given string.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible expansion path. Starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\n= (NT84 NT62) (NT54 NT53)\n\nNow, each of these can expand further. Let's take NT84, NT62, NT54, and NT53.\n\nLooking up NT84: production is NT4 NT1. NT4 can produce 't1' according to the rules (NT4 -> 't1'). NT1 has several productions, including NT68 NT3, which can expand further.\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Let me list out each non-terminal and their possible terminals.\n\nLooking through the given productions, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\nNT22 \u2192 't4'\nNT74 \u2192 't4'\nSo NT3 \u2192 't4' 't4' = 't4t4'\n\nWait, no. NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74, each of which is a terminal. So when NT3 expands, it becomes 't4t4' because NT22\u2192't4' and NT74\u2192't4'.\n\nSimilarly, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. NT4 \u2192 't1' and NT1 has several options. Let me check NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77, NT77 \u2192 't2', so if NT1 uses NT5 NT77, NT5 can also have other options. Alternatively, NT1 can be 't2' in some cases.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list each step more carefully.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nSo the string is now built from NT84 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nBut let me check the given string: it's a sequence of terminals without any non-terminals, so I need to expand all the way until only terminals remain.\n\nSo each non-terminal must expand into terminals or more non-terminals, but eventually, everything must become terminals.\n\nWait, but the grammar might have cycles, so I need to make sure that the expansion can terminate at some point.\n\nLet me attempt to break down each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part of the string: the given string is \"t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2\".\n\nI need to see if I can parse this string by matching the productions.\n\nLet's try parsing from left to right, using the grammar.\n\nThe string is t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent approach.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nSo the left part is NT64 which becomes NT84 NT62, and the right part is NT96 which becomes NT54 NT53. So now the overall string to parse is [NT84 NT62] [NT54 NT53], which corresponds to t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, expanding the non-terminals as needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent each non-terminal as a function that, given a stack, can generate possible terminal sequences.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to note that the grammar's start symbol S must generate a string that is the concatenation of two derived strings from NT64 and NT96. So the given string must be split into two parts, each part being derived from NT64 and NT96 respectively.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it's 12 terminals. Let's check the possible lengths.\n\nEach NT production can either be a terminal (length 1) or two non-terminals (which will expand into strings of varying lengths). So the total length of the string must be the sum of the lengths of the two derived strings from NT64 and NT96.\n\nLet me see how each NT can expand:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 each of these can expand further, but let's see their expansions.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 \u2192 NT4 is 't1', NT1 can be NT66 NT48, which then splits further, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I can see if the terminal string can be broken down into possible subterms.\n\nLooking at the given string: t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2.\n\nPerhaps the string can be divided into two parts, each part corresponding to the expansion of NT64 and NT96.\n\nWait, perhaps the string should be split into two parts where the lengths correspond to the number of terminals each NT expansion would produce. For example, NT64 might expand into a string of length 3, and NT96 into length 9, or some other split.\n\nWait, let me see: the string is 12 terminals. Suppose NT64 expands into 6 terminals and NT96 into 6, or 5 and 7, etc. But each NT production in CNF can only produce 2 non-terminals or a terminal, so their expansions would lead to varying lengths.\n\nThis might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm could help, but I'm not sure how to apply it here without the actual grammar in CNF structure.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out all possible productions for each non-terminal and see if any combination leads to the given string.\n\nAnother approach: look for possible ways the string can be split into two parts, each starting with 't0' and 't0', since the first symbols are t0, t0, t0. So the first part must derive something that starts with t0, and perhaps the same for the second part.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT68 can produce 't0', NT97 can produce 't1', etc. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't0' or 't1'.\n\nNT3 \u2192 't4' 't4' \u2192 't4t4'\nNT4 \u2192 't1'\nNT1 \u2192 't2' or other combinations leading to 't2'.\nNT77 \u2192 't2'\nNT68 \u2192 't0' or 't68' (wait, in the rules, some symbols produce 't0', etc.)\n\nLooking at the rules, let's see which terminals are possible:\n\nLooking for all rules that produce terminal symbols (like 't0', 't1', etc.):\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't4t4'\n- NT4 \u2192 't1'\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' (look, looking through the rules, yes: NT68 \u2192 't0' somewhere)\n- NT77 \u2192 't2'\n- NT33 \u2192 't3' (from NT33 \u2192 't3')\nWait, looking back, yes, there are some rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each rule takes a non-terminal and produces two other non-terminals or terminals. Since Chomsky normal form only allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, the rules provided seem to fit that.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first step is to see which productions from S can lead to the given string.

None of the productions from S produce 't1' as the first terminal. The first symbol in the string is 't1', but according to the grammar, NT35, NT64, and NT97 all produce their own terminals, none of which are 't1'. Let me double-check the rules:\n\nLooking through the definitions:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT84 \u2192 't2'\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n- NT64 \u2192 't4'\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\nWait, I see now. NT33 \u2192 't1'. But looking at the productions from S, none produce NT33 directly. So the initial step from S can't reach 't1' in the first step.\n\nHmm, that suggests that it's impossible for the grammar to derive the string because the first symbol is 't1', but S's children only produce terminals that are 't2', 't3', 't4', or others, but not 't1'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine each production from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96: NT64 is 't4', NT96 is 't4'\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7: NT97 is 't2', NT7 is 't0'? Wait, looking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48.

Then NT66 produces two non-terminals, but ultimately, when expanded, it would generate sequences that might lead to terminals. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the string cannot be derived because S cannot produce a 't1' unless one of its children can derive 't1'. But looking at S's productions, none directly produce 't1' in their immediate right-hand sides. The children of S all have their own right-hand sides that result in 't2', 't3', or 't4's, but no 't1's.

That should make parsing a bit systematic, maybe even using something like the CYK algorithm. But since this is a small string and the grammar is provided in CNF, perhaps a manual approach would be manageable.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions for S are all two non-terminals: `S -> NT64 NT96`, `S -> NT97 NT7`, `S -> NT35 NT84`. So any string derived from S must start with one of these combinations. The string I need to evaluate starts with `t4 t3 t2`, which don't directly correspond to any of these, but wait\u2014no, the string is in terms of terminal symbols like t0, t1, etc., so I need to see how they get built up from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules, each non-terminal on the right side has their own productions, some of which are terminals and others are non-terminals. For example, NT64 can produce `NT84 NT62` or `NT54 NT62`, etc. Each of these can either be terminals or break down further. The leaves of this tree will be the terminal symbols, and I need to see if the string can be constructed from these.\n\nLet me try to see if the string matches any possible derivation. The string is t4 t3 t2 t4 t2 t4 t2 t4 t1 t0 t2 t0 t3. That's 13 tokens, so the derivation path must expand 13 times. Hmm. But I need to think about how these tokens are built from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal can only produce two symbols, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal. Wait, no\u2014the rules are in CNF, so each production has exactly two non-terminals. Wait, no: wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C can be non-terminals or terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 B C with B, C being non-terminals, or A \u2192 a with a being a terminal. So each production is either replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's correct. Each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So when parsing, every step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So the start symbol S will generate two non-terminals, which in turn generate their respective pairs, etc., until all are terminals.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals, 13 in total. So from S, we need to expand it into 13 terminals. The number of steps required would be such that the derivation produces 13 terminals. Since each non-terminal expansion can produce either one or two symbols, but since all are in CNF, each production produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C are non-terminals. So each non-terminal replacement can produce two non-terminals. So the expansion can be thought of as a binary tree. So starting with S, which is a non-terminal, we replace it with two non-terminals. Each of those can again be replaced with two non-terminals, and so on, until we reach a point where some non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nThe total number of terminals is 13. Since each production of a non-terminal into two non-terminals increases the count by 1 (starting from 1, each expansion adds 1 because 2 non-terminals replace 1). Wait, actually, when you replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the count goes from 1 to 2. Then each of those can be replaced, leading to more non-terminals, but when you hit a production that replaces a non-terminal with a terminal, you just add one terminal as part of the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of terminals generated. The formula for the number of terminals (k) in a CNF derivation is that the number of non-terminals in the derivation tree (m) must satisfy k = m + 1. So if we have a string of length k, then the number of non-terminals in the tree is k - 1. So here, k=13, so m=12. That means the derivation tree has 13 leaves (terminals) and 12 internal nodes (non-terminals). So the parse would go from S down 13 levels, splitting each non-terminal into two until we reach all terminals.\n\nBut maybe that's not the easiest way. Instead, perhaps I should build the parse tree step by step and see if the given string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to use memoization or recursion to see if the string can be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to map each terminal in the string to their possible sources in the grammar, then see if they can be connected appropriately.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string in order: t4, t3, t2, t4, t2, t4, t2, t4, t1, t0, t2, t0, t3.\n\nSo each terminal corresponds to a production of a non-terminal, either directly or through a series of steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can produce which single terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT47 -> t4 (from NT47 -> 't4')\nNT62 -> t4 (from NT64 -> NT84 NT62, but NT62 in another production is something else. Wait, no, in the rules provided, I need to look for rules where the right side is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\nNT64 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't3'\nNT39 -> 't0'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT84 -> 't2'\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT48 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT54 -> 't1'\nNT66 -> 't4'\nNT7 -> 't2'\nNT68 -> 't2'\nNT26 -> 't3'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT74 -> 't4'\nNT33 -> 't0'\nNT80 -> 't3'\nNT22 -> 't4'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT21 -> 't4'\nNT52 -> 't4'\nNT43 -> 't0'\nNT53 -> 't2'\nNT84 -> 't0'\nNT34 -> 't4'\nNT96 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't0'\nNT3 -> 't0'\nNT98 -> 't1'\nNT86 -> 't0'\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT98 -> 't0'\nNT77 -> 't3'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT78 -> 't0'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT54 -> 't3'\nNT84 -> 't2'\nNT12 -> 't3'\nNT39 -> 't0'\nNT64 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT48 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT54 -> 't1'\nNT66 -> 't4'\nNT7 -> 't2'\nNT68 -> 't2'\nNT26 -> 't3'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT74 -> 't4'\nNT33 -> 't0'\nNT80 -> 't3'\nNT22 -> 't4'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT21 -> 't4'\nNT52 -> 't4'\nNT43 -> 't0'\nNT53 -> 't2'\nNT84 -> 't0'\nNT34 -> 't4'\nNT96 -> 't3'\nNT62 -> 't0'\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake here.

So the grammar can be analyzed step by step. I think I should start by looking at the start symbol S. The right-hand sides of the productions from S are combinations of NTs, which then break down further based on the productions.\n\nThe string starts with `t0`, which I'll refer to as t0[0]. Looking at the grammar, I see NT68 and NT3 are both associated with t0[0]. So, I need to find which production rules lead to t0. Checking the rules, NT68 can produce t4, but in the case of `NT68 -> 't0'`, so NT68 can be expanded into t0. Similarly, NT3 can directly become t0. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The grammar has multiple NTs that expand into t0, t1, etc. The key is to see the derivation path from S that can result in the given string. Since the string is a sequence of 13 t's, each separated by spaces, it's a bit long, but I can break it down.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S can go to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Each of these will generate two parts. Since the string starts with t0, let's see if any of these initial NTs can produce t0.\n\n- NT64: From the grammar, NT64 -> NT84 NT62. But NT84 is t2, and NT62 is t0, so perhaps that's a route. But NT64's own productions may go on, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, NT97: NT97 -> NT43 NT75. Both NT43 and NT75 are further expanded, but not sure yet.\n\nAnother option: NT35 -> NT84 NT81. NT84 is t2 and NT81 is t1, not t0.\n\nWait, maybe the first part is NT64, which is t4, then the second part must handle t0. That doesn't seem to fit because the string starts with t0.\n\nWait, let me check NT64's expansion: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. NT84 is t2 and NT62 is t0. So if S is NT64 NT96, then that would result in t2 t0, but the string starts with t0 t0 t4..., so that path might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if S is NT97 NT7, let's see NT97: NT97 -> NT43 NT75. NT43 expands to t0 and NT75 to t3. So that would produce t0 t3... which doesn't match the initial t0 t0.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT68, which is part of the rule where S can be NT97 NT7. Wait, no, S is not NT68. S's productions are either NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. So if the string starts with t0, that's from either NT68 or NT3, but looking at the grammar, for example, NT68 can be t0 in some cases.\n\nWait, the production rules are in the form of NTX -> NTY NTZ or NTX -> 't0' etc. So for example, NT68's rule is NT68 -> 't0', so NT68 can directly generate t0. Similarly, NT97 has a rule to produce t0. So, let's think about the starting symbol S.\n\nS can be S -> NT97 NT7. NT7's production: NT7 -> NT66 NT48. Let's see if NT7 can produce t4.\n\nWait, NT66 is part of NT66's production: NT66 -> NT52 NT63. NT52 is produced as 't2' (from NT52 -> 't2'), and NT63 is 't4' (from NT63 -> 't4'). Wait, looking at the rules, NT63's expansion is 't4'. So if, in the first step, S is NT97 NT7, and then NT7 is NT66 NT48, with NT66 being t4 and NT48 being t1, that wouldn't fit the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t0, t0, t4, t0, t4, t2, t4, t2, t4, t2, t4, t0, t3.\n\nEach 't' represents a terminal, and the positions matter.\n\nLet me try to build the string by starting from S and trying to break it down into the productions.\n\nLooking at S's options: S can be NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nThe first token is t0, so one of the NTs in either NT64, NT96, NT97, NT7, NT35, or NT84 must produce t0.\n\nLooking at NT64's possible expansions:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 is t0 (because NT84 -> 't0'), and NT62 is 't0' as well (from NT62 -> 't0').\n\nWait, so if S is NT64, which is NT64 -> NT84 NT62, then that would produce t0 t0, because both NT84 and NT62 are t0.\n\nWait, that matches the start of the string: t0 t0.\n\nSo perhaps the first symbol is t0 t0.\n\nThen the rest of the string would need to come from NT84 and NT62.\n\nWait, but NT84 is one of the possible first symbols for S.\n\nWait, S can be NT64 NT96. So S -> NT64 NT96, which would produce NT64 and NT96.\n\nBut that would give tokens based on NT64 and NT96. Let me see their expansions.\n\nWait, NT64 is part of the rule S->NT64 NT96, so NT64 is part of the first component, which is on the left of the space (the first symbol), and NT96 is the second component (the second symbol).\n\nSo in the string, the first two symbols are t0 t0. If S is NT64 NT96, then NT64 would produce t0 and NT96 would also produce t0.\n\nLet me check whether NT64 and NT96 can each produce t0.\n\nLooking at NT64, the possible expansions are:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nThen, NT84 is 't0' so that part would generate t0.\n\nAnd NT62 is also 't0', so both parts would produce t0 each. So NT64 NT96 would produce t0 t0, which matches the first two symbols.\n\nNow, the remaining string is t4 t0 t4 t0 t4 t2 t4 t2 t4 t2 t4 t0 t3.\n\nSo we need to generate the rest of the string from NT96 and maybe other productions, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of another approach: perhaps using recursion or the CYK algorithm.\n\nBut since I'm just reasoning, maybe it's better to look at each part. Alternatively, maybe the string does not fit because NT96 can only produce certain combinations.\n\nLooking back, the grammar also has S->NT97 NT7, which could be a route. If S is NT97 NT7, then NT97's production is 't0' and NT7's production.\n\nWait, NT7 can be broken down into NT66 NT48, so NT66 is t4 (from NT66 -> 't4'), and NT48 is t1 (from NT48 -> 't1'). So that would produce t4 t1, which doesn't match the third symbol which is t4. So that path might not work.\n\nAnother option: S->NT35 NT84.\n\nNT35 is 't3' (from NT35 -> 't3'), and NT84 is 't0' (from NT84 -> 't0'). So that would produce t3 t0, which doesn't match the first two symbols which are t0 t0.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the first t0, so maybe S is not taking that route.\n\nSo perhaps the initial S is NT64 NT96, which produce t0 and t0.\n\nNow, the rest of the string is t4 t0 t4 t0 t4 t2 t4 t2 t4 t2 t4 t0 t3.\n\nNow, after the initial t0 t0, we have to handle the next symbols"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Correction: NT77 expands to 't1', same as NT3 and NT98.]\n\nSo, to summarize, NT63, NT47, NT68, NT3, NT98, NT86, NT68, NT97, NT77, NT35, NT78, NT36, NT54, NT84, NT12, NT39, NT64, NT1, NT48, NT33, NT54, NT66, NT7, NT68, NT26, NT52, NT74, NT80, NT22, NT82, NT54, NT81, and NT36 expand into terminals. The rest are non-terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the starting symbol S. It can expand to NT64 NT96, which becomes 't4' and 't4'. So S would produce 't4 t4' if it directly expands to NT64 NT96. Alternatively, S can expand to NT97 NT7, which would be 't2' and 't2', giving 't2 t2'. Or S can expand to NT35 NT84, which is 't3' and 't2', so 't3 t2'. But the given string starts with 't0 t0', so S must expand to something else, but wait, based on the rules, S's only options are these three, none produce 't0' at the start. So that's a problem because the first symbol in the string is 't0', but all possible expansions from S start with 't4 t4', 't2 t2', or 't3 t2'. So the first two symbols cannot be 't0 t0' because S's expansions don't start with 't0'. \n\nWait, that might mean the string cannot be generated because S starts with non-terminals whose expansions don't begin with 't0'. But I need to double-check.\n\nWait, looking back at the production rules, maybe I made a mistake in understanding which non-terminals expand to 't0's. Let me check:\n\nThe terminals are explicitly given as:\n\nNT63 -> 't1'\nNT47 -> 't1'\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT3 -> 't0'\nNT98 -> 't1'\nNT86 -> 't0'\nNT68 -> 't3' (Wait, is that correct? Because earlier I thought NT68 expands to 't0', but now I see another production where NT68 -> 't3'. Maybe I messed up.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again:\n\n- NT68 has multiple productions. It's a bit confusing because a non-terminal can have multiple production rules, but in standard CFGs, if a non-terminal has multiple rules, it can choose any of them. But here, some rules seem overlapping. Let me check each NT68 production:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\nNT47-> 't1'\nNT12-> 't3'\nSo NT68 can expand to 't1' 't3' which is 't1 t3', but the rule says NT68 -> 't0' as well? Wait, no\u2014looking back, the rule list: under NT68, the rules are:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because if NT68 can expand into three things: a combination of NTs, a terminal 't0', or another terminal 't3'. So when considering NT68, it can produce 't0', 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-250","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Let me first look at the grammar and the string to figure out a way to approach this.\n\nThe grammar has several production rules starting with S and NT nodes, and eventually some rules that produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. The string I need to evaluate is `t2 t0 t4 t1 t0 t4 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t4 t0 t3`.\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, I can try parsing the string using a recursive descent approach or a CYK algorithm. But since the string isn't very long, maybe a recursive or backtracking method would work. Alternatively, I can also see if the grammar has any patterns that the string follows.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has productions like S -> NT64 NT96, S -> NT97 NT7, etc. So S must be expanded into two non-terminals. Then each of those would need to produce the string elements.\n\nLet me outline the structure of the string: It's a sequence of terminals: t2, t0, t4, t1, t0, t4, t1, t2, t2, t2, t2, t4, t0, t3. So it's 14 symbols long.\n\nEach non-terminal must expand into a pair of non-terminals or terminals. Since the string is in order, the first two elements must come from the first part of the S expansion.\n\nFor example, if S -> NT64 NT96, then the string starts with the production of NT64 followed by NT96. So I need to check if NT64 can produce t2 and then NT96 can produce t0, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me clarify: Each NT symbol in the grammar is a non-terminal, and each has its own productions. So for example, NT64 can produce ND84 and NT62 (from the rule NT64 -> NT84 NT62). These ND symbols are further non-terminals with their own productions, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nSo the approach is to parse the string step by step, expanding each non-terminal into its possible productions and checking if the string can be fully consumed.\n\nI think a better way is to represent this as a parsing problem, but since this might get complicated, maybe I can simplify by seeing if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's structure.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the grammar can generate this string by tracing possible expansions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol, t2. So which non-terminals can produce t2?\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's find which NT rules have t2 in their productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT7 -> NT66 NT48\n- NT26 -> NT52 NT62\n- NT75 -> NT98 NT26\n- NT97 -> NT43 NT75\n- NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n- NT74 -> NT33 NT27\n- NT5 -> NT68 NT3\n- NT54 -> NT84 NT54 (No, that's a cycle)\nWait, hold on, in the grammar list, it's written as \"NT54 -> 't4'\", so NT54 can produce t4 directly.\n\nWait, but other NTs like NT52 produce t2? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT52 -> 't2' (Yes, in the rules: NT52 -> 't2').\n\nSo NT52 is a non-terminal that can produce t2.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t0, which is the second symbol. Let's see which NTs can produce t0.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT66 -> 't4' (No)\n- NT47 -> 't4' (No)\n- NT97 -> 't2' (No)\n- NT84 -> 't2' (No)\n- NT35 -> 't3' (No)\n- NT78 -> 't0' (Yes, NT78->'t0')\n- NT36 -> 't2' (No)\n- NT54 -> 't4' (No)\n- NT84 -> 't2' (No)\n- NT12 -> 't3' (No)\n- NT39 -> 't0'\nAh, so NT39 can produce t0, but is NT39 present in the grammar? Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nYes, I see NT12 -> 't3' (No)\nNT39 -> 't0' (Yes, from rule NT39 -> 't0')\nSo NT39 can produce t0.\n\nWait, but in the initial grammar, NT12 is a non-terminal, but in the list of rules, I see NT39 -> 't0'. So yes, NT39 can produce t0.\n\nSo, the second symbol is t0, which could come from NT39. But how does that fit into the overall structure?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this step by step by trying to parse the string.\n\nThe string is t2 t0 t4 t1 t0 t4 t1 t2 t2 t2 t2 t4 t0 t3.\n\nLet's denote the positions as 0 to 13.\n\nStarting with S, which must expand into two non-terminals: for example, S->NT64 NT96, S->NT97 NT7, etc.\n\nLet me take the first possibility: S->NT64 NT96.\n\nSo the first production is NT64 followed by NT96.\n\nNow, check if NT64 can expand to produce t2 as the first symbol, and NT96 can produce t0 as the second symbol.\n\nLooking at NT64's productions: NT64 -> NT84 NT62 (from the rule NT64->NT84 NT62). So to get t2, which is the first symbol, we need to see if NT84 can produce t2 at the first step.\n\nWait, but let's think recursively. For the string to start with NT64 producing a sequence that starts with t2, NT64 must reduce to rules that start with t2.\n\nLooking at NT64's rules:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, NT84's rules: NT84 -> NT4 NT1 (from \"NT84 -> NT4 NT1\"). Wait, no, the rule is NT84 -> NT4 NT1. So NT84 can produce NT4 and NT1.\n\nWait, no. NT84 is a non-terminal, and each has their own productions. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT84 has a rule: NT84 -> NT4 NT1? Or is that for another NT?\n\nWait no, from the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT84: Yes, \"NT84 -> NT4 NT1\".\n\nSo NT84 can produce NT4 and NT1. ThenNT4's rules: NT4 -> 't1'. So if NT84 can produce t1 and ... wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, no, NT84 is one of the non-terminals. Its rules are: NT84 -> NT4 NT1. So to get t2, we need to see if NT84 can produce t2.\n\nBut looking at NT84, none of its productions directly produce a terminal like t2 or t0. Let me check the rules for NT84 again.\n\nYes, NT84 -> NT4 NT1. So NT84's only production is to NT4 and NT1. Since both NT4 and NT1 produce terminals, maybe we can see their combinations.\n\nNT4 -> 't1' and NT1 -> 't2', so NT4 NT1 would be t1 followed by t2, which doesn't match the first two symbols t2 t0. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, so if S expands into NT64 NT96, then NT64's expansion would be NT84 NT62. Then, the first symbol 't2' must come from NT64, but NT64 produces NT84 and NT62, which in turn produce 't1' and 't4', so that would give 't1 t4', which doesn't match the first two symbols 't2 t0'. So this path is invalid.\n\nMaybe S must expand into a different production. Let's try another production of S. Let's see, another production is S->NT97 NT7.\n\nSo if S is NT97 and NT7, then the first two symbols are t2 (from NT97) and t0 (from NT7). Let's check if that's possible.\n\nSo the string starts with t2 t0.\n\nLooking at NT97's production: NT97 -> NT43 NT75 (from the rule NT97 -> NT43 NT75). So NT97 would produce NT43 and NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided fits this structure, as all productions except for the terminal elements are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 t.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals: t1, t0, t2, etc. Since the grammar has only two starting symbols, S, and each production of S breaks it down into two non-terminals, I know the string must have an even number of symbols when fully expanded. The given string has 15 tokens, which is odd, so it can't be generated by S \u2192 NT ... NT unless I miscounted. Let me double-check: t1, t0, t0, t4, t1, t2, t1, t4, t1, t2, t2, t2, t4, t0, t2. Yes, 15 symbols, which is odd. That's a red flag because each production of S will result in two non-terminals, and each of those could break down into two, etc. So after n steps, the number of non-terminals is 2^n, and terminals would be 2^(n+1). But since the string is 15, which is 16 minus 1, it's not a power of two times two. So that's a strong hint that the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows for some overlapping or merging, but I don't think so because in CNF, each step increases the depth, so the number of terminals at any level is a power of two. Since 16 is a power of two, 16 would make the string possible if it were 16 symbols. 15 isn't, so that suggests it's not possible.\n\nAnother angle is to check all possible ways the string could be formed, but given the structure, it's even more constrained. Each step in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. So starting from S, each production increases the count until you reach the terminals. For the grammar provided, since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of terminals in the derived string must be a power of two. 16 is 2^4, so 15 can't be achieved.

Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar provided. I see that it's quite extensive with multiple non-terminal symbols and production rules. Each rule seems to be of the form A -> BC or A -> t where 't' represents a terminal symbol. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires that all productions are in the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. So this grammar is in CNF because all rules have either two non-terminals on the right (except when they produce terminals).\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t1 t4 t1 t4 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0`. That's a sequence of terminal tokens. The challenge is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm are suitable. But maybe I can approach this manually by trying to break down the string into possible non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me note down the non-terminals and their productions to see if any patterns emerge. The start symbol is S, which has the following productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, starting from S, the first step is to split into two non-terminals. Since the string is quite long, I might need to consider how these non-terminals can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me first see what each of these non-terminals can generate.\n\nLooking at NT64 and NT96 from the first production S \u2192 NT64 NT96:\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 (from S's rule 3: NT64's production is different than the first S rule. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT66 and others have their own productions. I think I need to map each NT to their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should group the non-terminals and their possible productions so I can reference them easily. Let me list all the non-terminals and their rules:\n\nNT64: NT84 NT62\nNT1: NT5 NT77\nNT66: NT52 NT63\nNT64's rule is separate: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT53: NT86 NT33\nNT7: NT66 NT48\nNT33: NT84 NT81\nNT38: NT34 NT27\nNT12: NT82 NT48\nNT5: NT68 NT3\nNT38: NT63 NT96 (Wait, is this a separate production? Because NT38 might have multiple productions. Need to check all rules for NT38.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n- NT38 \u2192 NT34 NT27\n- NT38 \u2192 NT63 NT96\n\nSo NT38 has two productions. Similarly, other non-terminals may have multiple productions. So I need to make a list for each NT of their possible productions.\n\nLet me reorganize the grammar into a list where each key is a non-terminal, and the value is a list of possible productions (each production is a pair of two non-terminals or a terminal).\n\nSo:\n\nNT64 \u2192 [ (NT84, NT62) ]\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar:\n\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nSo yes, that's the only production for NT64.\n\nNT1 \u2192 [ (NT5, NT77) ]\n\nNT66 \u2192 [ (NT52, NT63) ]\n\nNT64: only [NT84, NT62]\n\nNT53: NT86, NT33\n\nNT7: NT66, NT48\n\nNT33: NT84, NT81\n\nNT38: NT34, NT27; NT63, NT96\n\nNT12: NT82, NT48\n\nNT5: NT68, NT3\n\nNT38 has two options.\n\nNT96: NT54, NT53\n\nNT77: NT39, NT39\n\nNT24: NT38, NT70\n\nNT98: NT78, NT14\n\nNT47: NT1, NT62; Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nBut then in another part: NT47 -> NT1 NT62 again? Let me confirm. Yes, I see that NT47 has two productions:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n- Another occurrence of NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62? No, perhaps a typo, or maybe it's unique. Wait, I'll recount the grammar:\n\nLooking back, after S's rules:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\n- NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n- Then again: NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nWait, no, perhaps only one production for NT47?\n\nWait, no, I think the user made a mistake here, but in the provided grammar, I see NT47 appearing twice:\n\n- Line 17: NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n- Line 44: NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nWait, that's confusing. So is NT47 having two different productions? Let's confirm.\n\nYes, in the given grammar, NT47 is defined as:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n\nAnd also:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62? Or perhaps it's a typo, maybe another production. Wait, actually, checking again:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, lines 17, 44:\n\nLine 17: S \u2192 NT98 NT26.\n\nLine 18: NT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14\n\n... \n\nLine 29: NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n\nLine 44: NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62. So perhaps NT47 has two productions, both NT1 and NT62. Hmm, perhaps that's a mistake in the input, maybe it's a copy-paste error. But for the sake of this problem, I'll proceed, assuming that NT47 has one production: NT1 NT62. Or wait, maybe it's two same productions, which may not affect anything.\n\nAnyway, I can proceed.\n\nOther non-terminals:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT63 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1' [Wait, that's confusing. Is NT47 a terminal? Because 't1' is a terminal token.\n\nWait, but in CNF, non-terminals can only produce other non-terminals or terminals, not a mix. So if a non-terminal produces a terminal, it must be a single terminal. So looking at:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nBut in another line, NT47 is defined as NT1 NT62, so NT47 produces non-terminals. So perhaps the production NT47 \u2192 't1' is incorrect because NT47 cannot produce a terminal if it's a non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe it's an error. Hmm, this is unclear. Similarly, NT98 \u2192 't1', 't0', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals that produce terminals are the ones with rules that directly go to terminals, but perhaps in some cases, a non-terminal is directly connected to a terminal. Let's check all the rules.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT47 appears on the right side in multiple rules, but I don't see any instance where NT47 is on the left side. So as a non-terminal, it can only produce non-terminals. So if any of its rules produce a terminal, that's allowed as long as other steps can reach terminals.\n\nWait, but another line: NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nIf NT47 is defined as producing non-terminals, then NT68 also produces non-terminals. But in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- So both NT47 and NT68 produce two non-terminals.\n\nIn the given rules, I see that some non-terminals are directly connected to terminals, e.g.:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT78 \u2192 NT64 NT36\n- NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n- NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT7 \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. Each production's left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side can be two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, or two terminals, but wait, Chomsky normal form typically restricts to two non-terminals only, right? Oh, but looking at the rules, some right-hand sides have two terminals, like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, which are both non-terminals. Wait, no, in the rules above, I see some like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, which are non-terminals, others like NT3 \u2192 't0', so those are terminals. So each production is either two non-terminals, a non-terminal and a terminal, or a terminal and a non-terminal, but none have two terminals. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see NT47 \u2192 't1', so that's a terminal. So the grammar allows for some productions to produce a terminal in one step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t0, t1, t2, etc. Now, the string has 16 elements (counting each t as a single token). Each t is a result of a production, so the derivation path must produce exactly 16 t's without any leftover non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, considering possible derivations from the grammar.\n\nFirst, the top-level grammar (the start symbol) is S, which can be rewritten in three ways:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these will produce two parts, which then need to expand into sequences of t's. The string given is `t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1` which is 16 t's. So each S must generate exactly 16 t's, meaning each part after S \u2192 NT... must generate 8 t's each. Because S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and each NT1 and NT2 must produce 8 t tokens each, making 16 total.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because each NT could expand into multiple t's through different productions. But the total number of t's is 16, so the derivation must result in exactly 16 t's. Each step that goes through NT's that produce t's increments the count, but I have to consider how the grammar's productions can generate the required sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of symbols needing to expand all the way until only terminals are left, and their sequence must match the target string.\n\nGiven that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals and productions, I'll try to find a way to build the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a way to match the string by traversing the grammar's productions, trying to build the string from the start.\n\nLet me see: the string is 16 t's. Each t must come from a production that outputs a single terminal symbol, probably either 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nLet me try to see which NT's directly produce t's.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, making it easier to parse.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which expands into combinations of NT and numbers. The grammar has a total of 18 non-terminals, which are all the NT followed by numbers like NT47, NT64, etc. Each of these non-terminals eventually expands into a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the expansions don't contain any \u03b5 (epsilon) productions, which means every expansion must produce at least two terminals. However, I notice that some NT symbols expand directly into a single terminal, like NT66 -> 't0', NT24 -> 't3', and so on.\n\nThe string given consists of sixteen 't' symbols with numbers, so I need to see if I can derive this string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, I'll likely need to perform a recursive descent or use dynamic programming for parsing, but maybe I can find a parse tree manually.\n\nI can start by looking at the start symbol S and see which productions can lead me towards the given string. The three possible productions for S are:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nI'll need to see which of these can generate parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the terminal sequence, it starts with t0 t0. Let's see if any of the productions for NT can produce t0.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT66 -> 't0'\n\nSo, if one of the NTs in the S production is NT66, that could produce t0. For example, in S->NT64 NT96, if NT64 can produce t0 and NT96 can produce t0, then the start S would generate t0 t0, which is the beginning of our string.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf NT64 can produce t0, that's good. Looking at NT64's production:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nThen NT84 can produce t2, and NT62 can produce t0 (from NT68 -> t0, but wait, NT68 is another non-terminal. Let me check:\n\nWait, NT68's productions:\n\n- NT68 -> 't0', so yes, NT68 can produce t0.\n\nBut NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo if NT84 produces t2 and NT62 produces t0, that would give NT64 -> t2 t0.\n\nWait, that doesn't produce t0. Hmm, perhaps I need to go deeper into the expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe string starts with t0 t0. Let's see which NTs can derive t0.\n\nFrom the NT productions, I see:\n\n- NT66 -> 't0'\n\nSo, if one of the parts of the S production is NT66, it can produce t0. For the other part, we need another NT that can produce t0. Looking at the S productions:\n\nIf I take S -> NT64 NT96, then I need both NT64 and NT96 to produce t0. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nLooking at NT84's productions: NT84 -> NT4 NT1. Then NT4's productions: NT4 -> 't1', NT7 -> 't0', etc. Wait, NT84 is 't1'? Wait, no, let me find the production rules.\n\nWait, the grammar is quite extensive, and it's given in CNF, so each non-terminal expands to exactly two non-terminals except some which expand to a single terminal. Let me list a few key non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT84 can expand into NT4 NT1.\n\nNT4 can be 't1' or 't7' (from NT7 -> 't0'? Wait, no, wait. Looking at the grammar:\n\nThe grammar's expansions are all pairs except the obvious terminals. Wait, let me see:\n\nFor example, NT64->'t0'? No, wait, looking at the rules above, the non-terminals seem to produce other non-terminals until they reach the terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules, let me list the terminal productions:\n\n- NT66 -> 't0'\n- NT47 -> 't1' (appearing twice)\n- NT64 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT1 -> 't2'\n- NT77 -> 't2'\n- NT97 -> 't4'\n- NT78 -> 't0'\n- NT14 -> 't0'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't3'\n- NT21 -> 't4'\n- NT52 -> 't4'\n- NT43 -> 't0'\n- NT53 -> 't2'\n- NT84 -> 't0'\n- NT53 -> 't2' again\n- Others: I might be missing some, but overall, many NTs directly produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nSo, for instance, NT66 is 't0', NT47 is 't1', NT64 is 't4' (from NT68), but wait, wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, looking closer:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nThen NT84 could expand further, perhaps into a terminal. Looking through NT84's rules:\n\nWait, I think I need to make a structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider the string and see if it can be built by applying the grammar rules step by step.\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t1 t4 t1 t4 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1.\n\nLet me try to build this string step by step, applying the productions.\n\nFirst, S can produce any of the three options. Let's try S->NT64 NT96, because NT64 can produce 't0' if derived through some steps.\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT64 is a combination of NT84 and NT62. Let's see if both can produce t0 or other terms that can lead to the start of the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t0 t0, so maybe both NT64 and NT96 must produce t0.\n\nWait, let me rephrase. If S is NT64 NT96, then the string must be generated by NT64's expansion followed by NT96's expansion. So NT64 must produce the first t0, and NT96 must produce the next t0, and so on.\n\nWait, but the string is t0 t0 t1 t4..., so let's see:\n\nIf NT64's expansion produces t0 followed by something, and NT96's starts with t0, then the initial part would be t0 (from NT64) and t0 (from NT96), which matches the beginning of the string.\n\nSo let's explore this path:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT84 and NT62 must expand to produce t0 and t0, etc.\n\nWait, but the first part of the string is t0 t0, so NT64 must start with t0 and NT96 must start with t0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince the string starts with 't0 t0', let's see which NTs can produce 't0'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT66 -> 't0'\n\n- NT47 -> 't1' (no)\n- NT64 can be derived, but what's its expansion? NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 can be derived, for example, into 't4', 't1', etc., but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps NT64 can produce 't0' if NT84 produces 't0' and NT62 produces 't0'\u2014but that would require NT84 and NT62 to generate 't0', which might not be the case.\n\nWait, looking at NT62: what does NT62 produce?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT62 -> 't0' directly. It must expand further. So let's check NT62's production.\n\nWait, in the grammar, many non-terminals expand to other non-terminals until they reach a terminal.\n\nLooking for NT62, in the given grammar:\n\nFrom the rules, NT68->'t0', NT26->'t3', NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-306","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. The goal is to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that, as all the rules are either producing two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see non-terminals like S, NT1, NT3, etc., and some of them produce terminals like 't0', 't1'. The start symbol is S, which produces combinations of non-terminals, leading down to terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t0 t0 t1 t4 t1 t3 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1`.\n\nSo, I think the best approach is to perform a parse using the grammar, starting from S and seeing if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me try to outline the possible steps:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the string starts with t4 (from NT64 -> t4) and t4 (from NT96 -> t4). Wait, but the string begins with t0 t0. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I need to explore other production rules.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules for NT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Similarly, NT96 -> NT54 NT53, which then produce 't2' and 't1'. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the NT64 rule: it's defined as NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Oh, and looking at NT84's rule: NT84 -> NT47 NT38, and so on. But this might get complicated quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying all possible derivations. But given the string length and the rules, this might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production rule either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal. So each step in the derivation increases the length by one (since two non-terminals combine into a terminal via a production).\n\nWait, actually, in a typical derivation, a non-terminal (like A) is replaced by two non-terminals (B and C), which could then be expanded further. So the process is like breaking down the string into smaller segments until all are terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for specific patterns in the grammar that match the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some terminals are assigned to multiple non-terminals. For example, NT47 can produce 't1' or combine to other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t0 t0 t1 t4 t1 t3 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1. Let me count the number of symbols: that's 17. Hmm, which is an odd number, but in a context-free grammar, the number of symbols can vary, as each step can introduce more symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I can start from the end of the string and work my way backwards, using a bottom-up approach. Or use the recursive descent method.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to find which production rules can generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar step by step. So starting with S, each production must match a part of the string.\n\nBut this might take a long time, so perhaps I can look for specific segments in the string that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t0 and t0. Let me check which non-terminals produce t0. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT62 -> 't0'\n- NT52 -> 't0'\n- NT22 -> 't4' (no, that's t4, not t0)\nWait, no, I think I need to look more carefully. Let me list all the terminal assignments:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\nNT77 \u2192 't2'\nNT35 \u2192 't3'\nNT78 \u2192 't0'\nNT36 \u2192 't2'\nNT54 \u2192 't1' (Wait, no, in the list, some rules say NT54 \u2192 't1', others may point to other things.

For example, NT68, NT96, NT1, NT77 (when it's 98 it's t1, 77 is t2, etc.). Hmm, but this is a bit confusing. So, each NT rule can lead to a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nSo, let's start by looking at the string: t0 t0 t1 t4 t1 t3 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1.\n\nSo, the first two terms are t0 and t0. Let me see which NT productions generate t0.\n\nLooking at NT68 \u2192 t0, NT96 \u2192 t4 (no), NT1 \u2192 t2 (no), NT77 \u2192 t2 (no), NT36 \u2192 t2 (no), NT74 \u2192 t4 (no), NT1 \u2192 t2 (no), NT48 \u2192 t1 (no), NT33 \u2192 t1 (no), NT80 \u2192 t3 (no), NT22 \u2192 t4 (no), NT82 \u2192 t4 (no), NT54 \u2192 t1 or t3 (no), NT81 \u2192 t1 (no), NT36 \u2192 t4 (no), NT77 \u2192 t3 (no), NT96 \u2192 t4 (no), NT47 \u2192 t4 (no), NT1 \u2192 t0 (yes), NT77 \u2192 t1 (no), NT4 \u2192 t1 (no), NT7 \u2192 t0 (yes).\n\nWait, so NT1 and NT7 produce t0. So the first t0 could come from either NT1 or NT7.\n\nLet's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, suppose the first t0 comes from NT1. Then, the second t0 must come from another NT that produces t0. Looking again, NT1 can produce t0, and NT7 can produce t0. So perhaps the second t0 comes from NT1 or NT7.\n\nWait, but the first rule is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which generates t4 and t4. But the string starts with t0 t0, which doesn't match. So maybe I'm wrong in thinking that S directly produces the first two symbols. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. Actually, S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the first step in the derivation is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then, each of these non-terminals must be expanded to terminals or further non-terminals, until we get the entire string.\n\nSo, it's possible that after expanding NT64 and NT96, the sequence of terminals and further expansions results in the given string.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is to have NT64 generate some symbol, and NT96 generate another, leading to the start of the string. But the given string starts with t0 t0, so perhaps each of these NT64 and NT96 must produce t0 in some way.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules for NT64"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-302","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recap what I know. Chomsky Normal Form is a specific structure where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and 'a' is a terminal. The string given is a sequence of terminals: `t0 t0 t2 t1 t4 t1 t4 t1 t2 t3 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0`. \n\nTo determine if this string is in the language, I think the right approach is to perform a derivation starting from the start symbol and see if I can reach the given string. The start symbol in the grammar is 'S', as seen in the rules: `S -> NT64 NT96`, `S -> NT97 NT7`, and `S -> NT35 NT84`.\n\nSo, the first step is to choose one of these productions for 'S' and then see if I can break down the string accordingly. Wait, but trying all possibilities might be too time-consuming because there are three initial options. Maybe a better approach is to represent the string as a series of terminals and see how they can be combined according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut first, I notice that the grammar uses non-terminals (like NT64, NT97, etc.) that expand into other non-terminals or directly into terminals. The terminals include 't0', 't1', 't2', etc., and some non-terminals are defined as 't'? For example, NT64 \u2192 't4', NT66 \u2192 't4', and so on.\n\nWait, looking at the non-terminals, some are directly linked to terminals. So perhaps the string can be decomposed into parts that correspond to these terminals. The given string has multiple 't0', 't1', etc., so I need to see how these can be built from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the start symbol's productions again:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nI'll consider each possibility.\n\nStarting with the first production: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 \u2192 't4' and NT96 \u2192 't4' because looking at the rules:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT84 \u2192 't2' (from NT84 \u2192 't2')\n- NT62 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo NT64 would expand to 't2 t0', because NT84 is 't2' and NT62 is 't0'. Then, NT96 \u2192 't4' as per the rules.\n\nWait, no, looking back: \n\nWait, for NT96, the production is NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Then:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't4' and NT53 \u2192 't2', so NT96 \u2192 't4 t2'.\n\nWait, is that so? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT96: `NT96 -> NT54 NT53`.\n\nThen, NT54 \u2192 't4' and NT53 \u2192 't2'. So NT96 \u2192 't4 t2'.\n\nSo, putting it all together, NT64 NT96 would expand to 't2 t0 t4 t2'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't0 t0 ...'. So this would give us 't2 t0 t4 t2', which doesn't match the string starting with 't0 t0', so perhaps this production isn't used here.\n\nNext, let's try the second production: S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2' because the rule is NT97 \u2192 't2'.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't0'. Checking the rules: NT7 has a rule NT7 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo, the production S \u2192 NT97 NT7 would expand directly to 't2 t0'.\n\nNow, the first two symbols in the string are 't0 t0', so this starts with 't2 t0', which doesn't match, so this production isn't the correct starting point either.\n\nNow, the third production: S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nNT35 \u2192 't3' because the rule is NT35 \u2192 't3'.\n\nNT84 \u2192 't2' because the rule is NT84 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT35 NT84 expands to 't3 t2'.\n\nComparing to the string, which starts with 't0 t0', that's a mismatch as well. So none of the initial productions seem to match the string's first parts.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake here? Because the start symbol S can only expand into two non-terminals, but the string has 17 symbols. So, that implies multiple steps are needed to expand these non-terminals into terminals until we get the entire string.\n\nBut according to the initial expansions, when S is NT35 NT84, it becomes 't3 t2', which only two symbols. So that can't be the right path because the string is longer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to read the grammar. Let me double-check. The production for NT35 is NT35 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT84 \u2192 't2'. So, S \u2192 NT35 NT84 would produce 't3 t2'. But the string is much longer, so that can't be it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem is that the initial productions for S result in only two symbols after expansion. But the string given has 17 symbols, so the expansion must go deeper.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the NT rules can expand into more non-terminals before they expand into terminals. So, the NT's that make up the initial production of S must themselves be expanded until all are terminals.\n\nSo, in S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which becomes NT64 (which is 't2 t0') and NT96 ('t4 t2'), so S \u2192 't2 t0 t4 t2', but the string starts with 't0 t0', so that's not a match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the NT's can further be broken down into more NT's. For example, in the rule for NT66, it's NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63.\n\nBut let's focus on the string: It starts with 't0 t0 ...'.\n\nLooking at the string, 't0 t0 t2 t1 t4 t1 t4 t1 t2 t3 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0'.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is more complex because some of the NT's in the first step of expansion have further productions involving other NT's.\n\nLet me start by considering that S must expand into two NT's, each of which may expand into more NT's until we get all terminals.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then, each of these NT's may have their own expansions.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 't2' (from NT84 \u2192 't2').\n\nNT62 \u2192 't0' (from NT62 \u2192 't0').\n\nSo NT64 \u2192 't2 t0'.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't4' (from NT54 \u2192 't4').\n\nNT53 \u2192 't2' (from NT53 \u2192 't2').\n\nSo NT96 \u2192 't4 t2'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT64 NT96 \u2192 't2 t0 t4 t2', which is four symbols. But the string is longer, so that can't be the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to choose a different initial production.\n\nWait, let's try another approach: Maybe the string starts with a production that requires more than one step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is to take S \u2192 NT97 NT7, which gives 't2 t0', but that doesn't match the first two 't0 t0's.\n\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84 gives 't3 t2', which doesn't match.\n\nSo, none of the direct expansions from S give the starting of the string, so perhaps S must expand into a longer sequence through multi-step productions.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, meaning all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each step replaces only one non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThus, to get from S to a string of terminals, we need to expand each non-terminal step by step. So maybe the string is the result of multiple such expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string in question is built from multiple layers of expansion, but perhaps I can look for sequences that correspond to specific NT's that expand into certain terminal sequences.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to see if the string can be broken down into segments that match the possible combinations of terminals generated"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-328","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t0 t0 t0 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t2`, and the grammar has a bunch of productions. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has all productions being either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 some terminal (if it's a single terminal, though in many cases, single terminals can be treated as A \u2192 B, but sometimes they might be A \u2192 a where a is a terminal). But looking at the grammar, I see a mix\u2014some productions go to two non-terminals, and some seem to go to a non-terminal followed by a single terminal, like NT1 -> NT5 NT77, but wait, NT1 could also have a production like NT1 -> something? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar seems to have all productions either going to two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar again. It looks like all the productions are of the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except for a few where they have something like NT47 -> 't1', which is a terminal. So the grammar allows for terminals, but all the non-terminals are binary (A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a single terminal). But in CNF, it's typically A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So that's okay.\n\nNow, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: `t0 t0 t0 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t2`.\n\nWait, but in the production rules, I need to see how many non-terminals there are and how the string is built.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nSo S is derived from NT64 and NT96. Each of these is a non-terminal, so to get to the string, these must expand into sequences of terminals and\/or non-terminals that eventually resolve to the string.\n\nI think a good approach here is to use the method of expanding the string as if it's generated by the grammar, starting from S. Maybe I can use parse trees or look for the possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, since all the productions are binary, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But I'm not sure, as I might make a mistake in implementing CYK mentally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work backwards, seeing if the last part of the string can be matched by some production.\n\nThe string is long, 18 tokens. Each step in the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols. So starting from S, which is two non-terminals, each level of derivation would increase the number of symbols by 1 (since replacing one non-terminal with two symbols). Wait, actually, in each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, so the total number of symbols increases by 1 per replacement.\n\nSince S is two non-terminals, and each replacement replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, the number of symbols grows exponentially, but perhaps it's manageable for a small string.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the number of symbols: the start symbol S is two symbols long when both NTs are on the right. Wait, no: initially, S is one non-terminal, but each production of S is two NTs. So S \u2192 NT64 NT96 has length 2, and each of these NTs can further expand.\n\nWait, the initial expansion: S is one non-symbol, so the first step is to replace it with two NTs, then each of those NTs can be replaced by two more symbols or a terminal, depending on their productions. So after one step, we have 1 (S) \u2192 2 NTs. After two steps, we can have up to 4 symbols, etc. So the number of symbols doubles each step.\n\nBut the string has 18 symbols. So perhaps it's around 5 steps or so. But this might not be the easiest approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string is generated by building a parse tree from S that results in the string. Let's try to break down the string into chunks that might match the productions.\n\nLooking for possible ways to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions. The string is:\n\nt0, t0, t0, t4, t1, t3, t1, t0, t4, t0, t1, t0, t0, t3, t2, t0, t3, t2\n\nHmm, quite a lot of t0s, t1, t3, t4, etc.\n\nLet me look at the grammar and see what some of the NTs can produce. For example:\n\nLooking at NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Wait, but NT64 might go on to produce more terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if any of the NTs match a part of the string. Let's look for NTs whose productions might generate a sequence of t's.\n\nFor example, NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. Then NT43 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 ... Not sure. Alternatively, NT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by looking for the higher-level productions that can generate a t0, since the string starts with t0 t0.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many of the productions end with a terminal. Let's list all the productions that result in a single terminal:\n\nLooking through all the grammar entries, some have -> 't0', 't1', etc. Here are some:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\nNT47 -> 't1' (Wait, so NT47 can be a terminal)\nWait, wait. Wait the grammar has multiple entries with NTxxx -> t1, t0. For example:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\nNT47 -> 't1'\nNT3 -> 't0'\nNT68 -> 't2'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT84 -> 't2'\nNT78 -> 't0'\nNT48 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT81 -> 't1'\nNT98 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't1'\nNT64 -> 't4'\nNT35 -> 't3'\nNT75 -> 't98' \u2192 but wait, actually, looking back:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the entries include:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\nNT47 -> 't1'\nNT3 -> 't0'\nNT68 -> 't2' (Wait, is that correct? Because in the initial list, NT68 has two productions: 't2' and maybe others? Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar in a rather sparse way. It seems that some non-terminals have multiple productions. For example, NT68 has:\n\nNT68 -> 't2' (Is that an option?)\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n- NT53 -> NT86 NT33\n- NT77 -> NT36 NT48\n- NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n- NT68 -> 't2'\n- NT97 -> NT43 NT75\n- NT84 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT12 -> NT82 NT48\n- NT5 -> NT68 NT3\n- NT21 -> NT52 NT60 (Wait, no, not in the data)\nWait, I think I need a more organized approach.\n\nLet me list all the NT productions with their possible RHS:\n\n1.

It's a sequence of symbols from the grammar's terminals, which are t0, t1, t2, etc. The rest are non-terminals like S, NT47, NT53, etc.\n\nThe grammar is given in CNF, which means each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. So, I'll need to see if I can derive this string starting from S by expanding the non-terminals and replacing them with terminal symbols.\n\nI'll represent the string as a list: ['t0', 't0', 't1', 't4', 't4', 't1', 't3', 't0', 't2', 't0', 't2', 't2', 't0', 't2', 't2', 't0', 't3', 't2'].\n\nThe first step is to consider the production rules that can generate the starting non-terminals.

Let me consider each possibility separately.\n\n1. Starting with S -> NT64 NT96:\n   - NT64's production leads to t4 (from the table NT64 -> 't4').\n   - NT96's production leads to t3 (from NT96 -> 't3').\n   So, the string starts with 't4 t3', but the actual string starts with 't0 t0'.

Starting with S -> NT97 NT7:\n   - NT97's production leads to t2 (from NT97 -> 't2').\n   - NT7's production leads to t2 (from NT7 -> 't2').\n   So, this production would start the string with 't2 t2', but our string starts with 't0 t0'. Hence, this production also can't generate the string.\n\n3. Starting with S -> NT35 NT84:\n   - NT35's production leads to 't3' (from NT35 -> 't3').\n   - NT84's production can either lead to 't2' or 't0' depending on its production.

So, to get a terminal symbol, it must be one of the rules that directly produce 't...' symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-345","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t0 t0 t1 t2 t1 t1 t4 t1 t1 t0 t3 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t2` and the grammar has several production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand Chomsky Normal Form to make sure I'm on the right track. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, yes, all the productions fit this form. Each non-terminal on the left is expanded into either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nNow, the string provided consists of a sequence of t0, t1, t2, etc. These terminals are the result of the grammar's production rules. So, I need to see if starting from the start symbol, which is S, I can derive this string through a series of replacements.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol S, I see S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So, the first step is to derive something that starts with NT64 and NT96. Each of these non-terminals will be expanded further. \n\nLet me break down the string. The string has 19 tokens: t0, t0, t1, t2, t1, t1, t4, t1, t1, t0, t3, t2, t2, t0, t2, t4, t0, t3, t2. Each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. The structure of the grammar suggests recursion since many non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, potentially leading to nested structures.\n\nI'll approach this by attempting to parse the string from the start, using the grammar's rules. This might get complicated because the string is quite long, so maybe I can find a pattern or see if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm could be helpful, as it's designed for CNF grammars and can determine membership in the language efficiently. However, since I'm supposed to think through it manually, I'll try a step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me start by considering the first part of the string, which begins with t0. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which non-terminals can produce t0. Looking through the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 t0, NT97 \u2192 t0, NT24 \u2192 t0, etc. So, the first step is to have one of these non-terminals produce the first t0.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t0, which is a terminal. To get a terminal, the corresponding non-terminal must produce it. So, each t in the string must be the result of a non-terminal expanding into that terminal.\n\nLet me consider the initial expansion from S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Each of these non-terminals (NT64 and NT96) must expand into sequences that start with t's. \n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So, the string will be built by NT64 followed by NT96.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t0 t0 t1 t2... So, maybe NT64 will produce the first few t's, and NT96 will produce the rest.\n\nLet's look at NT64: The rule for NT64 is \u2192 NT84 NT62. So, NT64 expands into NT84 and NT62.\n\nNow, let's look at NT84: rule is \u2192 NT4 NT1. So, NT84 becomes NT4 and NT1.\n\nNT4 (from NT4) \u2192 t1. So, NT4 produces t1. So, the first part of NT84 is t1.\n\nThen, NT1 (from NT1) \u2192 NT5 NT77. So, NT1 becomes NT5 and NT77.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t2. So, NT5 produces t2.\n\nNT77 \u2192 t3. So, NT77 produces t3.\n\nSo, combining this, NT1 \u2192 t2 t3.\n\nPutting it together, NT84 \u2192 t1 t2 t3.\n\nNow, going back to NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 t1 t2 t3 followed by NT62.\n\nSo, next is NT62. Looking at the rules, NT62 \u2192 t0. So, NT62 produces t0.\n\nSo, putting it together, NT64 \u2192 t1 t2 t3 t0.\n\nSo, the first four symbols (t0, t0, t1, t2) would not fit because NT64 starts with t1. Wait, the string starts with t0, but here, NT64 starts with t1. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I've misassigned. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the rules again. Let me look at NT68 \u2192 t0. Also, NT24 \u2192 t0. Maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Let's see what NT64 expands into.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm getting confused with the non-terminals; perhaps I should approach this as a tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the CYK algorithm approach. Let's list the terminals in the string and assign them to positions. The string is positions 0 to 18, with each being t0, t0, t1, t2, etc.\n\nBut I'm not familiar enough with the CYK algorithm to apply it right now, so I'll try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts corresponding to NT64 and NT96. So, NT64 would generate the first part, and NT96 would generate the second part.\n\nAssuming that, let's see what NT64 can generate.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t1.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t2.\n\nNT77 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo, NT84 \u2192 t1 t2 t3.\n\nNT62 \u2192 t0.\n\nSo, NT64 \u2192 t1 t2 t3 t0.\n\nSo, the first four symbols (t0, t0, t1, t2) do not fit because NT64 starts with t1 t2 t3, which is longer. So, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT64 again.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t1.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t2.\n\nNT77 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo, indeed, NT84 \u2192 t1 t2 t3.\n\nSo, NT64 \u2192 t1 t2 t3 t0. That's four t's with the sequence t1 t2 t3 t0. But the string starts with t0 t0, so this can't be the right path.\n\nTherefore, maybe S \u2192 NT97 NT7 (from the initial S options). Let me look at the other option for S.\n\nS can also be NT97 NT7. Let me see what NT97 and NT7 can produce.\n\nNT97 \u2192 t2 (from the rules), and NT7 \u2192 t0. So, if S is NT97 NT7, it would produce t2 t0.\n\nBut the string starts with t0, not t2. So, that's a conflict. So, perhaps this isn't the right path either.\n\nWait, maybe S can expand in a different way. Let me check all possible initial expansions of S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nI already considered the first option, which starts with t1 t2 t3 t0, which doesn't match the string. The second option gives t2 t0, which also doesn't match because the string starts with t0. So, maybe the third option is better.\n\nThe third option, S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nLet's see what NT35 and NT84 produce.\n\nNT35 \u2192 t3 (from the rules). So, NT35 \u2192 t3.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, and as before, NT4 \u2192 t1, NT1 \u2192 t2 t3. So, NT84 \u2192 t1 t2 t3.\n\nSo, NT35 NT84 \u2192 t3 t1 t2 t3.\n\nBut the string starts with t0 t0, so this doesn't fit. So none of the initial S expansions seem to match the string. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I have an error in my reasoning. Let me double-check the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I misassigned NT35. Looking back, the rules for NT35: it's \u2192 t3. So, NT35 produces t3. So, if S is NT35 NT84,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-347","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t0 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t1 t1 t2 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1`, and the grammar is provided with a bunch of productions.\n\nFirst off, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing manageable, maybe with something like the CYK algorithm, but I think I can approach it by trying to break down the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only terminal symbols are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', and 't7' (wait, no, looking again\u2014actually, the terminals are only 't0' through 't7', with specific rules for each). But the main thing is that each step from a non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with `t0 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t1 t1 t2 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1`. So I need to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe grammar has two initial productions for S: S \u2192 NT64 NT96 and S \u2192 NT97 NT7. So the start symbol S can generate two different sequences.\n\nLet me look at NT64 and NT96. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT62 \u2192 NT47 NT12. NT47 I see can produce some permutations, like NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which could loop back. Wait, this might get complicated, but maybe I can find chains that eventually produce terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the string is made up of t's and perhaps I can map the steps needed to derive each t. Since the terminals are only at the leaves, maybe each production chain must reduce to the terminals given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a tree and see if each node in the derivation can produce the necessary non-terminals that eventually lead to the t's.\n\nLooking at the string, I need to see if each 't' can be matched by some production that starts with t as a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each NT has a production that leads directly to a t. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74, and NT22 \u2192 t4. NT74 \u2192 t4. So NT3 could produce t4 t4, which is 't4 t4'. Alternatively, NT24 could lead to t4 t70, and so on.\n\nBut let's look at the string again: it starts with t0 t0. So two t0's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t0.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0' (twice: once in NT68 as 't0' and again in NT68 \u2192 ...)\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\nNT63 \u2192 't1' (wait, no, looking again: NT66 \u2192 't4', NT74 \u2192 't4', but looking down, under NTx, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2' (Wait, looking at the grammar again: under NT3, it's \"NT3 -> 't2'\", so when NT3 is at the top, it can't produce t0. Hmm.)\n\nWait, let me go through each production and find which NTs can produce t0, t1, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t2 (so no t0)\n- NT68 \u2192 t0 (twice: NT68->t0)\n- NT97 \u2192 t2, t0, t1, etc., but at the bottom we have NT97->'t2', 't0', etc. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the structure, for NTx, the productions sometimes go to terminals and sometimes to other non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT3 -> NT22 NT74\nNT74 -> t4\n\nSo NT3 can produce two NTs which then further split until we get terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to reconstruct the possible steps.\n\nFor each 't' in the string, we need to see if it can be produced by some NT with a production that includes that terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nt0 can be produced by NT68\u2192t0, or by NT97, which under some productions can eventually produce t0. Wait, the production for NT97 is:\n\nNT97 \u2192 nt47 nt75, NT75 \u2192 nt98 nt26, and so on, but one of the productions for NT97 is NT97->t2, which isn't t0.

{"custom_id":"request-367","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of CFGs where every production rule is of the form:\n- A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols.\n- A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nThis structure simplifies the grammar, making it easier to analyze, especially for parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since this problem is more about determining string generation, I might not need to get that deep into parsing techniques.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the production rules are either of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 terminal. So, each non-terminal breaks down into two other non-terminals or a terminal symbol. The terminals are given as 't0', 't1', etc., and some non-terminals seem to be terminals as well, like NT68 -> 't0', NT97 -> 't2', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t1 t1 t0 t3 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t0`.\n\nThis string has 20 tokens, all of which are terminals ('t0's, 't1's, etc.). My task is to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to model this as a parsing problem, using the structure of the grammar to see if the string can be broken down according to the rules. Since all productions are in CNF, each step would produce two terminals at most, and the parsing can be done level by level.\n\nLet me sketch out how I can approach this mentally. The top-level production in the grammar is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So, S produces two non-terminals: NT64 and NT96. Each of these non-terminals can further break down.\n\nLooking at NT64's production: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Similarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nSo, the string starts with t0's, which correspond to NT64 \u2192 t0 and NT96 \u2192 t0. Wait, no. Let me check the rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT68 \u2192 't0', NT77 \u2192 't3', etc. Wait, in the rules, some non-terminals are terminals:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT3 \u2192 't0'\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n- NT86 \u2192 't0'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n- NT98 \u2192 't0'\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT78 \u2192 't0'\n- NT36 \u2192 't2'\n- NT54 \u2192 't4' (Wait, no. Looking back: NT54 \u2192 't1' or 't3'? Let me check.)\n\nWait, looking at the rules again:\n\n- NT54: some entries are NT54 \u2192 't4', others like NT54 \u2192 't1' or 't3'. Wait, perhaps each production is only one rule. Let me parse that carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each NT has multiple production rules, right? Because the grammar is in CNF, with left-hand sides being a single non-terminal, and every rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. CNF requires that every production is of length 1, so a single non-terminal on the left, and on the right, either one terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, actually, I might have confused something. Wait, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but the initial and intermediate steps can have longer right-hand sides? No, no, in CNF, each production is exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, a production like NT \u2192 NT1 NT2 is allowed, but a production with more than two non-terminals is not, unless you have intermediate steps that break it down further.\n\nBut in our case, all non-terminals in the grammar seem to be defined with productions that split into two parts. So perhaps the entire grammar is such that any non-terminal can be expanded into two other non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut regardless, the string given is entirely made up of terminals, so each part of the string must result from the expansion of some non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of 20 t0's, t1's, etc. So I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the initial production. The start symbol is S, which produces NT64 and NT96.\n\nSo, from S, we get two non-terminals: NT64 and NT96.\n\nLooking at NT64's productions, it can produce NT84 and NT62. Similarly, NT96 produces NT54 and NT53.\n\nNow, we need to expand these further.\n\nLet me try to see what each of these non-terminals produce.\n\nNT84: The rules for NT84 include several options:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\n\nNT4 is not defined in the provided rules, so perhaps I need to check if it's a terminal or non-terminal. Looking through the rules, there's no NT4, except one rule: NT4 -> 't1'. Wait, no.\n\nLooking through all the rules for NT4, it seems that NT4 is only in one rule: NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, NS's rules show NT48\u2192t1, etc. So wait, maybe NT4 itself doesn't have any production, meaning it's a terminal. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nBut I don't see any production for NT4 besides perhaps in another production. Wait, perhaps I didn't list all rules, but from the given, the only rule involving NT4 is NT48 \u2192 t1. So, maybe NT4 is a terminal symbol with value t1.\n\nWait, no, some rules like NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, so NT47 isn't a terminal. But others like NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77, so NT1 is also a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a comprehensive list of all the non-terminals and their possible productions so I can see what options are available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree step by step, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nGiven the string is 20 tokens, it's a bit long, but maybe there's a pattern or something that allows us to see if the string can be broken down into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has to be split into a binary tree structure where each node has exactly two children until we reach the terminal symbols.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched to a production's terminal, and each non-terminal can be split into parts that can produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nWait, but the string is all t0's and some other t's. So perhaps the string is made up of t0's and other t's, and I need to see if each can correspond to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me check which non-terminals produce which t's.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce t's:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0', 't3', 't4', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't0', 't2'\n- NT97 \u2192 't1', 't2', 't0'\n- NT86 \u2192 t0\n- NT77 \u2192 t3\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT84 \u2192 t2, t4\n- NT54 \u2192 t1\n- NT33 \u2192 t1\n- NT66 \u2192 t4\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT47 \u2192 t4, perhaps. Wait, looking at the rules for NT47: there are multiple.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Perhaps a better approach is to see if the grammar can produce the given string in terms of the number of symbols and the arrangement.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of non-terminals and terminals when expanding.\n\nWait, the initial expansion from S is two non-terminals: NT64 and NT96. Each of these will expand into two more non-terminals each, so S can generate four symbols in the next step, each of which could be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string provided has 20 terminals. Since the grammar only has one start symbol, S, which expands into two non-terminals, each of which may expand further.\n\nSo, the production steps will work as follows:\n\nEach step, non-terminals are replaced by two symbols (either two non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal, but wait, no\u2014each production rule is either two non-terminals or a single terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of several production rules, and some of them directly map to 't's with specific indices. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the production rules to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which has the following productions:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these intermediate symbols (NT64, NT96, etc.) can be broken down further into other NT symbols until reaching the terminal symbols 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nLooking at the production rules that directly produce 't's:\n\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63\n- NT70 -> NT84 NT36\n- NT26 -> NT3 NT24\n- NT54 -> NT84 NT86\n- NT84 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT47 -> NT21 NT3\n- NT17 -> ... (Wait, I don't see this in the rules. Maybe it's a typo. Oh, the rules go up to NT97. Let me double-check. Wait, the user only provided some rules. Maybe I need to list all the rules again to make sure.)\n\nWait, the rules provided include:\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\nNT70 -> NT84 NT36\nNT26 -> NT3 NT24\nNT54 -> NT84 NT86\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\nNT17 isn't there. Oh wait, looking back, the initial production for S has NT3, which then goes to NT22 NT74, etc. I should go step by step.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of t's with indices. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits the string into exactly two parts, so the derivation tree must be a binary tree. The entire string should be reachable by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to model the productions as a pushdown automaton, but maybe a better way is to consider the string as a sequence of t's and see if it can be split according to the grammar rules.\n\nEach non-terminal (NT) production splits into two non-terminals, each of which can further split until we reach the terminals. So, the sequence of t's must align with the splits according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can try to find a parse tree for the string according to the grammar. Let's attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t2 t1 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1\n\nThat's 21 t's. Let's see how they can be split.\n\nStart with S, which must produce two symbols. Looking at the production rules, S has three possible branches, but each starts with NT64, NT97, NT35. For example, S -> NT64 NT96. So the first two symbols would be NT64 and NT96. But let's see, the first t in the string is t0, so NT64 must derive to a string starting with t0.\n\nLooking at NT64: from the rules, NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT64 leads to NT84 and NT62.\n\nNow, NT84 has two options: NT84 can go to NT4 NT1 or to itself. Wait, no: looking back, NT84 -> NT4 NT1. So NT84 is directly mapped to t4 and NT1.\n\nNT62: according to the rules, NT62 -> NT47 NT12 or NT22. Wait, no: the rules include NT62 -> NT47 NT12 or NT33 NT96? Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking back, the rules include:\n\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n- NT47 -> NT21 NT3\n- NT12 -> NT82 NT48\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list, including:\n\nNT62 -> NT22 NT63\nWait, let me check the rules again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63\n- NT70 -> NT84 NT36\n- NT26 -> NT3 NT24\n- NT54 -> NT84 NT86\n- NT84 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT47 -> NT21 NT3\n- NT1 -> NT5 NT77\n- NT48 -> t1\n- NT33 -> t1\n- NT54 -> t3\n- NT81 -> t1\n- NT36 -> t2\n- NT77 -> t3\n- NT96 -> t4\n- NT47 -> t4\n- NT1 -> t0\n- NT77 -> t1\n- NT4 -> t1\n- So on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's focus on the productions needed for NT64 and NT96.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT64 and NT96. Let's track the first t0 in the string. If S starts with NT64, then NT64 must produce a sequence starting with t0. Looking at NT64's production: NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84's production is NT4 NT1.\n\nSo NT84 leads to NT4 and NT1. Let's see NT4: from the rules, NT4 isn't listed, but looking back, the rules include NT4 in one of the productions?\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, let me see.

{"custom_id":"request-381","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means that all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It has a start symbol S, which can produce different combinations of NTs. For example, S can be NT64 NT96, or NT23 NT3, wait no, looking again, actually S can be NT64 NT96, S can be NT97 NT7, or S can be NT35 NT84. Wait, no, that can't be right because NT97 is a non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nWait, but then I see more rules. Some of the rules are like NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3, or NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. Then, some of the non-terminals seem to resolve to terminals like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, but then NT63 is a non-terminal that apparently goes to NT68 and NT62. Wait, but in the end, some non-terminals resolve directly to 't0', 't1', etc. So a lot of the rules end with 't0' or 't1', like NT68 \u2192 't0', NT97 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of t0, t1, etc. I think each of these is a terminal, right? So the string is a series of terminals, each representing a single token or step from the grammar.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding rules correctly. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step increases the length by one. So the string starts with S being two non-terminals, but wait, no: S in the grammar does produce two non-terminals, like NT64 NT96. So the string has 20 tokens, which is quite long, so that suggests that the derivation must be several steps.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S can only directly produce two non-terminals, leading to strings of length 2. Then, each of those can be further expanded. But this string has 20 tokens. Let me think about how the derivation progresses.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar either expands to two other non-terminals or to a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, any string generated must have a length that's 2^k + 1 or something? Wait, no, because each step can take a single non-terminal and expand it into two, so starting from S, which is two non-terminals, then each of those can be split, etc. So the length grows as 2^depth or so. \n\nBut in this case, the string is 20 symbols long, which suggests that it's a longer derivation. Each production step increases the number of symbols. So, perhaps the depth is such that the number of symbols generated is equal to the given string's length.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. For a grammar in CNF, the maximum length of a string is 2^k, where k is the number of non-terminal splittings. For example, starting with S, which is two symbols, to get down to terminals, each step splits a non-terminal into two, so the number of symbols doubles each time.\n\nBut 20 is not a power of two, so maybe the string can't be generated. Alternatively, perhaps the starting symbols can split in a way that the total number of symbols adds up correctly. But actually, each production step in CNF adds one level, not necessarily the entire string, so it's possible to reach 20 symbols if the structure allows it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar has certain rules that allow the tokens to appear in a certain order, and the string in question can be formed by a correct sequence of productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t0 t0 t0 t4 t1 t3 t2 t2 t4 t0 t1 t1 t4 t1 t0 t1 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1. That's 21 tokens, but the start symbol S produces two symbols initially. So wait, the initial S produces two, then each non-terminal can produce two or a terminal, but the string is longer. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, actually, the given string is 21 tokens. Let me count: \n\n1. t0\n2. t0\n3. t0\n4. t4\n5. t1\n6. t3\n7. t2\n8. t2\n9. t4\n10. t0\n11. t1\n12. t1\n13. t4\n14. t1\n15. t0\n16. t1\n17. t4\n18. t0\n19. t3\n20. t4\n21. t1.\n\nSo 21 symbols. Starting from S, each step can generate two symbols, but the total number doesn't have to be a power of two because some non-terminals might resolve to terminals, thus ending that branch.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, the start symbol S produces two non-terminals. Each of those can be either replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal. But in our case, looking at the given string, all the tokens are terminals (they start with 't'), so the entire string must be a result of replacing non-terminals until we reach all terminals.\n\nSo if the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT1 NT2, each of NT1 and NT2 would need to be replaced by sequences of terminals, so the string would be built by expanding each non-terminal into a list of terminals. Given that, the overall structure of the string would be determined by the hierarchy of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be divided into substrings where each part corresponds to a tree of replacements.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to see if each consecutive 't' in the string can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model the string as a derivation, but since the string is 21 symbols, and the grammar starts with two, each step could split a non-terminal into two more, but with some non-terminals not splitting further, leading to the tokenization.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down into a tree structure where each split corresponds to a non-terminal replacement. Let's try to parse it step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t0 and t0. So perhaps the first non-terminal is an NT that expands to 't0 t0'. Looking at the grammar, 't0' appears as the result of certain non-terminals. For example, NT97 \u2192 't2'? Wait, no, looking back, I see NT77 \u2192 't2' and NT97 \u2192 't2', but also some others.\n\nWait, wait. Let me list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT10 \u2192 (Wait, does the grammar have NT10?) Hmm, looking again, I see:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nWait, in the initial list, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3' (Wait, perhaps a typo. Let me check.)\n\nWait, in the rules provided:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' \u2192 Wait, that can't be because a non-terminal can't produce two different terminals. So maybe it's a typo, but perhaps not. Let me check.\n\nWait, the list seems to have multiple entries for NT68. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Probably a mistake, but perhaps only one is active. Or maybe some are to be considered, so perhaps in the actual grammar, each production is either one or the other, not both. Let me clarify.\n\nI think that's a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules carefully.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- Then again, NT68 \u2192 't3' later on.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the non-terminal NT68 can produce either 't0' or 't3' or both. Wait, but in Chomsky normal form, a non-terminal can have only one production rule for each possible left-hand side. So perhaps that's a mistake here, maybe they meant to write 't3' as a single rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct list is:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nAnother rule is NT68 \u2192 't3'? That might not make sense unless the grammar is ambiguous and allows for both.

{"custom_id":"request-410","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t1 t0 t1 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a CFG in Chomsky normal form produces symbols in a tree-like structure, and each rule is production where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. To determine if the string is generated, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing with such grammars.\n\nBut before diving into the algorithm, maybe I can analyze the grammar's structure a bit. Let's list out the production rules and terminals:\n\nThe terminals are listed as strings of 't' followed by numbers, like 't0', 't1', etc., up to 't96', but not all are present in the string. The production rules are as follows:\n\n- S -> NT64 NT96\n- S -> NT97 NT7\n- S -> NT35 NT84\n\nWait, but hold on, the grammar starts with S having three options, but looking at the productions, it seems that S is the start symbol and the first three lines are the productions for S. Hmm, no, wait, no, actually, the user presented the grammar as several lines, starting with S -> NT64 NT96, then S -> NT97 NT7, etc. But that can't be right because S shouldn't have two production rules. Alternatively, perhaps the user inputted multiple production rules for S? Or perhaps it's a mistake.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Each line after the grammar starts is a production rule. So, in the input, the first line after \"Grammar:\" is S -> NT64 NT96, then the next lines are other production rules for S? But that would mean S can have multiple productions, which is allowed in CFG. So, the start symbol S can produce any of these options.\n\nBut looking at the provided productions, I see lines like NT47 -> NT21 NT3, which is a production for NT47. Then all the longer rules. It's a large grammar, but perhaps the key is to see which paths lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nBut perhaps instead of going into the entire parsing process, which would be time-consuming, I can think about the possible derivations starting from S.\n\nThe given string has 21 symbols, so the parse tree must have a height such that the number of symbols at the leaves matches 21. Each production in the grammar either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, starting from S, each step increases the number of symbols by one (if replacing with two non-terminals) or decreases if replacing with a terminal. Wait, but the total number of symbols in the string is 21, which is an odd number. Since each production from a non-terminal either adds one (from 1 to 2) or replaces with a terminal (so, 1 to 1, but in that case, it's a terminal, not a non-terminal).\n\nWait, no, each production applies to a single non-terminal and replaces it with two symbols. So, starting from S, each derivation step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, increasing the total count by one.\n\nSo, the initial string from S is just S (count 1). Then, after one step, it's replaced by two symbols. After n steps, the number of symbols would be 1 + n. So, the final string has 21 symbols, meaning n = 20 steps. So, each step adds one symbol, so the derivation must have 20 steps.\n\nBut that's just the count of steps. Now, each symbol eventually must be replaced by terminals, so all symbols except the start symbol S must eventually turn into terminals.\n\nWait, but for each production, we have to check if both left and right symbols can eventually produce terminals. So, perhaps each NT production eventually leads to a terminal, and we can build this parse tree.\n\nBut another way is to map the string to a sequence of terminals that can be generated by the grammar. Let's look at the given string: `t0 t0 t1 t0 t1 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1`.\n\nThat's 21 tinals. To see if this can be generated by the grammar, perhaps I can see if the derivations result in such a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if each 't' can be derived from some NT in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are 't0' through 't97' etc. The rules for each NT eventually replace them with terminals, so let's see which NTs produce which 't's.\n\nLooking through the production rules, several NTs eventually go to 't's:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0' (from NT3 production rules)\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT66 -> 't4'\n- NT21 -> 't4' (though I'm not sure, looking at NT21's production, it goes to NT52 and NT63, both of which go to other NTs that don't directly produce 't's? Hmm, need to check more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a mapping from each NT to the 't' it produces.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\nNT5 -> 't2'\nNT1 -> 't2'\nNT7 -> 't0'\nNT98 -> 't1'\nNT24 -> 't3'\nNT33 -> 't1'\nNT54 -> 't4'\nNT62 -> 't0'\nNT77 -> 't3'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT7 -> 't0'\nNT14 -> 't3' (since NT14 -> NT33 NT27, and 33->'t1', 27->'t4'; wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe some NTs go deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a mapping for each NT to the 't's it can produce. Alternatively, perhaps each NT eventually leads to a particular 't'.\n\nWait, NT3 -> 't0', directly. Similarly:\n\nLooking at NT5: NT5 goes to NT68 and NT3, so 68->'t4', 3->'t0', so NT5-> 't4' and 't0'? Or does 5 replace in a way that can produce multiple 't's?\n\nWait, perhaps each NT can only produce one 't' in the end. So, I need to check for each NT what's the 't' it ends with.\n\nLet me go through each NT:\n\n- NT3: 't0'\n- NT1: 't2'\n- NT48: 't1'\n- NT97: 't2' (as per the given rules)\nWait, looking at the given rules:\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\n\nNT1 -> 't2'\n\nNT48 -> 't1'\n\nNT21: looking at its production, NT21-> NT52 NT63, both NT52 and 63 are terminals. NT52 -> 't2', NT63->'t1'. So NT21 produces t2 and t1, but in the production, can it replace to both? Not sure.\n\nWait, but in context-free grammars, each production is a rule that replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols. So, a production like A -> BC means A can be replaced by BC. But in the given rules, some NTS (like NT47) have multiple productions, but each is a replacement with two other NTS.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT47 can be replaced by NT21 NT3 or others, but in the given grammar, I think each has different production rules. So, for NT21, the production is NT21-> NT52 NT63. So, NT21 can produce 't2' and 't1' in one step, but how? Because both NT52->'t2' and NT63->'t1' are production rules.\n\nSo, when you expand NT21, it becomes NT52 NT63, which then becomes 't2' followed by 't1', making the string segment 't2 t1'. Similarly, other NTS can produce specific 't's.\n\nSimilarly, other NTS:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62. Let's see: NT84 -> 't2' and NT62->'t0'. So, NT64-> 't2 t0'.\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53. NT54->'t4', NT53-> 't2'. So, NT96-> 't4 t2'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, sometimes we have 't4 t4' which isn't matching any of these. Wait, maybe I need to check all possible transitions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go step by"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Alternatively, since it's a small string, I can try to see if there's a plausible way to derive it.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the maximum depth of the string is 22 symbols, and each step splits into two, the derivation tree could have a certain structure. Maybe it's easier to look for the order in which non-terminals are used.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the start symbol S and see how it can produce the string.

Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the rules, it says:\n\nNT77 -> 't2'\n\nWait, but earlier in the mapping, it said NT77 -> 't2' or 't1'? Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the rules provided, under NT77:\n\n\"NT77 -> 't2'\"\n\nSo earlier, the initial mapping for NT77 was 't2'.\n\nSo NT98 \u2192 t0\nNT68 \u2192 t0\nNT80 \u2192 t3? Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nWait, NT98 \u2192 't0' because in the rules, I see:\n\n\"NT98 -> 't0'\"\n\nSimilarly, NT68 \u2192 't0', right?\n\nYes, in the rules, NT68 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo, the initial t in the string is t0, so the first NT must be either NT98 or NT68.\n\nAlright, let's consider this as the first step.\n\nOption 1: NT98 \u2192 't0'\n\nOption 2: NT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nLet me choose Option 1 first. Assume the first NT is NT98.\n\nThen, the string becomes after consuming the first t0: remaining is t0, t0, t4, t4, t4, t1, t4, t0, t2, t0, t0, t4, t0, t0, t2, t0, t0, t4, t0, t3, t2.\n\nSo, the production for NT98 is NT47 \u2192 't2'? Wait no, wait, NT98 is a terminal, so according to the grammar, S can have NT97 or NT35.\n\nWait, sorry, the initial step is S \u2192 NT98 NT35 perhaps? Let me check the rules.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar for S has three options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, if we take S \u2192 NT98, but NT98 is not directly an option for S; instead, perhaps NT98 is part of another production. Wait, no, NT98 is a separate non-terminal. So, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t0, which can be generated by either NT98 or NT68.

{"custom_id":"request-425","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of t0s and t1s: `t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t1 t4 t0 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t4 t4 t1 t4 t3 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. The grammar has several non-terminals (like S, N, T47, etc.) and some terminals (t0, t1, t2, etc.).\n\nThe string starts with t0, t0, t0. I need to see if the grammar can produce three t0s at the beginning. Looking at the grammar, the terminals are defined in terms of non-terminals or themselves. For example, NT3 -> 't0' and NT68 -> 't4'. But t0 and t1 are terminals, so any derivation ending in a terminal will have that rule.\n\nSo, maybe the string is built by expanding S into non-terminals that then resolve to these terminals, one after the other. Since the string is length 23, the derivation would have to go through S and expand into several non-terminals until it reaches the 23 terminals.\n\nWait, the provided grammar's terminals are specific strings like NT3->t0, but others are non-terminals. So each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with either another non-terminal or a terminal. So for the string to be generated, each terminal in the string must correspond to some production rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few t0s. Since NT3 -> t0, any place where t0 appears can come from NT3. Similarly, NT68->t4, which could be used to produce t4.\n\nBut the key is to see if the sequence can be built by applying the productions step by step. However, with a 23-length string, it's time-consuming to track each step manually. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to see if all the terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking more closely, the first production is S->NT64 NT96. So starting with S, we get NT64 and NT96. Then each of these can be split further.\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62, NT96-> NT54 NT53.\n\nLooking at NT84, it can produce t2 or further non-terminals. NT54 can produce t2 or NT68 which can go to t4 or others.\n\nBut since the string starts with t0, I wonder if any of these non-terminals produce t0. Looking at the productions, NT3->t0, but that's one step back. So to have a t0 at the start, we'd need a way for the leftmost non-terminal to expand to t0, or a chain leading to it.\n\nWait, S is NT64 NT96. So if we expand NT64 to NT84 NT62, and NT96 to NT54 NT53. Then we need to see if any of these further expand to t0.\n\nFor example, NT84 can go to t2 or t2, etc. Wait, looking at NT84, the productions are: NT84->NT4 NT1, NT4 is production NT4->t1, so NT84 could go to t1 t1, which is t1 t1, which isn't in the string but maybe not the start. Alternatively, NT84->t2, which is another terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT54->t1, so if NT54 is in the string, it would expand to t1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the entire string. Let's see how each terminal can come from the non-terminals.\n\nt0 can come from NT3, t1 from NT1, t2 from NT7, etc.\n\nSo the first few t0s: could they come from NT3. Let's check if S can produce NT3.\n\nLooking at S-> NT64 NT96. To get a 't0', perhaps one of these non-terminals needs to derive a 't0'. Let's see:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62. NT84 can produce t2 directly. NT62 is 't0'. So NT64 can produce t2 t0. But in the string, after t0 t0 t0, maybe NT64 is splitting into something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the string as a sequence of terminals, each of which is produced by some non-terminal via a production rule. So the entire string can be generated if there's a way for S to expand into the sequence of terminals through intermediate non-terminals.\n\nBut this would involve a lot of steps. Maybe I can think of the string in terms of the number of transitions and possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a pushdown automaton, but that's complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the starting non-terminals can derive into sequences that can lead to the given string. For example, S-> NT64 NT96. So NT64 and NT96 each produce something. Then each of those can be expanded further.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to check if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, terminals include t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, etc. The given string has t0, t1, t2, t3, and t4, t5. Wait, in the string, is t5 present? Let me count the terminals: t0, t0, t0, t1, t4, t1, t4, t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t1, t4, t4, t1, t4, t3, t2, t2, t0, t3, t2.\n\nWait, the string has t5, but looking through the grammar, the terminals are up to t86, but I don't see any production that directly produces t5. For example, NT53->t2, NT54->t1, NT52->t2, etc. So in the given string, we have t5 mentioned in some productions like NT1->t2, but t5 itself doesn't appear in the string.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the string uses t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, but perhaps t5 is not present. So that's fine; as long as the grammar can produce the string's terminals, it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t5 is a non-terminal that produces other terminals. For example, if t5 is part of a non-terminal that expands to t0, t1, etc., but in the given string, it's not present as a terminal. So no problem there.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see NT5->t2, which is useful. So perhaps t5 is not required in the string.\n\nAnother thing is that in the grammar, NT70->t0 and others. So in the string, we have multiple t0s, which could come from NT3 or NT70.\n\nSo trying to map the string to the grammar, each terminal is produced by some non-terminal. For example, the first t0 could be from NT3 or NT70, the next t0 from another NT, etc.\n\nBut given the sequence, perhaps it's possible to find a derivation path. For instance, S->NT64 NT96. NT64->NT84 NT62. NT96->NT54 NT53.\n\nThen, NT84->t2 or other possibilities. Wait, but in the string, after the first three t0s, comes t1. So maybe one side leads to t0 and the other to t1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string represents a left-to-right expansion, with S branching into multiple non-terminals that eventually produce the required terminals.\n\nBut without a concrete step-by-step derivation, it's hard to be certain. However, given that the string only contains terminals that are present in the grammar, and that each terminal has a production rule, it's theoretically possible that the string can be generated.\n\nWait, but I might have missed some terminals. Let me check all terminals in the string:\n\nThe string is: t0, t0, t0, t1, t4, t1, t4, t0, t0, t2, t2, t0, t1, t4, t4, t1, t4, t3, t2, t2, t0, t3, t2.\n\nSo it includes t0, t1, t2, t3, t4. Do these terminals exist in the grammar? Yes, each is listed as a terminal in the grammar (like NT68->'t0', etc.), so each has a production rule.\n\nTherefore, the grammar can produce any sequence of these terminals, provided there's a valid way to expand S into the sequence. Since all the required terminal symbols are present, and S can split into NT64 and NT96,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-429","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing manageable, although parsing a CNF grammar can sometimes be tricky.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the rules are non-terminals expanding into two other non-terminals. Then there are some rules where rules end with a terminal, like NT68 \u2192 't0'. Those are our terminal productions, which are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t1 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t1 t2 t0 t3 t1 t4 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string. I need to see if I can build this string starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which according to the first two rules can produce NT64 NT96 or NT97 NT7, etc. Let me list the main productions from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nWait, so S spawns two non-terminals, each of which needs to be expanded into more symbols. It looks like the grammar is binary, each step splitting into two, so the entire derivation will be a binary tree, and the string will be the leaves in order.\n\nI need to see if the given string can be derived from S using these productions. Given that, perhaps a leftmost or rightmost derivation approach could work, but it might get complicated with so many rules. Alternatively, maybe building a parse tree is possible, but that would be tedious.\n\nAnother approach is to assign types or labels to the string positions, tracking which symbols can appear next based on the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a way to split the string into possible components that match the grammar's terminals.\n\nLet me list all the terminal symbols in the grammar to know what characters are allowed:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t6, t7... Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT54 \u2192 't4', NT64 \u2192 't4', NT12 \u2192 't3', etc. The terminals are:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t3, t4. So the string is composed of these terminals. The string given uses t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, and nothing else. That\u2019s fine because all are present in the grammar.\n\nNow, let's see the string again: t0 t0 t1 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t1 t2 t0 t3 t1 t4 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0.\n\nThat's 23 symbols. Since each production (except the terminals) inserts two symbols, a valid derivation would need to have a structure that leads to an odd number of symbols. Wait, the number of symbols:\n\nEach S \u2192 NT X (each X is a non-terminal), then each X \u2192 NT Y, etc., until a terminal. Each step doubles the number of symbols because each production is binary. Wait, actually, when you replace a non-terminal with two others, the total number of symbols can change. Maybe I should consider the length.\n\nWait, when starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, after one step, you have two non-terminals. Each replacement of a non-terminal adds one more symbol. Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me think differently.\n\nEach production replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals increases by one each time. But terminals are leaves. Each step could potentially lead to expansion, but the total number of symbols is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would help, but manually that's going to take a long time. Another idea is to see if we can find a path from S to the string by trying to match the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to reverse-engineer the string by grouping the symbols into possible expansion sequences.\n\nLet me see if any of the terminals in the string can correspond to only one production rule.\n\nLooking at the rules, some terminals are produced by only one rule each:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0' (only one rule)\nNT64 \u2192 't4'\nNT96 \u2192 't4'\nNT47 \u2192 't4'\nNT12 \u2192 't3'\nNT3 -> 't0', 't2', etc. Wait, more than one.\n\nWait, let me list each terminal and their possible sources:\n\nt0: NT68, NT64, NT96, NT74, NT5, NT1, NT3, NT33, NT54, NT97, NT47, NT68 (there are duplicates, but each is a rule that yields t0)\nt1: NT96, NT98, NT77, NT33, NT68, NT74, NT47, NT97, NT86, NT68\nt2: NT26, NT52, NT74, NT77, NT97, NT14, NT98, NT47, NT68, NT22, NT52, NT74, NT36, NT27\nt3: NT24, NT38, NT34, NT21, NT52, NT53, NT54, NT...\nt4: NT47, NT1, NT21, NT33, NT35, NT22, NT39, NT70, NT84, NT63, NT78, NT80, NT81, NT70, NT80, NT22, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps instead of trying to list all, it's better to see if the string can be segmented into sequences that match production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into components where each component is a possible expansion path.\n\nLet me try to break the string into possible pairs starting from the beginning.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt0 t0 t1 t1 t4 t1 t3 t0 t1 t2 t0 t3 t1 t4 t4 t1 t3 t4 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0.\n\nLet me try to see if I can split this into smaller chunks that correspond to possible non-terminals.\n\nSuppose I start with the first 't0'. According to the grammar, t0 can be derived from NT68, NT64, NT96, etc. So the first 't0' might come from one of these.\n\nThen the next symbol is 't0', which could come from a different rule. But perhaps the string can be split into two parts: the first 't0' and the second 't0' each derived from different start non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, the start symbol is S, which has to eventually expand to the whole string. So the entire string must be built from S, which expands into two non-terminals, each of which expands into two non-terminals, and so on, until terminals are reached.\n\nAn alternative idea: since the string's length is 23, which is an odd number, and each expansion step from S adds one to the number of non-terminals, starting from 1 (S), then 2, then 3, etc. The final count of symbols would be a power of 2, but here 23 is not a power of 2. Hmm, but that can't be right because the number of terminal symbols may not have to be a power of two, because multiple non-terminals can expand to the same symbols.\n\nWait, maybe that's not a reliable approach. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother idea is to consider the string as a sequence generated by S. Let's attempt to parse it with a top-down approach, recursively splitting the string into left and right parts.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Each of these produces two non-terminals, which themselves can split further.\n\nLet me pick one option: suppose S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nThen, the first part would be the expansion of NT64, followed by NT96. Let's see what NT64 and NT96 can expand into.\n\nLooking up NT64 \u2192 't4' (from NT64\u2192 NT24? Wait no, looking back: NT64 \u2192 NT52 NT63 (from the rules given), but there's a rule NT64 \u2192 't4'? Yes, under NT64: NT64 \u2192 't4' (from the rules). Similarly, looking at NT96 \u2192 't4'? Yes, NT96 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, but if S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then the entire string must come from NT64 followed by NT96.\n\nBut if NT64 \u2192 't4' and NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

My goal is to see if the provided string can be derived by expanding the grammar until only terminals remain.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of 't's and numbers, which I believe are terminal symbols, but I'm a bit confused because the grammar has some terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. I need to be careful about how these terminals combine. For example, when the grammar has rules like S -> NT64 NT96, both NT64 and NT96 need to resolve to terminals or more non-terminals that eventually lead to the required terminals in the string.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules and terminals:\n\nThe grammar starts with S and has several production rules, many of which involve non-terminals like NT47, NT1, etc. Some of these non-terminals directly produce a terminal symbol, like NT66 -> 't4', NT64 -> 't4', etc. So, the steps involve expanding S until I can get a sequence that matches the target string.\n\nLooking at the string: `t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t2 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t3 t2 t1 t1`.\n\nThat's 24 tokens. The grammar's initial production is S -> NT64 NT96, which, in the grammar, seems to have some possible values. Wait, let me check the production rules again because sometimes the same non-terminal can have multiple options.\n\nFrom the grammar, S has three options:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nBut looking at the grammar in more detail, I see that NT64 is defined as NT84 NT62, which itself is produced by 't4'. Similarly, NT96 is 't4' as per one of the rules. So if I choose the first production for S, NT64 would produce 't4' and NT96 would produce 't4', giving S as t4 t4, which is 't0 t0'.\n\nBut the string starts with t0 t0 t0 t1, so that might not be the correct path. Alternatively, the second production for S is NT97 and NT7. NT97 is 't2' according to the rule NT97 -> 't2', and NT7 is 't2' as per NT7 -> 't2'. So S would become t2 t2, which starts with t2 t2, but the string starts with t0 t0, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. The grammar might have more options for NT64 and NT96 beyond the direct terminals. Let me check the NT64 and NT96 productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT66 -> NT52 NT63\n- NT64 -> NT84 NT62\n- NT53 -> NT86 NT33\n- NT7 -> NT66 NT48\n- NT33 -> NT84 NT81\n- NT38 -> NT34 NT27\n- NT12 -> NT82 NT48\n- NT5 -> NT68 NT3\n- NT38 -> NT63 NT96\n- NT14 -> NT33 NT27\n- NT96 -> NT54 NT53\n- NT39 -> NT70 NT39\n- NT24 -> NT38 NT70\n- NT98 -> NT78 NT14\n- NT47 -> NT1 NT62 \u2192 but wait, there's another rule for NT47: NT47 -> NT1 NT62, but also another rule earlier?\n\nWait, I might have misread. Let me look again:\n\nNT47 has two rules:\n- NT47 -> NT1 NT62\n- NT47 -> NT1 NT62 \u2192 Hmm, wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT47, the production is listed as:\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\nand another line:\n- NT47 -> NT62 NT1.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me look at the entire grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nBTW, parsing such a large grammar manually might be time-consuming, so perhaps I should start by seeing if the target string can be broken down into segments matching the nullable terminals of the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me note all the terminal symbols in the grammar: 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', etc.\n\nOur target string has 't0's, 't1's, 't2's, 't3's, and 't4's.

{"custom_id":"request-450","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of 't' tokens, but I guess each 't' is like a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. CNF is a form of CFG where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. In this grammar, every non-terminal seems to produce exactly two non-terminals except for S which produces two non-terminals, which themselves are probably further decomposed.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT64 NT96 is the top-level rule. So the starting symbol is S, and each of those non-terminals will need to be expanded until we reach the terminals 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t3 t0`. That's 24 tokens long. Since each application of a production rule doubles the number of symbols (since each non-terminal becomes two non-terminals), starting from S, the string should have a length that is a power of 2. 24 isn't a power of 2 (since 2^4=16, 2^5=32). Hmm, that might be a problem, but maybe the terminals are from further expansions. \n\nWait, no, because each rule can only produce non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals or terminals. So the total number of symbols is 1 + 2 + 4 + ... until terminals are reached. So for example, S starts as one symbol, each step potentially doubling the count until terminals are produced. So the length of the string must be a power of 2. 24 isn't, which might mean the string isn't in the language. But wait, maybe the grammar allows for some rules that don't add to the length in a way that would make the total a power of 2. But I think in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, so if all productions were applied until terminals, the total length would always be 2^k. So 24 isn't possible, which suggests the string might not be in the language. But that's just a starting thought.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a way to have a mix of non-terminals that don't all expand to two symbols. For instance, if a non-terminal can eventually produce a terminal without further expansion, but no, in CNF, every production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So every symbol in the string must be a terminal produced directly by a production. So for the string length to be possible, it has to be that the number of terminals is exactly a power of 2. Since 24 isn't 16 or 32, perhaps the string isn't generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe the string can be built by expanding some non-terminals more than others. It's possible that some non-terminals expand deeper, producing more symbols, but I think that each time a non-terminal is expanded, it splits into two. So the total number of symbols should still be a power of 2. Therefore, a string of length 24, which isn't a power of 2, can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the string. Let me check the string again: `t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t3 t0`. Let's count the number of 't's. 24, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, unless the grammar somehow allows the length to not be a power of 2. But in CNF, that's not possible because every expansion of a non-terminal adds exactly one more symbol (from one to two). So starting from S, the number of symbols is 2, then 4, 8, etc. Therefore, the string length must be a power of 2, which 24 isn't. Thus, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Are all the productions in CNF, and does that ensure the total length is a power of 2? Yes, because each non-terminal's production either contributes two symbols or one. So starting from one symbol, each step doubles the count. Therefore, the total number of symbols after k steps is 2^k. Since 24 is not a power of 2, the string can't be in the language.\n\nSo my initial thought is that the answer is 'No'. But wait, let me double-check. Is there a way that the grammar could result in a string of 24 symbols? For instance, if a production leads to a terminal and another non-terminal that later expands into more. But no, the string here is entirely terminals. So all non-terminals must be directly expanding to terminals at some point. So all of them must produce terminals eventually. But since S starts as two non-terminals, each split into two, the count doubles at each step. So the total number of symbols is 2^k, where k is the number of times you've split.\n\nWait, but the string is a single sequence of terminals. The expansion process would involve a parse tree where each split could be in different branches. However, the total count is still 2^k. Therefore, 24 isn't possible. So the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit that structure since all non-terminals seem to produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string starts with multiple 't0's and 't1's, so perhaps the key is to trace back the derivation through the productions. Each 'tX' in the string corresponds to a terminal, so I can see which non-terminals produce those terminals. For example, NT64, NT97, etc., produce 't0's and 't1's, and others produce different terminals like 't3', 't4', etc. But in the given string, we only see 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4' which match the terminals in the grammar.\n\nNext, I should consider how the start symbol S can generate the string. The start symbol S is initially split into several non-terminals: NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, and S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So the string must come from one of these branches.\n\nLooking at the initial productions of S, the string is quite long, 25 tokens. So I think the derivation must involve multiple steps, possibly several productions from each non-terminal in S.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Each production for NT involves two non-terminals. For example, S can branch into NT64 and NT96. Each of these NT's will have their own productions until we reach terminals.\n\nBut the string has a lot of 't0's and 't1's, which are likely produced by NT64, NT68, NT1, and others.

Hmm, this looks a bit complex, but let's try breaking it down.\n\nFirst, the CFG has several productions. Notably, many non-terminals (NTs) eventually derive into terminals like `t0`, `t1`, etc. The string only has t0, t1, t2, t3, and t4, so the NTs must derive into these.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce NTs like NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Each of these NTs has their own productions, which might eventually lead to the terminal symbols in the string.\n\nLet me consider the possible paths the string could take. It might help to think about the production tree. The string length is 27, so it's quite long, but since CFGs allow for parallelism, the number of steps could be up to 27.\n\nBut wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where B and C are non-terminals. So every step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSince each terminal is a single token, the derivation would require each t in the string to either be a direct production or result from a chain of productions that generate a terminal.\n\nGiven that the string has 27 tokens, the derivation would require at least 26 steps if each step creates one additional terminal. But I think in this context, the question is more about whether the structure of the grammar allows for such a string, regardless of the exact number of steps.\n\nLet me look at the NTs and their productions. For example, NT1 can produce NT5 NT77, which then might produce more NTs leading to terminals. NT97 can produce NT43 NT75, and so on.\n\nAnother approach is to try to parse the string using the CFG, starting from the beginning. Since it's a CFG, I can attempt a leftmost derivation.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually might be error-prone. Maybe I can look for patterns or repeated structures that match some part of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t0 t0 t0. Let's see if any NT can produce three t0s. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT68 can produce NT47 NT12, and NT47 can produce nt1 (if we follow NT47-> 't1'?), but wait, looking at the grammar, some NTs directly produce terminals. For example, NT68 -> 't0', NT97-> 't2', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check for each NT production whether it can derive into a terminal t0, t1, etc.\n\nLet me list out the rules where NTs directly derive to t:\n\nNT68 -> 't0'\nNT97 -> 't2'\nNT75 -> 't0'? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT68->'t0', NT93->'t0'? Wait, not exactly. Let me check each line:\n\nNT68: \n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n\nSo NT68 can directly produce t0.\n\nOther NTs:\n\nNT12 -> NT82 NT48\n...\nNT12 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no, in NT12's rules, I see NT12 -> NT82 NT48, and NT12->'t3'. So NT12 can produce 't3', but not t0.\n\nWhat about NT96? NT96->'t4' or via other paths.\n\nNow, the string starts with t0 t0 t0. So perhaps the first part of the derivation produces three t0s.\n\nHow can an NT derive into three t0s? Only if it has a production that allows that, but in CFG, each production replaces a single non-terminal with two, so to get three terminals, you'd need a structure that ends up with three terminals, perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nWait, each production replaces a single non-terminal with two, so each step adds one non-terminal. Starting from S, which is two non-terminals.\n\nFor example, S -> NT64 NT96.\n\nIf each of those can derive to a certain number of t's, their combined count would need to add up to 27.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, for the string to consist of 27 t's and others, I need to see if each t could be generated by a non-terminal that can derive to a t.\n\nLooking at the rules, each t can be directly generated by some NT:\n\nNT68 -> t0\n\nAnother NT's that produce t's:\n\nNT84 -> t2\n\nNT35 -> t3\n\nNT14 -> t3\n\nNT52 -> 't2'\n\nNT7 -> 't0'\n\nNT33 -> 't1'\n\nNT54 -> t0, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the NTs that directly produce each t in the string.\n\nWait, the string is t0, t0, t0, t1, t4, t4, t4, t1, t4, t2, t2, t2, t0, t0, t4, t0, t1, t0, t4, t0, t0, t2, t0, t3, t2.\n\nI need to see if each t in the string is the result of some NT production.\n\nBut not just any NT.

Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that directly produce t0:\n\nLooking at each NT rule:\n\n- NT68: NT68 -> NT47 NT12 | 't0'\n\nSo yes, NT68 can produce t0.\n\n- NT7: NT7->NT66 NT48 | NT68 NT3 | ...? Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT7 is defined as:\n\nNT7 -> NT66 NT48 | NT68 NT3 | ... ?\n\nNo, wait in the rules, the line is NT7 -> NT66 NT48 or NT68 NT3?\n\nWait, reviewing the grammar:\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules, let's compile all NTs and see which produce t:\n\nNT68 -> t0\n\nNT1 -> t2, NT7 -> t2, NT33->t1, NT47->t1, NT53->t2, etc.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule:\n\n- NT68: NT68->'t0' so yes, generates t0.\n\n- S: starts with NT64 NT96. NT64->t4, NT96->t4 or via another path, but at least produces t4.\n\nWait, perhaps S is not the right starting point for producing t0s, but let's see.\n\nBut since the string starts with t0, we might need a subtree starting with an NT that can produce t0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer, so maybe the structure is more about multiple substitutions generating the t's.\n\nWait, maybe we can find the entire string by starting from S, applying productions step by step, but it's a bit too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for the generation of a string where each t is the result of any NT that can produce a t, and the counts are as needed.\n\nBut maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me consider the string: It's 27 tokens of t0, t1, t2, t3, t4.\n\nSince the grammar has multiple NTs that can derive into each t, perhaps the string can be generated.\n\nWait, but we need to check whether the string can be generated by any combination of productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that since the grammar can produce any terminal by choosing the correct productions, and the string consists solely of the terminals t0 to t4, each of which can be produced by some NT, perhaps the string is valid.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. For example, each t must be produced by a non-terminal that can derive to it. So, let's make sure each t in the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nCan NT68->t0?\n\nYes.\n\nCan NT47->t1?\n\nWait, NT47 is:\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62 | NT21 NT3 | ... and some rules that reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT47 rules, I see NT47-> NT1 -> t2, etc., but wait, I need"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I think I can handle it. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It consists of a start symbol S and several productions. Each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, I remember that each production only involves two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But wait, actually, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or exactly one terminal. So, in this case, the productions seem to have either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol, which fits the definition.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t1 t4 t2 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t4 t0 t3 t3 t3 t2 t4 t0 t3 t2`. That's quite a long string. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the productions again for clarity:\n\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nWait, I see that S is the start symbol and it can produce three different combinations. But in this case, the string starts with t0s, so maybe one of the productions from S will lead to t0. Let me check the productions that result in t0.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some symbols like NT68, NT97, NT84, and others have terminal assignments. Let me note which symbols correspond to t0, t1, etc.\n\nFrom the given mapping:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t4\n- NT97 \u2192 t2\n- NT47 \u2192 t4 (Wait, no, looking back at the productions, there's a NT47 with multiple productions.

Let me try to map each terminal to its 't' value. It looks like some symbols have the same 't' value, so maybe I can create a dictionary or list where I can look up which symbols correspond to each 't'.\n\nLet's go through each symbol and note their 't' value:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t4\n- NT97 \u2192 t2\n- NT47 can produce either t4 or t2 (since one production is NT47 \u2192 t4 and another is NT47 \u2192 NT1, which is t2)\n- NT66 \u2192 t4 (Wait, no, looking at the productions: NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, so NT52 is t2 and NT63 is t3. So, NT66 would produce t2 and t3 together, which isn't a terminal, so perhaps NT66 isn't directly producing a 't' symbol. Wait, but in the given list, are there any symbols that produce 't's directly? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the terminal symbols are those that are mapped to specific 't' values.

That complicates things.)\n- NT98 \u2192 t1\n- NT4 \u2192 t1\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT80 \u2192 t2\n- NT22 \u2192 t4\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT21 \u2192 t4\n- NT52 \u2192 t4\n- NT43 \u2192 t0\n- NT53 \u2192 t2\n- NT84 \u2192 t0\n- NT34 \u2192 t4\n- NT96 \u2192 t3\n- NT62 \u2192 t0\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Some symbols have multiple productions, one of which is terminal, and the other is non-terminal. So, for NT47, one production is NT47 \u2192 t4, another is NT47 \u2192 NT1. So, when we choose NT47 \u2192 t4, it produces t4, and if we choose NT47 \u2192 NT1, that leads to NT1 \u2192 t2. Similarly, NT7 can produce t0.\n\nSo, the string starts with t0, t0, t0... So perhaps we can derive this by using productions that result in t0. Looking at the start symbols S, they can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nLet me check which of these can lead to a t0 in the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the productions for S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96: Let's see what NT64 and NT96 produce. From the list, NT64 \u2192 t4 (since NT64 maps to t4 in one of its productions). NT96 \u2192 t4. So, S \u2192 t4 t4, but the string starts with t0, not t4. So this production cannot lead to the first t0.\n\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7: NT97 \u2192 t2, and NT7 \u2192 t0. So, this would produce t2 t0. But the string starts with t0, so the first symbol would have to be this. Wait, but in context-free grammars, the left-hand side is a single symbol, so the production S \u2192 NT97 NT7 would produce the sequence of symbols from NT97 and NT7. So, NT97 \u2192 t2 and NT7 \u2192 t0. So the first two symbols would be t2 followed by t0, but the string starts with t0 t0. So this production doesn't match unless there's a way to get two t0s in a row.\n\nWait, but maybe the first symbol is derived from T0 somehow. Alternatively, maybe NT47 is the one that can produce t0. Oh, wait, looking back, NT7 \u2192 t0. So, if S can produce NT7 somewhere, but looking at S's productions, none of them directly produce NT7 except perhaps through intermediate steps.\n\nWait, no, S is the start symbol, so the initial productions from S are either NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. So, the first step is to go from S to one of these NT pairs, leading to a sequence of symbols that can be further expanded.\n\nSo, to get the first t0, perhaps we need a production that eventually leads to a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar has several NT rules leading to terminals, which I can see at the end of each NT production, like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 and some NTs ending with 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is a tag, so the string is a sequence of these tags. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S splits into three options:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, any string generated will start with the combination of two non-terminals. That means the first part of the string will be determined by one of these options. Since our string starts with 't0 t0', I need to see if that's possible from any of these.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that some of these NTs go directly to 't0' or 't1'. For example, NT3 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't1', NT5 \u2192 't2', etc. But in the first step, S splits into two NTs, so the first token must come from the first NT, and the second token from the second NT?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each production is a pair of NTs, but in the string, it's a flat sequence of 't's. To match the string, each of these pairs must split into sequences that produce the corresponding 't's.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to think of the string's length. The string has 25 tokens. Since the grammar uses binary expansions (each step splits a non-terminal into two, which may further split), the length of the string must be 2^n - 1 for some n. 25 isn't a power of 2 minus one, so maybe it can still be generated. Alternatively, perhaps the parsing will fail due to some mismatch.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the production rules for each non-terminal and see if they can generate the required 't's in sequence.\n\nLooking at the start symbols, S can split into NT64 and NT96. Let me check NT64 and NT96's productions.\n\nNT64:\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT52 \u2192 NT53 NT85 (Wait, but in the given grammar, I don't see NT53, it goes to NT39 etc. Maybe I'm missing a production.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or terminals, but in this case, many of the productions are NT followed by two other NT or 't' with subscripts. Wait, actually, some of the productions end with a 't' like NT64 \u2192 't4'. So, the terminals are the various 't' terms, like t0, t1, etc., and NT refers to the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the left-hand side (LHS) of the production expands into two other non-terminals or possibly a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which means S can be replaced by NT64 and NT96. Then, each NT can expand further, and so on, until we reach terminals.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string from the start symbol S and see if it can be derived through a series of productions. Alternatively, I might try to build a parse tree for the string, starting from the root (S) and breaking it down into constituent parts.\n\nBut parsing a long string like this manually could be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or parts of the string that correspond to specific productions. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be divided into chunks that match the productions.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t0 t0.

So, the string is `t0 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t2 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t1 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t0`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is a non-terminal producing exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the productions are either two symbols on the right-hand side, which means it's indeed in CNF. If it weren't, we might have to do some pre-processing.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals: various t0, t1, t2, t3, and t4. From the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand into these t's. So, the idea is to see if this sequence can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is given in CNF, we can use a dynamic programming approach, where we track the possible non-terminals at each position in the string. But since that might be a bit complex, perhaps I can try to approach it step by step.\n\nWait, actually, the string starts with t0, t0, etc. I see that t0 appears multiple times. Looking at the productions, I notice that NT68, NT97, NT24, NT3, NT5, and others can produce t0, t1, t2, etc. But since each step in derivation splits a non-terminal into two, the string should have a length that's one less than a power of two. But the given string has 28 tokens, which is 2^4 + something, but 2^5 is 32. 28 is not a power of two minus one, so that might be a red flag. Wait no, in a binary tree structure, the number of leaves is equal to 2^n, where n is the height of the tree. Wait, for example, for a tree with height 3, you have 8 leaves. So, the number of terminals should correspond to the number of leaves, which is 2^n.\n\nThe given string has 28 symbols, which is 28. 2^5 is 32, which is more than 28. 2^4 is 16. 28 is neither a power of two nor one less. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar since the number of terminals generated by a binary grammar should be a number that is 2^k - 1 or similar, but 28 doesn't fit that. Therefore, it's likely that the string is not generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe number of terminals is 28, which is not a power of two minus one.

{"custom_id":"request-528","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t1 t3 t4 t3 t1 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The given grammar has production rules that mainly start with S and NT, eventually deriving into terminal symbols (t's and numbers like 1, 2, 3). The string consists of a sequence of 30 t's and numbers, so it's likely that each t corresponds to a terminal symbol derived from the NT productions.\n\nThe grammar produces terminals t0, t1, etc., which are terminal symbols. Each NT rule produces two other NT's until it reaches a production that directly produces a single terminal, such as NT66 -> 't4'.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I can use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to reduce the string by replacing the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLet me write down the grammar rules more clearly for each NT:\n\n- S -> NT64 NT96\n- NT47 -> NT21 NT3, or 't1' (several times)\n- NT1 -> NT5 NT77, or 't2' (since in some rules, it becomes 't1' and others 't2')\nWait, no, looking back, some rules for NT1 become 't2' like in S -> NT1 NT5, which becomes 't2' or 't0'? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me map each NT to its terminal if it's a leaf.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT66 -> 't4'\n\nNT64 -> 't4'\n\nNT53 -> 't2'\n\nNT97 -> 't2'\n\nNT96 -> 't4'\n\nNT38 -> 't3' (multiple instances)\n\nNT1 -> 't0' via some productions, like NT1 -> NT5 NT77, and then NT5 becomes 't2',NT77 is 't3', so NT1 could be 't2' via NT5, but elsewhere like NT1 -> NT5 NT77, which is 't2' and 't3', but wait, NT5 -> 't2', NT77 -> 't3', so NT1 would be 't2 t3', but I think I'm making this more complicated. Maybe it's better to consider what each NT directly produces.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nFor NT1, some productions are:\n\nNT1 -> NT5 NT77 (which in some cases lead to t2 or t3)\nNT1 -> 't2' (some where, for example, from NT1 in the string context, but looking back, NT64 -> 't4', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each NT's terminal production is the only way to get a terminal. So for NT66, it's 't4', so it's easy.\n\nBut let me proceed.\n\nLet me start with the string and see if it can be split into the productions.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1 t0\n2 t0\n3 t0\n4 t4\n5 t4\n6 t4\n7 t1\n8 t3\n9 t2\n10 t0\n11 t4\n12 t0\n13 t0\n14 t2\n15 t0\n16 t1\n17 t3\n18 t4\n19 t3\n20 t1\n21 t4\n22 t0\n23 t0\n24 t2\n25 t0\n26 t3\n27 t4\n28 t1\n\nI need to see if this can be parsed step by step using the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string, which needs to be matched by S. S has two NT's: NT64 and NT96. So the string must be split into two parts where NT64 produces the first part and NT96 produces the second part.\n\nLet's look at the NT64 production: It can be NT66 NT62 or 't4'. Wait, from the rules:\n\nLooking back, NT64 -> NT84 NT62, and NT62 is 't0', but NT84 is another NT? Wait, let me check:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nBut NT84 could be further broken down:\n\nNT84 -> NT47 NT86\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62, among others.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check each NT and see what terminal it can produce. So for example, NT66 -> 't4', so when NT66 is on the stack, it produces 't4' as a single symbol.\n\nWait, but when parsing top-down, we start with S and apply rules to it. Let's pick how to split the string. Since S produces NT64 NT96, we'll look at the first occurrence where NT64's derived string starts and NT96's string starts.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t1...\n\nLooking at the first 't0', could it come from NT5? Or NT1?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to find at each step which rule could match the current string.\n\nStarting with the entire string. Let me think in terms of the leftmost derivation.\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n   So the string is split into [t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t1 ...] for NT64 and [t3 t4 t1 ...] for NT96.\n\nBut how to parse these two parts? Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see how each NT can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t0. Let me see which NT can produce 't0':\n\nLooking through the rules, which NT have 't0' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT5 -> 't2'\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nNT68 -> 't4' or 't0'\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\n\nAnd NT47 has multiple productions, one of which is 't1', another is 't3', but also NT68 has rules that lead to 't4' or 't0'? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT68 is defined as:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\n\nAnd also, in other rules, like:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\n\nIs there any production for NT68 that leads directly to 't0'? Let me check the grammar:\n\nWait, looking again, after NT68, in the initial list:\n\n- NT68 -> NT47 NT12\n\nBut looking through all the rules, does any NT68 have a direct 't0'? Scanning through, I see:\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\n\nBut no direct 't0'. So perhaps NT68 is involved in longer productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules.\n\nWait, let me get back. For the initial step, the string starts with t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t1... So that's seven symbols starting with t0.\n\nBut let me try to think about NT64 and NT96 rules.\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT84 can be NT47 NT86\n\nNT47 can be NT1 NT62 or 't1' etc.\n\nBut perhaps I should map each NT to see what terminal symbols they can produce.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet's consider the entire string and see if it can be split into two parts by S, each part being the expansion of NT64 and NT96.\n\nSo for the entire string, the first part (let's say) needs to be generated by NT64 and the second by NT96.\n\nBut how to split the string so that each part fits the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write down the string and try to see how each token is generated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nLet me see how the first t0 can be generated.\n\nLooking at the possible NT that produce t0. Let me check the production rules for each NT to see if any produce 't0' directly.\n\nFrom the given grammar, let me scan each NT:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT1 -> NT5 NT77 or 't0'?

{"custom_id":"request-530","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of t0, t1, t2, etc. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. All the production rules are in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where a non-terminal is directly converted to a terminal string (like 't0', 't1', etc.). This structure will help because it simplifies the process of reduction and tree construction.\n\nThe string to check is: `t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t0 t3 t0`. That's quite a long string with 30 tokens. Each token is either 't0' to 't9' or some other identifier, but in this case, all the terminals are 't's with subscripts. Wait, no, actually looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce these terminals directly, like NT68 -> 't0', etc.\n\nSo the approach here is to see if we can derive the given string step by step using the grammar's productions. Alternatively, we could construct the parse tree for the string and check if it conforms to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, building a parse tree would be straightforward.\n\nLet me consider the top-level productions. The start symbol is S, and it can produce two options: NT64 NT96, OR NT97 NT7. So each option is a pair of non-terminals. Each will expand further based on their own productions.\n\nI'll start by considering each possible expansion of S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Let's track the number of symbols each expansion would produce. NT64 and NT96 each have their own productions. For example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Then NT64 would split into two non-terminals, and so on. Each production replaces a non-terminal with two others. So the parse tree will have a structure where each node splits into two until the leaves are terminals.\n\nSimilarly, the second option: S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nI think it's manageable if I try both options and see if either can generate the string. But since the string is quite long, maybe I can find a pattern or a way to build the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is small, maybe the string can be generated by tracing the production steps. Let's try to see if the string can be constructed by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to write down the steps of expanding the non-terminals until I reach the terminals and see if the resulting sequence matches.\n\nLet's start with the first option: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64: Looking at the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84: It can produce 't2' or further non-terminals. Let's see. NT84's productions include \u2192 't2' and also some others, but that's a terminal. So in our string, we have a 't2' somewhere. Similarly, NT62 \u2192 NT64 NT63, and both of those have further productions.\n\nWait, let's map this out more carefully.\n\nFirst, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 has two options: 't2' or NT47. Hmm, in the string, we have 't2's early on, so perhaps NT84 is producing 't2' here.\n\nSimilarly, NT62 \u2192 NT64 NT63, which then split into more non-terminals.\n\nThis could get quite involved, so maybe let's look for the entire string in terms of the production order. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each non-terminal corresponds to a certain pattern, and the string can be built by combining these patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to see if the string can be divided into segments that correspond to each production rule.\n\nWait, the string is: t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t0 t3 t0.\n\nThat's 30 symbols. Now, considering the grammar, each step in the derivation increases the string length by 1, but wait, no\u2014since all rules are binary, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the derivation starts with 1 non-terminal, then 2, then 4, 8, etc. Wait, that's more relevant for how the parse tree expands, but in this case, the string is a linear sequence, so the derivation would need to align in a way that the terminals are generated in the right order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's structure corresponds to a series of production applications that can be traced through the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if each occurrence of a non-terminal in the string's sequence can be linked back to a production rule.\n\nWait, but the string is all terminals. So each symbol in the string must come from a base production rule, i.e., a production where the non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions that produce terminals are:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT96 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT75 \u2192 't98' ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the nt's and their terminal outputs:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0', 't3', 't4'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't1', 't4'\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT98 \u2192 't1'\n\nAnd the other nt's like NT64, NT12, etc., have longer productions, but perhaps in the string, the terminals are being generated by these base nt's.\n\nBut perhaps the better approach is to consider that to generate a terminal string, each non-terminal symbol must eventually produce a terminal. So in the derivation, each non-terminal must be expanded down to terminals.\n\nGiven the start symbol S, which is a combination of two non-terminals, each of which will be expanded via their respective rules.\n\nWait, but the problem is that S directly produces two non-terminals, which then need to produce the string in sequence.\n\nWait, but the string is a list of terminals, so the parse tree will require that each pair of non-terminals (from S) must somehow combine to produce the terminal string. But wait, in the given grammar, S is a production of two non-terminals, which are themselves each further splits, leading to many non-terminals, and terminal productions only apply at the leaves.\n\nBut in a typical leftmost or rightmost derivation, each non-terminal is expanded step by step, but it's tricky to see if the given string can be formed.\n\nGiven that the string is 30 symbols long, I might think that the grammar could generate it, but perhaps the sequence of t's does not follow any production path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into segments that correspond to the expansion of some non-terminals.\n\nBut considering the detailed structure, perhaps each occurrence of a particular non-terminal will correspond to a certain pattern of t's.\n\nFor example, perhaps NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, and so on. But without constructing the entire parse tree, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to known patterns from the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps I should think of this as a problem where each non-terminal expansion can produce a certain number of t's, and the string is built by combining these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check for the existence of a leftmost derivation that would produce this string.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps an alternative approach is to notice that the given string has 30 symbols, which is an even number, so perhaps it can be generated by a string formed by multiple binary splits.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens, and from what I remember, CNF grammars have specific structures, with each production rule having exactly two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar provided. The non-terminals include S, NT1, NT2, etc., and terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4. Each production rule leads to two non-terminals, except where a terminal is involved.

Let me check.)\n\nWait, maybe some productions have overlapping non-terminals, so I have to be careful.\n\nI think the key is to start from the beginning of the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying production rules.\n\nSince the string starts with t0, I should find which non-terminals produce t0. Looking through the list:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't0', and S is one of the start productions.\n\nWait, S leads to two non-terminals, and the string starts with t0, which is a terminal. So S must produce two sequences that together form the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look at the entire string and see if it can be split into two parts, each corresponding to the two non-terminals in a production rule leading to the entire string.\n\nBut the entire string is about 30 tokens long, which is quite long. It might be easier to use a recursive approach or CYK parsing.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to find the possible ways to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to the two components of a production rule.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into possible pairs. For example, the first part could be the first k tokens, and the second part could be the remaining (30 - k) tokens, and I need to see if both parts can be generated by some production rule.\n\nGiven that S has three production rules (each leading to two non-terminals), but actually, the initial S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Wait no\u2014the first three lines under S are actually the three production rules for S, each producing two non-terminals. So S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nEach of these produces two non-terminals. So the string would have to be the concatenation of two sequences, each derived from one of these rules.\n\nSo, to parse the entire string, it must be split into two parts, each corresponding to one of the three possible production rules of S.\n\nSo let's consider each of these possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The entire string is the result of S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the first part is derived from NT64, and the second from NT96.\n\nSimilarly, for each of the three S rules, we can check whether the string can be split accordingly.\n\nLet me focus on the first case: the string starts with t0, and the rule for NT64 is: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo, if the string is generated by NT64, then the entire string is the concatenation of the string derived by NT84 and NT62.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: t0. So t0 must be the first symbol of the string derived from NT84 NT62. Therefore, I need to check if t0 can be derived from either NT84 or NT62.\n\nWait, no. The production is NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which means the string for NT64 is NT84 followed by NT62. So the entire string must be the concatenation of NT84's string and NT62's string.\n\nBut the entire string is the concatenation of the string derived from NT84 and the string derived from NT62.\n\nSo, I need to check if the entire string can be split into a prefix that's generated by NT84 and a suffix generated by NT62.\n\nSimilarly, this splitting can be done recursively.\n\nThis seems quite involved because the string is quite long, but maybe I can start by checking known terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t0. Let's see which non-terminals produce t0. Looking at the list:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't0'\n- S \u2192 possible via other rules where t0 appears in the body.\n\nBut since S is already leading to two non-terminals, and the string is the combination of both, we might need to proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to check each production rule and see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps a better approach is to look for the earliest production that could yield the first few tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm. Since the string is long, I might not want to process it step by step, but perhaps I can look for the required structure.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the given string in terms of the grammar's rules. Since the string starts with t0, and NT3 produces 't0', maybe the string starts with a derivation from NT3, possibly after several steps.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74. So, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, let's see: NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74. Then, perhaps NT22 and NT74 can produce certain terminals.\n\nBut NT22 \u2192 NT48, which then can produce... Let me check NT48 \u2192 't1'.\n\nWait, this might not be the right path because the string starts with t0.\n\nLet me reconsider. Since the string starts with t0, maybe it's useful to look for rules that can produce t0, which is:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't0', but NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74. So, to produce t0, perhaps the string starts with NT3, but that would mean the first symbol is t0 followed by another symbol. But in our case, the string is just t0, so perhaps that's not possible.\n\nWait, wait\u2014this suggests that the entire string might be a single non-terminal derivation, but S is the start symbol and can only be split into two parts. Alternatively, perhaps the string is such that it can be split into two sequences, each corresponding to a production.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck here.

{"custom_id":"request-549","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I'm supposed to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. I remember that means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, except for the starting symbol which can have just one non-terminal. Or wait, no, actually Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this case, the right-hand side can be either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see a bunch of S \u2192 NT... and then some NT \u2192 NT... and finally some NT terminating with 't0', 't1', etc. So the terminals are those like 't0', 't1', etc., and the non-terminals are all the NT variations.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t0, t0, t0, t1, t4, t4, t1, t4, t0, t3, t1, t0, t4, t0, t1, t2, t2, t0, t1, t2, t4, t3, t3, t2, t0, t3, t4, t1, t1.\n\nSo the plan is to try to see if this string can be derived from the grammar S. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can try to see if it's a derivation tree where each step splits a non-terminal into two, and the entire string is built from the bottom up.\n\nAlternatively, since the right-hand sides of the productions are either terminals or two non-terminals, each terminal in the string must correspond directly to a production that's either a rule that ends with that terminal or a rule that needs to be expanded further.\n\nWait, but the string is made up of t0, t1, etc., which are terminals in the grammar. So each t in the string must come from a production where that NT is directly a terminal.\n\nSo looking at the grammar, for example, NT47 can go directly to t1 or other NTs. Similarly, NT68 can go to t4 or t2, etc.\n\nSo the approach might be to represent this as a string of terminals and see if it can be parsed by the grammar, i.e., if we can find a way to derive the string starting from S.\n\nGiven the string is 29 symbols long, which is quite long, it's probably best to think of this as a top-down approach. Start with S, which is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So S splits into NT64 and NT96.\n\nNow, let's take NT64 and NT96.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nSo NT64 has to be split into NT84 and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nSo now, our string starts with t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t3 t3 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1.\n\nWait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me try again.\n\nWait, actually, the string is the result of expanding S, so each symbol in the string must be produced by one of the NTs in the grammar that directly produce a terminal. So each 't' corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nThe grammar has each NT with possible productions either directly to a 't' or to two NTs.\n\nSo for example, NT64 can expand to NT84 and NT62, which are themselves non-terminals.\n\nSo the idea is to represent the string as a tree, starting from S, and breaking down each part into the rules.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to think in reverse. Let's reconstruct the string by expanding the top-down.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to represent the string as a list and see if we can match it by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser. But that might be complicated.\n\nAnother idea is to model this as a tree where each node is an NT and the leaves are the terminals. Starting from S, each step involves replacing a node with two child nodes according to a production rule.\n\nBut given the string length is 29, it's probably going to be a deep tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the rule that ends with the first symbol, t0. Looking at the grammar, which NTs directly produce a t0?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\nNT48 \u2192 't0'\nNT54 \u2192 't4'\nWait, let me list all the NT rules that end with a terminal:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't0'\nNT33 \u2192 't1' (so no, t1)\nNT68 \u2192 't4'\nNT47 \u2192 't1', 't4', etc.\nWait, wait, let's check the rules.\n\nLooking through each NT's production:\n\nNT48 \u2192 't0' \u2713\nNT3 \u2192 't0' \u2713\nNT68 \u2192 't4' (so no)\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nNT84 \u2192 't2' (no, t2)\nWait, but the string starts with t0, so the initial S must expand into NT64 and NT96, as S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nSo the first two symbols would come from NT64 and NT96. So let's see if the entire string can be split into the two parts generated by NT64 and NT96.\n\nNow, looking at NT64's expansion: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo the string starts with t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t3 t3 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1.\n\nWait, so the first part generated by NT64 would be a string, and the second part by NT96 would be another string. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the string generated by NT64 and the string generated by NT96.\n\nSo let's try to split the given string into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT64 and the second by NT96.\n\nNow, the first step is to see how NT64 and NT96 can expand.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So the string from NT64 will be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT84 and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. So the string from NT96 will be the concatenation of NT54 and NT53.\n\nSo we can split the given string into two parts: the first part is the string from NT84 and NT62, and the second part is the string from NT54 and NT53.\n\nLet me see: Let's take the first two symbols of the given string, which are t0 and t0. But wait, the entire string is 29 symbols, so perhaps after splitting, each part must also start with the initial non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the entire string being the result of the expansion and try to parse it step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the possible sequences from S and see if the given string can be one of them.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so let's try to see possible candidates.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to trace possible splits.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nThen, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nSo the string will be the combined output of NT84, NT62, NT54, NT53.\n\nLet's denote the entire string as S = part1 + part2, where part1 is from NT84 and NT62, and part2 from NT54 and NT53.\n\nLooking at the given string: t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t3 t3 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1.\n\nSo part1 is from NT84 and NT62, and part2 from NT54 and NT53.\n\nLet me look at the first part, part1: it's t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t1.\n\nWait, but that's too long. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way is to represent the process as a tree and see if the given string can be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to represent each step as a list of NTs and their expected outputs"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-568","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Okay, first, I need to parse the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe given string is: t0 t0 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t1 t2 t1 t4 t0 t2 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t3 t0.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S branches into three possible rules: NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. I think I should start by checking if the string can be split into any of these combinations.\n\nLet me write down the initial rule for S:\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96, OR S \u2192 NT97 NT7, OR S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nSince the first step of using S would generate two symbols, I need to split the string into two parts after each step of derivation. For example, if I choose S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then the string should split into the part from NT64 and the part from NT96, concatenated.\n\nLooking at the string length is 32 tokens. So, if I split the string into two parts at position k, each part should match the corresponding NT64 and NT96, or other rules if chosen.\n\nWait, but the NT are non-terminals, so each of them could expand further. It's a bit complex. Maybe I should approach this by trying to find which S rule the string could start with.\n\nLet me try each possibility:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96: So, first find what NT64 and NT96 can generate. If I can find a way that the first part becomes NT64 and the second NT96, then maybe yes.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7: Check if the first part is NT97 and the second is NT7.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84: Check if the string starts with NT35 and ends with NT84.\n\nI think I'll start with the first rule, S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So, the string starts with NT64 and ends with NT96.\n\nWait, but I'm dealing with tokens, so each NT (like NT64) would expand into a sequence of 't's and other NT's. Maybe it's easier if I try to see what the first NT64 and NT96 could be.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I see that many of the NT rules directly produce t's. For example, NT68 \u2192 't0', NT97 \u2192 't2', etc. So, some NTs are abbreviations for terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar, some NTs are directly mapped to terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 't0', NT97 \u2192 't2', NT77 \u2192 't2', etc. Others have more complex relationships, like NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, but NT64 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nSo, maybe I can try to trace the possible terminals for each NT.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then, the string should start with the expansion of NT64 and NT96.\n\nLooking at NT64, from the grammar, it expands to NT84 NT62. Then, NT84 is 't2'. NT62 is 't0'. So, NT64 would produce 't2 t0'.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 expands to NT54 NT53. Then, NT54 is 't1' and NT53 is 't2'. So, NT96 would expand to 't1 t2'.\n\nThus, if I follow S \u2192 NT64 NT96, the start part would be 't2 t0' followed by 't1 t2', making the initial four tokens 't2 t0 t1 t2'?\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and both NT84 and NT62 are terminals. So, the expansion of NT64 is 't2 t0' because NT84 is 't2' and NT62 is 't0'. So, the entire S rule would be the combination of NT64's expansion and NT96's expansion. So, the first part (from S) would have the tokens from NT64 and then NT96.\n\nSo, if our string starts with 't2 t0' followed by the expansion of NT96.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with t0, so that's a problem. Because NT64 NT96 would produce 't2 t0' followed by 't1 t2', so the first token should be t2, but the string starts with t0. So, this means S \u2192 NT64 NT96 is not the correct path, because the first token should be t2, but it's t0.\n\nSo, maybe try the next S rule: S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nNT97 \u2192 't4', as per the production NT97 \u2192 't4'. NT7 \u2192 't2' because NT7 is production NT74 and several others, but eventually, in the end, NT7 reduces to 't2' or others. Wait, in the given grammar, NT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48. Both NT66 and NT48 are NTs, which in turn have expansions.\n\nLooking at NT66, production is NT52 NT63. NT52 is 't2' and NT63 is 't4' because NT63 \u2192 't4'. So, NT66 \u2192 't2 t4'.\n\nThen, NT48 \u2192 't1', as per NT48 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo, NT7 would be NT66 NT48 \u2192 't2 t4 t1'.\n\nThus, NT7 \u2192 't2 t4 t1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT97 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT97 NT7 would produce 't4' followed by 't2 t4 t1'.\n\nThe given string starts with t0, so that doesn't align. So this rule is not applicable.\n\nNow, check the third S rule: S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nNT35: the production is NT78 NT33. NT78 is 't0' because NT78 \u2192 't0'. NT33 \u2192 't1' as per NT33 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo, NT35 \u2192 't0 t1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT84 \u2192 't2' because NT84 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo, the expansion of NT35 is 't0 t1' followed by 't2' from NT84. So overall, S \u2192 NT35 NT84 would produce 't0 t1 t2'.\n\nBut the string starts with t0, followed by t0. Not matching the initial 't0 t0'.\n\nWait, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. Perhaps NT35 and NT84 have more complex productions, so maybe their expansions involve further non-terminals.\n\nLet me check again: NT35 \u2192 NT78 NT33.\n\nNT78 \u2192 't0' directly, since it's a terminal.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81.\n\nThen, NT84 is 't2' and NT81 is 't1' (as per NT81 \u2192 't1'). So NT33 \u2192 't2 t1'.\n\nThus, NT35 \u2192 NT78 NT33 \u2192 't0 t2 t1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT84 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo, the expansion of S \u2192 NT35 NT84 is 't0 t2 t1' followed by 't2', making the sequence 't0 t2 t1 t2'.\n\nBut the string starts with t0 t0, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the NTs have alternative productions that can lead to different sequences. For example, NT33 might have another production.\n\nLooking back, in the given grammar, some NTs have multiple productions. For example, NT36 has productions: NT24 NT62, and others. But checking the provided grammar, for example, NT33 also has NT84 NT81, which seems to be the only production.\n\nWait, let me check: the user provided a long list of grammar rules for NTs, like:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\n\nAnd so on. So, for NT35 and NT84, let's see if they have other production options.\n\nLooking at the list, NT35 only has one production: NT78 NT33.

{"custom_id":"request-569","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has several production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of t0, t1, and t4 symbols. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form entails. It's a specific form where every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this case, looking at the provided grammar, all the rules seem to fit that form, except I should double-check. For example, S is defined as NT64 NT96, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine. The right-hand side of each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of t's with indices 0, 1, and 4. The string is: t0 t0 t1 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t0.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S, using the given productions.\n\nI think the approach here is to use a parsing method suitable for context-free grammars, such as either recursive descent or a dynamic programming approach like CYK. However, since this is a bit involved, maybe I can simplify by looking for patterns or trying to break down the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the string in terms of the non-terminals and see if they can be reduced to terminals. Let me list out the non-terminal productions and see if I can find a way to expand S into this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT64 NT96. So S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Then, each of those non-terminals (84, 62, 54, 53) have their own productions.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can build a parse tree by expanding S step by step, trying to match the string. Let me attempt to map the string to the non-terminals.\n\nEach production either combines two non-terminals or introduces a terminal. So, for example, if the string starts with 't0 t0', I'd look for a production that results in 't0 t0'. Let me scan through the non-terminals to see if any of their productions result in sequences of t0s.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to work backwards. Let me see which non-terminals produce t0, t1, or t4.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12 and also NT68 is set to 't0' in some cases. Wait, no, looking at the last part of the grammar:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12 | 't0'\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 NT82 NT48 | 't3'\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that produce a terminal and what terminals they produce.\n\nLet me go through the rules:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0' or NT47 NT12.\n\nWait, the rules are a bit confusing here. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the rules, many non-terminals are defined as combinations of other non-terminals, while some are directly assigned to a terminal. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nSimilarly, NT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT96 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, perhaps I need to create a dictionary mapping each non-terminal to its possible terminal productions.\n\nSo, let's list each non-terminal and the terminals they can produce:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' (and also NT47 NT12, but that's non-terminal expansions)\n\nWait, no, actually, the production rules are given as:\n\nNT68 -> 't0' or NT47 NT12\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list for each non-terminal all the possible terminals they can produce after fully expanding their rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quickest way is to note each non-terminal that directly produces a terminal:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' directly\n\n- NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75 and also NT43 \u2192 't0', NT75 \u2192 't4' \u2192 that would make NT97 produce 't0 t4'\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's check each rule.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminals are assigned as follows:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' (line: NT68 -> 't0')\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12 (line: NT68 -> NT47 NT12)\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (line: NT3 -> 't2')\n- NT4 \u2192 't1' (line: NT4 -> 't1')\nWait, no\u2014wait, looking back, the rules end with lines like:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't1' (maybe?

{"custom_id":"request-584","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the string `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t2` is generated by the given CFG. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has a lot of productions, each splitting into two non-terminals except where terminals are involved. Each non-terminal's productions either lead to terminals or further splits. The start symbol is S, which splits into NT64 NT96. So the string must start with two parts derived from NT64 and NT96.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t0. Since both NT64 and NT96 may produce t0 somewhere down the line, I need to explore their derivations.\n\nLet's break down the string. The first three t0's are at positions 1, 2, 3. Given that the grammar might have rules that produce multiple t0's, it's possible. However, I should check if each t in the string can be traced back through the productions.\n\nI'll consider each production rule and see if the tokens can be matched. For example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. If NT84 can produce t4, and NT62 can produce t0, then that's one option. Similarly, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 could produce t2 and t4, etc.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a parsing problem, trying to apply the productions to the string step by step. Starting with the start symbol S, which must split into NT64 and NT96. Each of these must produce a substring that, when combined, give the overall string.\n\nLet me outline the possible paths:\n\n1. NT64 can produce t4 (from NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 \u2192 t4 as per the rules NT84 \u2192 't4'). Similarly, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 can produce t2 and t4. NT68 \u2192 t4 or other terminals. So there are multiple paths.\n\n2. Similarly, NT96 can produce t4, t0, or other t's depending on its productions.\n\nNow, the given string is quite long and specific, but each step may have multiple options, which makes it a bit complex. I might need to reconstruct a derivation or see if the string can be split in a way consistent with the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in reverse, starting from the entire string and trying to reduce it through possible productions. For example, looking for the end symbols that can be the result of applying a production.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is t2. So the last non-terminal must be something that can produce t2. Scanning through the productions, NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62 can produce t4 and t0. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the production NT34 \u2192 NT24 NT27. So perhaps looking for a way to get to t2. For example, NT99 \u2192 't2' might not be present, but maybe NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, where NT84 can be 't4' and NT62 could lead to t2? Or perhaps NT37 \u2192 NT66 NT68. Wait, but in the productions, NT54 is present, but I need to match t2's.\n\nWait, the given productions don't list NT22's production except that NT22 \u2192 t4. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the grammar includes a lot of productions leading to terminals, and each terminal corresponds to a specific symbol in the string. Maybe the string can be split into parts where each part corresponds to the derivation of a non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to see if the string starts with a t0. The start symbol S splits into NT64 and NT96. Let's see the possible terminals for these:\n\nNT64 can produce t4 (from NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 \u2192 t4). NT96's possible productions include NT54 NT53, which can be t4 and t3, or NT68 \u2192 t4, etc. Wait, looking back at the productions:\n\nNT68 can derive t4 (from NT68 \u2192 t4 in some cases). Or maybe through other steps.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, there are several points where terminals are listed. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t4, NT47 \u2192 t4, NT53 \u2192 t4, etc. So if a non-terminal can directly produce a t4, that might be a way.\n\nBut the first token in the string is t0, so perhaps the first non-terminal must derive to t0.\n\nLooking at NT64, can it directly derive to t0? Checking the productions:\n\nFrom NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and then NT84 can be t4, NT62 can be t0 (looking back, I see NT62 is terminal 't0' in some rules like NT62 \u2192 t0. Yes, under NT62's productions, there's a rule that directly gives t0.\n\nSo for NT64, the path could be NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 (t4)(t0) = t4 t0.\n\nSimilarly, for NT96, which is part of the S split, perhaps it can produce t0 t3 or something else. Wait, the string starts with t0, so if S is split into NT64 (which gives t4 t0) and NT96, then NT96 needs to produce the remaining tokens: t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t2.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right because the initial split would produce t4 t0, but the string is longer than that. Wait, no. Wait, the entire string is a single string, so if S splits into A and B, then A's derivation plus B's derivation must form the entire string.\n\nBut the given string is 31 tokens, and S's split is NT64 NT96. So each of these must derive a certain number of tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the length of the string. The string is 31 tokens. Each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the total number of tokens can vary depending on the paths taken.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try looking for a recursive descent parser approach or see if each token can be traced back through the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, since time is limited, perhaps looking for contradictions: if any part of the string can't be matched by any production, the answer is No.\n\nLooking at the first token: t0.\n\nFor NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which can produce t4 and t0 (as per NT84\u2192t4 and NT62\u2192t0). So one possibility for the first part is t4 t0. But the string starts with t0, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps S \u2192 NT64 NT96, but let's see another possibility.\n\nWait, S has other production rules besides NT64 NT96. Wait, in the initial CFG, the first line after the grammar shows S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So S can split into three options: NT64NT96, NT97NT7, or NT35NT84. \n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as lines starting with S ->, each line being a production. So the grammar has S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, S \u2192 NT35 NT84, and many other productions for the NTs leading to terminals.\n\nSo the first step is choosing which production of S to take. For the string starting with t0, which production of S could lead to t0.\n\nLooking at the other productions of S: S \u2192 NT97 NT7. Let's see what NT97 and NT7 can yield.\n\nNT97's production: looking back, NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, which could lead to t0 and t2 (since NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26, and NT98\u2192t1, NT26\u2192t3, so t1 t3, but wait, no. Let me parse step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75, and NT43 \u2192 t0, and NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26. NT98 \u2192 t1, NT26 \u2192 t3, so NT75 produces t1 t3. Thus, NT97 produces t0 t1 t3.

{"custom_id":"request-581","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar structure. It looks like every non-terminal symbol (NT) is expanded into two other non-terminals, except for those that directly produce terminals (t0, t1, etc.). That makes sense since CNF requires productions to have two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly expands to NT64 NT96. So any string generated by this grammar must ultimately break down to these components.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of t's and numbers. Let me write it down and see:\n\nt0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t2 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1\n\nSo 33 tokens in total. Each token represents a terminal symbol, and I need to see if they can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI think the standard approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can try a recursive descent approach or maybe use a parse table.\n\nFirst, since S starts with NT64 NT96, the string should start with the symbols from these two. Let's see what NT64 and NT96 expand to.\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nSo S expands to NT84 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nNow, the string starts with t0. Let's trace back each step.\n\nEach NT symbol in the expansion will produce certain t symbols. The idea is to traverse the string from the beginning, matching the symbols as we go along according to the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree. Let me see:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT64 NT96 \u2192 NT84 NT62 NT54 NT53.\n\nSo, the first token must come from NT84, and the next from NT62, then NT54, then NT53.\n\nBut the string starts with t0, so I need to see how NT84 produces a t. Looking at the rules, I see that NT84 has several productions:\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 (but that's a terminal t1)\nNT84 \u2192 t0 (right there)\nNT84 \u2192 t0\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT84 are:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\nNT84 -> t0\nNT84 -> t2\n\nSo, NT84 can produce t0, t2.\n\nSo the first token t0 must come from NT84. Good.\n\nThen the next part: from NT62.\n\nNT62's productions are:\n\nNT62 -> NT52 NT63\nNT62 -> NT47 NT12\nNT62 \u2192 t0\n\nSo NT62 can produce t0 as well. So the second t0 is from NT62, which is fine.\n\nNext is NT54.\n\nLooking at NT54:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT12 NT27\nNT54 \u2192 NT86 NT33\nNT54 \u2192 t2\n\nWait, looking again, the rules for NT54 are:\n\nNT54 -> NT12 NT27\nNT54 -> NT86 NT33\nNT54 -> t3\n\nWait, maybe I misread earlier. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the rule for NT54 is:\n\nNT54 -> t4\n\nWait no, let me scan the grammar again. Here's part of the CFG:\n\nNT54 -> t4 (maybe) or some other terms? Wait no, in the initial part, I see:\n\nLooking back, I have:\n\nNT54 -> t4.\n\nWait, actually, from the initial grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT54 is mentioned in several places. Let me find all occurrences:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT54 -> t4\nNT54 -> NT12 NT27\nNT54 -> NT86 NT33.\n\nWait, no, looking at the full grammar:\n\nI think I might have errors in my earlier analysis, but let me re-examine.\n\nLooking through the top part of the grammar:\n\nNT53 -> NT86 NT33\nNT54 -> t4\nNT54 -> NT12 NT27\nNT54 -> is there another rule?\n\nWait, in the full list of grammar rules provided, let me see:\n\nNT54 has multiple productions:\n\n- NT54 -> t4\n- NT54 -> NT12 NT27\n- NT54 -> NT86 NT33\n\nYes, so NT54 can produce t4, or combinations leading to t's.\n\nSo, after the initial NT54, the next token is t4. So that matches. So the third token is t4.\n\nMoving on, then NT53.\n\nNT53 has rules:\n\nNT53 -> NT86 NT33\nNT53 -> NT39 NT80\nNT53 -> t2\n\nSo to get t4 as the fourth token, but wait, no. Wait the string after the first five tokens is t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 ... Wait, let me count.\n\nWait the string is:\n\n1: t0 (NT84)\n2: t0 (NT62)\n3: t1 (NT?)\n4: t4 (NT?)\nWait, hold on, let me recount.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\nt0, t0, t1, t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t1, t4, t2, t4, t0, t0, t4, t0, t0, t2, t0, t2, t2, t0, t0, t2, t0, t0, t4, t0, t3, t4, t1.\n\nWait, no, let me count:\n\n1: t0\n2: t0\n3: t1\n4: t4\n5: t4\n6: t4\n7: t4\n8: t4\n9: t1\n10: t4\n11: t2\n12: t4\n13: t0\n14: t0\n15: t4\n16: t0\n17: t0\n18: t2\n19: t0\n20: t2\n21: t2\n22: t0\n23: t0\n24: t2\n25: t0\n26: t0\n27: t4\n28: t0\n29: t3\n30: t4\n31: t1\n\nWait, the fourth token is t4. Let me track back.\n\nAfter the initial S expansion: NT84, NT62, NT54, NT53.\n\nToken 1: NT84 \u2192 t0\nToken 2: NT62 \u2192 t0\nToken 3: NT54 \u2192 t4\nToken 4: NT53 ?\n\nWait, the fourth token is t4, but the symbol is NT53. How can NT53 produce a terminal? Let's see.\n\nNT53 can produce t2 (as per one of the rules: NT53 -> t2). So token 4 is supposed to be t4, but NT53 can only produce t2. That's a problem. So that would mean the fourth token is t4, which doesn't match NT53's production. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait the fourth token is t4, but NT53 can only produce t2 or via other rules, which go into non-terminals.\n\nSo, if the fourth symbol is t4, but the non-terminal NT53 can't produce t4, that would mean a problem here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\n1: t0\n2: t0\n3: t1\n4: t4\n\nSo the fourth token is t4, but after NT54 was t4, the next symbol is being produced by NT53. NT53 cannot produce t4, so that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the order of production.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT64 NT96, but wait, looking back, I realize that S could also produce NT97 NT7 and other options. Wait, no, S was given as S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, etc. Wait, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nThe user input was:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT64 NT96\nS -> NT97 NT7\nS -> NT35 NT84\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\nNT1 -> NT5 NT77\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\nNT53 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-603","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of t's and numbers, and the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, I notice that each production on the left of the arrow results in either a terminal ('t0', 't1', etc.) or a combination of two non-terminals (like S -> NT64 NT96). But wait, some of the non-terminals are also expanded into other non-terminals, making the parse tree potentially deep.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t1 t0 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2 t1 t1`. That's 32 symbols long, mostly t0 and t1, with some other numbers interspersed. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to perform a top-down or bottom-up parsing. Maybe a recursive descent approach would work since the grammar is in CNF. But given the size of the string, a top-down approach with memoization or using the parse table might be necessary.\n\nAnother idea is to model this as a tree where each node represents a non-terminal, and its children are the non-terminals it expands into. Each leaf node would be a terminal (like 't0', etc.). If I can parse the entire string into such a tree structure, then the string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT64 NT96. So the string should start with a production that expands into NT64 and NT96. Let's see. NT64 -> NT84 NT62, and NT96 -> NT54 NT53. Then each of those would expand further.\n\nWait, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. The string starts with t0, which is a terminal. So I need to see if any non-terminal produces t0. Looking through the grammar, several non-terminals end with '->' to 't0' or 't1'. For example, NT3 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't1', etc. So t0 comes from NT3, NT68, NT21, NT54, etc.\n\n2. Starting from S, we have to expand S into NT64 and NT96. So the first two symbols (NT64 and NT96) should be t0 or whatever their terminals are. Wait, no, because in the string, it's the symbols that are terminals or non-terminals. So for example, each symbol in the string is either a terminal or part of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. In the given string, each token is either a terminal symbol or part of a non-terminal's expansion. So, each symbol in the string must be a terminal or correspond to a non-terminal that can expand into the current symbol.\n\nFor example, the first symbol is t0. So in the parsing tree, the root S must have two children, each of which can produce t0 or their respective expansions. But wait, S directly expands into two non-terminals, NT64 and NT96. So each of those must produce a string that, when combined, gives t0 t0 t0... So let's consider how NT64 and NT96 generate the string.\n\nNT64 expands into NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 expands into NT4 and NT1. NT4 is 't1', NT1 is 't2'. So NT84 generates t1 t2. But in the string, after t0 (from S), the next few t0s come first, so perhaps this path isn't the correct one.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused because I'm not parsing the entire string step by step. Let me try another approach. Since the string is quite long, maybe I can check the leftmost derivation.\n\nLet's start with S: S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nSo the string starts with NT64 followed by NT96. Let's look at how NT64 and NT96 can expand into the t0's.\n\nWait, maybe I should first see what each NT can derive. Let's take NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 NT4 NT1 NT62.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the production paths that lead to a terminal 't0' in the right order.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t0, t0, t0. So three t0s in a row. Maybe S's expansion into NT64 and NT96 can each produce t0, which would make t0 t0 so far. But then the third t0 would come from the third symbol, but S only produces two symbols. Wait, that can't be because S is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, so the string after S would start with the expansion of NT64, then NT96.\n\nWait, no. Each non-terminal in the S \u2192 NT64 NT96 expansion produces a string, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT64's expansion and NT96's expansion. So the string is (NT64 productions) followed by (NT96 productions).\n\nSo let's see: if NT64 produces something that starts with t0, and NT96 also starts with t0, then the string would start with t0 t0...\n\nLooking at NT64's production: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 \u2192 NT4 NT1 NT62 \u2192 NT4 is t1, NT1 is t2, NT62 is ... wait, NT62 \u2192 NT48 NT52? NT48 \u2192 NT96 is 't4', but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for possible t0 derivations.\n\nLooking at NT21 \u2192 't4' (since NT21's production is 't4'). Hmm, not helpful. Wait, NT96: NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. NT54 \u2192 NT47 NT96? Wait, NT54 can be expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for each non-terminal that can derive a 't0' terminal.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, NT3 -> 't0', NT68 -> 't0', NT21 -> 't4' (but wait, in the input, is there a 't4' in the string? Let me check. The string is: t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t1 t0 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2 t1 t1. So there are t0, t1, t4, etc., but not t2 in the beginning.\n\nWait, maybe I should see if S can produce a t0 in the initial step. But S\u2192NT64 NT96. So if either NT64 or NT96 can start with t0, and the other part can produce the rest. But looking at NT64: NT64\u2192NT84 NT62\u2192 NT4 NT1\u2192 t1 t2. So the first symbol would be t1, not t0. Similarly, NT96\u2192 NT54 NT53\u2192 NT86 NT33\u2192 t0 NT33. Wait, NT86 \u2192 't0', so NT96 after two steps gives t0 from NT86, but then NT33 can derive more.\n\nWait, maybe let's look at NT86: NT86 \u2192 't0'. So if NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33. NT86 is 't0', and NT33 can produce more.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT64 (which gives t1 t2) and then NT96 (which gives t0 ... ). So the string would start with t1, t2, t0, ... which is not matching the input's first t0. So this suggests that maybe this path isn't the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another production for S that I'm missing. Wait, the given grammar has S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So there are three possibilities for S.\n\nLet me check each possibility.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nNT97\u2192 't2'. NT7 \u2192 't2'. So this production would yield t2 t2. The input starts with t0, so this might not be applicable unless later steps can derive t0.\n\nSecond, S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nNT35\u2192 't3'. NT84\u2192 't2'. So this would produce t3 t2.

{"custom_id":"request-601","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. The grammar starts with S, which branches into combinations of NTs. Each NT eventually leads to a terminal 'tX' or a fixed string like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, I see it consists of a series of t's with different indices (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4). My task is to trace how this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe grammar includes rules that connect non-terminals to other non-terminals, which in turn expand into terminals or more non-terminals. For example, NT64 can produce 't4', NT3 into 't0', NT7 into 't2', and so on.\n\nTo approach this, I think of the string as a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals. Since the string length is 35, the tree would have a depth corresponding to log2(35), which is not exact, but this can be handled as the grammar allows left and right branches.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into parts that might correspond to specific non-terminals. For example, t0 can come from NT3, NT4, NT5, etc. Similarly, t4 can come from NT64, NT24, NT54, etc.\n\nIt's also useful to note that some non-terminals have direct terminal productions. For instance, NT64 -> t4, which would be one step. So if I see t4, it's likely from NT64.\n\nLooking at the string, I can try to split it into sections. The first t0 might come from NT3. Let's see: NT3 decomposes into NT22 and NT74. NT22 breaks down into NT82 and NT48. NT48 is t1, and NT82 is NT24 or NT77. NT24 leads to t4, and NT77 is either 't2' or 't3'. Here, NT77 in the production rules is sometimes 't2' and sometimes 't3' based on the case. But in our string, we have t2 as the next after t0, so perhaps it's a specific case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it by building a parse tree. But since the string is quite long, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can track the possible non-terminals that can generate each terminal, moving from left to right.\n\nLet me try another approach: count the number of t's and see how they can be generated. The string has 35 tokens, so the parse tree must have enough symbols to produce 35 nodes.\n\nI notice that the grammar can be simplified by looking for non-terminals that map directly to t's. For example, NT68, NT64, NT35 can all produce t4, t4, and t3 respectively.\n\nWait, NT35 -> t3, which is t3, and NT64 -> t4. So if I see t3, it might come from NT35. Similarly, t4 from NT64.\n\nLooking at the string, the order is: t0, t0, t0, t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t1, t4, t2, t2, t0, etc.\n\nI think this can be broken down by considering each production step. For example, since the start symbol is S, which has three possible productions: NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, NT35 NT84.\n\nWait, no, the start symbol S has three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nI think I need to see if the string can be derived from one of these initial productions.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96. So the derivation starts with NT64 and NT96. NT64 can produce t4, and NT96 can produce t4 as well? Wait, from the rules, NT96 can be 't4' or split into NT54 and NT53. Looking back, NT96 -> NT54 NT53. Then NT54 is 't3' and NT53 is 't2' sometimes or other combinations.\n\nWait, no: The productions for NT96 are:\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53 (from the first part of the grammar) as well as NT54 NT53 in the last part. Wait, looking back, perhaps I need to parse all possible productions for each NT symbol.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NT symbols have multiple production rules, like NT47 has two options: NT21 NT3 or NT1 NT62. So, for example, NT47 can be split in different ways. So when trying to parse the string, each step could have multiple possibilities.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should use a parsing strategy, such as recursive descent, but without implementing the actual parser code, just by hand.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that the grammar seems deterministic because each non-terminal has only two options, and sometimes one path leads to terminal symbols directly.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t0, t0, t0, t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t1, t4, t2, t2, t0, etc.\n\nLet me think about the possible start.\n\nLooking at the options for S:\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96\nSo NT64 and NT96 will generate the first two parts of the string. If both produce t0, t0 or t0 followed by other t's.\n\nLooking up NT64 in the grammar: NT64 \u2192 t4 (since in the rules, NT64 -> NT84 NT62, and further, NT84 gives t2, NT62 gives 't2', but looking at another rule, NT64 can also go to 't4'? Wait no, checking the rules:\n\nLooking for NT64: The rules are:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nOther rules for NT64? No. So NT64 decomposes into NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 decomposes into NT4 and NT1, which in turn produce t1 and 't0' respectively? Wait, NT4 is not in the grammar. Wait, the grammar starts with S, S has NT as non-terminals, so let me check: NT47 is one of the non-terminals, and it has multiple production rules. But looking for NT4, is that present? Wait, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are combinations like NT64, NT96, etc. The terminal symbols are t0, t1, etc., but in the grammar, some non-terminals are replaced by terminals, like NT68 \u2192 t0, NT47 \u2192 t1, etc.\n\nWait, no: The grammar's productions are as follows. For example, NT96 \u2192 't4' (is this correct? Or does NT96 have a production rule leading to terminals?) Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT96: The rules for NT96 are:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nBut wait, does NT96 have any direct terminal production? Looking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t0\n- NT47 \u2192 t1\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT68 \u2192 t0\n- NT97 \u2192 t2\n- NT98 \u2192 t1\n- NT77 \u2192 t2\n- NT35 \u2192 t3\n- NT78 \u2192 t0\n- NT36 \u2192 t2\n- NT54 \u2192 t3\n- NT84 \u2192 t2\n- NT12 \u2192 t3\n- NT39 \u2192 t0\n- NT62 \u2192 t0\n- NT43 \u2192 t0\n- NT53 \u2192 t2\n- NT80 \u2192 t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t4\n- NT5 \u2192 t2\n- NT74 \u2192 t3\n- NT82 \u2192 t4\n- NT54 \u2192 t3\n- NT81 \u2192 t1\n- NT24 \u2192 t4\n- NT38 \u2192 t4\n- NT70 \u2192 t2\n- NT27 \u2192 t2\nWait, I think I might have to clarify.

So all the S and NT rules here fit that because each is replaced by two NTs, not containing any terminals except in the leaves. \n\nThe string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, which I think are the terminal symbols. The grammar has several terminal symbols: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, etc. So each 'tX' in the string corresponds to a terminal derived from the grammar. \n\nThe first step is probably induction: see if each 'tX' matches any of the terminal rules, and then check if the string can be generated by the non-terminals through the given productions.\n\nLet me list all the terminal symbols and their corresponding NT rules:\n\n- t0: NT96, NT39, NT59 (Wait, actually looking at the rules, for example, NT39 -> 't0', but in the initial list, NT39 isn't defined beyond that. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the NTs that produce terminals are things like NT3->'t0', NT68->'t0', etc. So any NT that can directly produce a 'tX' must be one of those.\n\nWait, the grammar has the following NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n- NT68 -> 't0' (multiple rules)\n- NT96 -> 't4'\n- NT5 -> 't2'\n- NT77 -> 't2'\n- NT1 -> 't2'\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't1' (multiple rules)\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT68 -> 't2' (multiple rules)\n- NT21 -> 't4'\n- NT52 -> 't4'\n- NT43 -> 't0'\n- NT34 -> 't4'\n- NT96 -> 't3'\n- NT62 -> 't0'\n- NT97 -> 't0' (multiple rules)\n- NT47 -> 't4' (multiple rules)\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT98 -> 't1' (multiple rules)\n- NT75 -> 't98' (Wait, that doesn't make sense; perhaps a typo. Let me check the grammar again.)\n\nWait, actually, looking again, all the rule endings are 'tX', so for example, NT97 -> 't2', NT98 -> 't1', etc. So each terminal rule is directly producing a 'tX'.\n\nSo first, I need to see if each 'tX' in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, which they all do: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4.\n\nNow, to check if the string can be generated, I can try to reduce it using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production expands S into two NTs, and each NT can only lead to terminals or other NTs, but ultimately, they all terminate in terminals.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, maybe the best approach is to check whether the grammar can derive a string of this form by ensuring that each step of reduction can produce the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a parse tree, ensuring that each terminal in the string can be matched by some path in the grammar.\n\nBut since the string is given, maybe it's easier to try to see if each 'tX' can be generated directly or through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to think about the start symbol S, which has three possible productions in the grammar:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo the string must start with the concatenation of two NTs from one of these options.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t0 t0 t2...\n\nSo the first part is t0 t0. Let's see if the start symbol can produce something starting with t0 and t0.\n\nIf we pick option 1: NT64 and NT96.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nThen NT84 -> 't4' or NT84 -> NT4 NT1, which can produce more NTs.\n\nWait, but we need to match the first two symbols as 't0 t0', so perhaps this path is too long. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should pick option 3 first: S -> NT35 NT84.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't0', so NT35 might produce 't0'? Let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT35 -> 't3'? No, waiting no, looking at the terminal productions, I see NT33 -> 't1', NT35 -> 't3' (the rule is NT35->'t3').\n\nWait, no. Wait, the production NT35 is: from the given rules, line: NT35 -> 't3'. So that would produce 't3', which doesn't match the first 't0'. So S -> NT35 NT84 would start with 't3 ...', which doesn't match the given string.\n\nSo option 3 is out. Next, option 1: NT64 NT96.\n\nLooking at NT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nThen, NT84 can be either 't4' or NT84 -> NT4 NT1.\n\nFor the first symbol 't0', NT64's first production gives 't4' (since NT64 leads to 't4'), which is not 't0'. So that's a problem. So the first symbol 't0' cannot come from NT64 in the first production. Alternatively, perhaps the NT64 might lead to a different symbol.\n\nWait, no. NT64 is a non-terminal, so it must produce a sequence of symbols. So the first element of the string is 't0', which means that the first NT in S's production must reduce to 't0' as its first symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe given string is long, but I can look for patterns or possible reductions. Since the string is broken down into tokens: t0, t0, t2, t1, t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t1, t3, t2, t2, t0, t1, t0, t2, t0, t0, t4, t0, t0, t4, t0, t2, t2, t0, t1, t2, t4, t0, t3, t2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check if each token is in the grammar, but I think all are covered as terminals. But more importantly, the way they are combined is crucial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a reduction step by step.\n\nStart with the string: t0 t0 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t22 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t3 t2.\n\nWait, wait, I notice that towards the end, there's a 't22', which might be a typo since in the grammar NT77->'t2' and other NTs. It's possible that 't22' is a mistake; perhaps it's 't2' or another t.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed, assuming all 't's with digits are valid.\n\nSo first, S can produce three possible options. Let's see which options could generate a string starting with t0.\n\nLooking at the first symbols of each option:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96: the first NT64 can produce 't4' (if following NT64->'t4'), or further into NT84 NT62. If NT64->'t4', then the first symbol is 't4', which does not match 't0'. So this path can't match the string.\n\n2. S -> NT97 NT7: NT97, according to the rules, can produce 't0' in one step (NT97->'t0'). So if S uses this production, the first symbol would be 't0', which matches. Then the second NT is NT7, which according to the rules can produce 't2' (NT7->'t2'). So the next symbol would be 't2', matching the first two symbols t0 t0 t2... Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-624","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. Wait, no, actually, Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production rule be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules follow this structure, so that's correct.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols starting with t0 and ending with t4, etc. Each symbol is a terminal. So, the grammar's start symbol S must be rewritten into this string through a series of productions.\n\nThe first step is to see how S can be rewritten. The grammar provides three options for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the string starts with t0, which suggests that the first part of the derivation should produce t0. I'll check each option:\n\nLooking at NT64: The rule for NT64 is NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. From the rules, NT84 can go to 't2' (from the rule NT84 \u2192 't2'), and NT62 \u2192 't0' (NT62 \u2192 't0'). So NT64 \u2192 t2 t0, which is t2 t0. So the start symbol S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would lead to t2 t0 followed by whatever NT96 produces.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t0, so maybe this isn't the right path. Let me check the other options.\n\nSecond option: S \u2192 NT97 NT7. Let's see what NT97 and NT7 produce.\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75 (from NT97's rule). Then:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT1 NT62 (from NT43's rule). NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3 (rule for NT5: NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3). NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12 (rule for NT68), and so on. This seems complicated, but let me see if it can lead to t0 at the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, the third option: S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT84 NT81 (from NT35). NT84 \u2192 't2' as per rule NT84 \u2192 't2'. NT81 \u2192 NT54 NT81 (from NT81 \u2192 't1'), and NT54 \u2192 't3' (looking at the rules, NT54 \u2192 't4'). Wait, no, NT54's rule is NT54 \u2192 't4'? Let me check: under symbols, NT54 is in the list and maps to 't4' via several rules. Wait, no, looking more carefully, under NT54 we have:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't4' because lines like NT54 \u2192 't4' are present.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the 'symtable' provided, let me list the ones ending with a terminal:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 (symtable shows NT66 \u2192 't4' because NT52 \u2192 't2' via rule 52, and NT63 \u2192 't4'? Wait, maybe not. Let me look again at each rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t0. So, the start symbol S must derive a string starting with t0. Let's check each option for S and see what their initial symbols are.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96. NT64's production leads to NT84 (t2) and NT62 (t0), so NT64 \u2192 t2 t0. NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, and each of those: NT54 \u2192 t4, NT53 \u2192 t2 (via NT53 \u2192 't2'). So NT96 \u2192 t4 t2. Thus, S \u2192 NT64 NT96 \u2192 t2 t0 t4 t2. So the first symbols would be t2 t0 t4 t2. The string starts with t0, so this doesn't match. So this option is probably not the one.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT97 NT7. Let's see NT97 and NT7.\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. NT43 \u2192 NT1 NT62. NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77. Then NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3. NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12. NT47 \u2192 either NT1 NT62 (via rule 16: NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62) or other rules. Wait, looking at the rules, some have 't' outputs. Let's see NT47's rules: the first is NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which we've seen leads to t1 and t0. But there are other rules? Or maybe it's fixed to those.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under the productions, there are some NT47 rules that are t1. Wait, actually, the user provided a long list of rules ending with terminal symbols, which are the outputs.\n\nLet me list all the NT productions:\n\nLooking at the rules, many are in the form NTx \u2192 other NTs, but some end with terminals. So, for example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nBut also, NT47 \u2192 't1' in some production? Wait, no, looking at the symtable, there's a line NT47 -> 't1' under NT47's definitions. So maybe NT47 can also produce t1.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar has NT47 as either NT1 NT62 or 't1'.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user said the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, but the provided rules include both non-terminals and terminals as outputs. So for example, NT68 \u2192 't0', NT47 \u2192 't1', etc. Let me list all where a non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal.\n\nFrom the provided rules, for NT:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n- NT3 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't1' (from NT4 \u2192 't1' via a production rule)\n- NT6 \u2192 't1' (NT6 \u2192 't1')\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' (NT8 \u2192 't0'), etc. Wait, but actually, looking at the symtable, each symbol is either a non-terminal or terminal.\n\nWait, the symbols can be either NT (non-terminals) or t1, t2, etc. So, for example, NT64's rule is NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 \u2192 't2', NT62 \u2192 't0', so NT64 \u2192 't2 t0', etc.\n\nSo, for S \u2192 NT97 NT7, we need to see what NT97 and NT7 produce.\n\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75 (from the rule). NT43 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which produces t2 t0, as earlier. NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26 (from NT75's rule). NT98 \u2192 NT47 NT14, etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated, so maybe let's check option 3.\n\nOption 3: S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT84 NT81. So, NT35 \u2192 NT84 \u2192 't2' and NT81 \u2192 NT54 NT81. NT54 \u2192 't4', and then NT81 \u2192 't1'.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT84 NT81.\n\nNT84 \u2192 't2'.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT54 NT81.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo NT81 \u2192 't1' (since when NT81 is followed by another NT81, it must be due to a rule that allows that). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the non-terminal NT81's rule is NT81 \u2192 't1' in some cases? Let me check.\n\nFrom the rule list, looking for NT81:\n\nIt seems NT81 is defined as NT84 NT81 (from NT81 \u2192 't1') but wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see under NT81: 't1' is one of the possibilities? Wait, no, under the NT81 rule, I see:\n\nNT81 -> 't1' [is that from a production rule? Let me check: looking through the rules, I see NT81 -> 't1' once.]\n\nSo, NT81 can produce either NT54 NT81 (which would apply if it's followed by something else) or 't1'.\n\nSo, for NT35 \u2192 NT84 NT81:\n\nNT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-642","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I know is a specific way of structuring CFGs where each production is either a single symbol -> two symbols, a terminal -> terminal, or a terminal -> non-terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, it seems more complex because some of the productions might be rules where two non-terminals produce another pair, some expand to terminals, and some are a bit ambiguous since the same non-terminal is used for multiple things.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the string we're evaluating: t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t0.\n\nThe string has a series of t's with numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. Some of them expand to specific t's, while others might expand to more non-terminals. To determine if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a way to derive the entire string starting from S using the given productions.\n\nI notice that the grammar's start symbol is S, and S is defined as NT47 NT96. So the initial expansion from S would have to be NT47 and NT96. Then, each of these NTs must expand further according to the productions.\n\nLooking at NT47, in the grammar, we see multiple productions for NT47. Wait, no, actually, looking again, I think I might have misread. The grammar as given seems to have some entries for the same NT, like NT47 -> NT1 NT62, but earlier I saw NT47 -> NT21 NT3. Let me check: the grammar starts with S -> NT64 NT96, and another option: S -> NT47 NT77, etc.\n\nWait, I might be mixing up the NTs. Let me list all the productions for each NT:\n\n- S and a few others are higher-level productions, but the first step is S -> NT64 NT96 or S -> NT97 NT7, or S -> NT35 NT84.\n\nSo for the given string, the first step is to see if it can start with any of these. Let's check the string starts with t0 t0 t0 t1... \n\nLooking at the first few terminals: t0, t0, t0, t1. Let's see how each t can be generated.\n\nFrom the grammar, for example, t0 can be generated by NT64, NT68, NT98, NT77, NT26, NT74, NT52, NT96, NT63, etc. Wait, no: looking at the productions, the terminals are directly expanded, but in the grammar, for example, NT68 can expand to 't0' or 't3' etc. Similarly, NT96 expands to 't4'.\n\nI think I need to trace a possible derivation. Let's start with S -> NT64 NT96. So the first step would produce two symbols: NT64 and NT96.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT64 -> NT84 NT62. So replacing NT64 with NT84 NT62. Then NT96 -> NT54 NT53. Then replace each of these:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1 (and so on, but this could get complicated).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this by looking at the string and seeing which parts can be matched step by step.\n\nAnother approach: The string starts with t0, and t0 can be generated by several NTs, such as NT68, NT96, NT77, NT26, NT74, etc. Let me see which of these are more likely given the next terms.\n\nThe string is: [t0, t0, t0, t1, ...]\n\nLet me consider the first t0. Suppose NT12 produces t3, but the first t0 is in position 0. So if I consider that the first t0 is generated by some NT that produces t0.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT68 can produce 't0', 't1', etc., and NT96 can produce 't4', so that might not fit the first t0. NT63 can produce 't1', but we have 't0' first, so we need a NT that produces 't0'.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't0' directly:\n\n- NT3: 't0' (production rule)\n- NT5: 't0'\n- NT68: 't0' and 't3'\nWait, in the grammar, NT68 can produce 't4', 't3', 't0', etc. So the 't0' could be produced directly from NT68.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 can produce 't4' and 't1', but for 't0', it might come from NT68.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, the productions are:\n\n- NT68 -> 't4', 't3', 't0', etc. So t0 can come directly from NT68.\n\nBut in the first step, S -> NT64 NT96. So after expanding S, we have NT64 and NT96. Now, NT64 expands to NT84 and NT62, and NT96 expands to NT54 and NT53.\n\nLooking at NT84 and NT54:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1, but that would produce the next symbols.\n\nWait, maybe if I can take a big picture approach, but this is getting messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can check for possible derivations using the productions.\n\nAnother thought: since the string starts with t0, and t0 can be generated by NT68, let's see if we can work backwards, but in this case, perhaps forward.\n\nWait, the string starts with t0, which is 't0'. Could that come from NT97's production? Looking at the grammar, NT97 -> NT43 NT75. No, that's 't0' for NT97? Let me check: NT97 has a production \u2192 't1' (looking through the grammar).\n\nNo, looking at the grammar, NT97 -> 't1'. So that's 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT98 -> 't1', so that would give 't1' directly.\n\nNT47 can produce 't4' and 't3' as well as NT1 etc.\n\nBut the first symbol is 't0', and looking at the grammar, NT63 can produce 't1', NT3 can produce 't0' and 't5' perhaps? Wait, let's see:\n\nFrom the grammar's terminal productions:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0' (from NT3: 't0') and other rules? Wait, looking at the list again, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT3: 't0', NT68: 't0', NT63: 't1', NT54: 't1', NT84: 't2', NT12: 't3', NT33: 't1', NT53: 't2', NT66: 't4', NT77: 't3', NT96: 't4', NT47: 't4', NT12: 't3', and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

This is helpful because it simplifies the process of parsing and checking if a string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to follow CNF. For example, the start symbol S has two productions each time, like S -> NT64 NT96, and each NT is a non-terminal that eventually resolves to some combination of terminals or non-terminals. At the base level, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminal symbols. My approach here is to see if I can trace a path from the start symbol through the grammar, applying each production step-by-step to generate the string.\n\nThe string has 35 symbols, all of which are 't0's and 't1's except for a few 't4's. For example, I see t4 appears a few times: the 4th symbol is t4, then several t4s, followed by t0s, t2s, t1s, etc. \n\nI know that each production in the grammar either splits into two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal. So, the string starts with two t0s. Let's see where the terminals come from. The first production for S is S -> NT64 NT96. So, if S can produce NT64 and NT96, and then each of these NTs resolves to a combination.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT64 and NT96, I see NT64 -> NT84 NT62, and NT62 is a non-terminal that produces t0. NT84 can produce t2 or another combination. Wait, let me check each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the top-down parsing approach, where starting from S, we replace it according to the productions, and each time we expand a non-terminal, it needs to generate the correct sequence of terminals.\n\nBut manually tracing 35 steps could be time-consuming, so maybe I can look for patterns or see if the grammar allows multiple t0s and t1s as in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce t0 or t1. NT66 -> NT52 NT63, and both NT52 and NT63 have productions that include t0. Similarly, NT39 is connected to t0 and t1 through various productions.\n\nPerhaps the grammar contains multiple ways to produce sequences of t0s and t1s. Since the input string starts with two t0s, maybe that's possible.\n\nBut I'm also noticing that there are t4s in the string, which are terminal symbols. I need to check which productions result in t4. Looking at the grammar, I see NT47 -> NT1 NT62 and other productions but it's unclear if any NT directly produce t4.\n\nWait, checking the productions, let me look for any NT that produce 't4'. Scanning through, I see NT47 -> 't1', NT48 -> 't1', NT64 -> 't4', NT66 -> 't4', etc. Oh, so NT47 can produce t1, but NT48 and NT64 can produce t4 when they resolve.\n\nSo when do t4s appear? For example, the grammar has NT64 -> NT84 NT62, and NT84 can produce t4. Also, NT66 -> NT52 NT63, which may produce t4 as well.\n\nLooking at the string, the 4th symbol is t4. Maybe that comes from a production like NT47 -> NT1 NT62. Wait, but NT47 itself is a non-terminal that can produce t1, as NT47 -> 't1'. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify. NT64 can split into NT84 and NT62. NT84 can produce t2 or t4 based on other productions. Similarly, NT62 directly produces t0.\n\nSo if I have NT64 -> NT84 NT62, then NT84 might need to produce t4 to get a t4 in the string. So in that case, the production for NT84 would be something that eventually produces t4.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT84 -> NT4 NT1. So if NT84 is split into NT4 and NT1, which each produce terminals. NT4 -> 't1' and NT1 -> 't2' or 't0', depending on its current state.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, NT4 is actually 't1' and NT1 is 't2' under some conditions.\n\nWait, actually, for NT84 -> NT4 NT1, and both NT4 and NT1 have productions that eventually lead to terminals. Let me check:\n\nNT47 is connected to other NTs, but NT48 and NT64 are in the lower levels.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the grammar can produce a sequence of t0s and t1s, and how t4s come into play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, we can start expanding S, and see if we can generate the string step by step.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, it's impractical to do manually. So maybe a smarter approach is to see if all the terminals in the string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nThe terminals in the string are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4. Let's see if the grammar can produce these.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nSome NTs directly produce t0 ('t0'), some produce t1 ('t1'), some produce t2 ('t2'), and a couple of NTs (like NT35) produce t3, and a few produce t4.\n\nBut in the given grammar, the non-terminals that can produce t4 are those that eventually end up with a production that leads to NT47 or others that produce t4 directly.\n\nWait, in the productions, NT47 can produce NT1 and NT62. NT1 can produce t2 or t0. NT62 can only produce t0. So NT47 can't produce t4.\n\nWait, let me recheck. NT47->NT1 NT62, and NT1 is in the list:\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT1-> NT5 NT77, and NT5 produces 't2', NT77->t3 or t1. So NT1 can lead to t2 or t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT66->NT52 NT63. NT52 can produce t0 or another path, and NT63 is either 't1' or other paths leading to t1 or t2.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions like NT12-> 't3' or other paths.\n\nI think I'm getting too confused. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nThe string starts with t0 t0. Let's see which productions in the grammar produce t0.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT64 -> 't4' (from NT64->NT84 NT62, NT84->NT4 NT1, etc.) Wait, no, NT64 is not directly 't0' or 't1'.

{"custom_id":"request-670","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens: `t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t4 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4 t1 t2 t2 t4 t1 t2 t2 t0 t4 t0 t3 t1 t0 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1`. I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, which makes parsing easier.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Let me list out the productions to see what's possible. The start symbol is S, and it can go to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Each NT has further productions, and some of them directly produce a 't' followed by a number, others are non-terminals.\n\nMy approach should be to see if the given string can be derived from S by recursively applying the productions. Since the string is a series of 't's with numbers, I can think of each token as either being a terminal or a non-terminal that eventually leads to it.\n\nLet me start from the string and try to parse it. Chomsky Normal Form suggests that each step either consumes one token or combines two parts. However, since the problem is about generating the string, I might need to see if the string can be built up using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can perform a top-down parsing, starting from S and expanding it step by step. But that might be complicated given the depth of the productions.\n\nAnother way is to model this as a grammar that could generate the string by recursively breaking it down into smaller parts. The string is 39 tokens long, so the derivation would require several steps.\n\nLet me see what the initial productions for S can produce. The string starts with `t0 t0 t0 t1 t1...`. So the first thing to check is whether the string can start with S leading to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for NT68, it can produce 't0'. Also, NT64 can produce 't4', but I don't see a 't0' in NT66 or NT63. Let's check the start symbol S's productions:\n\nS -> NT64 NT96. Now, NT64 has rules: NT66 -> NT52 NT63, NT63 -> 't2', NT66 -> NT52 NT63, etc. Wait, perhaps I should look at the rules for each NT.\n\nFor example, NT68 can produce 't0'; NT96 can produce 't4'. But in the string, the first tokens are 't0 t0 t0', so that would require that S somehow produces three 't0's, but each NT can expand into two parts. So maybe S can generate either two NTs, each of which needs to produce the required tokens.\n\nWait, another thought: each production in the grammar is a two-step expansion, so for S, it's S -> NT A, where A is another NT. Each of those NTs can expand into two NTs or into a terminal. So to get a string of 39 tokens, the expansion would have to go down several layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the string as a sequence of t0, t1, t2, etc., and see if each t can be generated by some non-terminal and then check the overall structure.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to model this as trying to parse the string by splitting it into segments that match the productions. For example, starting from the beginning, can I split the string into two parts that each come from a production of a non-terminal?\n\nLooking at the first part: `t0 t0 t0 t1 t1...`. The first three t0s could be generated by, for example, some NTs leading to t0. Let's check if any NTs can produce t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT68 -> 't0' (multiple rules)\n- NT96 -> 't4' and others\n- NT35 gives 't3'; NT38 can produce 't3' or 't4'; NT98 can produce 't1', 't0', 't2'; NT77 -> 't2'; NT3 -> 't0'; NT53 -> 't2'; NT63 -> 't0'; NT54 -> 't1'; NT70 can produce 't4', 't2', etc.\n\nSo NT68 can produce 't0', NT3 can produce 't0'. So if a production leads to NT68, it could produce 't0' directly.\n\nLooking back at S, S can be NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, etc. Each of these is a pair of NTs. So if S is NT64 NT96, then each of them must expand into two tokens each, but wait, the string is a flat list, not nested. So perhaps the approach is to see if the entire string can be split into two parts, each generated by one of the two Nts in the production.\n\nFor example, S can go to NT64 NT96. So the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT64 generates and what NT96 generates.\n\nSo the string is `t0 t0 t0 t1 t1 t4 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4 t1 t2 t2 t4 t1 t2 t2 t0 t4 t0 t3 t1 t0 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1`. Let me count the tokens: 39 in total.\n\nIf S is NT64 NT96, then NT64 must generate the first half, and NT96 the second half. But wait, in a typical parse, each NT would generate a subset of the entire string, but since it's a flat list, we can model the derivation as each NT expanding into sequences of terminals or non-terminals that together form the string.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think recursively. Suppose each step involves taking a pair of Nts and breaking the string into two parts, each part being generated by one NT.\n\nSo starting with S, which is NT64 NT96, so we need to see if the string can be split into part1 and part2, where NT64 generates part1 and NT96 generates part2. Then, each of these parts can themselves be split if the NT's rules are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the first three 't0's in the string. Let's see if NT64 can generate multiple t0s.\n\nLooking at rules for NT64: NT64->NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT64 must split into NT84 and NT62.\n\nThen, each of those needs to generate part of the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT84 has rules: It can produce 't2', or go to NT47 NT7.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe some of the Nts can produce multiple t0's.\n\nWait, perhaps we can see which Nts can produce t0. So NT68 can produce 't0' directly. Also, NT3 can produce 't0'. So maybe S can go to these, but looking at the start symbol S's initial productions:\n\nS can go to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84.\n\nLooking at these:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96: Looking at NT64, it goes to NT84 NT62.\n\nNT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. So then NT84 can produce 't2' or go to NT47 NT7. So if NT64 is producing 't2's or further.\n\nWait, but the first part of the string starts with t0, so perhaps this path isn't suitable because NT64 can't directly produce t0. Wait, no\u2014NT64's immediate production is to NT84 NT62. NT84 can produce t2, and NT62 can produce t0. So if S is NT64 NT96, then S can generate, for example, a sequence where NT64's first rule (NT84 NT62) produces t2 t0, and then NT96 needs to produce the rest of the string. But the first token is t0, so that suggests that NT64's first expansion (t2 t0) is perhaps not the start. Maybe the entire string starts with some Nt that produces a t0.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's look for the start symbol S and see how it can produce the first token t0.\n\nLooking at S's options, the first option is S -> NT64 NT96. Then each of these Nts must generate the strings. Let's see: NT64 can expand into NT84 NT62. So what can that produce? NT84 can produce t2 or go further, but perhaps not t0.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol. In this case, the start symbol seems to be S, which expands into combinations of NT and T's.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the string is built. Each symbol in the string is either a 't' followed by a number or a non-terminal. The grammar has a lot of these NT and T rules, so I need to see if the string can be derived from S using these rules.\n\nLet's look at the grammar productions. The start symbol S can produce NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Each of these is a combination of two non-terminals. The string starts with t0 t0 t1, so I might need to find a path that starts with these.\n\nLooking at the T rules: NT68 -> t0, NT47 -> t1, etc. So each T rule maps a non-terminal to a specific terminal symbol. Maybe the string is built by a series of these T rules.\n\nI can try to reconstruct the parse tree. Maybe the string is generated through a series of steps where each T rule is applied to a non-terminal, producing a terminal symbol. But I have to make sure that the entire string is covered, meaning all symbols must be accounted for by the left-hand sides expanding into the right-hand sides until all T's are resolved into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can check whether the string can be split into parts that match the grammar. Each production rule has two non-terminals, so I might need to split the string into chunks of two terminals, but that might not work because some productions might involve more steps.\n\nWait, but all the production rules in the given grammar seem to directly correspond to T symbols. For example, NT68 directly becomes 't0', NT47 becomes 't1', and so on. So maybe each non-terminal is directly connected to a specific terminal in the string.\n\nIf that's the case, I can map each non-terminal to its corresponding terminal and see if the entire sequence is produced by S.\n\nSo I need to check which non-terminals correspond to each term in the string.\n\nLet's list the string again: t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t0 t3 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2.\n\nEach term in the string corresponds to a T rule. For example, t0 can come from NT68 or NT43, etc. So I need to see if there's a path starting from S that can produce this entire sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be generated by S through a series of expansions. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nEach non-terminal in the start symbol's production (S) is either a combination of NT64 and NT96, or NT97 and NT7, or NT35 and NT84. Each of these non-terminals will produce t symbols.\n\nLooking at the T rules, NT64 maps to 't4', NT35 maps to 't3', NT7 maps to 't2', NT96 maps to 't4'. So S could produce:\n\nNT64 (t4) + NT96 (t4) \u2192 t4 t4\nor\nNT97 (t2) + NT7 (t2) \u2192 t2 t2\nor\nNT35 (t3) + NT84 (t2) \u2192 t3 t2.\n\nBut the string starts with t0 t0 t1... which doesn't match any of these. Because t4 t4 would start the string as t4, but it's starting with t0.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the non-terminals in the left-hand side of the productions are actually combined via multiple steps, not just directly corresponding to a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the production tree. Let's see, S has to expand into two non-terminals, each of which can expand further until we get t's. So the entire string is a combination of these t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is structured in such a way that each T symbol is a non-terminal that ultimately evaluates to a specific t.\n\nFor example, let's check some T productions:\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62. So NT47 can produce t1 and t2 (since NT1 is 't2' and NT62 is 't0'). Wait, but in the first option, NT47 is directly 't1', so maybe that's a priority.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, trying to split it into non-terminals and terminals according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: since each T production directly maps to a terminal, the number of symbols in the string should be equal to the number of non-terminals in the derived tree. Wait, but in a CFG, the number of symbols increases with each production, especially with left- or right-recursive productions. But in this case, it's Chomsky Normal Form, so each rule is two non-terminals. So to reach the terminals, we might have to apply multiple rules.\n\nWait, no, actually, each production rule in CNF has exactly one symbol on the left and two on the right. So each application of a rule replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals increases by one each time. But in our case, the string is entirely terminals, so the number of non-terminals must equal the depth of the parse tree. But this might be getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing. Let's see: the string is a list of terminals. We start with S, which can produce a combination of two non-terminals. Each of those can produce another combination, until we reach the base cases which are the T symbols that map directly to terminals.\n\nSo, for example, each node in the parse tree is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a T symbol mapped to a terminal.\n\nBut since the string is all terminals, the entire parse tree must be such that all non-terminals are resolved into terminals.\n\nWait, no, the parse tree starts at S, which is a non-terminal, and it must derive into the string, which is a sequence of terminals. So the entire derivation must start from S and expand into the string, possibly through multiple steps.\n\nBut with the given T rules, each non-terminal is either a non-terminal that expands into more non-terminals, or a terminal. However, in the given rules, all the T symbols are defined as non-terminals except for the specific T's which are terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some T's like NT47, NT66, etc., are actually connected to terminals. For example, NT47 -> t1. So those are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nSo, for instance, if in the string there's a 't1', it could be from NT47.\n\nSo the idea is that the string is built by expanding non-terminals until all symbols are terminals. So each time you replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until you reach the T symbols which directly give terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the string is generated as a series of these replacements, ensuring that all symbols in the string are accounted for.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a bit complex, maybe I can construct a leftmost derivation step by step, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nBut considering the string is quite long (56 symbols), manually doing a leftmost derivation would be time-consuming and error-prone. Perhaps a better way is to look for a pattern or a way to break the string into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can assign the non-terminals to each part of the string and see if a coherent derivation can be constructed.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of whether the string can be matched by the grammar. Since all the T symbols in the string are generated directly from specific non-terminals (like NT47->t1, etc.), I can map the string's symbols to their non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to list the string and assign the corresponding non-terminals:\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t0 t3 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2\n\nLet's list the non-terminals for each t:\n\nLooking through the T rules, each T is defined as:\n\n- NT68 -> t0\n- NT47 -> t1\n- NT64 -> t4\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided has multiple rules, some of which are terminals, and others that split into two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces two non-terminals, NT64 and NT96. So the first step is to split the string into chunks that might correspond to the results of these initial productions.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts, the first part corresponding to NT64 and the second to NT96. The entire string is 36 tokens long, so each part should be 18 tokens. But wait, I should check the splitting. The first production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which would mean the string is split into two parts: from the start to whatever NT64 produces, and then NT96 from there.\n\nSo let's take the first 18 tokens as the part for NT64, which is \"t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t2 t0\". And the next 18 tokens as NT96: \"t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t0 t3 t2\".\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT96 can go directly to 't4' via the production NT96 \u2192 't4', which is under the CNF table. So NT96 can be matched directly to 't4'. Wait, no, let me check the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nLooking back, in the production list, I see NT96 -> 't4'. Yes, that's a single terminal. So the second part of the string should match 't4', but the given second part is longer than that. That seems like a contradiction. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the string is 36 tokens long. If S produces NT64 and NT96, each part would have a sequence that leads to the respective non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe there are multiple productions, and each non-terminal in NT64 and NT96 can split further until terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider that S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then each of those further splits into other non-terminals, which in turn lead to the t's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as trying every possible way to split the string step by step according to the grammar rules. That might be complex, but I can try.\n\nAnother approach is to try to find a sequence of productions that, when expanded, result in the given string. Let's start by looking at the initial split: S splits into NT64 and NT96. So the string can be divided into two parts, each derived from NT64 and NT96 respectively.\n\nLooking at NT96 \u2192 't4' is a terminal, but the second part of the string is longer than one token. So perhaps NT96 can split further into more non-terminals until it reaches the terminal. But the given grammar's NT96 production is only to 't4', which is a single terminal token. So the second part of the string must be exactly 't4', but here it's longer, so that might not work. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in splitting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial split isn't S\u2192NT64 NT96. Wait, in the grammar, S has three productions: S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, and S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So the string could be split into any of those. So perhaps it's possible that the string starts with NT97 or NT35, not necessarily NT64.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is 't0'. Let's see what NT97 and others produce. \n\nIn the grammar, NT97 \u2192 't2', and NT7 \u2192 't0'. So if the string starts with 't0', one possibility is NT7 \u2192 't0' or NT26 \u2192 't0' perhaps? Let me check the grammar for NT66: NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, and then NT52 \u2192 NT22 NT2, but I need to track the possible expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the beginning and try to match the string.\n\nLet's consider each production of S and see which can cover the string, starting with 't0'.\n\nProduction S \u2192 NT64 NT96: The first two tokens are 't0 t0', but NT64 produces 't4' or other options. Wait, let's see NT64 in the grammar: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, then NT84 is 't2' or can split further. Wait, this might get too complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the string is quite long, maybe it's better to use a parsing strategy, either top-down or bottom-up, using the grammar. Since the problem asks for yes or no, perhaps the string cannot be derived because one of the splits doesn't work.\n\nWait, looking back, when I considered S \u2192 NT97 NT7, and since the first token is 't0', how does that happen? NT97 \u2192 't2' (from the grammar: NT97 \u2192 't2'), so starting with 't2' would not match 't0'. So perhaps the first production S \u2192 NT97 NT7 can't be used because the string starts with 't0'. So maybe S must start with NT64 or NT35, which may have 't4' or other options.\n\nWait, looking at NT64 in the grammar: NT64 \u2192 't4' directly, but the production's first token is 't0', so that's a mismatch. Hmm, so perhaps that production can't be used either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S uses the production S \u2192 NT35 NT84. Let's see NT35 in the grammar: NT35 \u2192 't3' or NT35 splits into other non-terminals. If the first part is 't0', then that's a problem because NT35's initial production is 't3', not 't0'. So that might not be a fit either.\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Maybe I should look for any possible initial production that can lead to the string starting with 't0'. \n\nLooking at NT33: NT33 \u2192 't1' or can split into more non-terminals. So perhaps the string starts with NT33 \u2192 't1', but the first token is 't0', which doesn't match. Hmm. Wait, the string starts with 't0', so perhaps none of the initial productions start with 't0' except maybe NT7 \u2192 't0'? Yes, because NT7 \u2192 't0' is a terminal.\n\nSo maybe S \u2192 NT7 NT something. But looking at the S productions, none except S \u2192 NT97 NT7 allows for NT7 as one option.\n\nWait, no, S has three productions, and none can split into NT7 NT7. Let me see: S can produce NT97 and NT7, which are separate non-terminals. So to use S \u2192 NT77 NT7, perhaps? Wait no, the initial S productions are S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, and S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So none of these directly allow NT7 to be a part unless we go deeper.\n\nWait, so perhaps the string starts with NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, but NT66 is 't4'? Let me check: NT66 is defined as 't4'? Yes, because in the production list, NT66 \u2192 't4'. So if the string starts with 't4', then NT66 is possible. But the string starts with 't0', which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT26 \u2192 't3'? Wait, no, in the production list, NT26 is 't3', but the string starts with 't0'. So that's not a match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me try to track back possible expansions.\n\nThe first token is 't0'. Let me see what NT7 \u2192 't0', so maybe the first part of the string could be derived from NT7, which is a single step. But how does that fit into S's productions?\n\nWait, perhaps the string is split into S \u2192 NT97 NT7. Then NT97 \u2192 't2', and NT7 \u2192 't0'.

{"custom_id":"request-683","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar looks like. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and it has three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these primary non-terminals (NT) leads into other non-terminals, and some of them eventually produce terminal tokens (t0, t1, etc.). The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t3 t4 t4 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t3 t0`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production is two non-terminals, making parsing perhaps somewhat straightforward, but it might still require checking the entire structure step by step. Alternatively, I can try to derive the string step by step by expanding the non-terminals and seeing if it matches the given string.\n\nBut manually doing this for such a long string might take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to model this as a parse tree. Let me see if I can map each production to the terminals and see how the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, all its expansions produce two NTs. Each NT then expands into other NTs until it hits a terminal. The terminals produced by each NT are fixed, so maybe I can trace the derivation by looking up each terminal in the NT productions.\n\nWait, for example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, and NT4 \u2192 t1, etc. But since the grammar is small, perhaps I can model each NT and see the sequence of terminals they can produce.\n\nLet me create a table for each NT and see what terminals they can generate. That might help me see if the string is a combination of these.\n\nFor example:\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 \u2192 t1 t1 (since NT4 \u2192 t1 and NT1 \u2192 t2, wait no, wait NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT3 \u2192 etc. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, some NTs directly produce a terminal. For example, NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, and NT52 \u2192 NT22 NT48, and so on until it hits a terminal. So each NT can be seen as a chain that eventually produces a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, for each NT, I can represent it as a function that, when expanded, produces a string of terminals. The idea is that each NT's production leads to a specific terminal sequence.\n\nLooking at NT64: it produces NT84 and NT62. NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. NT4 \u2192 t1 (from NT4's production?), wait no: looking back, NT4 is part of other productions, but in the given grammar, NT4 isn't listed as a production except in S. Wait wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any production for NT4, except that in the string, t4 is produced by NT4. Wait, no: looking at the grammar's terminal productions, I don't see NT4 directly producing anything except perhaps in the S rule, but no, NT68 for example leads to t0, t1, t2, etc., but NT4 itself is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the grammar provided has many NTs, each with productions to other NTs or terminals. So each NT ultimately must expand into a sequence of terminals. For example, considering NT64:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 ? Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT4 \u2192 something. Wait, in the grammar, is NT4 present? Let me scan through the productions. Oh, I don't think NT4 is a primary non-terminal. All the NTs are like NT68, NT66, etc., but I don't see NT4 in the productions. Wait, then how does NT4 produce anything?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all the NTs present:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT47, NT66, NT64, NT53, NT74, NT96, NT39, NT24, NT38, NT12, NT5, NT3, NT68, NT97, NT84, NT63, NT47 again, NT68 again, NT3 again, etc. So NT4 isn't listed as an NT. So perhaps in the grammar, NT4 doesn't exist; maybe it's a typo or perhaps in the grammar, NT4 is a terminal. Wait, in the provided grammar, does any NT directly produce a terminal t4?\n\nLooking at the grammar, for instance, NT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14, and so on. Wait, in the terminal list, do any NTs produce t4?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production for t4 except in the string. Wait, perhaps t4 is produced by some NT, but in the given grammar, none of the NTs directly or indirectly produce t4. Because looking at all the NTs, none seem to have a production that leads to t4. For example, NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81, but 84 \u2192 t2, so t3 is involved somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each NT to its possible terminal sequences.\n\nFor example, starting with NT64:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nBut NT4 is not an NT; perhaps it's a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps NT4 is a non-terminal but there's no production for it. This seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again. In the grammar, the NTs are followed by their productions. For example:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7\nS \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\nNT74 \u2192 NT1 NT62\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\nNT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nWait, hold on, NT84 has a production NT4 nt1, but NT4 itself is not an NT in the grammar. I don't see any production for NT4. So this is a problem. How can NT84 produce NT4 if NT4 isn't defined?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps in the grammar, I made a mistake in reading it. Alternatively, maybe NT4 is a terminal, and in the grammar, the production is written as NT4 \u2192 t4. But in the given grammar, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps in the grammar, NT4 \u2192 t4, but it's not part of the provided productions except in the terminals. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again more carefully.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the way we can parse strings in this form. Each production is either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t0`.\n\nFirst, I think I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, every step in the parse should produce exactly one non-terminal, so the parsing can be done in a bottom-up or top-down manner. I'll start with the top-down approach, which means I'll try to find the leftmost non-terminal that can derive the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n\nSo, S is always a combination of two non-terminals. The string starts with t0 t0..., which are all terminal symbols. Since each production for S gives two non-terminals, the first step would be to see if either of these can produce the entire string.\n\nBut wait, it's more complex than that because each non-terminal can also produce other non-terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the non-terminals can end up producing these terminals. Alternatively, I might try to build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can derive the given string.\n\nI think I should maybe start by trying to match the string from left to right using the grammar. Maybe using a recursive descent approach or trying to apply the productions greedily. But because the grammar is quite large, managing this might be tricky.\n\nLet me first see if any of the non-terminals in the grammar directly produce terminals. Looking through the productions, I see that several NTs produce t0, t1, t2, t3, or t4. For example:\n\n- NT64 -> t4\n- NT66 -> t4\n- NT77 -> t3\n- NT33 -> t1\n- NT96 -> t4\n- NT7 -> t2\n- NT22 -> t4\n- etc.\n\nSo, many non-terminals directly produce single terminals. I can use this to my advantage by starting to reduce the string when a non-terminal is matched.\n\nLet me try to think about the string and break it down. The string starts with t0, t0, t0. So maybe the initial step produces something that leads to three t0s. Let me check which NTs produce t0.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT3, NT26, NT52, NT74, and NT97 produce t0. So the string starts with three t0s, so perhaps the initial production is one of these NTs.\n\nWait, but the entire string is 35 terminals. Let me count: the string has t0 repeated 9 times, t4 9 times, and t1, t2, t3 appearing 3 times each. So the string has a lot of t0 and t4, which might hint towards certain paths.\n\nLet me think about the possible starting non-terminals that produce t0. Let's pick one of them, say NT3, as it's in the top-level grammar symbols (since I might have a case where S \u2192 NTx, and then NTx \u2192 t0...).\n\nWait, actually, the S productions start with NT64, NT97, or NT35, none of which directly produce t0. For example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which further breaks down into more non-terminals. So the initial symbols in S are non-terminals, but they eventually resolve into terminals. So the first step is to produce two non-terminals, each of which eventually becomes a terminal.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t0, so the first symbol in the string is t0, which must come from one of the non-terminals in the grammar that can derive t0. But the first production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which would produce NT64 and NT96. The string starts with t0, so I need one of these NTs to produce t0, and then the other to produce the rest.\n\nBut wait, wait. No, because each production is a pair. So for example, if S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then the string would be the concatenation of what NT64 produces and what NT96 produces.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT64 is defined as NT84 NT62, which in turn are both NTs. Let's see what they can produce. NT84 \u2192 t4, so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT62 \u2192 t0. So NT64 would be NT84 (t4) and NT62 (t0). Then, when combined, NT64 would produce t4 followed by t0. Similarly, NT96: looking back, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nWait, let's break down NT96 step by step:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nNT54 \u2192 t1\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n\nNT86 \u2192 t0\n\nNT33 \u2192 t1\n\nSo NT53 \u2192 t0 t1. Therefore, NT54 NT53 \u2192 t1 t0 t1. So NT96 would produce t1, t0, t1.\n\nPutting it all together, the production S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would produce t4 t0 t1 t0 t1.\n\nBut the string starts with t0. So if S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which starts with t4, that's conflicting with the string's first t0. So that means S cannot derive the string via that production.\n\nSimilarly, let's check another S production: S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nLooking at NT97: NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75.\n\nNT43 \u2192 t0.\n\nNT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26.\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe instead of going too deep into each production, I should look for a path that can generate the string's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree starting from the given string and see if it can be reduced step by step using the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the entire string can be derived by repeatedly applying the productions, starting from S and expanding until I get all terminals.\n\nBut doing this manually for a string of 35 symbols is going to be tedious.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the grammar is ambiguous, so perhaps I can choose a particular derivation path.\n\nWait, let me try to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the leftmost non-terminal productions.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t0. Let's see if any NT can directly produce t0. From the production list, I see NT3, NT26, NT52, NT74, and NT97 all produce t0.\n\nSo perhaps the first NT is one of these. Let's choose, for example, NT97 \u2192 t0. Then, the next symbol should be the result of the second NT in the production.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT97 NT7. So the first NT is NT97, which produces t0, then the second NT is NT7. Let's see what NT7 produces.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT66 NT48\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT22 NT6\n\nNT63 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, looking back, I think I miswrote. Let me look up NT63:\n\nIn the grammar, NT63 \u2192 't2' ?\n\nWait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT22 NT6\n\nWait, no, NT52's production is: NT52 \u2192 NT22 NT6, but in the grammar, I think I might have mixed up NT52 and NT62. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking back, I have:\n\nNT62 \u2192 t0\n\nBut others, like NT52, are not directly listed as producing a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-708","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what the grammar and the string are. \n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminals here are 't0', 't1', 't2', etc., and some non-terminals seem to have terminal values, like NT64 -> 't4', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t1 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t3 t4 t4 t2 t2 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t3 t0.\n\nFirst, I think I need to build a parse tree for this string using the given grammar. Alternatively, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is a bit complex, it might be easier to trace the possible derivations.\n\nLet me list out the grammar productions that lead to terminals:\n\nNT64 -> t4\nNT66 -> t4\nNT70 -> t4\nNT74 -> t3\nNT84 -> t2\nNT86 -> t0\nNT54 -> t1\nNT33 -> t0 or t1\nNT96 -> t4\nNT77 -> t1 or t3\nNT98 -> t0\nNT47 can go to t4, t0, or t2 depending on the rules.\n\nWait, looking closer, some NT productions have multiple paths to the same terminal. For example, NT47 can go to 't4' in some cases or via other rules. Hmm, maybe I should check each part of the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach: starting from the top symbol S, which can lead to NT64 NT96 or other options. Since the string starts with t0 t0 t0 t1..., let's see how S can produce this.\n\nLooking at S -> NT64 NT96, which would produce t4 and t6? Wait, wait, NT64 is a non-terminal, it's defined as NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Let me check what NT84 and NT62 resolve to.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT4 is a terminal or not? Wait, in the grammar, NT4's only production is NT4 \u2192 't1'. So NT4 is t1. Similarly, NT1 is defined as NT5 NT77, and NT5 is NT68 NT3, etc. This could get complicated quickly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list all the NTs and their productions that lead to terminals. For instance:\n\nNT64: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62; NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1 \u2192 t1 t1? Wait, NT4 is t1, and NT1 is another NT, so probably t1. Wait no, NT47 is 't4' sometimes. Wait, maybe I need to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me try to write out the productions and terminals.\n\nFirst, NT47 can produce t4, t0, or t2 based on rules like NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which could lead to t2, or other rules like NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which if NT1 is t2, etc. Wait, maybe it's better to not get stuck here and think about the possible sequences.\n\nAlternatively, the string is 39 terminals long. Let me count them: 39 elements, which suggests that the derivation has to go through several steps. However, without building the entire parse tree, it might be tough.\n\nWait, the first three symbols are t0 t0 t0. Let's see if the grammar can start with three t0s.\n\nLooking at S, the only way to get t0s is through S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which would produce t4 (from NT64) and something else. But t4 is the first symbol, which doesn't match the first t0. So perhaps S isn't the starting point. Wait, S is the only top symbol, so the string must be derived from S.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The string is given, and we need to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Let me try to see if the first symbol t0 can come from any NT.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, some start with t0. For example, NT64 \u2192 t4, which is not t0. NT66 \u2192 t4, also not. NT96 \u2192 t4, no. NT77 \u2192 t1 or t3, no. NT78 \u2192 t0? Wait, looking through the list, NT78 is not present, but I see NT39 \u2192 't0'. Hmm, no, NT39 is not among the first productions. Wait, let me re-examine the list of NT productions.\n\nFrom the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't0' or 't1'\n- NT54 \u2192 't1', 't3', 't4'\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT38 \u2192 't0', 't4'\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT21 \u2192 't4'\n- NT27 \u2192 't0'\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n- NT64 \u2192 't4'\n- NT97 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't0'\n- NT84 \u2192 't2', 't1', etc.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. For example, NT33 is t0 or t1, depending on which rule it follows. So for example, NT33 can be \u2192 NT84 NT81 \u2192 t2 (from NT84) and t1 (from NT81) \u2192 so t2 t1? That's a possibility.\n\nWait, maybe the initial step is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, which are both non-terminals. NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 and NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Let me see what NT54 and NT53 can produce.\n\nNT54 has rules like 't1', 't3', 't4', so depending on the path, it could be 't1', 't3', or 't4'.\n\nNT53 \u2192 't86' (which is t0) or 't80' (t2) or something else? Wait, I think I might be getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that S \u2192 NT64 NT96 starts with t4 (from NT64) and then t4 (from NT96), but the string starts with t0, so that can't be right. So maybe the initial S is wrong, but that's impossible because S is the start symbol.\n\nWait, no. The string starts with t0, but according to the grammar, S can't start with t0. So either the string is invalid, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol S can go to NT64 NT96, which would be two non-terminals, each of which is a binary tree. So S produces two parts, each of which will generate sequences of symbols.\n\nBut in the given string, it starts with t0 t0 t0 t1..., which suggests that the first part of the string starts with t0. But according to the grammar, the first symbol from S's first part (NT64) is, for example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Let me see what NT84 and NT62 produce.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, which are both non-terminals. NT4 \u2192 't1', NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77, which leads to more non-terminals. So starting with t1, which is 't1', but the string starts with t0. So S's first option, NT64, starts with t1, which doesn't match the string's t0.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other S options:\n\nS \u2192 NT97 NT7. NT97 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. NT43 is something... looking through the grammar, NT43 is defined as something else, I think. Wait, I might not have all the details in front of me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the grammar has a rule that can lead to a t0 as the first symbol. Looking through the NT productions, I see NT33 \u2192 't0' or 't1'. So maybe S could derive to NT33 NT something else, but from the given S options, S doesn't directly point to NT33. So that might not be possible.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with t0, so the first part of the expansion must start with t0. So perhaps S's production must derive to a sequence that starts with t0. But all of S's options"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-726","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given and what I need to check.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT64 NT96. So the initial step is that the string starts with NT64 and NT96. I'll need to see if each of these can derive to a terminal string.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT64 and NT96:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT64 and NT96 derive into NT84 NT62 and NT54 NT53 respectively. Hmm, so the first step is S produces two non-terminals which then split further.\n\nEach NT in the grammar is further broken down, either into other NTs or terminal symbols 't0' to 't9' and other letters like 'NT'.\n\nBut wait, the string provided is a sequence of t's and numbers. For example, the string starts with t0 t0 t1 t4... so each of these must correspond to the terminals generated by the NT productions.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol S and apply the productions step by step, checking if the string can be derived by expanding the non-terminals correctly until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut with such a long string, this might be tedious. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be formed by recursively applying the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the entire expansion process. But first, let me see what the possible terminal symbols are. In the grammar, there are terminals like 't0', 't1', 't2', etc., up to 't9', and also some NTs like NT3, NT4, etc.\n\nWait, also, the NT productions sometimes result in terminals. For example:\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\nNT52 -> NT52 NT63 (looking at the given productions, I see that NT52 is defined as NT52 -> NT52 NT63), which is a left-recursive production. Similarly, NT27 is defined as NT27 -> NT24 NT62, and NT24 -> NT38 NT70, etc. There's also NT3 -> 't0', which means that NT3 directly produces 't0'.\n\nSo, perhaps I can parse the string by trying to match possible derivations.\n\nBut starting with S -> NT64 NT96. So the generated string should be the result of NT64 and NT96 expanding to their respective sequences, concatenated.\n\nSo first, NT64 expands to NT84 NT62.\n\nThen, each NT in NT84 and NT62 needs to be further expanded.\n\nLet me try to parse the string as follows:\n\nString: t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2 t1 t1\n\nSo, starting with S, which is NT64 NT96.\n\nLet me first look at NT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should be generated by NT84 and then NT62.\n\nNow, NT84 -> NT47 NT79?

For example, the productions for NT84 are listed as:\n\nNT84 -> NT47 NT79 (wait, no, looking back, perhaps I missed how each NT is defined.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT productions as given:\n\nS-> NT64 NT96\n\nS-> NT97 NT7\n\nS-> NT35 NT84\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\n\nNT1 -> NT5 NT77\n\nNT66 -> NT52 NT63\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nNT53 -> NT86 NT33\n\nNT7 -> NT66 NT48\n\nNT33 -> NT84 NT81\n\nNT38 -> NT34 NT27\n\nNT12 -> NT82 NT48\n\nNT5 -> NT68 NT3\n\nNT38 -> NT63 NT96\n\nNT14 -> NT33 NT27\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53\n\nNT39 -> NT70 NT39\n\nNT24 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT98 -> NT78 NT14\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nNT75 -> NT98 NT26\n\nNT53 -> NT39 NT80\n\nNT70 -> NT84 NT36\n\nNT27 -> NT24 NT62\n\nNT3 -> NT22 NT74\n\nNT68 -> NT47 NT12\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1\n\nNT63 -> 't1'\n\nNT47 -> 't1'\n\nNT68 -> 't0'\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\n\nNT98 -> 't1'\n\nNT86 -> 't0'\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nWait, looking at the productions again, some seem conflicting. For example, NT47 has two different productions:\n\nFirst line says NT47 -> NT1 NT62, then later lines have NT47 -> NT21 NT3, and also NT47 -> NT47 NT12? Wait, the user listed some lines, so let me check all NT47 productions.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of NT productions. Let me look again. Oh, in the user's message, under NT47, two productions are listed: one is NT47 -> NT21 NT3, another is NT1 -> NT5 NT77, and then again NT47 -> NT1 NT62. So perhaps it's a typo or I need to parse correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that the user made a mistake in listing, but perhaps the correct ones are:\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\n\nand\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nWait, but I'm not sure because in the user's list, NT47 is present in multiple places. Hmm, perhaps I need to parse this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some NT productions are overlapping. But to proceed, maybe I should list all the NT productions as given and then see how they can derive to the string.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to write a recursive descent parser for the grammar, as it's in Chomsky normal form. Chomsky normal form allows for each production to have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps I can approach this by trying to find a path through the grammar that can generate the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse-engineer the string to see if each terminal can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a top-down parsing problem, starting from S and expanding non-terminals step by step, checking if the string can be produced.\n\nBut given the string's length, this might be time-consuming. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the grammar as a tree and see if the string can be formed by the leaves of such a tree.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be matched by a terminal in the grammar, and see if the structure matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns in the grammar and see if the string conforms to them.\n\nFirst, note that the start symbol is S, which produces NT64 NT96. So the string must begin with the expansion of NT64 followed by NT96.\n\nSo, NT64 -> NT84 NT62, and NT96 -> NT54 NT53, as per the first few productions.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first t's are t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1...\n\nSo perhaps NT64 expands to something that starts with t0, and NT96 starts with t0 as well.\n\nLet me focus on NT64 first.\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62\n\nSo NT84 can be expanded. Looking at the productions for NT84:\n\nNT84 -> NT47 NT79? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-722","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar has several productions, and some symbols are terminals ('t0', 't1', etc.). The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t1 t1 t1 t0 t4 t1 t2 t4 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t1 t0 t2 t1 t0 t2 t0 t3 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string needs to match a derivation from the start symbol S down to the terminals.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So, the first step is to split the string into two parts: the first part generated by NT64 and the second part by NT96.\n\nLet's split the string into two substrings:\nSubstring 1: `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t1 t1 t1 t0 t4 t1 t2 t4 t1 t3`\nSubstring 2: `t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t1 t0 t2 t1 t0 t2 t0 t3 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2`\n\nWait, actually, the string is 38 tokens long. When S splits into NT64 and NT96, each should generate a substring. Let's count the tokens:\n\nNT64 generates the first n tokens, and NT96 generates the remaining. Let's see how many tokens each part should have.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT64 and NT96 are both non-terminals. Each of them has a series of productions leading to terminals. I can try to build the parse tree by working from the top down.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm since the grammar is in CNF. But since I'm doing this manually, let's look for possible reductions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So, the string must be the concatenation of two sequences generated by NT64 and NT96 respectively.\n\nLet's first process NT64.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT64:\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63\nNT52 \u2192 NT22 NT6\nNT6 \u2192 NT47 NT1\nNT47 can either produce NT1 or 't1'. Wait, in the grammar, NT47 can go to NT1 NT62 or 't1'? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the productions for NT47 include:\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\nNT47 \u2192 NT62\nWait, no, looking back, I see NT47 has two productions:\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62. No, actually, looking back, the NT47 productions are:\n\nWait, the given grammar has:\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\nAnd then, lower in the list, I see:\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\nWait, no, that's not the case. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the NT47 entries are:\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62\n\nSo, two productions: one is NT21 NT3, and the other is NT1 NT62.\n\nSo, back to NT64:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nLooking at NT84: NT84 can produce 't2' or 't4' via its productions. The productions for NT84 include:\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT84 \u2192 't2'\nNT84 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo, possible to produce tokens 't2' or 't4'.\n\nSimilarly, NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63.\n\nNT52 can be NT22 NT6, and NT63 is either 't2' or NT54.\n\nWait, let's try to trace this.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the top-down approach. Alternatively, think about the structure.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent the string as a production chain. Let's look at NT64 and NT96.\n\nLet me analyze the entire string. It's quite long, but perhaps it's easier to break it down into parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated as follows:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNT64 can generate a sequence, and NT96 another.\n\nLooking at NT64's productions, it starts with NT84 NT62. So, the first step in NT64 is to split into NT84 and NT62. The string starts with t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t1 t1 t1 t0 t4 t1...\n\nLooking at the beginning: t0, t0, t0, t4, t4, t1, t1, t1, t0, t4, t1...\n\nFirst, NT84 can produce 't4' as it has a production to 't4'. So the first token from NT84 could be 't4'. But the string begins with 't0's, so maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to see where 't0's appear in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, NT3, NT5, etc., can produce t0 or t1.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, NT3 can be 't0', NT66 \u2192 't4', etc. So, multiple NTs can produce different t-labels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be processed step by step.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that the string must match the concatenation of two sequences: one from NT64 and one from NT96.\n\nLet's first process the entire string as two parts.\n\nSuppose NT64 generates the first, say, n tokens, and NT96 generates the remaining.\n\nI need to find the split point where the end of the first part matches the prefix of the string, and the start of the second part matches the suffix.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see the count.\n\nFrom the start token list, perhaps each NT can generate a certain number of tokens.\n\nLet me consider NT64.\n\nLooking at its productions:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 can produce 't2' or 't4'.\nNT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63\nNT52 \u2192 NT22 NT6\nNT6 \u2192 NT47 NT1\nNT47 can produce 't1' or another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in the string, the occurrences of 't0's, etc., must correspond to the productions. Maybe I can try to find possible trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed as a series of NT64 and NT96 productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to see if the string can be divided into two parts, each generated by NT64 and NT96 respectively.\n\nLet me try to process NT64 first.\n\nThe first token is 't0'. So, does any production of NT64 lead to 't0'?\n\nLooking at NT64's productions, NT84 can be 't2' or 't4', and NT62 can be various things. So, maybe NT84 can't produce 't0' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is to look for where 't0's can appear.\n\nLooking at the NT64's productions, the first step is to split into NT84 and NT62.\n\nNT84 can produce 't4' or 't2'. But the string starts with 't0's, which are t0, t0, t0. None of NT84's primary productions produce 't0', so perhaps that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Looking back: in the grammar, NT68 can produce 't0', NT97 can produce 't2' or 't3' depending on the production, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconstruct possible parse trees step by step.\n\nLet me consider NT64's first split into NT84 and NT62.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't0', 't0', 't0', etc.\n\nLooking at NT84, it can produce 't2' or 't4'. So, if the first token is 't2' or 't4', perhaps the string can fit. But since the first three tokens are 't0's, that suggests perhaps NT84 is not producing a terminal in the first step.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should consider that NT64's initial split into NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has specific rules about production length and terminals versus non-terminals on the right-hand side. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t0 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t0 t3 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t1 t3 t4 t3 t3 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t2`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either of the form S \u2192 AB or A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and S is the start symbol. Terminals can only appear on the left-hand side as the start symbol, but here they are on the right, so each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. Since some productions have two non-terminals, the string must consist of terminals only once each step, building up in a binary tree-like structure.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that S produces NT64 NT96.

NT96 has two productions: one is NT54 and NT53, and another is directly 't4'. But looking at the given grammar, the last line says NT96 \u2192 't4' as well as NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. But in the list above, I think I might have misaligned some. Let me check: in the user's input, the grammar ends with several lines like NT3 \u2192 't0' etc. But looking back, NT96 is assigned to 't4' in the full context, but in the initial part, the production for NT96 was given as NT54 NT53. So maybe that's an error. I should clarify that.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under the initial list, the first few productions are S \u2192 NT64 NT96, S \u2192 NT97 NT7, S \u2192 NT35 NT84. Then a line: NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63. Then the list continues with NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, etc. Wait, but after that, later in the grammar, under the list of production rules, there's NT96 \u2192 't4'. So perhaps in the grammar, NT96 has two separate productions: one is NT54 NT53, and another is the terminal 't0'? Wait, in the grammar provided, after the list of production rules, I think I might be mislisting.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because in the initial part, under the grammar, there are lines like S \u2192 NT64 NT96, etc., but then after, there are lines like NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3, etc., and then towards the end, some symbols are assigned to terminals, e.g., NT3 \u2192 't0', NT5 \u2192 't2', etc. So I think the initial productions are S's, and then the rest are non-terminals producing either terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the grammar correctly. Let me list all the productions properly:\n\nS:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form of CFG where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see all the rules are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So that checks out.\n\nThe grammar is a bit complex, but I notice that the terminals start with 't' followed by a number. So I might need to map each production that ends in a terminal to its corresponding 't' token. Let me see how each terminal is defined.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT47 \u2192 t4\nWait, no, actually, let me scan all the productions:\n\nWait, I think I got that wrong. Let me look at the right-hand sides. Each production ends with one of the terminals. Each terminal is a 't' followed by a number.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a string is in the language of the grammar if it can be derived starting from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which are just 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo any string generated must be the concatenation of two parts, each derived from one of these three right-hand sides.\n\nThe input string is: t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0.\n\nI think the strategy is to try to parse the string step by step, trying each possible production for S and seeing if it can fit the string.\n\nLet me start by considering the first production: S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the string must start with the concatenation of NT64 and NT96. I need to find out what NT64 and NT96 expand into.\n\nLooking into NT64's production: From the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So NT64 expands into two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 in the string is early on, and I see that NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Hmm, let me check what NT54 and NT53 expand to.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT54 \u2192 NT12 NT63\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t0 t0 t0 t4... Looking for matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT64 ends up with a t4, and NT96 also ends up with more ts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for the derivations step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the initial string, but that might be time-consuming. Since the string is quite long, I might need a better approach.\n\nWait, considering the grammar is in CNF, and we need to parse the string as a series of steps, each step replacing a non-terminal with a pair of non-terminals, until we reach the base case where all symbols are terminals.\n\nLet me think about the structure:\n\nEach non-terminal can only produce two others, so for example, S will split into two parts, each part further splitting until we reach terminals.\n\nBut given the string is long (35 symbols), perhaps it's best to see if the entire string can be broken down into a series of NT transitions.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps the string starts with S \u2192 NT64 NT96, so the first part is NT64, which is t0s and the second part is NT96, which is the next t0s.\n\nWait, looking at the string: the first few symbols are t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t0.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT64 NT96, then the string should be NT64_part concatenated with NT96_part.\n\nLet me see what NT64 and NT96 produce.\n\nLooking at NT64:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 't1' (from the grammar)\nNT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77\nNT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3\nNT68 \u2192 't0' (since NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12, and NT47 \u2192 't0', NT12 \u2192 't4', so wait, not sure.

Wait, but in the grammar, it seems that some NTs have multiple productions. Let me check:\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused because some non-terminals have multiple productions. For example, NT68 has:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT68 \u2192 't0'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar as presented has for NT68:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' (I think that's different)\n\nWait, looking back, I think I see:\n\nWait, in the initial list, there are lines like:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12\n\nNT68 \u2192 't0'\n\nAnd another line:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo actually, NT68 has three productions: two to other NTs and one to 't0', and another to 't3'? Wait, no, that can't be.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal and B and C can be either terminals or non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the top-level productions provided:\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo S can start with either NT64 and NT96, or NT97 and NT7, or NT35 and NT84. Each of these options will lead to more productions until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t0 t0 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t3 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t2\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since it's a long string, I should figure out the steps or find a way to map the sequence through the productions.\n\nI notice that each production in the grammar either produces a terminal or another pair of non-terminals. So each step could potentially increase the length of the string. But since all the productions either have two terminals or lead to other pairs, the number of steps should correspond to the length of the string divided by 2.\n\nWait, the given string has 37 tokens, which is odd. Let me check: 37 is an odd number. But in the grammar, the initial productions for S lead to two non-terminals each. Each of those could either be a terminal or another pair. So each production splits into two parts, hence each step potentially increases the count by 1.\n\nFor example:\n- S (1) \u2192 two tokens (2)\n- Each of those tokens could be expanded into two more tokens, leading to 4, then 8, etc.\n\nSince 37 is not a power of two and it's odd, maybe it's problematic. Let's see: 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 37 is between them. Or perhaps the structure isn't a straight exponent but a binary tree.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Each non-terminal can produce two symbols. So the number of symbols in the string should be 2^k, where k is the number of steps, or something like that. But 37 isn't a power of two, so maybe it's not possible.\n\nWait, the given grammar might not generate all strings of 2^k length. Let's test that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S is part of more complex structures. For example, S might go through several steps. But given the initial steps, each S leads to two tokens, and each token can lead to two others, so the length should be 2^k for some k. But 37 isn't a power of two, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me count again: the string given has 37 tokens. Let me re-count: t0, t0, t2, t1, t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t1, t3, t0, t0, t0, t2, t0, t2, t4, t0, t1, t2, t3, t2, t0, t2, t2, t0, t2, t2, t0, t1, t2, t2, t0, t2, t4, t0, t3, t2. Let's count them: 1,2,3,...,37. So yes, 37 tokens.\n\nIf each step generates two tokens, then starting from S (1 token), each step will generate 2,4,8,16, etc. But 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 37 is not a power of two. So there's no way to generate a string of length 37 with a grammar that produces exactly two symbols each expansion. So it's impossible.\n\nWait, but another possibility: maybe the grammar allows for some non-terminals to produce a single terminal. Or perhaps not. Let me see: looking at the productions, some non-terminals like NT66, NT7, etc., are on the right-hand side of two-terminals. But then other non-terminals, like NT54, have productions like \u2192 't3' or other terminals. Oh, yes, for example:\n\nLooking at the productions, some non-terminals directly produce terminals or multiple of them. For example:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't4' (terminal)\n- NT66 \u2192 't4'\n- NT97 \u2192 't2'\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n- NT43 \u2192 't0'\n- NT77 \u2192 't1'\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n- NT54 \u2192 't1'\n- NT80 \u2192 't3'\n- NT22 \u2192 't4'\n- NT82 \u2192 't4'\n- NT54 \u2192 't3'\n- NT81 \u2192 't1'\n- NT36 \u2192 't4'\n- NT77 \u2192 't3' (duplicate)\n- NT96 \u2192 't4'\n- NT47 \u2192 't4' (duplicate)\n- NT1 \u2192 't0' (duplicate)\n- NT77 \u2192 't1' (duplicate again)\n- NT4 \u2192 't1'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n- NT74 \u2192 't3'\n- NT80 \u2192 't2'\n- NT22 \u2192 't3' (duplicate)\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT21 \u2192 't4'\n- NT52 \u2192 't4'\n- NT43 \u2192 't0'\n- NT53 \u2192 't2'\n- NT84 \u2192 't0'\n- NT34 \u2192 't4'\n- NT96 \u2192 't3' (duplicate)\n- NT62 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal, like NT54 \u2192 't4'. So, for example, if a non-terminal directly expands to a single terminal, that could shorten the number of steps needed to generate symbols.\n\nBut in the initial productions for S, each S produces two non-terminals. So each S initially splits into two, which could then split again, etc. So, perhaps the length can be adjusted.\n\nFor instance, if S \u2192 NT64 NT96, and NT64 \u2192 't4' (terminal), and NT96 \u2192 't4', then S would produce 't4 t4', which is length 2. Alternatively, if NT64 and NT96 each expand further into more non-terminals, their expansion could lead to longer sequences.\n\nWait, let's calculate how the string length can grow. The initial S is 1 symbol. It expands into two symbols (non-terminals). Each of those can be non-terminals or terminals. \n\nBut given that in the production rules, each symbol is either a terminal or a pair of symbols, the total length must be 2^k for some k, or perhaps something related but not exactly 2^k because some symbols can be terminals that stop the expansion.\n\nBut in this case, the string length is 37, which is not a power of two. So, does that mean it's impossible to produce such a string? Because each expansion steps increase the string length from n to 2n, but if some of the non-terminals produce terminals early, then the length can vary.\n\nWait, let's think more carefully. Each time you have a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals, it adds one to the length. Each terminal adds zero.\n\nBut the grammar is CNF, so all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, meaning every production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo each step of derivation is replacing a non-terminal with two symbols. The total number of symbols increases by the number of non-terminals replaced minus the number of terminals produced.\n\nWait, it's getting complicated. Let me think of the stack as starting with S (length 1), and each production replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, so the length increases by 1 each time a non-terminal is replaced. However, if a non-terminal directly produces a terminal (like NT54 \u2192 't4'), then expanding it doesn't add any length because it goes from 1 to 1, with two symbols: 't4' is one symbol in the final string, but in the intermediate steps, it's considered two non-terminals? No, that's not right. If NT54 \u2192 't4', then when you replace NT54 with 't4', the length doesn't increase.\n\nWait, when you expand a non-terminal, if it's replaced by terminals, the number of symbols in the string doesn't increase because that non-terminal was just replaced by a single terminal. So in that case, replacing a non-terminal with a terminal doesn't change the length"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT53 \u2192 't2', 't3'? Wait, let me correct that.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each line is a separate production. So let's list each NT and all the possible right-hand sides, considering both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nFor example:\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' (appears twice)\n- NT35 \u2192 't3'\n- NT54 \u2192 't2', 't3', 't4'\nWait, no.

The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT64 NT96, another S \u2192 NT97 NT7, and third S \u2192 NT35 NT84.\n\nSo S starts by producing pairs of Non-terminals, like NT64 and NT96.\n\nEach of these Non-terminals may produce terminals or other Non-terminals.\n\nFor the string provided, the first symbol is t0 t0 t0.

{"custom_id":"request-786","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is quite big, with many non-terminals, and the string is a long sequence of 't's and numbers. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar looks like. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that many non-terminals are reduced to terminals with rules ending in something like 't0', 't1', etc. Others are still non-terminals and break down into more combinations.\n\nThe string we're checking is: t0 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. My plan is to see if I can trace back through the grammar starting from the start symbol S and see if I can build this string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S could also produce other things, but looking at the given rules, only the three are: NT64, NT96, etc. Wait, the first line under S is S \u2192 NT64 NT96. There's more, like S \u2192 NT97 NT7, etc. Let me check.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\n```\nS -> NT64 NT96\nS -> NT97 NT7\nS -> NT35 NT84\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\n...\n```\n\nSo S has three initial productions: S\u2192NT64NT96, S\u2192NT97NT7, S\u2192NT35NT84.\n\nSo I need to see which of these could lead to our string. Let's start with the first option: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nNow, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So let's parse that. Then NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, and NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62. Wait, but wait, NT47 is another non-terminal. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree step by step. Let's start by assuming we're using the first production for S: NT64 NT96.\n\nBreaking down NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Now, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. So NT4 is another non-terminal: NT4 \u2192 NT47 NT96. Hmm, NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3, and NT21 \u2192 NT47 NT3? Wait, that's circular.\n\nWait, no. Let's see NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3. So NT21 is a production: NT21 \u2192 NT52 NT63. Then NT52 \u2192 NT52 NT63? No, wait, NT52 \u2192 NT52 NT63 is not a production. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the NT52 rule is: NT52 \u2192 NT22 NT52. So it's recursive. Hmm. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the string and see which productions could generate the starting 't0's.\n\nWait, the first part of the string is t0 t0. Let's see which non-terminals reduce to t0.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, several non-terminals reduce directly to 't0' or 't1' etc. For example, NT47 \u2192 't1' (line 7), NT68 \u2192 't0' (line 11), NT22 \u2192 't4' (line 23), but wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the given data, under NTs, the reductions are:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't0' (line 11)\n- NT3 \u2192 't0' (line 23)\n- NT64 \u2192 't4' (line 16)\n- NT12 \u2192 't3' (line 20)\n- NT52 \u2192 't2' (line 25)\nWait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

{"custom_id":"request-801","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens: `t0 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1`. I need to determine if it's possible for the grammar to generate this string.\n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky normal form (CNF) works. In CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. This structure typically makes parsing easier, but here, I need to determine if a given string is valid, so it's more about tracing through possible derivation steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals: NT64 and NT96. Both of these need to produce the corresponding terminal sequences that form the string.\n\nI think the approach is to split the string into two parts, each part corresponding to the two non-terminals derived from S: one part from NT64 and the other from NT96.\n\nSo the string is 39 tokens long. Since S expands into NT64 NT96, the string must split into two equal parts, each corresponding to the strings they produce. Wait, no, because in CNF, each production is a two-step process in each derivation. But for the initial split, perhaps the string is divided into two parts based on the initial non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to model the possible derivations. Let's think of the entire string as the concatenation of the two sequences generated by NT64 and NT96. So the overall string should be the concatenation of the string produced by NT64 and the string produced by NT96.\n\nBut how do NT64 and NT96 expand? Each of them can have their own production rules, which themselves might expand further until terminals are produced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parse tree is structured as S \u2192 NT64 NT96, and each NT64 and NT96 branches further until they become terminals. So the entire string is a combination of two parts, each part is derived from NT64 and NT96.\n\nSo the first step is to check if the string can be split into two parts, say, Part A and Part B, such that Part A can be generated by NT64 and Part B can be generated by NT96. If both are possible, then the answer is yes; otherwise, no.\n\nLooking at the given tokens, the entire string is 39 tokens. So Part A and Part B would have 19 and 20 tokens, or some other split? Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is a split into two non-terminals, so each production step doubles the length of the string. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: in each step, a single non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, but for the string generation, it's not just about the length doubling. Hmm, maybe this is more about the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial string can be built bottom-up, using the grammar's productions in reverse. That is, for each part, start with the terminal string and see if it can be reduced using the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me think: for a given part, say NT64 generates a string X, and NT96 generates a string Y, then the full string is X concatenated with Y.\n\nSo for the entire string, we can split it into two parts, and check if the first part can be generated by NT64 and the second by NT96.\n\nBut where is the split point? The initial split comes from S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the length of each part can vary, but the entire string is built by concatenating the two parts.\n\nWait, but the way the grammar is structured, each non-terminal (like NT64 and NT96) can have their own chains of productions, which might produce strings of varying lengths. So it's more complex than a fixed split. Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of checking, we can generate possible splits and see if any of them yield the given string.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to check for each part (from NT64 and NT96) whether their corresponding string can be built by their production rules.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming. Let's instead look for possible sequences in each part.\n\nFirst, NT64: according to the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nSo NT64 expands into NT84 and NT62. Then, these can further expand.\n\nLooking at NT84: NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nSo NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nThen, NT4 \u2192 't1'.\n\nWait, NT4 is a terminal. So NT84 produces 't1' followed by whatever NT1 produces.\n\nWhat's NT1? NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77.\n\nBut wait, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar is given, but I need to parse it correctly. Let me list the production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nThen a series of NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, ending with some NTx \u2192 't0' or 't1' or 't2', etc.\n\nSo the initial step is S, which branches into two non-terminals, and each of those can further branch.\n\nNow, looking at NT64 and NT96.\n\nLet's start with NT64: NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nThen, NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.

NT68 \u2192 NT47 NT12.\n\nWait, let me try to build the first part of the string as derived from NT64.\n\nSo NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nSo the first two steps produce 't1' and then NT1, which is NT5 NT77.\n\nSo NT1 \u2192 NT5 NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT3 and NT1 again, I think. Wait, NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3, and NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT74.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to map out a possible derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the end tokens and work backwards.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't0' and the last is 't1'.\n\nSo one part (from NT64) ends with 't0', and the other part (from NT96) ends with 't1'.\n\nLet's look at the possible end tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which production rules end with a terminal 'a' instead of non-terminals?\n\nYes, for example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't1'\n- NT3 \u2192 't0' or 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't2' etc.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, some like NT77 \u2192 't1', NT54 \u2192 't1', NT53 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nSo the idea is to see if the string can be split into two parts where the first part ends with a terminal that matches a production of NT64 and the second part ends with a terminal from NT96.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last token of each part corresponds to a terminal.\n\nLet me look again at the given string:\n\nThe full string is: t0 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t3 t4 t1 t1.\n\nI notice that the last token is 't1', which could come from NT4 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo if the last part is generated by NT96, it ends with 't1', which perhaps is from NT4 \u2192 't1'.\n\nLooking at the end of NT96: NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't1'\n- NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33.\n\nBut NT86 is 't0' and NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81.\n\nWait, NT33 goes further down to NT84 and NT81, which then go to 't2' and so on.\n\nBut perhaps another way: NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53 \u2192 't1' (from NT54) and then NT53, which we need to see how it ends.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to consider the overall string.\n\nAnother approach: for NT64, the chain of productions should end in a terminal string, and similarly for NT96.\n\nGiven the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-802","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific rules: each production rule must have exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar provided:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which has multiple productions starting with S. Each production seems to split into two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal (like some NT66 \u2192 't0'). So some of the rules here are correct for CNF, and others directly produce terminals, which might be part of the same family, like a single terminal in productions.\n\nNext, the string I need to evaluate is: t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t2 t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice a bunch of NT symbols with transitions that eventually produce t0 or t1 terms, which are the terminals in the string. The string is a sequence of t0 and t1's, each a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the approach to solve this is to likely use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing strings in CNF grammars. Alternatively, since the string might not be too long, I could try to manually check possible derivations.\n\nBut considering the string's length, doing this manually would take a while, so maybe I can spot patterns or recurring symbols that can help.\n\nFirst, I'll list some production rules that lead directly to terminals:\n\n- S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nLooking at NT64 and NT96, I need to see if they can produce t0 or t1.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1, which are non-terminals, but later in the NT47, for example, NT47 \u2192 't1' or 't4', but in the given grammar, NT47 has two options: NT21 NT3 and also a terminal, but looking closer:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT47, it's given as:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3\nNT47 \u2192 't1'\n\nSimilarly, other NT's have both non-terminal and terminal productions.\n\nHmm, but it's a bit messy. Maybe I can map all NT's to their possible terminal outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about mapping the entire string and seeing if it can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nAnother thought: each production in the grammar splits into two symbols, so the string length should be compatible with the number of splits. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step doubles the non-terminals. The string length here is 39. The number of symbols in the string is 39, so the derivation would have 39 - 1 = 38 steps? Or maybe I should think in terms of the number of symbols.\n\nWait, in CNF, each step replaces a single symbol with two, so starting from S (1 symbol), each step increases the total symbols by 1. To reach a string of length L, you need L-1 steps. The given string has length 39, so starting from S (1), the number of steps would be 38. That's feasible.\n\nNow, let's consider the CYK algorithm. We can create a table where each cell represents a position in the string and possible non-terminals that can derive that substring. But setting up a full table might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps we can see if the string can be generated by recursively applying the productions.\n\nLooking for the start symbol S, which has three options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nI need to see if the string can be generated from one of these initial splits.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if any of these components can lead to the sequence.\n\nOption 1: NT64 and NT96.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nThen NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nSo for NT84, it can derive t0 or t1 if NT4 and NT1 have terminals.\n\nLooking at NT4: I don't see NT4 in the productions above, but perhaps it's defined elsewhere. Wait, in the given grammar, NT4 is not listed, so maybe it's a terminal? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nBut I don't see a production for NT4 or NT1 except for NT98 having parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string should be broken down into parts that match the production steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for the presence of certain patterns. For example, any occurrence where both parts of a production are terminals, or one terminal and one non-terminal, etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to assign indices to the string.\n\nThe string is: positions 0 to 38.\n\nWe need to see if the whole string can be broken down into two non-terminals at each step, working recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to write down the possible symbols each NT can produce and see if the overall string can be split accordingly.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the first part of the string can be derived from S.\n\nOption1: S \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nSo the string would need to be split into parts that NT64 and NT96 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the first chunk is something that NT64 could produce, and the second chunk something that NT96 could produce.\n\nBut without knowing the exact breakdowns, it's hard. Maybe I can see if the string starts with t0 t0, which is common in many productions.\n\nWait, looking at NT47 production: NT47 can produce 't1' or 't4', which are both present in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the end of the string. The last symbol is t0. Let's see which NT can produce t0.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 t0, NT5 \u2192 t2 (but that's a non-terminal, so not matching t0), wait:\n\nLooking for NT that directly produce t0:\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t0.\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT3 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't0'.\n\nSimilarly, NT97 can produce 't2', which is not t0.\n\nLooking elsewhere, perhaps in the rules.\n\nWait, the rule for NT22 is: NT22 \u2192 t4.\n\nHmm, I need to spot which NTs can produce t0 in the string.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT27 \u2192 ... looking at the rules, NT27's production is NT24 NT62, not a terminal.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39. So no terminal.\n\nNT68 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, in the given, NT62 \u2192 't0'.\n\nYes, because in the rule:\n\nNT62 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo NT62 can produce t0.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 t4.\n\nWait, look:\n\nNT96 \u2192 't4'.\n\nAh, yes, NT96 can produce 't4'.\n\nSo, going back to S \u2192 NT96 NT7.\n\nWait, S's second option is S \u2192 NT97 NT7.\n\nND7 can produce 't2' perhaps?\n\nLooking at NT7's production:\n\nFrom the given rules, NT7 can produce multiple things, including NT66 NT48, and also has some rules, but looking directly:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't2'?\n\nWait, in the grammar, is there a rule where NT7 directly produces a terminal?\n\nLooking at the given rules for NT7:\n\nOne production is NT7 \u2192 't2', so yes.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT97 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 t2, which matches the string's 24th symbol being t2.\n\nWait, but how do we split the string?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK table approach:\n\nFor the CYK algorithm, I can create a table where each row represents the index and the columns represent possible non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string length is 39, I can start from the beginning and try to split the string into possible substrings that can be derived by the grammar.\n\nBut doing this manually would be time-consuming, but let's attempt it.\n\nFirst, the string is 39 elements long, so each element is a terminal (t0, t1, etc.).\n\nThe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-828","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand how CNF works. In CNF, every production is either a terminal, or two non-terminals, or a single non-terminal on the left side. The right side must always be two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in this case, looking at the productions, I see mostly two non-terminals.\n\nThe grammar has non-terminals S, NT47, NT1, NT66, etc., and terminals that correspond to tokens like 't0', 't1', etc. The start symbol is S, and the string provided is a sequence of these terminal symbols.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I can approach it by simulating the parsing process. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or even a simple parser simulation might work. Alternatively, I could try to build a parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S and checking if I can derive the entire string.\n\nLooking at the string: `t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t2 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t1 t4 t1 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t0 t3 t0`.\n\nThis is a long string, so manually checking step by step might be error-prone, but maybe I can find a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nAnother approach is to convert the grammar into a form where I can more easily simulate the parsing process, like using a top-down method. Each production has exactly two symbols on the right, so the parser can look for two symbols at a time.\n\nI should check the start symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT64 NT96 and S \u2192 NT97 NT7 and S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So the first step is to see if the string starts with any of these possibilities.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t0. I'll need to find which non-terminals produce t0. Looking through the production rules, I see NT68 -> t0, NT97 -> t2, NT77 -> t3, NT70 -> t4, NT26 -> t3, NT52 -> t2, NT47 -> t4, NT1 -> t2, NT21 -> t4, etc. Wait, but I don't have any production that directly produces t0 except NT68 and NT97 maybe?\n\nWait, checking the productions again. For example, NT70 -> t4, so I'm looking for how to get t0. Checking each production, for example:\n\nLooking at NT33 -> t1, which doesn't help. NT66 -> t4, no. NT64 -> t4. Hmm, I don't see a production that directly gives t0 except maybe in other combinations. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, let me check again. The possible non-terminals that produce t0: \n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT68 -> t0\n\nWait, is that correct? Because in the list, I saw NT68 -> 't0' and also NT77 -> 't3'. So NT68 can produce 't0'. Similarly, looking at other rules, maybe NT3 -> 't0', because I see NT3 -> 't0'. Also, looking at NT5 -> 't2', no. Wait, wait: in the rules, it's written as 'NT68 -> 't0'', 'NT3 -> 't0''. So yes, those non-terminals can directly produce t0.\n\nSo, for the first token t0, possible sources are NT68 and NT3.\n\nNow, looking further, the first two tokens are 't0 t0'. So perhaps the first two symbols come from a production that expands to two t0's.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production on the right side is a combination of two non-terminals. So each production has two symbols on the right, which could be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, for example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So for S to generate a string starting with t0 t0, we would need NT64 to generate t0 and NT96 to generate t0, or vice versa.\n\nBut looking at NT64: its production is NT84 NT62. NT84 is 't2' and NT62 is 't0'. So NT64 \u2192 t2 t0.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, which are 't4' and 't4'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would produce t2 t0 t4 t4. So that's four symbols, but the first token is t0, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, S could have another production, but let me check the other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider smaller steps. Let's try to find how to parse the string starting with 't0 t0'.\n\nI need to see if there's a production that starts with two t0's. Let's look at the non-terminals that can produce two t0's.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\nLooking at NT96 \u2192 t4, but perhaps through another production.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for non-terminals that can produce a sequence starting with t0 t0. For example, what does NT3 produce? NT3 \u2192 t0. But then, what about NT3 as the second symbol in a production?\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT68 can produce t0, so perhaps the first symbol t0 comes from NT68, and the second t0 must come from another non-terminal, let's say X, such that NT68 X is a production. But looking at NT68's productions, I only see NT68 -> t0, so there's no production where NT68 has two symbols on the right. Wait, no\u2014looking at the rules, each production for NT68 is just its definition. Wait, no, NT68's productions are all single terminals or combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I need to step back and re-examine the grammar.\n\nThe grammar consists of a set of non-terminals and productions. Each production has two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal has a terminal on the right. Wait, no: actually, in CNF, productions can be of the form A \u2192 B C, A \u2192 a, or A \u2192 B a, but in this case, maybe every production is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, for example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96 and S \u2192 NT97 NT7 and S \u2192 NT35 NT84. So these are all productions with two non-terminals on the right. Then looking at other rules, like NT47 -> NT21 NT3, so two non-terminals. NT68 -> t0, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT3 -> t0.\n\nSo, to parse a terminal token, we have to have a production where that token is the result of a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the first symbol in the string can be produced by a non-terminal, which would require that in the grammar, there's a production where that non-terminal is on the left and that terminal is on the right.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t0. Looking for non-terminals that produce t0 directly:\n\n- NT68 -> t0\n\n- NT3 -> t0\n\nSo, the first symbol could come from either NT68 or NT3.\n\nLet's consider each possibility.\n\nCase 1: The first symbol comes from NT68 -> t0.\n\nSo, the first production for the start symbol S is S \u2192 NT64 NT96, OR S \u2192 NT97 NT7, OR S \u2192 NT35 NT84. We're looking at the first case of S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Since we're assuming the first symbol is t0, which comes from NT68, that would mean that NT64 and NT96 in S's production would need to produce t0 somewhere, but NT64 is producing t2 t0 as per its rule, so S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would produce t2 t0 t4 t4, which is four symbols, but our string starts with t0, so that can't be the first case.\n\nTherefore, S cannot produce t0 as its first symbol through NT64 and NT96.\n\nHmm, but wait\u2014is there a different production for S that can directly produce t0? Let me check all S productions.\n\nLooking at S's rules, all S productions are two non-terminals: NT64, NT96; NT97, NT7; NT35, NT84. None of these directly produce t0; their right-hand sides are non-terminals or a mix. So S cannot directly produce t0, because all rules for S are combinations of non-terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has a non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string we're testing. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, like `t0 t0 t0 t1 t4 ...` and so on. Each token could be either a terminal symbol or a non-terminal, but looking at the grammar, it seems like all the non-terminals are followed by certain terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly map to 't0', 't1', or 't2' when they appear on the right-hand side. For example, NT68 -> 't0', NT97 -> 't2', etc. So, whenever a production has a terminal, that part of the expansion will correspond to the token.\n\nThe string starts with 't0 t0 t0...'. So, I need to find if there's a way to derive this string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of steps in a leftmost derivation should be equal to the length of the string minus 1. The string has 44 tokens, so a successful leftmost derivation would involve 43 productions.\n\nLet me try to break down the first few tokens. The first symbol is 't0'. To get 't0', I look at the grammar and see that several non-terminals directly produce 't0', such as NT68, NT77, NT1, etc. So, the start symbol S must expand into something that can produce 't0' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S -> NT64 NT96, S -> NT97 NT7, S -> NT35 NT84. None of these directly produce 't0', so I think the first step must be that the highest symbol (S) expands into two non-terminals, each of which then expand further to produce the sequence.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol. So in the first step, S would produce two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals would then need to expand, leading to a derivation that eventually results in the string.\n\nBut the first token is 't0', so perhaps the first non-terminal in the expansion of S produces 't0' or the second one does, but given the leftmost derivation, the first symbol generated would come from the first non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. In leftmost derivation, we replace the first non-terminal at each step. So S becomes NT64 NT96. Then, the leftmost NT64 produces something. If NT64 can be 't0' when it's time to output, then that's how we get the first 't0'.\n\nLooking at NT64's productions: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. So NT64 must expand into NT84 and NT62. Then, NT84 might expand into something else. Wait, from the grammar, NT84 can be 't2' or other non-terminals. Let me check NT84's productions: NT84 -> NT4 NT1, NT4 -> 't1', NT1 -> 't2'. So, if NT84 expands into NT4 and NT1, then NT4 is 't1' and NT1 is 't2', so NT84 -> 't1' 't2', which is 't1t2'. So the first step from S would be S -> NT64 NT96, then NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Now, NT84 would produce 't1t2'. So the first part is 't1t2', but the string starts with 't0', so this path doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The first symbol in the string is 't0', so perhaps the first non-terminal expansion needs to produce a 't0'. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nLooking at the first possible expansion of S: S -> NT64 NT96. If NT64 can produce 't0', then the first symbol would be 't0'. Let's check NT64's production: NT64 -> NT84 NT62. Do either of these non-terminals produce 't0'? From the grammar, NT68, NT77, NT1, etc., produce 't0'. None of NT84 or NT62 produce 't0' directly. So, NT64 cannot produce 't0' directly. So S -> NT64 NT96 can't start with 't0'. What about the next production of S: S -> NT97 NT7. Let's see NT97: NT97 -> NT43 NT75. So NT97 can't produce 't0' directly. NT7 is NT7 -> NT66 NT48. Neither of these produce 't0' directly. So S -> NT97 NT7 can't start with 't0' either. The third production of S is S -> NT35 NT84. NT35: NT35 -> NT78 NT33. So NT35 can't produce 't0' directly. NT84 as we saw earlier can produce 't1t2', but that starts with 't1', so that won't help.\n\nWait, but that's contradictory because the string starts with 't0'. So maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I need to check all possible first steps of S and see if any can lead to the string starting with 't0'.\n\nWait, another approach: the first symbol is 't0'. So the first non-symbol must be a non-terminal that, when fully expanded, yields a string starting with 't0'. Let's look for all non-terminals N such that N can be expanded into a sequence starting with 't0'.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT68 -> 't0', NT96 -> 't4', NT47->'t4', NT77->'t1', NT68->'t2', etc. So the non-terminals that directly produce 't0' are NT68, NT77, NT1, etc. So perhaps the first production of S must lead to a non-terminal that can eventually expand into 't0'.\n\nWait, but S -> NT64 NT96. Can NT64 or NT96 derive to 't0'? Let's see:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62. From NT84, we saw it can be 't1' 't2', so NT64 can't start with 't0'. Similarly, NT96 -> NT54 NT53. NT54 -> NT1 NT54\u2192't2'? Hmm, wait, NT54's productions include NT1, which is 't2'. So maybe I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is S -> NT97 NT7. Then, NT97 expands to NT43 NT75. NT43 -> 't0', so the first symbol would be 't0'. Let's check:\n\nNT97 -> NT43 NT75. NT43 is 't0', so as the first symbol, that would start the string with 't0'. Then, the next production would be NT75. Let's see what NT75 does: NT75 -> NT98 NT26.\n\nSo now, the current string is 't0' followed by the expansion of NT75, which is NT98 and NT26. Let me check NT98: NT98 can be 't1', 't2', etc. Specifically, NT98->NT47 NT98\u2192't1' via NT47? Wait, NT98's productions include NT47 and others. Let's see:\n\nNT98 -> NT78 NT14, which then lead to other terms. Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to model the entire expansion step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of focusing on the start, I should think about all the non-terminals that produce 't0' as their first symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-847","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string I need to check is a sequence of ts and numbers, like `t0 t0 t1 t1 t4 ...` etc. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, the start symbol is on the left, and each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar starts with S. Let me look at the productions for S. \n\nLooking at the grammar, S can go to NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. So each of these is a pair of non-terminals that S can expand into. So the first step is to see if each part of the string can be derived through these initial steps.\n\nBut wait, each of these initial productions results in two non-terminals, each of which can further expand. And each non-terminal eventually expands into a terminal symbol, which is either 't0', 't1', or numbers like 't2', 't3', etc. But those numbers are actually terminal symbols as well, right? Because in the string, the elements are 't0', 't1', 't2', etc. So the grammar's non-terminals are actually the strings like NT3, NT4, etc., and the terminals are the 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar has non-terminals like NT3, NT4, etc., which can produce either another non-terminal pair or a terminal. The terminals are the 't0', 't1', etc., so each production rule ends when it hits a terminal. \n\nSo the process is to start at S and expand until we get all terminals. Each step involves replacing a non-terminal with the right-hand side of its production.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, I need to find a way to parse it or see if the sequence can be generated. But parsing an entire string manually might take a long time. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a series of steps through the grammar. Each terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule where that non-terminal directly produces a terminal. So each terminal is a result of a non-terminal's production, which in turn is derived from other non-terminals, all the way back to S.\n\nLet me think about the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of 40 terminals, so S needs to expand into a structure that, when fully expanded, leads to this sequence. Let's see how the grammar's productions can chain together.\n\nEach production from S is two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96. Then each of NT64 and NT96 will produce their own pair or terminals. So maybe the string is built by expanding each of these NTs recursively until we get down to terminals.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe it's easier to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions. For instance, the beginning of the string is t0 t0 t1 t1 t4 t1 t0 t3 t1 t4... Let's look at the first few ts.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few are t0 t0. Let me check which non-terminals produce t0. For example, NT68 produces t4, wait no. Looking at the grammar rules, NT68 \u2192 t4? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals are terminals. Let me list the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 \u2192 t2, NT68 \u2192 t4, NT1 \u2192 t2, NT48 \u2192 t1, NT7 \u2192 t2, NT66 \u2192 t4, NT74 \u2192 t4, NT33 \u2192 t1, NT82 \u2192 t4, NT54 \u2192 t3, NT84 \u2192 t2, NT12 \u2192 t3, NT39 \u2192 t0, NT64 \u2192 t4, NT1 \u2192 t0, NT77 \u2192 t3, NT96 \u2192 t4, NT47 \u2192 t4, NT1 \u2192 t0, NT77 \u2192 t1, NT4 \u2192 t1, etc. So for example, NT39 produces t0.\n\nSo if I can trace how the string is built, I need to find a way that each t in the string comes from some NT's terminal production. But since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So the derivation is a binary tree, each node is a non-terminal except for the leaves, which are terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of a certain length. The start symbol S expands into two non-terminals. Each of those can expand into two non-terminals, and so on. Each time, the number of symbols doubles until it reaches the leaves, which are terminals.\n\nThe string's length is 40, which is 2^3 * 5, so it's not a power of two. That suggests that perhaps the derivation trees aren't all of the same depth. Wait, but in CNF, each expansion is binary, so the number of leaves in the parse tree is a power of two. That can't be, because 40 isn't a power of two. Hmm, wait, that suggests that maybe this approach is incorrect, or the string isn't correctly formed.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not necessarily the case. Let me think. Actually, in the Chomsky Normal Form, the parse trees are binary, so the number of symbols (terminals) in the derived string is 2^n, where n is the number of expansion steps from the root. So, if the string is of length L, then L must be a power of two. But here, L is 40, which is not a power of two. That would immediately say that the string isn't possible, unless I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait, that depends on how the grammar is applied. Each production of a non-terminal either produces two symbols or a terminal. So, starting from S, which is two non-terminals, then each step replaces a non-terminal either with two non-terminals or a terminal. So for each non-terminal production that produces two symbols, it's like adding one to the count of the expansion steps. Hmm, perhaps the total number of symbols is variable, but the length depends on the path taken.\n\nWait, that's not quite right. Each application of a rule that replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals increases the count by one. Starting from S, which is one symbol, each step can replace one non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the total number increases by one each time. Therefore, the possible lengths of the string are any positive integers, not necessarily powers of two.\n\nFor example, S can expand into two non-terminals, then one of those into two, making three, then one of those into two, making four, etc. So the total number of terminals can vary. So 40 is possible.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, regardless of the length, each terminal in the string must come from a production that has a rule ending with that terminal.\n\nSo maybe the first step is to check if each t is produced by a non-terminal that can produce it. For example, the first t0 in the string must come from a non-terminal that can produce t0. Looking back at the grammar, I see that NT39 \u2192 t0. So some non-terminal can produce t0.\n\nBut to get the full string, each t must be produced by some NT.\n\nWait, but the way the grammar works is that each production is a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal. So in the string, each t must be the result of a non-terminal's production followed by other non-terminals being expanded until they reach a terminal. For example, t0 could be the result of NT39, which itself might have been preceded by other NTs expanding into NT39.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by a series of expansions where each non-terminal is eventually replaced by a terminal through a chain of productions.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the beginning.\n\nLet's try to see if the string can be broken down into the productions. Let's consider the string starts with t0 t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t0? From the grammar, NT39 \u2192 t0, and when looking at NT39's productions, I see NT39 \u2192 NT70 NT39 and other rules, but ultimately, it can produce t0.\n\nSo perhaps t0 t0 can come from the initial S? Wait, S is split into NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, etc., each as a pair. So S can't directly produce a single t0 t0, because each production for S is a pair of non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the string is a complex sequence that can be generated by a series of these rules, but given the length, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible to see if the string can be divided into a series of pairs that correspond to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It looks like the grammar is defined with non-terminals (like S, NTx) and terminals (like t0, t1, etc.). Each production rule in CNF has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived starting from S. Since this can be complex, maybe I can use a top-down parsing approach, like the CYK algorithm, which is typically used for CNF grammars.

{"custom_id":"request-861","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, but the string is a sequence of 't0', 't1', etc. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the terminals which directly produce themselves. \n\nFirst, the string I need to check is \"t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t3 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t2\". That's a long string, 45 tokens. I need to see if it can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, which produces NT64 NT96. So the first step is that S expands into two non-terminals, and each of those needs to expand into their respective parts. Let me see what NT64 and NT96 produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63\n- NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n- NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nWait, NT84 and NT53 both have rules that eventually lead to terminals. Let me check further:\n- NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62\nBut wait, NT84's rules go to 't2' and 't4'. So the breakdown might be that NT64 becomes NT84 and NT62, each of which produce 't4' and 't3', perhaps? Or maybe more steps are needed.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, and NT54 produces 't2' or 't4', and NT53 produces 't0' or 't3'. Hmm, it's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to parse the string backwards or look for possible derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each step in the derivation will split the string into smaller parts. Starting with 't0 t0 t1...'. Maybe I can check if the entire string can be divided into subparts that match the terminals produced by the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem, using the grammar as a parser. Each non-terminal can match a sequence of terminals from the string. But with 45 tokens, this could take a while. Maybe there's a pattern or recurring subsequence that can be identified.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are 't0 t0 t1'. Let's see if any of the grammar rules can produce 't0' and 't0' followed by another terminal. Looking at the rules, not all non-terminals produce 't0'. For example, NT3 \u2192 't0', NT98 \u2192 't1', etc. So perhaps the first 't0' comes from NT3, but then where does the second 't0' come from?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list all the terminal productions and see how they can combine. Each terminal is either a digit followed by 0 or 1. Like 't0' is produced by NT3, NT68, NT47, NT63, etc. But in the given grammar, some of these are 't0's and 't1's. Let me list out all the terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n- NT3 \u2192 't0'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\nWait, no, looking at the list provided: NT3 is always 't0' or 't2'? Wait, the user provides a list where NT3 is 't0' in some rules. Wait, looking back, the user provided a long list of grammar rules ending with:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't0'\nNT98 \u2192 't1'\nNT84 \u2192 't2'\nNT62 \u2192 't3'\nNT7 \u2192 't2'\nNT47 \u2192 't4'\nNT1 \u2192 't2'\nNT77 \u2192 't3'\nNT74 \u2192 't4'\nNT33 \u2192 't0' or 't1'\nNT54 \u2192 't3' or 't4'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo each NT's terminal is as per the rule in the last section.\n\nSo, to rephrase, each non-terminal has specific rules for how it can expand, sometimes directly to terminals, and sometimes to other non-terminals.\n\nSo, for the given string, the approach could be to check at each step if any of the non-terminals can produce the current part of the string.\n\nBut with so many non-terminals and terminals, this is getting complex. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down step by step according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is a specific form of context-free grammars. It has productions where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals. However, in this case, some rules produce terminals directly, which is allowed in CNF, but perhaps more accurately, the given grammar is not exactly in CNF because some rules, like S \u2192 NT64 NT96, are in CNF, but looking at other rules like NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which are two non-terminals, so that is CNF. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So some of these rules are two non-terminals (which is allowed in CNF), but others like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63 are also two non-terminals, so they fit. Therefore, this grammar is in CNF because each rule replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal (except for a few rules like NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which are two non-terminals). Hmm, but looking back, it seems that some rules replace a non-terminal with a terminal. For example, NT68 \u2192 't0' directly.\n\nSo, in this case, the grammar allows for some non-terminals to produce terminals directly. That's fine since Chomsky Normal Form permits productions like A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So the grammar is indeed in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nWith that in mind, perhaps I can attempt a reduction. Starting from S, which is the start symbol, and see if the string can be generated.\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t1 t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t1 t3 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t2\n\nBut that's a long string. Maybe I can find a way to parse it by starting at the beginning and seeing possible derivations.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So the initial production is two non-terminals, which together must generate the entire string. So, the first non-terminal, NT64, and the second, NT96, must produce strings that together form the entire string.\n\nLet me see what NT64 and NT96 produce. From the rules:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n\nSo, we need to see if NT64 can produce something that starts with the first 't0', and NT96 can produce something that starts with the next part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nWhich, in their rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking through the list, NT4 is used in several productions, but there's a NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT62, which produces 't2' or 't4', but I don't think NT4 itself is directly producing a terminal. Wait, looking at the given grammar rules, is there a rule for NT4? Let me check. The rules are a long list, so I might have missed it. Scanning through, I don't see a direct rule for NT4, so perhaps it cannot produce a terminal directly. Wait, but NT84 \u2192 NT4 NT1. Both NT4 and NT1 are non-terminals, so NT84 would produce a string of two non-terminals. Then NT62 would be another production.\n\nWait, but looking further down, NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63. So NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62 would expand into NT4 NT1 NT52 NT63.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe this is the wrong approach. Perhaps instead, I should try to see if the entire string can be broken down into a structure that fits the grammar by recursively checking."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This structure is useful for parsing with algorithms like CYK, but since this is a manual process, I'll need to approach it differently.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, all terminal symbols are either 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', or some combination of these. Non-terminals include S, NT1, NT3, NT4, etc. The start symbol is S. The production rules are all from non-terminals to two non-terminals or terminals.

S can split into NT64 and NT96. Then, NT64 goes to NT84 NT62, and NT62 goes to 't0'. NT84 goes to NT4 NT1, and each of those can further split.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, each non-terminal is either a two-symbol production or a terminal. For example, NT64 -> NT84 NT62, which are both non-terminals, each of which might have their own productions.\n\nBut perhaps instead of expanding everything, I'll try to see if the string can be built from the bottom up, starting from S and seeing if the terminal symbols match as we go.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that each non-terminal can only produce certain terminal combinations. For example, some non-terminals produce specific 't's based on their production rules.\n\nI notice that NT35 -> 't3' and looking at the string, there are 't3's, so if a non-terminal that goes to 't3' is needed at some point.\n\nBut another approach is to check if the given string can be built by the grammar, starting from S and applying productions, and see if the string can be generated.\n\nSince the process is manual, perhaps it's better to see if each step in the string corresponds to the possible terminals.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: 't0'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals go directly to 't0', such as NT62 -> 't0', NT3 -> 't0', NT48 -> 't1', but wait, I have to think correctly.\n\nWait, looking back at the production rules, some non-terminals have direct terminals:\n\nNT68 -> 't0'\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\n\nNT97 -> 't2'\n\nNT84 -> 't2'\n\nNT26 -> 't3'\n\nNT52 -> 't2'\n\nNT74 -> 't4'\n\nNT54 -> 't3'\n\nNT81 -> 't1'\n\nNT36 -> 't4'\n\nNT77 -> 't3'\n\nNT96 -> 't4'\n\nNT47 -> 't4'\n\nNT1 -> 't2'\n\nNT77 -> 't1'\n\nNT4 -> 't1'\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all non-terminals that directly produce a 't' and the corresponding 't's they can produce:\n\n- NT68 -> 't0'\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n\n- NT68 -> 't0' (again)\n\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n\n- NT84 -> 't2'\n\n- NT26 -> 't3'\n\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n\n- NT74 -> 't4'\n\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n\n- NT81 -> 't1'\n\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n\n- NT77 -> 't3'\n\n- NT96 -> 't4'\n\n- NT47 -> 't4'\n\n- NT1 -> 't2'\n\n- NT77 -> 't1'\n\n- NT4 -> 't1'\n\nLooking at the string, the first 't0' could come from NT68 or NT3. The second 't0' could again come from NT68 or NT3.\n\nBut I need to see if the overall structure can be built, not just individual 't's.\n\nGiven that S -> NT64 NT96, which becomes NT84 NT62.\n\nNT84 can be NT4 NT1, which can be NT4 (terminal 't1') and NT1 (terminal 't2').\n\nNT62 -> 't0'.\n\nSo S -> 't1' 't2' 't0' at this point.\n\nBut the next symbols in the string are t0, t0, t0, etc. Wait, S after expanding NT64 and NT96 becomes NT84 (which is NT4 NT1) and NT62.\n\nSo S would yield 't1' 't2' 't0', but the string starts with 't0 t0 t0...', which would not match this initial expansion since the first symbol is 't0', but according to S's first expansion, the first symbol is 't1' from NT84.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nActually, NT84 -> NT4 NT1, and NT4 -> 't1' and NT1 -> 't2', so NT84 produces 't1' 't2'.\n\nNT62 -> 't0'.\n\nSo S expands to NT64 (which is NT84 NT62) and NT96. Wait, no, S is NT64 NT96, which then each expand.\n\nWait, S is NT64 and NT96, but in the production, it's S -> NT64 NT96, so when S is expanded, it's the combination of NT64 and NT96.\n\nBut expanding NT64: NT64 -> NT84 NT62, which is 't1' 't2' 't0'.\n\nExpanding NT96: NT96 -> NT54 NT53, and each of these can further expand.\n\nNT54 -> 't3', and NT53 -> 't2'.\n\nWait, so NT96 would expand to 't3' 't2'.\n\nPutting it all together, S would expand to 't1' 't2' (from NT64) followed by 't3' 't2' (from NT96), making the initial four symbols 't1 t2 t3 t2'. But the given string starts with 't0 t0 t0...', so this suggests that the initial expansion doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, maybe S's production is not the right one for the string. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals have different productions that lead to 't0'.\n\nWait, another production for NT97 -> 't2', but I don't see NT97 in the initial S expansion. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S's expansion is S-> NT97 NT7, instead of NT64 NT96.

The string is a sequence of tokens: `t0 t0 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t1 t1 t3 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t2 t1 t1`. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make parsing easier because each rule produces at most two non-terminal symbols, and the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and the first step is to see the productions for S. There are three options:\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these produces two NT symbols. So, the first step in any derivation will consist of two NT symbols that then expand into the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't0' followed by another 't0', etc. I need to see which of these S productions can lead to the string.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96: The tokens generated by NT64 and NT96 are t4 and t4 respectively. So the first two tokens would be t4 and t4, but the actual string starts with t0 t0. So this production cannot be the starting point.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7: NT97 expands to t2, and NT7 expands to t2. So this would produce t2 t2 as the first two tokens, but the string starts with t0 t0. So this is also not possible.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84: NT35 is t3 and NT84 is t2. So the first two tokens would be t3 t2, but the string starts with t0 t0. So this can't be either.\n\nWait, that's confusing because none of the S productions seem to start with 't0'. But hold on, maybe I made a mistake in looking at the productions for NT35 and NT84. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at NT35's production, it says NT35 \u2192 t3. Similarly, NT84 \u2192 t2. So yes, starting with NT35 and NT84 would give t3 t2 as the first two tokens, but our string starts with t0 t0. So none of the S productions can start with t0 t0, which seems impossible. But that can't be right because the string is provided, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the NT symbols might expand further into more tokens, but the first two tokens generated by S should match the first two in the string. But in this case, none of the S productions produce 't0' as the first token. That would mean it's impossible for S to derive the given string, right?\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm looking at the wrong grammar. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nThe NT symbols are defined with their productions. For example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, which then would have t4 and t0. But when looking at the starting symbols, the problem is that S's first productions all result in t4, t2, or t3, not t0. So how does the string start with t0 t0?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, looking at the NT symbols, for example, NT64 is defined as t4, so producing 't4' when S uses S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would mean the start would have t4 t4, but the given string starts with t0 t0.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT97 NT7 would be t2 t2, and S \u2192 NT35 NT84 would be t3 t2. So none of the S's first productions result in 't0'.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for S to start with t0 t0 because none of the S's initial productions can lead to t0.

S -> NT35 NT84\n\nEach of these rules involves two non-terminals, and since the grammar is in CNF, each of these non-terminals will eventually derive a terminal string (since in CNF, the process continues until terminals are produced).\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t0, t0, which suggests that the grammar may involve certain terminal rules leading to t0 and t1. Let's see which non-terminals produce t0 or t1.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals directly expand into 't' tokens:\n\n- NT68 -> 't4'\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't3'\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n- NT64 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't3'\n- NT26 -> 't3'\n- NT1 -> 't2'\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT68 -> 't2' (wait, this is conflicting; I think I might have misread. Let me check: the initial list might have a typo. Oh wait, in the given list, I can see lines like NT68 -> 't4', NT97 -> 't2', etc. So each production either breaks down into two non-terminals or into a 't' symbol.\n\nThe string starts with two t0's. Let's see which non-terminals expand into t0:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n- NT96 -> 't4'\n- NT66 -> 't4'\n- NT70 -> 't8'\nWait, but some non-terminals like NT15, wait no, perhaps I should create a list of non-terminals that produce t0 or t1, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n- NT97 -> 't2', which isn't t0 or t1.\n- NT66 -> 't4', which is t4.\n\nWait, wait. The provided rules are a bit confusing. Let me list all the rules and see which non-terminals produce t0, t1, etc.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT3 -> 't0'\n- NT68 -> 't4'\n- NT97 -> 't2'\n- NT98 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't3'\n- NT67? No, NT54 -> 't1'\nWait, I need to parse each line.\n\nLet me list all the production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT64 NT96\n2. S -> NT97 NT7\n3. S -> NT35 NT84\n4. NT47 -> NT21 NT3\n5. NT1 -> NT5 NT77\n6.

NT47 -> 't1' (Wait, but earlier rules may have been duplicated, perhaps duplicated or conflicting entries. Maybe some rules are same. Wait, let me see.)\n\nWait, this seems messy. Let's note all the rules that expand to a single terminal:\n\n- NT63 -> 't1'\n- NT47 -> 't1' (but NT47 also expands as NT21 NT3, which might have their own rule?)\n\nWait, I think line 30: NT47 -> 't1' might have been repeated as NT47 appears elsewhere. Let me check the initial list again. Oh, lines seem to be overlapping. Wait, in the user's message, they wrote the grammar with multiple production rules. Let me parse them correctly.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the user's grammar has each production separated, and some might be the same. Let's check each line whether it's a terminal or continues.\n\nOh wait, looking carefully, in the initial grammar provided, after the S productions, there are rules like:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\n\nNT97 -> 't2'\n\nNT98 -> 't1'\n\nWait, but then later rules like NT47 -> 't1' and others. Wait, perhaps some rules after are redefinitions of the same NT? Or perhaps they were transcribed correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the initial grammar:\n\nThe list continues as:\n\nNT63 -> 't1'\n\nNT47 -> 't1'  \/\/ So NT47 now produces 't1'\n\nNT66 -> 't4'\n\nNT70 -> 't84' ?\n\nWait, no, let me make sure. The user's initial grammar after S is as follows:\n\nIt continues with:\n\nNT47 -> NT21 NT3\n\nThen down to the end, several more rules, and the latter ones seem to be terminals:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\n\nNT97 -> 't2'\n\nNT98 -> 't1'\n\nNT77 -> 't3'\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\n\nNT68 -> 't2'\n\nWait, but then earlier, for NT68, there's a rule NT68 -> 't4' or 't2'? That can't be correct as a grammar would have only one production for each non-terminal. Therefore, perhaps there are duplicates or I need to correct which ones are terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wrote the grammar in a way that later lines may have rewritten some NTs as terminals or as other rules.

The productions start with S and have a few options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the initial expansion starts with any of these options. Each NT (non-terminal) symbol can be replaced by other non-terminals or terminal symbols ('t0', 't1', etc.).\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t0 to t4. Each token in the string represents a production step that must be derived from the NTs in the grammar.\n\nI notice that the string is long (50 tokens). Each NT production can lead to a certain number of tokens, depending on its right-hand side (RHS). For example, most NT productions have two symbols on the RHS, which would result in two tokens each time they are expanded.\n\nGiven the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the parse tree for the string should have a binary structure where each node has either a terminal (if it's a leaf) or two children (non-terminals).\n\nSince each production except NT68 and others lead to two symbols, I'll assume each step in the expansion contributes two tokens. So, for the string of 50 tokens, the parse tree's depth should allow for 25 productions starting from S, but that might not be exact because some productions could lead to three tokens or more if they have more on the RHS, but in this case, all productions have either one or two symbols. Wait, most are two, except some like NT66 \u2192 NT52 NT63, which is two.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are two symbols except for terminals. So, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, for the string, each 'step' in the parsing would involve expanding a non-terminal into two others, leading to an increase of one token per production. Therefore, starting from S, each step could double the number of tokens, but in this case, the string has 50 tokens, which is not a power of two minus one, so perhaps the parse tree isn't a perfect binary tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT production leads to a certain number of tokens, and I need to see if the entire string can be derived by a series of these expansions.\n\nBut this approach might be too time-consuming. Maybe a better way is to model this as a parsing problem, trying to build a parse tree step by step, ensuring that all tokens are consumed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a way to derive the string step by step, keeping track of the NTs needed at each step. Since the string is quite long, perhaps it's better to break it into smaller parts.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the grammar may generate a specific language, and this string might be a member of that language. But without knowing the language, I need a more concrete approach.\n\nAnother approach is to write a recursive descent parser, using memoization or dynamic programming to see if the entire string can be matched starting from S.\n\nBut doing that manually might be error-prone. Alternatively, perhaps I can find some patterns or regularities in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S can be expanded into NT64 NT96, NT97 NT7, or NT35 NT84. Each of these NTs then have their own productions.\n\nFor example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. So, if S expands into NT96, which leads to NT54 NT53. NT54 can be NT1 NT or other possibilities. Wait, looking at NT54's productions: NT54 \u2192 NT1 NT, NT54 \u2192 NT84 NT33.\n\nWait, NT54 has multiple options. Let me see:\n\nNT54:\n- NT1\u2192 't2'\n- 't3'\n- NT84 \u2192 't2'\n- nt53 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, NT54's productions might have more options, but from the given list:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT54:\n\nNT54:\n- NT54 \u2192 NT1 NT (but NT1's RHS is 't2' from the given 'NT1 \u2192 't2'. So NT1 is a terminal 't2'.)\n- NT54 \u2192 NT84 NT (but NT84 \u2192 't2' terminal)\n- Also, NT54 \u2192 nt34 NT27, but not sure.\n\nWait, actually, the given list might have been cut off, so some NTs might have multiple productions. But looking carefully, the grammar seems to have multiple productions for some NTs, like NT47 has multiple arrows.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to represent the grammar with all possible productions.

So, when we expand NT84, it becomes 't1' (NT48 \u2192 't1') and NT5 \u2192 which is NT68 NT3. NT68 \u2192 't4', and NT3 \u2192 't0'. So, NT84 \u2192 't1' 't4' 't0'? Wait, that doesn't make sense because NT84 is a non-terminal and splits into two. Oh right, each expansion is two parts. So, NT84 \u2192 't1' followed by NT5, which is NT68 NT3. Wait, no, NT84's rule is NT48 NT5, so each step is a binary split.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me build the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4...'\n\nLet's see how 't0' can be derived. Looking at the rules, several non-terminals expand directly to 't0', like NT68, NT47, NT98, etc. So, perhaps at some point in the derivation, one of these non-terminals is used.\n\nWait, let's think about the start symbol: S \u2192 NT64 NT96. So, after expanding S, we have two parts: NT64 and NT96, each of which will be expanded into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62: NT84 \u2192 NT48 NT5. NT48 \u2192 't1', and NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3 \u2192 't4' and 't0'.\n\nSo, NT64 \u2192 't1' 't4' 't0'. Wait, but NT64 is one non-terminal that splits into two parts, not three. So, NT64 \u2192 (NT84) (NT62), each of which splits into two, making three terminals? No, each step is binary, so NT64 expands into two parts, each of which can further split. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the structure of the grammar and see if the string can be built by recursively applying the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of a parse tree. Let's try to see if the string can be formed.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to look for patterns. The string starts with 't0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4...' so perhaps the derivation begins with S \u2192 NT64 NT96, and each of these leads to certain terminals.\n\nWait, maybe we should trace the start:\n\nS \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nThen, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62, and NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT48 NT5. So, NT84 \u2192 't1' and NT5 \u2192 NT68 NT3 \u2192 't4' and 't0'.\n\nSo, NT64 \u2192 't1' 't4' 't0'? No, wait, NT64 is NT84 NT62, so when NT84 is 't1', then NT64 contributes 't1' and whatever comes from NT62.\n\nWait, NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT52 NT63 \u2192 't2' and 't0'. So, NT62 contributes 't2 t0'.\n\nSo, NT64 is 't1' (from NT84) followed by the expansion of NT62, which is 't2 t0'. So, NT64 \u2192 't1' followed by 't2 t0', making 't1 t2 t0'.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 is NT54 NT53. Let's look at NT54: NT54 \u2192 NT12 NT80. NT12 is 't3', and NT80 is NT77 NT81. NT77 is 't1', and NT81 is 't1'. So, NT54 \u2192 't3' 't1' 't1'. Wait, but NT54 is a non-terminal splitting into two parts, so it's 't3' followed by NT80 \u2192 't1' 't1', making NT54 \u2192 't3 t1 t1', which would be three terminals. But that would mean NT54 contributes three symbols.\n\nWait, maybe each step contributes two, but when they split into further terminals, it's adding more. Wait, no, each production rule for a non-terminal results in two parts, each of which could be a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo, NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. So, when we expand, it's 't3' 't1' 't1' (from NT54) followed by NT53.\n\nWhat is NT53? NT53 \u2192 NT86 NT33. NT86 is 't0', and NT33 \u2192 NT84 NT81. NT84 is 't1', and NT81 is 't1', so NT33 \u2192 't1 t1'. So, NT53 \u2192 't0' 't1 t1' \u2192 't0 t1 t1'.\n\nPutting this together, NT96 \u2192 't3 t1 t1' 't0 t1 t1', making 't3 t1 t1 t0 t1 t1'.\n\nWait, no, because each non-terminal splits into two. So, NT96 is NT54 and NT53. Each of those splits into two parts, so NT96 would expand into four symbols, unless some of those are terminals. Wait, this is getting messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the length of the string. The string has 39 symbols, which is quite long. Since the grammar uses only two symbols (I'm assuming 't0' and 't1' are the only terminals present), and each production splits into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, the number of symbols in the string can give me some clues.\n\nThe start symbol S is a non-terminal, and each production rule either contributes two symbols (if it's a non-terminal split) or adds one terminal and then another split.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to look for the structure of the string and see if it can be parsed according to the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string: 't0 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t1 t0 t2 t2 t4 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t3 t2 t1 t1'.\n\nI notice that many of the t's in the string are 't4'. Let's look back at the grammar rules to see where 't4' comes from.\n\nLooking at NT48 \u2192 't1', NT68 \u2192 't4', so 't4' comes from NT68.\n\nAlso, NT98 \u2192 't4' is one of its rules."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-948","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what I'm dealing with.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see that all productions either convert non-terminals into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal: 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals: `t0 t0 t1 t0 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t2 t0 t3 t0`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will correspond to the parse tree where each node has exactly two children (except leaves). So, the string's length should be compatible with the grammar's rules.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which has productions that lead to two NT parts. Each NT further breaks down into more NT or terminals. The string has 48 tokens, which is 2^something? Let me think. Each step in the leftmost derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. Starting from S, which is two NTs, each NT can produce two NTs or a terminal. So, the number of symbols should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. But 48 isn't a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 48 is in between, which suggests it's not a valid derivation because each step should double the number of symbols from S onwards, except when terminals are introduced.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me recount the steps. The initial S is two NT's. Each NT can either produce two NTs or a terminal. So, each NT production either adds one to the count (if it's a terminal) or doubles the count (if it's NT). So the total number of symbols would be 2^k, where k is the number of NT symbols. But the string has 48 symbols, which isn't a power of two. 48 is 16*3, but 16 is 2^4 and 3 is not a power of two. Hmm, does that mean it's impossible?\n\nWait, let's consider the string length. Each production could either produce one terminal or two non-terminals. Starting from S, which is two NTs, each NT can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the count of symbols when all non-terminals resolve to terminals will be:\n\nEach NT either contributes 1 (if terminal) or 2 (if not). Let's model it as:\n\nTotal symbols = sum over all NTs of (1 if terminal else 2) * (number of times NT appears).\n\nWait, maybe another approach. If each NT production can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal, then the length of the string would be calculated as follows:\n\nEach step in the leftmost derivation replaces a non-terminal with two or one (if it's a terminal). Wait, no, in CNF, every production must produce exactly two non-terminals except for the terminals. So, every non-terminal in the derivation splits into two, so the length starts at 2 (S \u2192 NT1 NT2), each of which can produce up to two each, so length becomes 4, then 8, etc. Therefore, the total length should be 2^n where n is the number of steps.\n\nBut the string has 48 symbols. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 48 isn't a power of two, so it can't be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the string can't be derived because the length is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake because some NTs directly produce terminals. For example, if a NT produces a terminal, like 't0', then instead of two symbols, it adds only one. So the total length can vary.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's more about whether the way the NTs produce terminals leads to the correct sequence. Let me think differently.\n\nEach time a NT produces a terminal, it reduces the number of non-terminals by one, but each production that produces two NTs increases it. So, the number of symbols at the end depends on how many NTs were used to produce terminals versus those that were further split.\n\nThe initial S is two NTs. Each NT can either lead to two NTs (so total NTs increase by one if each of the two becomes two, 2\u21924\u21928 etc.), or produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the number of terminals in a derivation is equal to the number of NTs that were replaced by terminals. So, if you start with two NTs, each replacement of an NT with a terminal reduces the total number of NTs by one. So, if you replace k NTs, you get a string of length 2^(n-k) * k, where n is the initial number of NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me model it differently. Suppose you have m NTs at a certain step. Each NT can either stay as two NTs or become a terminal. So, the number of symbols after replacing each NT is (number of NTs replaced) + (number that become two NTs) * 2.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe think recursively. The number of terminals in the derived string depends on how many NTs were expanded. Let's say for a given NT, the number of terminals produced is the sum of its children's terminal counts.\n\nBut perhaps for this problem, the main issue is the length of the string. Since in CNF, each derivation step leads to a string whose length is a power of two because each NT either expands into two NTs or a terminal. So the length of the string should be 2^k where k is the number of leftmost splits.\n\nBut the string has 48 symbols, which is not a power of two. So it's impossible for 48 to be 2^k; the closest powers are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). Since 48 isn't a power of two, it can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string is not in the language generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's see. First, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has non-terminals S, NT1 to NT98, and terminals t0, t1, t2, etc. Looking at the start symbol S, it expands into combinations of other non-terminals. For example, S can become NT64 NT96, or NT97 NT7, and so on. Each of these non-terminals then expand further according to the rules provided.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: `t0 t0 t1 t2 t1 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t3 t1 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t1 t0 t2 t0 t1 t2 t2 t4 t0 t1 t2 t2 t0 t3 t2 t1 t1`.\n\nFirst, I notice that this string is quite long, so it must be derived from quite a few steps. To check if the string is in the language generated by the grammar, I can try to break it down into chunks that match the terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals like NT68, NT3, NT97, and others expand directly to terminals like t0, t1, or t2. For example, NT68 can be t4, t3, or t2, depending on the production. Similarly, NT33 can be t1 or t0.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step:\n\n1. The first two terms are t0 t0. So I need to see if there's a production that starts with t0. Looking at the non-terminals, NT3, NT1, NT47, NT68, etc., expand to t0, t2, or t1.\n\nWait, actually, some non-terminals like NT3 expand to t0, nt3 -> t0. Similarly, NT97 -> t2, but the string starts with t0, so maybe NT3 or NT68 or NT98 could be the starting point.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS can go to NT64 NT96. Let's see what NT64 and NT96 expand to.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62. So NT64 is composed of NT84 and NT62.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 -> NT54 NT53.\n\nNow, let's see what NT84 and NT54 expand to.\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1.\n\nSo NT84 becomes NT4 and NT1.\n\nNT4 is a terminal? Or is NT4 a non-terminal that expands further? Looking back, I see NT4 is listed with a value, but in the grammar, are there any productions for NT4? Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT4 being used as a non-terminal. It only appears as a terminal 't4' in some rules, but I'm not sure if that's a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, looking again: the grammar productions only have non-terminals on the left side; the right side is terminals or other non-terminals. So terminals are only when we have letters like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT12 -> NT82 NT48. Wait, but the '48' part is not in the list. Wait, no, the productions only have the non-terminals on the left and right. Let me check the right-hand sides: for example, NT12 -> NT82 NT48. So 48 is a terminal? Or is it part of a non-terminal symbol? I think in the grammar, the right-hand side is a sequence of symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals. But the terminals are the 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT47 -> NT1 NT62.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some terminals are 't0', 't1', etc., which are leaves. So any production that has 't0', 't1' on the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nSo, in NT84 -> NT4 NT1. Since NT1 can expand to t2, then this becomes NT4 NT1, which is a combination of non-terminals and terminals. But this seems problematic because NT4 is a non-terminal, and we can't continue expanding it unless it has rules.\n\nWait, but looking back, I see that NT1 is present in the grammar, but do I have a production for NT1? The given grammar has NT1 -> NT5 NT77. So NT1 expands to NT5 NT77.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 -> NT68 NT3.\n\nWait, but in the right-hand sides, I'm only seeing non-terminals, except where a 't' appears, which is a terminal.\n\nSo now I'm getting a bit confused because I thought some parts like NT64 go to NT84 NT62, but NT62 doesn't have a production, but in the given list, Nt68 is present with some terms.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the productions are all left-hand sides, except where a 't' is on the right. So NT84 -> NT4 NT1 is correct; that's a production for NT84.\n\nBut now, how do I handle that in the grammar? Because NT84 is a non-terminal, but if its right-hand side includes non-terminals, I need to expand those as well. So the process would be to start from S and try to match the string step by step, sometimes recursively expanding.\n\nBut with such a long string, manually expanding step by step would be tedious. Maybe I can look for the string to split into chunks that match certain productions. Let me try to parse the string from the beginning into possible chunks.\n\nThe string starts with t0 t0. So perhaps the first part is t0 t0. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminals that produce t0 include NT3, NT98, NT68, NT33, etc.\n\nWait, the grammar has several non-terminals that expand to t0, like NT3, NT68, NT33, etc.\n\nLooking at S's first production: S -> NT64 NT96. So the expansion starts with NT64 NT96. Let's see what NT64 and NT96 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT64 -> NT84 NT62.\n\nNT96 -> NT54 NT53.\n\nSo NT64 becomes NT84 NT62, which are both non-terminals, and NT96 becomes NT54 NT53, which are also non-terminals.\n\nNow, expanding further:\n\nNT84 -> NT4 NT1. So NT84 expands to NT4 and NT1.\n\nNT4 is a terminal? No, I think NT4 is a non-terminal because it's in the grammar as a left-hand side.\n\nWait, but in the productions, I don't see any rules for NT4, except it's on the right-hand side of some productions, like NT68 -> 't4', but I'm not sure if that's a terminal or not.\n\nWait, no, the terminal symbols are only 't0's, 't1's, etc. So if a non-terminal is written without being a left-hand side, is it treated as a terminal? Probably not. So perhaps in the grammar, NT4 is a non-terminal.\n\nBut this seems problematic because I can't expand further unless I know its production. In the given list, I don't see any production for NT4, which is on the right-hand side of NT64.\n\nWait, this suggests that maybe the problem statement is missing some parts of the grammar, but according to the user's message, that's all the grammar provided.\n\nThis could be a problem because without knowing further production rules, certain non-terminals might not have defined structures, leading to infinite loops or impossible expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how to interpret the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar symbols.\n\nIn the grammar given, the non-terminals are all the letters from S, NT1, NT2, etc. The right-hand sides are some of these non-terminals and terminals 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nSo, in NT84 -> NT4 NT1, NT84 is expanding into two non-terminals, NT4 and NT1. But we need to know what NT4 expands into to proceed.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT47, NT4, NT1, etc. Wait, does NT4 have any production? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the production rules provided, I don't see any line that starts with NT4, so it might not have any productions, implying it's a terminal. But wait, no, because in the grammar, NT4 is on the right-hand side of some productions, it's more likely a non-terminal, which would mean it has a production rule, but it's missing from the list provided.

{"custom_id":"request-963","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a terminal string or a non-terminal producing exactly two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, let's understand the grammar. It consists of several non-terminals (S, NT1, NT2, ..., NT98) and terminals (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4). Each non-terminal has productions that break it down into smaller parts until we reach the terminals, which represent the actual characters of the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, can be rewritten in a few ways:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT64 NT96\n2. S \u2192 NT97 NT7\n3. S \u2192 NT35 NT84\n\nSo, the first step when trying to derive the string is to choose one of these three options for S. The string starts with t0, t0, t1, etc., so I need to see which of these S productions can lead to this.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT64, NT66, NT7, etc., but perhaps it's better to look at how each of these NTs can derive into terminals. For example, NT64 \u2192 NT84 NT62. Then each of NT84 and NT62 can be broken down further. NT84 can produce 't2', and NT62 can produce 't0'. So S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would produce t2 followed by (the result of NT96). \n\nLet's see NT96: NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53. Then NT54 \u2192 't2' and NT53 \u2192 't1'. So NT96 would be t2 t1. So the production S \u2192 NT64 NT96 would give us t2 t2 t1. But the string starts with t0 t0 t1, so this path might not be the correct one, unless there's a way to get more t0s. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider S \u2192 NT97 NT7. NT97 \u2192 NT43 NT75. Then NT43 \u2192 't0', NT75 \u2192 NT98 NT26. NT98 \u2192 NT78 NT14, NT78 \u2192 't0', NT14 \u2192 NT33 NT27. NT33 can produce 't1' (from NT33 \u2192 't1'), and NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT62. Wait, but NT24 can break down into 't4' and other terminals. This path might not immediately lead to the initial t0s as in the string.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT35 NT84. NT35 \u2192 't3', and NT84 \u2192 't2', producing t3 t2, which doesn't match the initial t0 t0 in the string.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should try to work backwards from the string using the Pushdown Automaton (PDA) method for CNF grammars. In the PDA approach, we process each symbol in the string and see if we can derive it using the productions in a way that builds up the string step by step.\n\nSince the string starts with t0, let's see if any non-terminals directly produce t0. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't2'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' or 't0' or 't4' (from NT68 \u2192 't3', 't0' only if it's a terminal; but looking back, earlier entries show NT68 \u2192 't4' as well? Wait, let me check the grammar. Oh, here's NT68: NT68 -> 't3' or 't4'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are multiple rules. Let me parse through all the terminal productions:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't1'\nNT66 \u2192 't4'\nNT64 \u2192 't4'\nNT53 \u2192 't2'\nNT39 \u2192 't0'\nNT70 \u2192 't4'\nNT97 \u2192 't2'\nNT98 \u2192 't0'\nNT33 \u2192 't1' and 't0' (wait, under NT33: it has two rules: NT33 -> 't1' and NT33 -> 't0'. So yes, NT33 can produce t0 or t1.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the NTs that can produce t0:\n- NT33 \u2192 t0 or t1\n- NT54 \u2192 't1' (but under NT54, there's a rule: NT54 \u2192 't2'? Wait, let me recheck the grammar. Actually, looking at the grammar, it's a bit messy because each production is written with multiple rules. Let me list all terminal productions for each NT:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\nNT64 -> 't4'\nNT96 -> 't4' (from S to NT96 \u2192 NT54 NT53, where NT54 \u2192 't2', NT53 \u2192 't1' gives 't2t1' so not t0)\nWait, perhaps I should go back to each NT and list the terminal rules explicitly.\n\nLooking at each NT and the terminal rules:\n- NT33: 't1' and 't0' (two rules)\n- NT54: from the grammar, it's written as NT54 -> 't1' and 't2' looking at the entries: wait, no, the production for NT54 is:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT54: NT53 \u2192 't1' and 't2'? Wait, no, the NT53 production is under NT53: 't2'. Wait, perhaps I should list all the terminal rules for each NT.\n\nWait, maybe that's taking too long, but maybe I can find NTs that directly produce t0.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT33: two rules, 't1' and 't0'\n- NT54: looking at the grammar, it's written as NT54 -> 't1' (from NT53 \u2192 't1') but not sure. Wait, no, each NT's production is separate. Let me parse each NT and see what terminals they map to.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNT47: two rules \u2192 't1' and 't4'\nNT66: two rules \u2192 't4' and 't3'\nNT64: two rules \u2192 't4', 't62' (but 't62' isn't a terminal; then later we have NT56? Wait no, in the given grammar, I need to parse the rules correctly.\n\nWait, hold on. The grammar seems to have some entries that look like NTxy \u2192 'tZ'. So for example:\n\nNT68 -> 't4'\n\nNT64 -> 't4'\n\nNT66 -> 't4'\n\nNT77 -> 't3'\n\nNT33 -> 't1'\n\nAnd so on. Some entries like NT35 -> 't3' are direct.\n\nSo, focusing on NTs that directly produce 't0':\n\nLooking through, the grammar has:\n\n- NT33: 't1' and 't0' \u2192 so can produce t0\n- NT93: probably not present\n- NT12: 't3'\n- NT39: 't0'\n- NT70: 't4'\n\nLooking further, is there any NT that can produce t0? Yes, NT33 and NT39.\n\nSo, the entire string starts with t0. How can we get a t0 as the first symbol? The only way is if the starting symbol S can derive a non-terminal that produces t0 as the first symbol. But S isn't a terminal, so S must be rewritten into two non-terminals. For example, S -> NT64 NT96. Then NT64 and NT96 can be rewritten further.\n\nBut let's see if any of these can produce t0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the string: t0 t0 t1 t4 t4 ... etc. So the first two symbols are t0 t0.\n\nWe need to find a way to generate t0, then another t0, using the non-terminals.\n\nBut each non-terminal must be replaced by two non-terminals, which in turn produce symbols.\n\nAlternatively, considering the string starts with t0, perhaps it must be generated by a non-terminal that can directly produce t0. But in the context of the PDA approach, since it's a top-down parser, you split the input string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to apply the method of checking if each part of the string can be generated by the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to track the possible symbols that each non-terminal can produce. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal can only produce a single terminal symbol at each step, except during the expansion.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because that simplifies things a bit. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens with numbers, and I need to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So, in the given grammar, all rules except for the terminals should be in the form of two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Let me check a few rules to confirm. For example, S \u2192 NT64 NT96 fits the pattern as it's two non-terminals. Similarly, NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3 also looks correct. All the non-term rules seem to fit this structure.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' tokens. The terminals in the grammar are various 't' with different numbers, like 't0', 't1', etc. So, this string is built from these terminals, and I need to see if each can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI should probably start by looking for how to produce these t's. For instance, some production rules directly produce a single 't' symbol, like NT3 \u2192 't0'. Others produce combinations of non-terminals that eventually resolve to t symbols. So my approach should be to break down the given string into parts that correspond to the production rules.\n\nLet me look for the first t0 in the string: 't0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4 t1 t4 t2 t4 t2 t4 t0 t2 t0 t3 t2 t2 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t2 t4 t0 t0 t2 t0 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2'.\n\nThe first t0 could come from NT3 \u2192 't0', NT97 \u2192 't2', NT98 \u2192 't1', or others.

Hmm, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me cross-check.\n\nWait, the grammar definitions are listed after the context-free grammar. So each non-terminal rule is either producing another non-terminal or a terminal. For example, NT47 \u2192 NT21 NT3, and also elsewhere I see NT47 has other rules like NT47 \u2192 't4'. Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, each non-terminal rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.
