{"custom_id":"request-1","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the grammar provided generates the string 't7'. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a specific way to structure context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Here, 'a' in this context seems to be the terminal symbols, which correspond to 't' and 'n' based on the productions.\n\nThe string to check is 't7'. So, I'm thinking about how the grammar can derive this string. Let me start by looking at the top-level symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the string must be S followed by NT91 and NT22, but wait, NT22 is a non-terminal that ends with 't7' from the production NT22 \u2192 't8'? No, wait, looking back, NT22's production is given as NT22 \u2192 't8'. So, the string would be S followed by 't8' and 't9' if N91 is 't9'.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Wait, the NT91 is another non-terminal. Looking at the NT91 production: NT91 \u2192 't8' according to one of the productions, right? So, S \u2192 NT91 NT22 would lead to 't8' followed by 't8'? But the string we have is 't7', so that doesn't seem right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let me write down the productions first to see exactly how each non-terminal leads to a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n- NT22 \u2192 't8' (since I see NT22 \u2192 't8' is present)\n- Wait, actually, no, looking again, the NT22 production is given as NT22 \u2192 't8'? Or is that 't8' for another NT? Let me check all the NT productions to see which ones lead to 't7' or 't8' or 't9' etc.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, for example, NT91 \u2192 't8', according to the given rules. So, if S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and NT91 \u2192 't8', and NT22 \u2192 't8', then the entire string would be 't8t8', which is 't88', which isn't the string we have. So that's a problem because we need 't7'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misread the productions. Let me go back through the NT productions and see if any NT leads to 't7'.\n\nLooking up:\n\n- NT76 \u2192 't5'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT69 \u2192 't3'\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5' (same as before)\n- NT51 \u2192 't3'\n- NT96 \u2192 't6'\n- Wait, maybe I missed something.

Actually, looking at the NT26 productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't7'\n- NT26 \u2192 't9'\n- Wait, yes, look at the list: NT26 is \"NT26 -> 't7' NT90\" and \"NT26 -> 't9' NT26\", but I think I may have misread it earlier when listing the productions.

{"custom_id":"request-5","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if the string \"t8\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to structure the production rules of a grammar. Each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. The question is whether \"t8\" can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that all the non-terminals eventually end up producing terminal symbols (like 't', 'n', 'e', etc.) or combinations of them. So, I need to see how \"t8\" can be formed by combining these.\n\nThe string we're given is \"t8\". So, each character in the string is a terminal symbol, and each of these letters must be the result of a production from non-terminals. But wait, the grammar structure might complicate things because each step involves two non-terminals, except maybe the first step.\n\nLet me start by trying to see how the string \"t8\" can be built up. Each 't' and each '8' must come from some production in the grammar. I'll try to work backward from the string to see if it's possible.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is '8', so we need a production that ends with '8'. Looking at the grammar, is there a non-terminal that produces '8'? Let's check each production.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT56 -> 't7'\n- NT79 -> 't7'\n- NT96 -> 't6'\n- NT41 -> 't0'\n- NT87 -> 't5'\n- NT38 -> 't6'\n- NT68 -> 't5'\n- NT41 -> 't1'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n\nSo, NT6 and NT22 both directly produce 't8'. That's a good start because the string ends with '8', which could come from either NT6 or NT22. Let's pick one and see if we can backtrack further.\n\nSince the string is \"t8\", I can think of it as the result of some production ending with '8'. Let's take 't8' as the last part of a production. Looking again, both NT6 and NT22 produce 't8' directly (NT6 -> 't8'; NT22 -> 't8'). So that leaves us to see how each part of \"t8\" is formed.\n\nBut wait, \"t8\" is just one symbol. Hmm, that might not make sense because, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single non-terminal. But for a string of length 2, you would need two non-terminals that each produce a single symbol, and those in turn should have been reachable by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me reframe: each terminal symbol must be produced by some non-terminal, but perhaps through a chain of productions. So, \"t8\" would require that t comes from one non-terminal and 8 comes from another, both of which are productions in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, looking at the production list, I see that NT96 and others produce 't8' directly. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the production S -> NT91 NT22. So S produces two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. Each of these can produce further non-terminals, until we hit a terminal.\n\nTo get \"t8\", maybe the start symbol S can be derived into NT91 and NT22, each of which then produce something. But how do we get \"t8\" from this?\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S -> NT91 NT22. So to produce S, we need NT91 and NT22, each of which must be able to produce a terminal symbol. Let's see if either NT91 or NT22 can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT91: NT91 -> NT96 NT1. Hmm, so it's two non-terminals. So NT91 can't produce a terminal directly. It has to go through NT96 and NT1. Similarly, NT22: looking at NT22, it's a production in the grammar. Let me check NT22's production.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the production for NT22 is NT68 -> NT68 NT25, but I need to check each NT22.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the notation. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- S -> NT91 NT22 (line 1)\n- NT22 -> NT87 NT98 (line 2)\n\nSo NT22 is first produced as NT87 and NT98. Each of these may be further broken down.\n\nLooking at NT87: line 7 is NT87 -> NT95 NT53. Then NT95 -> NT13 NT1 (line 12). Hmm, getting more non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going to get stuck in loops. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe string is \"t8\". So each character must be a terminal, so perhaps each symbol comes from a non-terminal that produces a terminal. The key is to see if the grammar can produce \"t8\".\n\nLooking at the productions, NT6 -> 't8' (line: NT6 -> 't8'), so NT6 can produce 't8'. That means that if we have NT6, it can produce 't8'. Similarly, NT22 -> 't8' (line: NT22 -> 't8').\n\nSo if S can produce NT6 or NT22, then S can produce 't8' directly. But wait, looking at the start S, it's S -> NT91 NT22. So S is splitting into NT91 and NT22, each of which must be non-terminals, both of which need to produce terminals to get \"t8\".\n\nBut wait, to get \"t8\", we need the entire string to result from S. So if S produces NT91 and NT22, each of those would produce some terminal strings, and together their concatenation would be the result.\n\nSo, if NT91 produces 't' and NT22 produces '8', then the string would be \"t8\". Alternatively, the other way around. But does the grammar allow that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT91 can produce 't' and NT22 can produce '8'. So I need to check if NT91 can produce 't' and NT22 can produce '8'.\n\nLooking at NT91: line 10 is NT91 -> NT96 NT1. NT96 is part of line 14: NT96 -> 't7'. So NT96 can produce 't7' directly. So NT91, which goes to NT96 and NT1, needs to produce 't' and something else. But NT1's production is NT97 NT41 (line 16). Hmm, that seems complicated.\n\nWait, if NT91 -> NT96 NT1, and NT96 can produce 't7', then to get the first symbol 't', maybe that's from NT96.\n\nWait, but that doesn't help. Because if NT96 gives 't7', then NT91 would have to produce 't7' and whatever NT1 produces, which might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's see if any non-terminal directly produces 't8'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nYes, NT6 and NT22 both directly produce 't8'. So if I can find a derivation where the start symbol S can produce NT22, which in turn produces 't8', that would be one way. Alternatively, if I can get S to produce NT6, then that would also give 't8'.\n\nLet me think about the path S -> NT91 NT22. Assuming NT22 can produce 't8', then the other part, NT91, needs to produce something else? No, wait, the total string is two symbols, but NT22 is producing 't8', which is a single symbol. But no, because NT22 is a non-terminal; if it can produce 't8', then S can produce 't8' directly by splitting into NT91 and NT22, each producing something.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: in Chomsky normal form, every production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So S -> NT91 NT22 is a production of two non-terminals. Thus, to get the string, both NT91 and NT22 must be able to produce single terminals, concatenated. But wait, \"t8\" is two symbols. So each of NT91 and NT22 must produce one symbol each.\n\nWait, but looking back, I see that S is divided into two parts: NT91 and NT22. So each must produce one terminal, but NT91 and NT22 are separate non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT22"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

First, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The provided grammar seems to be in CNF since all the non-terminals on the left side have exactly two non-terminals on the right except for a few that have terminals. Wait, actually, looking again, most have two non-terminals, but maybe some have a mix or two terminals, which would violate CNF, but the user said it's in CNF, so I must have misread some rules.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. It looks like most rules have two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which are both non-terminals. Then NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, again both non-terminals. Similarly, NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41, which are two non-terminals. Wait, but in CNF, each production can only have two non-terminals or a terminal. So if a production has two non-terminals, like A \u2192 BC, and single terminals are fine. However, in this grammar, some rules have two non-terminals on the RHS, but I don't see any that have more than two, and I think the only terminals are the 't's. So each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, NT91 \u2192 't8', so that's a single terminal. So when generating a string, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and eventually, when the non-terminals are replaced with terminals, they form the string.\n\nSo the string to evaluate is \"t7 t2\". That's two symbols, both 't's. Now, to derive this, we need a derivation where the start symbol S ultimately produces two terminals.

Wait, in the initial grammar provided, I think each non-terminal has one or more productions.\n\nSo, for NT6, it has two productions: \u2192 't5' and \u2192 't8'. Therefore, in the parse tree, when we derive, NT6 could be replaced with either t5 or t8. That makes it a bit more complex.\n\nSimilarly, NT31 has two productions: NT54 NT31 and \u2192 't2'. Wait, no, looking at the list, NT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31 and NT31 \u2192 't2'. So, when deriving, NT31 could produce t2 or if followed by more non-terminals.\n\nNow, the given string is \"t7 t2\". So it's two symbols, both terminals. So let's think about how the start symbol S could generate this. S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, to get t7 and t2, both NT91 and NT22 must produce their respective terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, NT91. From the grammar, does NT91 have a production that produces t7? Looking at the rules, I don't see NT91 having 't7' as a terminal. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT95 \u2192 't7', NT22 \u2192 't8', NT38 \u2192 't2', etc. But wait, is there an NT91 that produces 't7'? Let me search for NT91.\n\nI see the rule S \u2192 NT91 NT22, but in the list of rules, the line is:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo, that suggests NT95 \u2192 't7', but not NT91. So does NT91 have a production to 't7'? I don't see any NT91 \u2192 't7' in the rules. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n- NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n- NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n- NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n- NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\n- NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n- NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n- NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\n- NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\n- NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\n- NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\n- NT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n- NT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31\n- NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\n- NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n- NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\n- NT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26\n- NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\n- NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT95 \u2192 't7' (duplicate, seems like maybe a typo)\n- NT38 \u2192 't2'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- NT26 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n- NT26 \u2192 NT69 NT29 (Wait, no, in the initial list, it's maybe a mistyped line.

Looking again, the line says:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't7'\n\nBut in the rules, maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be another rule, like NT26 \u2192 NT69 NT29 or something. Similarly, there are multiple rules for NT6 with 't5' and 't8', but perhaps that's intentional.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial part of the grammar has multiple entries for the same non-terminal with different productions. For example, NT91 is present only once, but perhaps I missed where it can produce 't7'.\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see NT91 having a rule that directly produces 't7'.

{"custom_id":"request-19","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string \"t7 t9\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which helps because each production rule has no more than two non-terminals on the right side, making it easier to parse. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at how the string is broken down into tokens: \"t7\" and \"t9\". So, I'm guessing that each of these tokens must be matched by some terminal in the grammar. Let me scan through the grammar to see what terminals are present.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see a lot of production rules that start with NT and end with some terminal symbols. For example, NT95 -> 't7', NT38 -> 't2', NT6 -> 't5', etc. I need to find which non-terminals can produce 't7' and 't9'.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't7'. Let me check the rules where the result is 't7'. \n\nLooking at NT76: NT76 -> NT69 NT26. Then, I need to see if either of those NTs can produce 't7'. Looking at NT69 -> 't3' (from NT69), but wait, that's only if NT69 is involved. Hmm, maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, looking at NT7: NT7 -> NT69 NT96. Then NTo: NTo -> NT90 NT79. NT90 is 't9', and NTo is 't0'. Then, looking at NTo again, NTo -> NT90 NT79, which is 't9' and N79. Maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking for terminals that are 't7'. Let me go through the grammar:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7' (Yes, so NT95 can produce 't7')\n- NT6 -> 't5', 't2', 't3', etc.\n- NT31 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> 't1', 't5', 't6'\n- Looking at NT22: NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT79 -> 't7', so NT79 can produce 't7'\n- NT56 -> 't0', 't7', etc.\n\nWait, so I found that NT95 and NT79 both can produce 't7' directly. So if I can derive 't7', that's good.\n\nNow, the second token is 't9'. Let's see what gives 't9'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, maybe NT98 -> 't5', but wait. Let me check NT98: NT98 -> NT90 NT87. NT90 is 't9', so yes, NT98 can produce 't9' because when you expand it, you get 't9' from NT90.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NTs that produce 't9' directly. Maybe NT95 can produce 't7', but that's not helpful. What about NT51? NT51 -> NT51 NT68. Hmm, that doesn't help. Wait, looking again: NT51 -> NT51 NT68? No, I think I'm mistaken. Wait, the rules are all about non-terminals; some end with terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's see if any non-terminals directly produce 't9'. \n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT90 -> 't9'. So NT90 can produce 't9'. So, I can have NTo -> 't9'.\n\nBut how do I get a whole string? The string is 't7' and 't9', which would be two separate terminals, so each must come from an NT production that results in that terminal.\n\nLet me think about the start symbol S. The start symbol is S -> NT91 NT22. So S creates two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet's see what those produce.\n\nLooking up NT91: NT91 -> 't8'. So NT91 produces 't8', which is one token, but the string we have is 't7' followed by 't9'. So S -> NT91 NT22 becomes 't8' followed by whatever NT22 produces. But in our string, the first token is 't7', not 't8', so S can't be derived to give 't7' as the first symbol. Therefore, perhaps this path is not the correct one.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT95 and NT79 again. NT95 can produce 't7', right? So if I have a NT95 in some production, I can produce 't7'.\n\nBut how do I get NT95 in a production? Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT95: NT95 -> NT13 NT1, and then maybe NT1 produces something. Wait, wait, let's go step by step.\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT91 NT22. NT91 -> 't8', NT22 -> 't8'. So S would produce 't8 t8', but our target string is 't7 t9', so that path doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another production starts with S. Wait, looking back at the grammar, it's possible I missed a production for S. No, in the given grammar, S only goes to NT91 NT22. So S must derive through NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo that means, according to that, the start string would be NT91 NT22 -> 't8' 't8'. But that's not our target string.\n\nWait, but that must mean that the grammar as presented doesn't include any other S productions. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, or maybe I missed a production. Wait, looking back, S is only given to produce NT91 NT22. So S can only produce those two non-terminals, leading to two terminals.\n\nBut in our target string, we have two tokens: 't7' and 't9'. So maybe there's another way. Wait, perhaps NT91 doesn't necessarily produce 't8' in one step, but maybe via more productions. Wait, NT91 is a non-terminal, so perhaps I need to expand it further.\n\nWait, I thought NT91 directly produces 't8', but looking back, let me check:\n\nNT91 -> 't8' \u2014 yes, that's correct. So S -> NT91 NT22 becomes 't8' followed by whatever NT22 produces. But if NT22 is 't8', then 't8 t8', which doesn't match our target.\n\nSo that path doesn't work. Is there another start production? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-check the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, meaning each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking back at S: S -> NT91 NT22. Right, so that's the start. Each of those NTs must be expanded into the string.\n\nBut for the string to have 't7 t9', we need to see if any other non-terminals in the grammar can lead to that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider NTs that can produce 't7' and 't9' in two steps. Let's say, for 't7', if I can have a path that goes NT95 -> 't7', and for 't9', a path that goes NT90 -> 't9'.\n\nSo, if S -> NT91 NT22, and those produce 't8' and 't8', that's not our target.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let me consider all NTs that can produce 't7' and 't9'.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFor 't7' possible NTs:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7' directly\n- NT79 -> 't7' directly\n- Any others? Let me check other NTs:\n\nNT22 is 't8', so no. NT7 is 't1' or 't7'?\n\nWait, maybe looking at NT1. NT1: NT1 -> NT97 NT41 and others. But NT97 is 't1', and NT41 is 't0'. So NT1 -> 't1 t0', which doesn't help.\n\nWait, let's try another angle. The string is 't7 t9', which means two symbols. So each symbol must come from some NT production.\n\nLet's see if any pair of NTs can lead to these. For example:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7', then NT90 -> 't9'\n\nSo, S would have to produce NT95 and NT90. But looking at the productions, S only goes to NT91 and NT22, so that seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, could another start exist? No, S is only that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with NT98. NT98 -> NT90 NT87. NT90 is 't9', and NT87 might produce 't7'.\n\nLooking at NT87: NT87 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is given with a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is `t7 t5 t3`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the rules provided, they all seem to fit this structure\u2014each rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the grammar is in the correct form.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string `t7 t5 t3` can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the string has three tokens, I suspect the process involves three productions or maybe two steps, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Let me break this down.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Each of these is a non-terminal, so the first step is to expand S into NT91 and NT22. Then, we'll need to expand each of these NTs into their respective symbols, which can be either other NTs or terminals.\n\nLet me start by writing down the replacements needed. The target string is `t7 t5 t3`, so I need to match each token in the string with the appropriate rules.\n\nLet's handle each 't' token one by one.\n\n1. The first token is 't7'. I look through the rules for 't7' and find:\n   - NT7 -> 't7' (rule exists)\n   \n   So, for the first 't7', NT7 can directly produce 't7'.\n\n2. The second token is 't5'. Looking through the rules, 't5' appears multiple times:\n   - NT6 \u2192 't5'\n   - NT2 \u2192 't5'\n   - NT41 \u2192 't0' (But that's 't0', not 't5')\n   - But wait, looking back, I see NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31.

Hmm, let me check all NTs that produce 't5'. \n\nLooking again, the production rules where the right-hand side is a terminal 't5' are:\n   - NT6 \u2192 't5'\n   - NT26 \u2192 't5' (since in the rules, NT26's first option is NT73 NT76, but wait, no, that's a non-terminal. Wait, let me recount. Looking at the rules again, is there any NT that directly produces 't5'?\n\nWait, in the rules provided, I have:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5' (from the rules: NT6 -> 't5'), and NT26 -> 't6' (so not 't5'), NT2 -> 't5' as well. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't5' exists.\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' exists?\n\nWait, in the rules, I don't see NT2 \u2192 't5' listed.

NT26 -> NT73 NT76, which aren't terminals, so it doesn't directly produce 't5'. So the only direct 't5' is from NT6.\n\nWait, but looking again, I realize I might have made a mistake earlier.

Got it.\n\nSimilarly, let's check NT95: NT95 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT5: I think in the grammar, NT5 isn't a non-terminal; perhaps I'm focusing on the wrong ones. So focusing on NT95 being 't7', which is 't7'.\n\nWait, but our string is t4, t8, t9. So let's try to see how to get t4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what non-terminals produce 't4'?

Let me scan for other NTs that produce terminals like 't4', 't8', or 't9'.)\n\nWait, NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12, and NT8 \u2192 't5' or NT79?

Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, NT26 is defined as NT76 and NT96? No, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT26 is:\n\nNT26 -> 't7' or 't9'\n\nSo NT26 \u2192 't7' or 't9'\n\nSimilarly, NT76 is NT69 NT26\n\nWait, NT76 is NT69 NT26. So if NT26 can be 't7' or 't9', then NT76 can contribute either 't7' or 't9'.\n\nWait, but how are these connected to the string \"t4 t8 t9\"?\n\nSo, stepping back: the string is \"t4\", \"t8\", \"t9\". So the entire string is three terminals in sequence.\n\nWe need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence starting from S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT68 NT41\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\n\nHere, NT6 is either 't5' or 't8'.\n\nSuppose we choose NT6 \u2192 't8' for the first 't8' in the string. That's good because we need the second part of the string as 't8 t9'.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t4\", \"t8\", \"t9\" \u2014 t4 comes first, so does any part of the grammar produce 't4'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, where do we get 't4'?

I need to see how the string can be derived from these.\n\nThe string is \"t1 t8 t5 t3\". So it's four tokens, each of which is a terminal symbol. Let's break it down.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, each production either has a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the string must have a leftmost derivation of length 4, meaning it's generated by starting from S and expanding until four terminals are produced.\n\nLet me see the start symbol: S. It goes to NT91 NT22. So the first split is NT91 and NT22.\n\nEach of these can only expand into two symbols, so the next step would combine these into four symbols. Wait no, actually, each non-terminal can produce two symbols, so S directly can't lead to four terminals in one step. So perhaps we need to expand each non-terminal step by step.\n\nLet me outline the possible steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n2. Now, NT91 and NT22 each can produce two symbols. So the next step is to expand each to have four symbols. Each of them will produce two, so the string will have four terminals if all the non-terminals are terminal at that point.\n\nWait, but each production for NT91 and NT22 would result in something like two symbols each. Let me check the productions:\n\nNT91: I don't see a production for NT91 in the given rules. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking back, NT91 \u2192 is there any rule? No, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nNT91 is the non-terminal. Let's see, NT91 is in the grammar as a terminal? Wait, no, looking back, the rule S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is given, but I don't see NT91 being a non-terminal; instead, NT91 is a terminal because no production is given for it except if I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, I think I misread. The non-terminals are all the NT... like NT91, NT22, etc. So in the initial production S \u2192 NT91 NT22, both NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals, because each of them appears in the left-hand side of different productions.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the given grammar, each symbol is either a non-terminal (NT followed by numbers) or a terminal (with a 't' prefix and numbers). So S is a non-terminal, and each NT... is a non-terminal, except when they are terminals, like NT91 may or may not be a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So if a non-terminal produces a terminal and a non-terminal, that's allowed.\n\nSo, looking at NT91: is there a production for NT91? Let me scan the rules. I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\nBut I don't see a production for NT91 except maybe as a terminal if it's present as a terminal, but in the given rules, I don't see a production rule for NT91. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, looking back, after S, the next is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So NT91 must produce something. Let me check if there's any rule for NT91. The rules list includes:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT70 \u2192 (Wait, not present in the given rules, as per the user's list.)\n\nWait, let me scan again. I think I might have misread the initial problem. The user wrote a long list of rules, starting with S and ending with several NT rules. Let me check the initial list again to see if NT91 has a production.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see a production for NT91. That suggests that NT91 is a terminal. Because in a CFG in ChNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So if NT91 is not present on the left-hand side of any production except the start symbol, then it's a terminal.\n\nSo, NT91 is a terminal. Similarly, I can check for NT22. In the rules, after NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, is there a production for NT22? Let's see: no, NT22 doesn't appear on the left of any production beyond that. So NT22 is a terminal. So S \u2192 NT91 NT22, expanding into two terminals.\n\nWait, but in this case, S would produce two terminals, which can't match our string of four terminals. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake; maybe NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals that can themselves be expanded into more symbols.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in the initial step, S \u2192 NT91 NT22 would mean two symbols, and the string is four. So perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT91 and NT22 can expand into non-terminals that can further expand into more terminals, building up to four in total.\n\nLet me write down the initial expansion step by step.\n\nStart: S\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nSo now we have two symbols: NT91 and NT22.\n\nNow, each of these must expand into two symbols each for the total to be four terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-39","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t6 t2 t4 t9\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are defined by a start symbol, production rules, and terminals. In this case, the start symbol is S, and the terminals are the 't' strings like 't6', 't2', etc. The non-terminals are the NT with numbers: NT22, NT12, etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is \"t6 t2 t4 t9\". I think I should parse this string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions are all of the form NTXY -> NTXZ NTYV, except for some where a NT has a terminal. Wait, no, actually, most of them go to two non-terminals, except for a few that directly go to a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals.\n\nWait, actually, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammars provided are indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string is four terminals long: t6, t2, t4, t9. So in terms of the number of non-terminals, each step in the parse would break the string into smaller parts based on how the non-terminals can produce two terminals or further.\n\nLet me think about how the string can be split. For a string of four terminals, the parse tree would have a root that splits into two parts, each of which could be either a single terminal or another split into two.\n\nSo maybe the first step is to see if the entire string can be matched by a production of the form NTXY -> NTXZ NTYV, but the right-hand side would have to produce the whole string. But that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards by trying to match the string against the known terminal rules. For example, looking at the grammar, there are several terminals defined directly:\n\nNT51 -> 't5'\nNT38 -> 't2'\nNT50 -> 't9'\nNT12 -> 't1' (Wait, that's 't1', but the string has t4. Hmm, maybe others.)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT98 -> 't5'\nNT56 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT41 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't6'\nNT76 -> 't3'\nNT96 -> 't6'\nNT96 -> 't5' (Wait, maybe it's a typo. Maybe only one of them is 't6' or both are 't6'? Maybe I need to confirm.)\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n\n- NT96 -> 't7'\n- NT38 -> 't2'\n- NT76 -> 't3' (since it appears twice: NT76 -> NT69 NT26, and later NT76 -> 't3' or something else? Wait, looking back at the original grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar lines are a bit complicated, so maybe I'm missing some. Let me list them:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each line is an NT production:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nNT26 -> 't7'\n\nNT90 -> 't9'\n\nNT8 -> 't5'\n\nNT56 -> 't7'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT41 -> 't0'\n\nNT25 -> 't6'\n\nNT76 -> 't5'\n\nNT96 -> 't6'\n\nNT96 -> 't5' (Wait, is this a mistake? Or maybe two separate rules for NT96? Maybe it's a typo, perhaps only one? Or perhaps the second one is another rule or continuation.)\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me parse each line correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is defined as follows:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nNT26 -> 't7'\n\nNT90 -> 't9'\n\nNT8 -> 't5'\n\nNT56 -> 't7' (I think this line says NT56 -> 't7')\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT41 -> 't0'\n\nNT25 -> 't6'\n\nNT76 -> 't5'\n\nNT96 -> 't6'\n\nWait, perhaps the last NT96 is an error. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT96 -> 't7'\n\nand\n\nNT96 -> 't5'\n\nSo that would imply that NT96 can produce either 't7' or 't5', but that seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo in the input. Alternatively, perhaps it's correct. For example, NT96 might have multiple terminal productions. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, proceeding.\n\nNow, the string is t6 t2 t4 t9. We need to parse this from left to right.\n\nSo, starting with the entire string t6 t2 t4 t9.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nNT91 and NT22. Let's see what these can produce.\n\nLooking up NT91: Looking through the productions, I don't see NT91 defined except as part of S. So it's a non-terminal that must be expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nSo S ultimately breaks down into NT91 (which we don't know yet) and NT22 (which becomes NT87 NT98).\n\nWait, perhaps this parsing tree is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider possible parse trees starting from the beginning of the string.\n\nTo break down the string t6 t2 t4 t9 into two parts at each step, since each production can split into two non-terminals. So perhaps the first split is into 't6' and the rest, then 't2' and so on, but I might need to think in terms of possible production sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each pair can be formed by the productions.\n\nLooking at each terminal:\n\nt6 occurs at the beginning. So can NT91 produce 't6'?\n\nLooking for a production for NT91: S -> NT91 NT22, and no other productions for NT91, as far as I can tell. So NT91 is a non-terminal, so it must be broken down into other symbols.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nSo S -> NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-44","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t0 t4 t9 t0 t6\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by looking at the grammar rules provided. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a good sign because it simplifies some analyses.\n\nFirst, I notice that the start symbol is S, and according to the rules, S expands into two non-terminals: NT91 NT22. So, the string I'm given must start with these two parts. Let me write that down: S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't0'. So, I need to see what NT91 can produce. From the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT96. Let me check if this makes sense. If NT91 splits into NT76 and NT96, then each of these can have further splits.\n\nNext, I look at NT96. The rules for NT96 are: NT96 \u2192 NT99 NT0 and NT0 also expands into 't0'. But wait, in the rules provided, I don't see NT99, so maybe I misread. Let me check the rules again. Oh, I see NT96 only has 't0' and maybe other rules. Wait, looking back: the rule for NT96 is not explicitly present. Wait no, in the rules, I see NT96 -> 't6' and NT96 -> 't5', as well as NT65 -> 't7' (but that's not our case). Hmm, perhaps I'm misremembering. Looking again, the rules for NT96: from the provided list, I see \"NT96 -> 't7'\", right? Wait, no. Looking again: The rules for NT96 are actually: \"NT95 -> NT13 NT1\", etc., but wait, the specific NT96 rule is \"NT96 -> 't6'\", \"NT96 -> 't5'\". So, maybe NT96 can sometimes produce 't6' directly. Wait, but in our string, the first token is 't0', so maybe that's from NT0, which is different. Hmm, perhaps I need to step back.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this as a parsing problem. Let's try to break down the string step by step, matching it against the grammar.\n\nThe string is \"t0 t4 t9 t0 t6\". Since Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has all productions with exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals at the leaves, perhaps we can build a parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nFirst token is 't0', which would come from either NT0 or some other rule. Let's see, in the grammar, NT0 has two rules: \"NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\" and \"NT0 \u2192 't0'\". So 't0' can be produced directly from NT0. Therefore, 't0' must come from NT0.\n\nSo, in the first step, S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSince the first token is 't0', which is from NT0, perhaps NT22 must be 't0'. Wait, no, because the first part is S's first non-terminal, which is NT91, then comes NT22. So the first part of the string \"t0\" would be from NT91, which is NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT96.\n\nWait, but if S \u2192 NT91 NT22, then the first two symbols after S would be NT91 and NT22. But in our string, the first token is 't0', which is from NT0. But wait, that would require that NT22 somehow expands into 't0', but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in how the string is being generated.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is the first step, so the string must be two parts: whatever NT91 generates followed by whatever NT22 generates. So for example, if NT91 generates 't0' and NT22 generates 't4 t9 t0 t6', or something else. So let me check what 't0' could come from.\n\nFrom the rules, NT0 produces 't0'. So to produce 't0', we have NT0 \u2192 't0'. So perhaps NT91 somehow generates 't0' and NT22 generates the rest of the string. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and the first symbol 't0' comes from NT91, which requires that NT91 can produce a string starting with 't0'. But looking at NT91's rules: NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT96. Then, both NT76 and NT96 can produce further symbols.\n\nLet me map out each step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\n2. So the string is split into two parts: the first part from NT91 and the second part from NT22. Let's explore the first part, NT91.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT76 NT96. Now, we need to match the first part of the string 't0 t4 t9 t0 t6' with this. But wait, if NT91 is producing two parts, then the string would have to start with the first symbol from NT76, then the next from NT96, and so on. So perhaps 't0' is from either NT76 or NT96. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT76: NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. So NT76 splits into two parts. Let's see if 't0' can be from NT69 or NT26.\n\nLooking at NT69: The rules list shows NT69 \u2192 't3' and \"NT69 -> 't1'\". Wait, actually, looking back: in the rules, \"NT69 -> 't3'\", and also \"NT69 -> 't1'\". So NT69 can produce either 't3' or 't1'.\n\nIf NT69 produces 't3', then that would contribute a 't3' token, but our string starts with 't0', so that's not matching. If it produces 't1', that would be a 't1' token, which also doesn't match 't0'. Hmm, so is 't0' coming from somewhere else? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again: Wait, in the provided rules, for NT69, it says \"NT69 -> 't3'\" and \"NT69 -> 't1'\". So actually, NT69 cannot produce 't0'. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first 't0' comes from NT0, which is the end of the NT22 part. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's consider that S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string is generated as (part from NT91)(part from NT22). Let me check the rules for NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT76 NT96. Both NT76 and NT96 are two-symbol rules. So NT91 will generate a string of two parts. Then, NT22 is the second part of the string, which is another two-symbol rule. Let me check NT22.\n\nLooking at NT22's rules: \"NT22 -> NT87 NT98\". So NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, each of which can split further. So the entire string must be built from these rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire string as a combination of the two parts from NT91 and NT22. So each part must fully generate their respective sequences, but in this case, the string seems to have five tokens, which is an odd number, but each production adds two symbols. Wait, no, each production breaks into two, but each non-terminal can produce either a terminal or another non-terminal. Hmm, but here, the string has five symbols: t0, t4, t9, t0, t6. That's five tokens, which is an odd number. However, in a normal context-free grammar in CNF, the number of symbols in the generated string should always be a power of two times something, but perhaps that's not the case since it's leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the initial S leads to NT91 and NT22, each of which generate their own parts. So let's see if the entire string can be split into parts from NT91 and NT22.\n\nThe string is t0, t4, t9, t0, t6. Let me see if this can be divided into two parts, each generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nWait, but NT91 and NT22 start each with two non-terminals. So for example, NT91 would generate a string starting with something and then NT22 would generate another string starting with something else. But looking at the string, the first token is t0,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each one must come from a production that eventually expands into a single terminal. So I need to see which non-terminals in the grammar produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, some of the NT symbols expand into terminals. For example:\n\nNT96 -> t6\nNT12 -> t1\nNT22 -> t8\nNT98 -> t5\nNT79 -> t7\nNT95 -> t1\nNT73 -> t7\nNT9 -> t3\nNT88 (Wait, I don't see a rule for NT88 here. Maybe it's part of another rule?)\n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\nNT38 -> t6\nSo NT38 can become 't6', and NT73 can become 't7' (from NT73 -> t7).\n\nSo maybe the string can be broken down into t6, t1, t9, t1, t0.\n\nHmm. Let's try to match the string step by step.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT91 NT22.\n\nSo S expands to NT91 NT22.\n\nThese NT91 and NT22 must produce sequences that together form the string. So let's see what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nLooking at NT91, it's the only rule I can find that mentions it: NT91 -> t8.\n\nSo NT91 produces t8.\n\nNow, NT22 expands to t8, as per the rule NT22 -> t8.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t6, not t8. That's a problem because S -> NT91 (t8) NT22 (t8), which would give us t8 t8, but the string starts with t6. That suggests that S can't directly generate the given string because the first symbol is t6, but S's expansion starts with t8. So either I'm missing something, or the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let's double-check the productions.\n\nLooking back, NT22 -> t8, as per the rule NTL22 -> NT22? No, the rule is NT22 -> t8. Yes, so NT22 directly produces t8.\n\nBut the string starts with t6. So if S produces two t8's, that would be t8 t8, not starting with t6.\n\nTherefore, the string `t6 t1 t9 t1 t0` cannot be generated from S because S's expansion starts with t8 t8, which doesn't match t6.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a way to derive S into something else through intermediate steps. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The start symbol S must directly expand into the entire string. So if S expands into two non-terminals, each of which must generate their parts of the string, but together they have to match the entire string.\n\nIn this case, since the first symbol is t6, I'm trying to see if there's any way to have a non-terminal that can produce t6 as the first symbol, but looking at the NT rules, none of the NT's except maybe NT6? Wait, but NT6 is not directly a production; let me look.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, let me see which NTs can produce t6. \n\nLooking for NTs that directly expand to 't6' as a terminal.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT92? I don't see NT92.\n\nWait, looking again, some rules:\n\nNT6 -> t5 (twice)\nNT26 -> t7 (twice)\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38 which can produce t7 and t6, so perhaps NT2 can lead to t7 t6.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which is NT91 NT22. So NT91 produces 't8' and NT22 produces 't8', which can't match 't6'.\n\nTherefore, no, the string can't be generated because the first symbol is 't6' but according to the grammar, S starts with 't8 t8'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't6', but the start symbol S -> NT91 NT22, and both NT91 and NT22 expand to 't8'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes it easier to analyze. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the entire string should come from the expansion of S into these two NTs. Since the string provided has six tokens, I need to check if they can be generated by expanding S into NT91 and NT22, each of which will expand further until we get the string.\n\nLet me write down the string: `t2 t0 t5 t3 t9 t8`. Let's split this into parts based on the NTs in the grammar. Looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal (NT) expands into two other non-terminals, except for the ones that directly produce terminal symbols. Wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminal strings which are direct.\n\nBut in this case, for some of these NTs, they directly produce a terminal. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7', so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12, which is recursive. Hmm, let's note that.\n\nWait, so the string is `t2 t0 t5 t3 t9 t8`. Let's count the number of tokens. That's six. Now, the initial production S \u2192 NT91 NT22 will generate two tokens from S. So each step, when expanding, increases the number of symbols by one, except when terminals are produced. Let's see:\n\nEach expansion of an NT breaks it into two parts. If those parts are NSs, they will expand further until they become terminals. So each step, the number of terms increases by one. So starting from S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 2 tokens\n2.

Hmm, that's a sequence of seven tokens, each presumably a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how these terminals can be derived. The start symbol is S, which initially produces NT91 NT22 (S -> NT91 NT22). So, the string must be built from this start.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT91 seems like it's a non-terminal, and it's defined as NT95 NT51 (from NT95 -> t1, NT41 -> t0). Hmm, but NT95 is a terminal because it has a rule -> t1, right? Similarly, NT51 -> NT51 NT68. But NT51 also has a production to NT95 NT56, which in turn are terminals? Let me check: NT95 is defined as 't7', but earlier it's NT95 -> t7, so NT95 is a terminal. Wait, no, looking again: Each rule ending with a letter is a terminal, I think. Let me list the terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals seem to be all the non-NT parts. So 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So the string has seven tokens: t0, t5, t3, t4, t7, t3, t7.\n\nNow, to generate this string, I need to see if there's a way the grammar can produce this sequence starting from S.\n\nLet's break it down. S -> NT91 NT22. So the initial split is into NT91 and NT22. Each of these must generate the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nNT91 is defined as NT95 NT51 (from NT95 -> t7, NT51 -> NT95 NT68?), wait no, the grammar says NT95 -> 't7', NT51 -> NT95 NT68. Wait, no: Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the rules are:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nSo NT95 is a terminal, generating 't7'. Similarly, NT98 -> 't5', NT96 -> 't6' and 't5'? Wait, let me look again.\n\n grammar:\n\nNT95 -> 't7' (so terminal)\nNT98 -> 't5'\nNT56 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT41 -> 't0'\nNT54 -> 't6' (from NT50: Wait, no, let's parse the grammar step by step.\n\nWait, each line is a production. So NT95 has a production -> 't7'. Similarly, NT98 has a production -> 't5'. Similarly, NT56 -> 't7'. But there are other NTs that may not have 't's but have further productions.\n\nWait, but the string has t0, which is a terminal. Let me check all the terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals seem to be any non-NT that have a production -> a single terminal symbol. So for example, NT95 is a terminal because it has a production NT95 -> 't7', same with NT54 -> 't6', wait no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7' (terminal)\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't7'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT41 -> 't0'\n- NT54 -> 't6' ??? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the lines correctly.\n\nWait, the lines are:\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT98 -> 't5'\nNT56 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT41 -> 't0'\nNT54 -> 't6' ??? Wait, no, looking at NT54's rule: NT50 -> NT2 NT69, etc. Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals based on the grammar:\n\n- NT95 -> t7 \u2192 terminal\n- NT98 -> t5 \u2192 terminal\n- NT56 -> t7 \u2192 terminal\n- NT2 -> t5 \u2192 terminal\n- NT41 -> t0 \u2192 terminal\n- NT54 -> t6 \u2192 terminal? Wait, no: Looking at the grammar, NT54 has a production: NT54 -> NT50 NT56, and then other rules.\n\nWait, actually, I'm getting confused. It's better to list all the rules and see which non-terminals have only terminal symbols as their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and given the structure of the grammar, it's not possible to produce it because of the limited possibilities.\n\nWait, the string is t0 t5 t3 t4 t7 t3 t7. So that's seven tokens: t0, t5, t3, t4, t7, t3, t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT95 produces t7, but I don't see any NT that produces t3 or t4 or t6 or t anything else except for some 't's.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I notice that NT51 has a production NT51 -> NT95 NT68, but also NT51 -> NT50 NT56? Wait, no, wait the grammar line is NT51 -> NT51 NT68 and NT50 -> NT2 NT69, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me look for any non-terminal that can produce 't3', 't4', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6' and 't7' (so terminals)\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n- NT79 -> 't3'\n- NT50 -> 't9' (Wait, NT50's rule is NT6 and something? Let me look:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31, and so on. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the NTs and see their possible productions and the terminals they can generate.\n\nLet me make a list of all the non-terminals and their productions, noting which can generate terminals.\n\nStarting from the grammar:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT91 -> NT95 NT51\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nThen:\n\nNT95 -> 't7' (terminal)\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53 ('t7' and NT53)\n\nNT53 -> 't6' (terminal)\n\nNT51 -> NT95 NT68 (so NT51 is a product of NT95 (t7) and NT68.\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41 ('t5' and NT41 (t0))\n\nWait, NT68's production is NT6 NT41, which are 't5' and 't0', so NT68 can contribute t5 t0.\n\nBut in the string, we have a t5. Hmm, perhaps that's possible.\n\nWait, but I see that in the string, after t0, we have t5, which may come from NT2, as NT2 is 't5'.\n\nSo let's try to see how the string can be broken down.\n\nThe string is t0 t5 t3 t4 t7 t3 t7.\n\nStarting from S: S produces NT91 NT22. So the string starts with NT91 and NT22. NT91 is NT95 NT51, so that's t7 followed by NT51.\n\nNT51 can be either NT95 NT68 or NT50 NT56.\n\nIf we take NT51 as NT95 NT68, then it's t7 and then NT68. NT68 is NT6 NT41, which are 't5' and 't0'. So t5 t0. But in the string, the first token is t0, then t5. So that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT51 is NT50 NT56. NT50's production is NT2 NT69, which is 't5' and 't6' (since NT69 is 't6'), but wait, NT2 is 't5' and NT69 is 't6'. So if NT50 is NT2 NT69, that would produce t5 t6.\n\nHmm, but NT56 has a production as well. Looking at NT56: NT56 -> NT55 NT78, and NT55 and NT78 must be further broken down."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-82","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t8 t3 t3 t5 t8 t8 t0\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form has productions where each rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, every production seems to fit that form either by combining two non-terminals or by directly producing a terminal. So that's good.\n\nThe string to check is \"t8 t3 t3 t5 t8 t8 t0\". Splitting that into tokens, it's seven tokens: t8, t3, t3, t5, t8, t8, t0. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal, so the string needs to be derived in a way that each terminal corresponds to a direct production or a combination that eventually reduces to the terminal.\n\nI think the approach here is to construct the parse tree and see if the start symbol S can generate this string. Let's start with the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the initial production: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the start symbol S is broken into two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22. Each of these will need to be expanded further.\n\nNow, expanding NT91 and NT22:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT87 NT98\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, but the initial S's first production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So when we expand S, we'll get NT91 NT22, but each of those needs to be broken down further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by working backwards from the string to see if each terminal can be matched by the rules. That might be easier because the string is a sequence of terminals, so each step should consume one terminal, and we need to make sure each terminal is covered by the grammar.\n\nSo let's list the string again: t8, t3, t3, t5, t8, t8, t0.\n\nStart from the root symbol S, which can produce NT91 NT22. So S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nEach part needs to match the first and second parts of the string. But each of these non-terminals will further produce other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as a derivation. Let's try to see the possible steps.\n\n1. Start: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string is split into two parts: the first part will be derived from NT91, and the second from NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91 and NT22, each has a production:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nSo expanding both leads to:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nSo now, the string is built from four non-terminals: NT87, NT98, NT87, NT98.

{"custom_id":"request-110","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string \"t3 t9 t7 t5 t6 t5 t6 t4\" can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals, which can't expand further. The starting symbol is S, and I need to see if the string can be derived from S through these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is the start symbol. The first rule is S -> NT91 NT22. So the string should start with whatever NT91 and NT22 can produce.\n\nLet's map out the given string: \"t3 t9 t7 t5 t6 t5 t6 t4\". The sequence is t3, t9, t7, t5, t6, t5, t6, t4. Hmm, that's 8 tokens. Since each production rule (except for terminals) gives two tokens, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. 2^3=8, so that fits.\n\nStarting with S, we go to NT91 and NT22. So the first two tokens should come from NT91 and NT22. Looking at the grammar, NT91's production rules: Let's search for NT91. Scanning the rules... Oh wait, the grammar only shows up to NT96. Let me check again. Hmm, I think it's missing some rules. Wait, maybe I need to check all the rules. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT91. Looking back, the given grammar lists NT91 -> 't8', so NT91 directly produces t8. But in the string, after S, we have t3, so wait, that doesn't fit. That's a problem. Because if NT91 is supposed to produce t8, the first token after S should be t8, but in the string it's t3.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Did I misread the grammar? Let me check again. The rules given include:\n\nNT91 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't3'\nAnd other NT rules.\n\nSo S -> NT91 NT22. If NT91 is 't8', then the first token after S should be t8, but in the string it's t3. That suggests either the string is incorrect, or maybe I messed up which rule is which.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong because each production is a leftmost or rightmost expansion. Maybe I should trace the entire string by expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is broken into tokens, so each step combines two non-terminals into a terminal. Let me try building the string starting from S.\n\nS expands into NT91 and NT22. So the string starts as [NT91][NT22]. \n\nNow, each of these non-terminals can expand further. Let's look at NT91: according to the rules provided, NT91 -> 't8' (since that's the rule given). So NT91 becomes 't8'.\n\nNT22: From the grammar, NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So now, the string becomes 't8' [NT87][NT98].\n\nNow, I need to expand NT87 and NT98.\n\nLooking up NT87: it's in the rules as NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nSimilarly, NT98: in the given rules, NT98 -> NT90 NT87.\n\nSo now, the string is 't8' [NT95][NT53][NT90][NT87].\n\nNext, I expand each of these non-terminals.\n\nFirst, NT95: Looking at the rules, NT95 -> NT13 NT1.\n\nNT53: The rule is NT53 -> 't6'.\n\nNT90: NT90 -> NT8 NT79, right? Wait, no: wait NT90's rule is in the given as 't0'. Wait, let me check. Oh, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me parse the grammar carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT51 -> 't3', which is the one that produces t3. NT6 -> 't5', but that's in another part.

The string has eight tokens, all of which are 't' followed by numbers.

Since the grammar has several non-terminals and each production can generate single tokens, I need to see if all these tokens are covered by the grammar.\n\nLet me check each token:\n\n- t4: I look through the rules and see if any non-terminal produces t4 directly.

{"custom_id":"request-128","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's see what I can do.\n\nFirst, I'll recap what I know. Context-free grammars are defined by a set of production rules, and in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The string provided is `t7 t7 t8 t9 t5 t6 t7 t2 t2`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string must start with 't...' for NT91 and 't...' for NT22. Let's parse the string: it starts with 't7 t7...', which aligns with NT91 being 't7' and NT22 being 't8' perhaps. Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nWait, let me list the relevant rules first to see which non-terminals produce 't's.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT91 \u2192 t8\n- NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, which becomes t3 and others? Not sure.\n- NT22 \u2192 t8, as per NT22 \u2192 t22, which is 't2' probably.\nWait, looking at NT22: the rule says NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, and each of those produce specific ts. But maybe it's easier to see directly if any non-terminal directly produces 't...'.\n\nLooking through the rules, non-terminals ending with 't...' seem to have direct rules producing terminals. Let's list them:\n\n- NT95 -> t7\n- NT56 -> t7\n- NT41 -> t0\n- NT54 -> t7 (from NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0, but NT7 is 't1'?) Wait, no. Looking again:\nNT54 has two rules: one is NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0, which is 't1' and 't0' perhaps, and another is NT54 \u2192 t7.\n\nWait, let me check each rule carefully:\n\nNT95: 't7' - so directly produces 't7'.\nNT56: two rules, one is NT56 \u2192 't7', another is NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95. So NT56 can directly produce 't7'.\nNT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38, which seems to produce 't6' and 't2' respectively because NT73 \u2192 't6' and NT38 \u2192 't2'. So NT2 can produce 't6t2'.\nNT41: NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51. NT9 \u2192 't4', NT51 \u2192 't3', so combined as 't4t3'.\nNT54: has a direct rule for 't7' and another for NT50 NT56.\nNT50: NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69. NT2 is 't3', NT69 might produce 't3'? Wait, NT69 \u2192 NT26 and NT96. NT26 \u2192 NT6 and NT26, which each can produce 't6's? I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

So the string starts with NT91 and NT22 generating the initial 't's. Let's see:\n\nNT91 \u2192 t8? According to the rules, looking for NT91. Wait, the rule for NT91 isn't directly given.

Some non-terminals have direct production to terminals:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 t7\n- NT56 \u2192 t7\n- NT54 \u2192 t7 directly, so NT54 \u2192 t7\n- NT25 \u2192 through NT50 \u2192 t7 and others? Hmm.\n\nWait, for NT50: look at the rules:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69. So NT50's production depends on NT2 and NT69. NT2 \u2192 t6 and NT38, but wait, let me see:\n\nWait, NT2's rule is NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38. So NT38 is part of NT2's expansion. From the rules, NT38 \u2192 t6. So NT2 becomes NT73 and NT38, which are t6 and t2. Wait, no, from the data given, looking for NT38: I see in the grammar, NT38 is 't2'? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nFrom the rules, under NT38: the last entry is NT38 \u2192 't2'. Yes, so NT38 producing 't2'.\n\nSo back to NT2: when expanded, it's NT73 and NT38. NT73's rule is NT73 \u2192 't6'. Also, in another rule, NT76 \u2192 NT73 NT26, and NT26 \u2192 't6's. So NT73 produces 't6', and NT38 produces 't2'. So NT2 \u2192 't6t2'.\n\nBut let's tie it back to the string. The initial part is `t7 t7 t8 t9 t5 t6 t7 t2 t2`. So the first two 't7's could come from NT91 \u2192 't8' (but wait, NT91's production isn't directly given. Wait, no: looking back, the user provided grammar rules and only some produce 't7's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by seeing which parts of the string can be generated step by step.\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the first part is NT91 and NT22, which need to produce the 't7's. Let's check:\n\nIs NT91 directly 't7'? No, because in the rules, NT91 is not a terminal; perhaps it's a non-terminal that produces something else. Wait, but looking at the rules, is there any rule where NT91 is on the left-hand side? Yes, the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So NT91 must be expanded into a terminal or a combination of non-terminals that produce the required 't's.\n\nLooking through the rules, is there any rule that starts with NT91? From the given rules, the only other place NT91 appears is on the left side of S's production. So unless there's another rule, NT91 doesn't directly produce a terminal, meaning that S \u2192 NT91 NT22 cannot produce a single 't7'; it would depend on NT91 and NT22's expansions. So perhaps NT91 and NT22 expand into the first two 't7's in the string.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. S is the start symbol. So, the string must be produced by the start symbol. So the first expansion is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So both NT91 and NT22 must contribute to the first parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are 't7 t7'. So perhaps both NT91 and NT22 produce 't7's. Let's check if any of these non-terminals produce 't7's.\n\nLooking at NT91's production: The user's rule lists NT91 as only being on the left side of S's production.

{"custom_id":"request-147","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out whether the given string `t4 t0 t8 t2 t8 t8 t6 t2 t1 t0` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on one side. Each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals have productions to other non-terminals, and others are terminals followed by certain values. For example, NT91 might produce a terminal 't8' or another combination. Wait, actually, looking closely, most of the rules seem to produce terminals followed by specific digits, but I realize that might not be the case because the grammar is written as A \u2192 B C where B and C might themselves be terminals or non-terminals. But in this case, many of the rules have the structure NTxy \u2192 NTuv NTuv, which suggests that each step involves non-terminals. However, some rules have the NT followed by a terminal and a digit, which might indicate that a production can directly result in a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So each production should have only two symbols on the right, but in the given grammar, many rules have more than two symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which is two symbols, so that's okay. Then NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, which is also two symbols, so that works. Similarly, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, two symbols again. But then I see other rules like NT95 -> 't7', which is a terminal. Wait, but that's strange because that would mean that rule produces just a single terminal 't7', so that's consistent. Similarly, some rules like NT54 -> NT50 NT56, which are two non-terminals. So far, it's matching Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nBut looking further, I see some rules that have longer expressions, like NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95, which is two non-terminals. Wait, no, that's just two non-terminals again. So the grammar is set up correctly.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. Each token in the string is a terminal, like 't4', 't0', etc. The goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string is `t4 t0 t8 t2 t8 t8 t6 t2 t1 t0`. I'll treat each 't' followed by a number as a single terminal symbol. So it's like t4, t0, t8, t2, t8, t8, t6, t2, t1, t0.\n\nI think the best way is to try to find a derivation path from S to this string. Let me see the start symbol is S, which produces NT91 and NT22. From the rule S \u2192 NT91 NT22, each of these is a non-terminal that needs to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT91, does it produce anything terminal? Let me check the rules. Looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT91's production isn't listed. Wait, none of the rules have NT91 on the left. That seems odd. Wait, I must have misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT91 is in the production S \u2192 NT91 NT22, but I don't see any rule where NT91 is on the left side. So perhaps NT91 is a terminal, but according to the grammar rules, it's only produced if it's in a production. Since there's no rule for NT91 on the left, it can't be a non-terminal because non-terminals must have production rules. Therefore, NT91 must be a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT91 is used as a non-terminal in S, so if there's no rule for NT91, that would mean S produces NT91, which is not defined, making S unproductive. But that can't be because the string has t4, which must come from somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the rules again more carefully. Here's a list:\n\nLooking at lines 1 to 75, I don't see any rule for NT91 producing a terminal. So NT91 is a non-terminal that must produce something else. But since there's no rule, perhaps the problem is that the grammar is incomplete, but I have to assume it's correct and proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Wait, perhaps S doesn't actually produce NT91 NT22 because those are terminals or can be broken down. Wait, let me reread the initial rules more carefully.\n\nThe first line is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So S directly produces two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22, which must then produce the required terminals for the string.\n\nBut look at the rules for NT91 and NT22. Let me check each rule.\n\nBut wait, I don't see any rule for NT91. All the rules start with NT2, NT4, etc., except for NT91 and NT51, etc. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT54 \u2192 't8'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT12 \u2192 't1'\n- etc.\n\nWait, so NT91 is not in any of these rules as a left-hand side, only as a right-hand side in S's production. That's impossible because that would make S produce NT91 which is not defined. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me check again. Hmm, in the rules provided, I don't see any rule for NT91 being a non-terminal. Therefore, this suggests that NT91 is undefined, which is a problem because S directly produces NT91 NT22. So that would mean the grammar is invalid because you can't produce something from an undefined non-terminal. But the problem states that the grammar is a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, so I must have made a mistake in understanding the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the NT91 production. Looking again, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan all lines:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT91 is used in S but not elsewhere. There's no NT91 \u2192 ... So that must mean NT91 is a terminal. But according to the string, we have 't4', which could be the result of some NT91 expanding to 't4', but I don't see such a rule. Or perhaps NT91 is a non-terminal that can expand into 't4' somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that NT91 is a non-terminal that can expand into multiple things, but in the provided rules, it's only in S's production as NT91, and nowhere else. Therefore, the grammar is incomplete because NT91 isn't defined elsewhere, making S unproductive. So the string can't be generated because the grammar can't produce NT91.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting because the string includes t4, which must come from NT91 somehow. But according to the rules, NT91 is only in S's production, which is undefined. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, let me check if any NT rules produce t4. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NTxy that produce 't4'. All the 't4's would have to come from a NT rule, but in the provided rules, NT68 \u2192 NT6 t2, but that's producing 't2'. Similarly, NT54 produces 't8' and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps some NT can expand directly to a terminal. For example, looking at the list, I see NT7 \u2192 't1', but no NT that produces 't4'. Since 't4' is part of the string, I must see if any NT produces 't4', but I don't see any. Therefore, the only way 't4' would appear is if some NT rule produces 't4', but I don't see that.\n\nWait, no, looking again, none of the rules produce a terminal starting with 't4' except maybe NT91, but since it's only in S's production, which is undefined, that can't be. Therefore, 't4' can't be generated by this grammar. Hence, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check again. Perhaps I missed a rule that produces 't4'. Looking at the rules again, the only terminals are 't4', 't0', 't2', etc., and they are the results of rules that have a '|' ending with a single 't'. So for example, NT26 \u2192 't7', etc.\n\nWait, here's a line: NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to see how the string can be broken down using these rules.\n\nThe string given is: `t8 t9 t3 t2 t7 t4 t5 t3 t0 t7`.\n\nLet me break this down step by step from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at S, the production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So S splits into NT91 and NT22. Each of these non-terminals must generate a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT91 and NT22:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT7? Wait, I need to see the productions for NT91 and NT22. Hmm, from the grammar:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT5? Wait, no, checking the grammar: I see NT91 \u2192 NT7?\n\nWait, let me go through each non-terminal production to see if I can construct the string.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be traced back through the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree would help, but with 10 tokens, it's going to be a bit complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be split in a way that matches the possible productions.\n\nLet me list the string again: t8 t9 t3 t2 t7 t4 t5 t3 t0 t7.\n\nNow, considering that each production step in a context-free grammar requires that each non-terminal can split into smaller non-terminals or terminals. So, the process would be to see if the string can be broken down starting from the top.\n\nAnother approach is to use dynamic programming, where we check at each position what non-terminals could produce it, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll have to look for possible splits step by step.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the entire string must be split into two parts that are the results of NT91 and NT22's productions, respectively.\n\nSo, the string is 10 tokens. Let's see if we can split it into two parts A and B such that A is generated by NT91 and B by NT22.\n\nSimilarly, for each of these non-terminals, we can recursively split them into their components.\n\nLet me try to figure out what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nStarting with NT91: Looking at the productions, NT91 can produce what? Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see an immediate production for NT91. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, I see NT91: wait, actually, I just noticed that some non-terminals have multiple productions, others are terminal. So, looking back at the grammar, I see NT91 \u2192 NT7? Wait, no, the productions are all in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 ..., so I need to look for A \u2192 ... where A is NT91 or NT22.\n\nWait, the grammar provided seems a bit complicated with many rules, but let me check for NT91:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n- NT76 \u2192 't5'\n- NT96 \u2192 't6'\n- NT91 \u2192 NT5?\nWait, let me check: NT91 is in the list as NT91 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT91: Wait, I don't see NT91 as a production; the only thing I see is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so perhaps NT91 is not a terminal. Wait, did I miss any NT91 in the productions? Let me check:\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, NT91 only appears in the start symbol S as S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So NT91 must be further expanded into other non-terminals or terminals. Wait, perhaps I need to go through each non-terminal to see their possible productions.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is that some of the non-terminals in the productions have conflicting or unclear rules. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the grammar's productions are:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8' [Wait, duplication: Wait, is NT6 -> 't5' twice? Or is this a mistake? Let me check again.]\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT6 is present here:\n\nLooking at the productions, I find:\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31 (Actually, the duplication is in the same NT68 production, which is allowed as a chain.)\n\nWait, but also elsewhere:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nIs that correct? Because in a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, each production starts with a single non-terminal and then produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if both NT68 and NT6 have two productions each ending in 't5' and 't8', that's possible.\n\nWait, but in some cases, a non-terminal can have multiple rules ending with different terminals. So, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, proceeding further.\n\nLooking for NT91: Wait, in the grammar, there's a production for NT95 \u2192 't7', but no NT91. So perhaps I got something wrong. Wait, perhaps NT91 is an abbreviation, but I think the start is S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that NT91 is a production that may result in a terminal or non-terminal. Wait, but in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22; so S is pushing off to NT91 and NT22, but unless both NT91 and NT22 produce a terminal, the string would have more than one symbol. But wait, the string is one symbol at a time, so that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that's not right. The production S \u2192 NT91 NT22 would mean that the entire string starts with whatever NT91 can produce and ends with whatever NT22 can produce, as they are each separate. Wait, but NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals, so each needs to produce a string that leads to terminal symbols.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t8, then t9, then t3, etc. So S must produce a string starting with t8, which suggests that either NT91 or NT22 produces t8, or some combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each production as building the string. So S is replaced by NT91 and NT22, and each of them will produce a sequence of terminals. So the entire string is the combination of the sequences produced by NT91 and NT22.\n\nTherefore, I need to find sequences for NT91 and NT22 whose combined symbols match the given string.\n\nSo let's split the given string into two parts: one part generated by NT91 and another by NT22.\n\nLooking at the string: t8 t9 t3 t2 t7 t4 t5 t3 t0 t7\n\nTotal length 10.

{"custom_id":"request-165","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string \"t8 t0 t5 t6 t2 t5 t3 t2 t5 t5 t8\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that can make derivations a bit more manageable.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. Each production rule has either one or two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. For example, S -> NT91 NT22. There are also terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers, like t8, t0, etc. These are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of these terminals. To determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I should try to build a parse tree from the string, ensuring that each step follows one of the grammar's production rules.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S expands into NT91 and NT22. So, the string must start with t91 from NT91 and t22 from NT22. Wait, let me check the productions for NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91, it seems to have a production NT91 -> ... but in the given list, I see NT91 -> ... and other NT91 productions. Let me check:\n\nNT91's productions are:\nNT91 -> NT1 NT65\nNT91 -> NT41 NT6\n... and others like NT91 -> NT12 NT91, which is a recursive production.\n\nWait, but in the initial string, the first part is t8 t0 t5... I think I might have confused the structure. Let me look at the string again: \"t8 t0 t5 t6 t2 t5 t3 t2 t5 t5 t8\".\n\nWait, I think I might be getting mixed up because the grammar uses NT followed by numbers, like NT91, but the string is a series of t followed by numbers. So, to parse the string, I need to see how these t's can be generated by the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT91: NT91 -> NT1 NT65 (among others). But in the string, I start with t8. So, does any production for NT91 or any other non-terminal produce t8? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT87 produces NT95 and NT53, and eventually 't5' and 't6' from terminal productions. So, t5 and t6 are leaves under NT87. But the string starts with t8, which I don't see in NT87's productions.\n\nWait, I think I need to map all the terminal symbols. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nFrom NT7, NT8, NT1, NT5, NT9, NT4, etc., they all have productions that lead to terminals like t2, t5, t6, t8, etc.\n\nWait, let's look for 't8'. Checking the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38, and from NT38, it goes to 't6' directly in one of the productions. Wait, is that correct? Let me check the listed productions for NT38: \nLooking through the provided grammar, I see NT38 -> 't6'.\n\nWait, that's not correct. If NT38 can directly produce 't6', then how does 't8' come into play? Maybe I'm looking at the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. Looking at NT8: NT8 is not directly present, but looking at other rules:\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53, which then go to t5 and t6 respectively. So NT87 can produce t5 and t6, which are t5 and t6. But the string has t8 as the first symbol. So unless there's a rule for some NT that produces t8 directly, I don't see how t8 would come into the string.\n\nWait, looking at NT56, it has multiple productions, including NT56 -> NT55 NT78, but I don't see t8 in NT55 or NT78's terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the productions for each NT to see which ones produce t8.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT1: It has production NT1 -> NT97 NT41, and NT41 -> 't0' or NT9 -> 't4'. Not directly t8.\n- NT2: NT2 can go to NT73 NT38, and from NT38, it's 't6'. So t6 is a terminal.\n- NT4: Not present in the list? Let's check all NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all NTs and their terminal productions to see if any produce t8.\n\nLooking at the entire grammar:\n\nLooking through each non-terminal:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5' or 't8'.\n- NT6 -> 't5' and 't8'.\n- Wait, I see in the grammar: NT6's productions include NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'. So NT6 can produce t5 or t8.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So if I have NT6, it can expand to either t5 or t8.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t8. So perhaps one of the steps involves NT6 -> 't8'.\n\nSo, the string starts with t8. So maybe the root S has to derive to a part that includes NT6.\n\nLooking back, S -> NT91 NT22. Then, NT91 and NT22 need to produce t0 or other terminals.\n\nWait, NT91's productions include NT12 NT91, which is recursive. I also see NT91 -> NT12 NT91, which seems like an infinite loop if not handled properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the parse tree. Let's attempt to build the parse tree step by step, starting with S.\n\nS -> NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the string is split into two parts: left part from NT91 and right part from NT22.\n\nThe entire string is t8 t0 t5 t6 t2 t5 t3 t2 t5 t5 t8.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t8. Let's see if that's produced by NT91 or NT22.\n\nWait, T8 is the first symbol. So the first part of the string is t8, so NT91 must derive to something that starts with t8. But looking at NT91's productions, does any of them directly produce t8? I don't see that. NT91's first production is NT1 NT65, but that goes to non-terminals. So perhaps through recursion or other paths.\n\nWait, but perhaps the recursion will eventually produce t8. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT22 needs to produce t0 as part of the string. Wait, let's look at NT22's productions: NT22 -> NT87 NT98, and from NT98, it ultimately leads to t9 or t0, as in NT98 -> NT90 NT87, and then NT87 -> 't5', etc., I think in the end, NT98 leads to 't9' or 't0' because somewhere in the productions, the terminals come through.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nS produces NT91 and NT22.\n\nThe first symbol is t8. So, in NT91's expansion, somewhere along the way, it must produce t8. But looking at NT91's productions, it doesn't directly produce any t's except perhaps through recursive rules. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT6 appears somewhere that produces t8 as t6.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me take a different approach.\n\nI can try to parse the string step by step using the grammar, constructing a derivation tree.\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t5 t6 t2 t5 t3 t2 t5 t5 t8.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, each step in the derivation can only introduce two symbols at a time, unless a non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I need to break it down into chunks that match the grammar rules.\n\nBut since the string starts with t8, perhaps the first step is to find a non-terminal that can produce t8, or a path that eventually produces t8.\n\nLooking again, NT6 can produce t5 or t8. So if a NT6 is part of the parse tree, then t8 can come from it.\n\nSo, perhaps one part of the string is derived from NT6 and produces t8.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the last symbol in the string, it's t8. So maybe the second part of the string, after splitting, is derived from another NT that ends in t8.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-163","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string \"t1 t5 t6 t1 t5 t6 t3 t8 t6 t9 t5\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the string I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a series of productions where each non-terminal breaks down into two other non-terminals or into terminal symbols 't' followed by a number. Each production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (since Chomsky normal form doesn't allow \u03b5 productions, and all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal).\n\nThe string I'm given is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers: t1 t5 t6 t1 t5 t6 t3 t8 t6 t9 t5. That's 11 symbols long. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use a parsing method, maybe a top-down or bottom-up approach, to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, the grammar is suitable for reduction using the CYK algorithm, but I'm not too familiar with that, so maybe I'll try a simpler approach.\n\nLet me start by looking at the production rules and see if I can build the string step by step. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So S produces two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. \n\nEach of these needs to produce the left and right parts of the string respectively. So I need to check if NT91 can derive t1 t5 t6 ... and NT22 can derive the rest.\n\nLet me first look at the string and see if each non-terminal can produce a part of it. Since NT91 is the first non-terminal, it should generate the first half, and NT22 the second.\n\nLooking at NT91, the productions are:\nNT91 \u2192 NT73 NT76.\n\nWait, but NT73 and NT76 are non-terminals. Let me check their productions:\nNT73 \u2192 NT73 NT78 or NT69 NT76.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a chain that leads to terminal symbols. Let's see if any of these non-terminals can produce a terminal string directly.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see a few that directly produce terminal symbols. For example:\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\nNT38 \u2192 't2'\nNT6 \u2192 't5'\nNT26 \u2192 't7', 't6', 't5' \u2014 wait, actually, NT26 has two productions: NT26 \u2192 NT45 NT50 and NT26 \u2192 't7' or 't6'. Wait no, looking back, each line is a production, so let me list all the productions correctly.\n\nWait, I realize I have to be careful about how the productions are structured. Each line in the grammar is a rule, so for example, the first line after S is NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. Each rule is written as A \u2192 B C, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but in the terminal part, some have 't' followed by a number. So for example, NT95 \u2192 't7' is a terminal production, meaning that NT95 can produce the string 't7'. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo the terminal symbols are things like 't1', 't2', etc., and each line with a terminal on the right is a single production that ends in that terminal.\n\nSo now, going back, the first non-terminal we have to expand is NT91. Let's see what NT91 produces. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT73 NT76.\n\nSo NT91 can only produce that combination. Then, both NT73 and NT76 are non-terminals. So I need to expand those.\n\nLooking at NT73, the productions are:\nNT73 \u2192 NT73 NT78 or NT69 NT76.\n\nHmm, that seems recursive. Similarly, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT68 NT31 or NT26 NT31.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe instead of expanding NT91 first, I should look for a way to derive the string step by step, breaking it down into parts that match the rules.\n\nThe string is t1 t5 t6 t1 t5 t6 t3 t8 t6 t9 t5. Let's break it down into two parts: the first 9 symbols and the last 2. Wait, but according to the start symbol S, it's NT91 and NT22, which produce these two parts respectively. So maybe NT91 should produce the first 9 symbols and NT22 the last 2.\n\nWait, no, the string is 11 symbols. Let me count again: t1 (1), t5 (2), t6 (3), t1 (4), t5 (5), t6 (6), t3 (7), t8 (8), t6 (9), t9 (10), t5 (11). So total 11 symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that NT91 produces the first 9 symbols and NT22 produces the last 2, but that may not necessarily be the case. Alternatively, perhaps they both split into subparts that together make up the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both NT91 and NT22 can produce multiple symbols each, which together form the entire string. Since S \u2192 NT91 NT22, the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT91 produces and what NT22 produces.\n\nSo, first, I need to check if NT91 can produce a string of 9 symbols, and NT22 can produce a string of 2 symbols, such that their concatenation is the given string.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first 9 symbols are t1 t5 t6 t1 t5 t6 t3 t8 t6, and the last two are t9 t5. So perhaps NT91 produces the 9-symbol part, and NT22 produces the last two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both NT91 and NT22 can each produce a part of the string without splitting the string into fixed parts. But since S is NT91 followed by NT22, their outputs are concatenated, so their production rules must collectively match the entire string.\n\nLet me look at the production rules for NT22. From the grammar, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. NT87 and NT98 are non-terminals. So NT22 can only produce sequences starting with NT87 and then NT98.\n\nLooking at NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nWait, but NT87 is used again in NT98. Let's see if these can produce terminals. Let's look into NT87 and NT98:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT53 is a non-terminal. Looking at the rules, I see NT53 \u2192 't6'. So NT53 can produce a terminal 't6'. So NT87's production leads to NT95 NT53, which is NT95 producing something, and NT53 producing 't6'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nNT90 is another non-terminal. NT90 \u2192 't9'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSo NT98 \u2192 't9' NT87.\n\nNow, NT87 is NT95 NT53, where NT95 can produce 't7' (I think NT95 \u2192 't7'). Let me check: Yes, in the list of productions, I see NT95 \u2192 't7'.\n\nSo putting that together, NT87 \u2192 't7' (from NT95) followed by NT53 \u2192 't6' \u2192 so NT87 \u2192 't7 t6'.\n\nTherefore, NT22's production is NT87 NT98 \u2192 ('t7 t6') followed by 't9' (from NT90) and then NT87. Wait, wait: Let's break it down.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nNT87 \u2192 't7 t6' (from NT95 NT53).\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87 \u2192 't9' (from NT90) and then NT87 \u2192 't7 t6'.\n\nSo putting that together, NT98 \u2192 't9 t7 t6'.\n\nTherefore, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98 \u2192 't7 t6' followed by 't9 t7 t6' \u2192 the entire production for NT22 would be 't7 t6 t9 t7 t6'.\n\nBut wait, let's check the rules again. Because NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, which is NT87 followed by NT98. So if NT87 is 't7 t6', and NT98 is 't9 t7 t6', then NT22's entire"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-185","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t5 t0 t4 t3 t4 t3 t0 t0 t2 t7 t1 t9`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form context-free grammars have production rules that produce two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. So every production is like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. I need to parse the string using the grammar's rules, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, and looking at the production rules, S is defined as NT91 NT22. So the initial string should start with whatever NT91 and NT22 can generate. The given string starts with `t5`, so I need to figure out how NT91 and NT22 can lead to `t5`.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT91 \u2192 t8, so NT91 in the first part should be `t8`. But the string starts with `t5`, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, perhaps the NT91 and NT22 can be broken down further.\n\nLooking at NT91, it has a production: NT91 \u2192 t8. So if NT91 is `t8`, but the string starts with `t5`, that's not matching. Maybe the NT91 is part of a chain that eventually produces `t5`. Wait, but the first step is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So if either of these non-terminals can produce a `t5`, maybe that's a way in.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the string recursively, trying to split it into parts that match the grammar. Let me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t5 t0 t4 t3 t4 t3 t0 t0 t2 t7 t1 t9`. Let's see if it can be split into the parts that the top-level production can handle. The top-level production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so we need to split the string into two parts: one generated by NT91 and another by NT22.\n\nLooking at the possible non-terminals, NT91 has a production that includes t8. But the string starts with t5, which isn't t8. So either NT91 might have a rule that eventually leads to t5, or perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, maybe the NT91 is part of a larger rule. Let me check: NT91 only has one production rule, which is NT91 \u2192 t8. So that's a terminal, which would mean any string generated by NT91 is just `t8`. But the first part of the string is `t5`, so that doesn't match. Hmm, that suggests that either the parse is incorrect or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT91 can be part of a longer chain. Wait, looking back, maybe I made a mistake in the NT91 rules. Let me double-check the provided grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT91 \u2192 t8, is that correct? Yes, according to the grammar.\n\nSo if NT91 can only produce t8, but the string starts with t5, which is different, then perhaps NT91 isn't the right starting point. Wait, maybe I should look at NT51 or NT79, which might have more complex rules that can produce longer sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with another part of the grammar. Wait, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the very first step is to get both NT91 and NT22 somewhere. But maybe NT91 and NT22 can themselves contain other non-terminals. Or perhaps the initial step is not about that. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the approach is to use the CYK algorithm. But given that I'm a bit rusty, I'll try to manually parse the string.\n\nLet me list the string as separate elements: positions 0 to 11 (since 12 tokens). The string is [t5, t0, t4, t3, t4, t3, t0, t0, t2, t7, t1, t9].\n\nI think the start symbol is S = NT91 NT22, so S generates two symbols. So the entire string must be split into two parts, each generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part ends at position k, and the second part starts at position k+1. So I need to find a split point where the first part comes from NT91 and the second from NT22.\n\nLet me see what possible lengths each can handle.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT91 \u2192 t8, which is a length 1. NT22 \u2192 t8, also length 1. So if S generates NT91 NT22, the entire string would be two tokens, but our input is 12 tokens. That can't be. So perhaps S is supposed to be NT91, followed by NT22, but each of those can split further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The top-level production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So each of those can be non-terminals that themselves produce sequences.\n\nSo the entire string is a combination of two sequences: one from NT91 and one from NT22. So each of these sequences must consume some tokens in order.\n\nSo, the string must be split into two parts, each part being a sequence generated by NT91 and NT22 respectively.\n\nNow, the problem is that the initial part of the string is t5. Let me look at NT91's productions:\n\nWait, from the rules, NT91 \u2192 t8. So NT91 can only produce a single token, t8. Similarly, NT22 \u2192 t8. So both NT91 and NT22, at their first level, produce t8. But in our case, the first token is t5, which doesn't match either. So that suggests that either the NT91 or NT22 can produce more than just t8, perhaps through deeper rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at them incorrectly. Let's see:\n\nNT91 \u2192 t8. No further options. So NT91 can only produce t8.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nSo maybe NT22 can split into two parts: NT87 and NT98. Let's see what each of those can produce.\n\nNT87 has the rule NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1, and NT53 can produce t6.\n\nWait, looking at NT53:\n\nIn the grammar, NT53 \u2192 t6, right? So NT53 is a terminal. So, NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1, each of which:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT0, which can produce NT51, which again, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at NT51: NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 OR NT51 \u2192 NT9.\n\nWait, no, looking back, I think I got some grammar rules wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are quite a lot, but perhaps let me list the relevant ones.\n\nLooking at NT95:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT0.\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79.\n\nAnd NT90 \u2192 't9', NT79 \u2192 't3'.\n\nWait, no, not NT79. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the provided rules, I see: NT95 \u2192 't1' is no, wait: NT13 \u2192 NT0, and NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, NT95 has rules like NT56 \u2192 't7', etc. Hmm, sorry, I'm getting confused. Let me take it step by step.\n\nLooking at NT87: its production is NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNow, looking at NT95: The rules are a bit extensive. Let me find them:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT0,\nNT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\nOther rules for NT95 may exist, but in the given grammar, NT95 seems to have:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1 and that's it? Or does it have others?\n\nWait, looking back: I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1.\n\nAlso, NT95 can be derived from other rules? Or is that a leaf node.\n\nWait, perhaps NT13 can derive further. NT13 \u2192 NT0, which can have a production NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79. NT90 is 't9', and NT79 can produce 't3'. So NT0 would be 't9 t3'.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1 \u2192 NT0 't1'.\n\nThen, NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, especially with algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But wait, maybe I don't need CYK since I can try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t0 t6 t5 t5 t3 t5 t6 t3 t6 t8 t7 t5`.

Hmm, maybe it's a typo in the initial formatting, but perhaps it's correct. Anyway, let me focus on the approach.\n\nThe string starts with t5, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, any leaf nodes (non-terminals that produce terminals) are the ones that produce the 'tXX' strings. So, 't5' can be produced by:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5' (from NT6 -> 't5')\n- NT6 -> 't8' (but no, that's 't8')\n- NT26 -> 't6'? Wait, looking back, perhaps I need to list all the 't...' productions.\n\nWait, let me list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT26 -> 't7'\nNT90 -> 't9'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT56 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT41 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't6'\nNT76 -> 't5'\nNT96 -> 't6'\nNT50 -> 't9'\nNT97 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT87 -> 't8' ? Wait, no, NT87 is NT95 NT53, which are further non-terminals. Wait, no: looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar only produces terminals when a non-terminal is defined to do so. So, let me compile all terminals:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't7'\n- NT90 -> 't9'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't7'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT41 -> 't0'\n- NT25 -> 't6'\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n- NT96 -> 't6'\n- NT50 -> 't9'\n- NT97 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n\nWait, that's a list. So, for example, NT12 can produce 't1'.\n\nNow, the string starts with t5. So the first part must come from one of the rules that produce 't5'. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\nSo, the first symbol t5 could come from any of these: NT6, NT8, or NT2.\n\nBut let's see what's possible in the grammar structure. The start symbol is S -> NT91 NT22. Then NT91 and NT22 each produce two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string must be built by expanding S into NT91 NT22, and then those further expanding until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t5 t0 t6 t5 t5 t3 t5 t6 t3 t6 t8 t7 t5.\n\nSince it's 13 tokens, let's see how that could be generated.\n\nStarting from S: NT91 NT22.\n\nLet me try to see possible expansions. \n\nFirst, perhaps NT91 can produce NT56 NT90, and NT22 can produce NT87 NT98.\n\nNT91 NT22 -> NT91 NT22, which then expands to (NT56 NT90)(NT87 NT98).\n\nWait, no, each non-terminal expands into their own productions.

So, NT91 and NT22 each expand into two non-terminals.\n\nLet me break down:\n\nNT91 -> NT56 NT90\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nSo, the initial expansion would result in NT56 NT90 NT87 NT98.\n\nThen, each of these can further expand.\n\nLet me write the expansion step by step.\n\nCurrent string (after S expansion): [NT56, NT90, NT87, NT98]\n\nNow, each of these can expand further:\n\nNT56: It has two rules: NT55 NT78 or NT56 NT95.\n\nBut since NT56 can produce itself if needed, but perhaps in this case,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. Let me start by looking at the grammar rules and see how they can derive the string.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar has a bunch of non-terminals like S, NT22, NT76, etc., and terminals that are 't' followed by digits, plus two NT26 entries that go to t6. \n\nThe string has 13 tokens, all being terminals except for 'nt22' which is a non-terminal I think. Wait, in the string given, all the tokens are 't-something', so they are terminals. So I don't have to worry about non-terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol S. The first step is to see what S produces. The production for S is NT91 NT22. So the entire string must derive from S, which means the string should split into two parts: one derived from NT91 and another from NT22.\n\nThe string is 13 tokens long, so if NT91 produces the first 6 tokens and NT22 produces the last 7, that makes sense because 6+7=13. Or maybe different splits, but I'll check that first.\n\nLet me write the string again: t8, t1, t0, t7, t4, t2, t7, t4, t2, t1, t0, t3, t5.\n\nSo NT91 should produce the first 6 tokens: t8 t1 t0 t7 t4 t2, and NT22 should produce the remaining 7: t7 t4 t2 t1 t0 t3 t5.\n\nNow, let's check NT91 and NT22 separately.\n\nStarting with NT22. Looking at the grammar, NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So from NT22, I derive to NT87 and NT98.\n\nLooking at NT87: it can produce NT95 NT53, according to the grammar. So NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nNT53 is a terminal, so that's done. Now looking at NT95: it has two productions. One is NT13 NT1, and another is NT51 NT76.\n\nWait, the initial production for NT95 is 't1', so I think NT95 produces 't7' according to the rules. Let me check: in the grammar, NT95 -> 't7', so that's a terminal. Wait, no, let me see: in the grammar, I see NT95 -> 't7'. So that's a terminal. So if NT95 is 't7', then the first part after NT95 would just be 't7'.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me see the production for NT95: it's written as NT95 -> 't7'. So that means NT95 produces the string 't7' as a terminal. Similarly, NT76 is 't3' according to the grammar, so when I have NT76, it's just 't3'.\n\nSo stepping through NT95: NT95 -> 't7'. Then, looking back, NT87 -> NT95 NT53. So NT87 would produce 't7' followed by whatever NT53 produces. Wait, NT53 is a terminal according to the grammar: NT53 -> 't5', because in the rules under NT53 I see it's 't5'.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: looking through the grammar, I see NT53 -> 't6' in the production? Or is NT53 a non-terminal with a production? Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find NT53 -> 't6' in the grammar. So NT53 is 't6'. So, back to NT87: NT87 -> NT95 NT53, which is 't7' followed by 't6', so 't7 t6'.\n\nNow, NT98 comes from NT22's production. NT98's production is NT90 NT87.\n\nNT90 -> 't0' according to the rules. NT87 we just determined is 't7 t6'. So NT98 becomes 't0' followed by NT87, which is 't0 t7 t6'.\n\nSo putting this together, NT22 (which is S's second half) is NT87 NT98, which is 't7 t6' followed by 't0 t7 t6'. So the entire string from NT22 would be t7 t6 t0 t7 t6.\n\nWait, but the string part for NT22 is t7 t4 t2 t1 t0 t3 t5.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe my initial split is wrong. Maybe NT91 and NT22 aren't split at 6 and 7. Let me try a different split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parsing NT22. Let's retrace:\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53, which is 't7 t6'.\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87.\n\nNT90 is 't0', and NT87 is 't7 t6', so NT98 is 't0 t7 t6'.\n\nSo NT22 produces 't7 t6 t0 t7 t6'. But the string part after S is NT22, which is supposed to be 7 tokens: t7 t4 t2 t1 t0 t3 t5.\n\nThis doesn't match, so maybe I need to change the split. Alternatively, perhaps there's another path for NT87 or NT98.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in NT87's production. Let me look again at NT87. The grammar says NT87 can produce NT95 NT53 or other options? Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT87 -> NT95 NT53. So yeah, only that path. So NT87 is 't7 t6'.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider other possibilities. Let me double-check if I missed any productions.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, for example, NT53: does it have any other productions? It looks like NT53 -> 't6' is the only one. So yes, 't6'.\n\nHmm. So the derivation for NT22 is 't7 t6 t0 t7 t6', which is 5 tokens, but the string is 7 tokens (t7 t4 t2 t1 t0 t3 t5). So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the initial split is wrong. Maybe S is split into NT91 and NT22, and the string is split in a different way.\n\nLet me count the tokens in the string for NT91 and NT22.\n\nIf the string is supposed to be split as NT91 producing a subset and NT22 producing the other subset, I need to see which subset makes sense.\n\nSuppose NT91 produces the first 7 tokens and NT22 the next 6.\n\nBut the total is 13, so 7+6=13. Let's see: NT91 is produced by S, which is NT91 NT22.\n\nWait, no, S is NT91 NT22. So the entire string is the combination of NT91's output and NT22's output.\n\nSo let's see what the string represents. The string is 13 tokens, which could be any split between NT91 and NT22, but their individual productions may have different lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me see what each non-terminal can produce in terms of the number of tokens and structure.\n\nLooking at NT91: let's see what it can produce. Looking at its production, NT91 can go to NT95 NT96. So NT91 -> NT95 NT96.\n\nNT95 is a terminal 't7'. NT96 has several productions:\n\nNT96 -> NT7 -> 't1' (from NT7 -> 't1')\n\nOR\n\nNT96 -> NT91 NT22 again, but that seems recursive and could lead to long derivations.\n\nWait, that might be a problem. Let me check NT96's productions. I see NT96 has:\n\nNT96 -> NT7 -> 't1'\n\nand\n\nNT96 -> NT91 NT22.\n\nWait, so NT96 can either produce 't1' or 't1 NT91 NT22' recursively.\n\nWait, but that would lead to infinite recursion if NT96 can produce itself. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the starts which produce terminal strings directly. \n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the first rule: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So S generates two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22. I should recursively break these down. \n\nNT91 \u2192 NT73 NT96. Hmm, so breaking down NT73 and NT96. Let me see if these non-terminals have their own rules. \n\nNT73 has two rules: \u2192 NT69 NT76 and \u2192 NT76. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT76 is defined as NT69 NT26, and NT73 is defined as NT69 NT76. So NT73 expands to NT69 NT76, which then is NT69 NT26. Let me follow that.\n\nNT69 is a production. Let me see: NT69 \u2192 NT50 NT66? Wait, no, checking the grammar, NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT6 NT41. Ah, right, NT69 is NT6 NT41. NT6 is a terminal that becomes 't5', and NT41 is NT9 NT51. NT9 isn't defined, but looking back, NT9 is a rule: wait, wait. Wait, in the grammar, do I see NT9? Let me check. Hmm, looking through all the grammar rules, I don't see NT9 as a non-terminal on the left side. Instead, I see NT56, NT25, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT96: wait, NT96 is defined as NT96 \u2192 NT56 NT95. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT96 is not directly present. Let me see: looking through the rules, I see NT66 is not present, but NT69 is NT6 NT41. So NT73 expands to NT69 NT76, and NT69 is NT6 NT41, NT76 is NT69 NT26. Then, that becomes (NT6 NT41) (NT69 NT26). Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently, using the string and the rules to see if I can derive it step by step.\n\nThe string is: t1 t9 t2 t6 t1 t2 t1 t5 t0 t9 t3 t0 t5 t9.\n\nI need to see if S can derive this string. Let's think of how S produces two parts: NT91 and NT22. So the entire string would be the concatenation of the expansions of NT91 and NT22. Let's split the string into two parts. The first part is t1 t9 t2 t6 t1 t2 t1 t5 t0 t9 t3 t0 t5 t9. Wait, wait, no, since S is two non-terminals, it's likely that NT91 produces the first part and NT22 the second part. But I'm not sure it's even split that way. Let me check how the non-terminals expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into segments that match the expansions of NT91 and NT22. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\nNT91 \u2192 NT73 NT96\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nSo S expands into NT91 NT22, which becomes (NT73 NT96) (NT87 NT98). Then each of those non-terminals needs to be expanded.\n\nLet me try to map the string. The string is 14 tokens. Let's see if it's possible for NT91 to generate a certain part and NT22 the other.\n\nFirst, let me consider NT91 \u2192 NT73 NT96. So NT73 and NT96 need to generate parts of the string.\n\nNT73 has two rules: \u2192 NT69 NT76 and \u2192 NT76. So let's take each possibility.\n\nCase 1: NT73 \u2192 NT69 NT76\nThen NT69 \u2192 NT6 NT41, and NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26.\n\nSo expanding NT73: NT69 NT76 \u2192 (NT6 NT41) (NT76)\nBut NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26 \u2192 (NT6 NT41) (NT26)\nSo overall, NT73 \u2192 (NT6 NT41) (NT69 NT26)\n\nNow, NT69 \u2192 NT6 NT41, NT26 \u2192 NT79.\n\nSo NT73 expands into (NT6 NT41) (NT69 NT26) which further expands into NT6 NT41 NT69 NT26, which is (t5), (t9, because NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51, wait wait no, NT41 is? Let me check NT41's rule. Hmm, looking through the grammar, I see NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51, but wait, NT9 in the grammar doesn't appear as a non-terminal on the left of a rule. Wait, NT9's rule? Let me check the entire grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at all the rules, I don't see NT9 in the right-hand side of any production. So NT9 is a terminal? Because in the grammar, when a symbol is only on the left of a production, unless it's on the right, it's a terminal. Wait, no, the opposite. Non-terminals are only on the left of productions. Terminals are on the right. So if a symbol is only on the right and not on the left, it's a terminal.\n\nIn this case, looking through all the non-terminals, symbols like 't1', 't2', etc., are terminals because they only appear on the right of the productions. So NT41's expansion is \u2192 NT9 NT51. But if NT9 is a non-terminal, then why is it not present in the production list as a non-terminal? Or wait, is NT9 a non-terminal? I think I need to double-check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT9 is on the left. So if it's only on the right, then it's a terminal. Similarly, any symbol that's only on the right side is a terminal.\n\nSo NT9 is likely a terminal, but that can't be since the string has t9. Wait, but t9 is in the string, which is one of the terminals. Hmm, perhaps I need to make sense of it.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Only non-terminals appear on the left of productions, and terminals on the right. So any symbol that's only on the right and never on the left is a terminal. So in this grammar, NT9 isn't on the left, so it's a terminal. So when NT41 is expanded to NT9 NT51, both are terminals because NT9 is a terminal. So that's important.\n\nLet me summarize the terminals: all the 't's followed by numbers are terminals because they don't appear on the left of any production. So, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9 are terminals. All other symbols in the rules are non-terminals.\n\nSo NT9 is a terminal because it doesn't have a production. Correct. Similarly, other non-terminals are: NT73, NT76, etc.\n\nSo back to NT73: its expansion is NT69 NT76. Since NT73 is a non-terminal, it has two non-terminals, and we need to expand further until we hit terminals.\n\nSo for NT73 \u2192 NT69 NT76.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT6 NT41, which are terminals: t6 (from NT6 \u2192 't6') and t9 (since NT9 is terminal, which maps to t9? Wait, looking through the grammar, NT9 is directly a terminal. But in the string, there's a t9.\n\nWait, wait, the grammar has: NT8 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't6', NT6 \u2192 't5', NT26 \u2192 't9', etc. So:\n\nLooking at the NT8 productions: NT8 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't6', NT6 \u2192 't5', etc. Wait, in the grammar given, the right-hand sides include \"t1\", \"t2\", etc., so those are terminal replacements.\n\nSo NT6 is a non-terminal that's rewritten as 't5'. So when NT6 appears, it's replaced by t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 appears in NT69 and other places.\n\nBut for NT73 \u2192 NT69 NT76,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, every rule seems to either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, except some have more than one non-terminal on the right side? Let me check.\n\nLooking closer, for example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So that's fine, it's two non-terminals. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, that's also two non-terminals. Hmm, but wait, some of these non-terminals might produce further non-terminals or terminals. I need to make sure I don't miss any terminals.\n\nWait, the given string consists entirely of terminals: t2, t8, etc. So the derivation must eventually produce these terminals without any non-terminals left.\n\nMy plan is to work backwards from the string and see if I can factor it into the productions given. Each step should split the string into pairs that match the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list all the productions with their terminals for clarity.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals.

Wait:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT96: \u2192 NT96 NT5, so it's a recursive rule. But I don't see any terminal production from NT96. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, checking again:\n\nThe rules include:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT96 NT5 \u2013 which is recursive. Maybe I need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait, another rule: NT78 \u2192 NT76 NT26, and both of those produce terminals. NT76 is t5 and NT26 is either t5 or t6 or t9. So maybe NT78 can produce t5 t5, t5 t6, t5 t9, or t6 t5, etc.\n\nBut let's focus on the string: `t2 t8 t6 t8 t0 t7 t5 t9 t2 t0 t2 t3 t2 t0`.\n\nWait, the string starts with t2, which corresponds to NT2, because NT2 \u2192 t5. But wait, NT2 \u2192 t5, but the string starts with t2, which is not t5. So how does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the grammar's terminals properly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals have multiple productions leading to different combinations. For example, NT0 \u2192 't0' and also NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79. Similarly, NT95 \u2192 t1, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at all the productions where the non-terminal can directly produce a terminal.\n\nFrom the rules provided, the following non-terminals have direct terminal productions:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 t8\n- NT22 \u2192 t8\n- NT87 \u2192 t5\n- NT98 \u2192 t9\n- NT76 \u2192 t5\n- NT69 \u2192 t1\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT41 \u2192 t0\n- NT56 \u2192 t7\n- NT95 \u2192 t1\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT50 \u2192 t9\n- NT1 \u2192 t1\n- NT96 \u2192 t6\n- NT91 is used in NT91, which outputs t8. Hmm, perhaps each production rule is to be parsed for direct terminals.\n\nWait, actually, each production is in the form of non-terminals, so to find the terminals, I need to see which rules directly output terminals. It seems that only some rules have direct terminals, others produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT96 \u2192 t7 or t5? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT98 \u2192 t9, so NT98 is a direct terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t2 t8 t6 t8 t0 t7 t5 t9 t2 t0 t2 t3 t2 t0.\n\nI'll try to build a parse tree from the string.\n\nLet me start with the entire string. The first part should match the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo S = NT91 NT22.\n\nEach of those needs to be matched by the string.\n\nNT91 \u2192 t8, so the first element of the string must be t8. But the string starts with t2. That's a problem. Because S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and NT91 produces t8, which doesn't match t2. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I got the productions wrong. Let me double-check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nThen, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nSimilarly, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut none of these seem to output 't2' directly except for NT2, which is one step further.\n\nWait, perhaps the derivation is longer. Let me think recursively.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT91 NT22, then NT91 and NT22 must each produce some sequence of terminals. But if NT91 \u2192 t8 and NT22 \u2192 t8, then the string would start with t8 t8, but our string starts with t2 t8, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol is S, but in the string, the first symbol is t2, which suggests that NT91 \u2192 something that starts with t2. But looking back, NT91 \u2192 t8, so that's not possible. So maybe S isn't producing NT91 and NT22 in that order, or perhaps there's a longer production.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for a way that NT91 can produce a sequence starting with t2. But according to the grammar, NT91 \u2192 t8. So unless NT91 can produce t2 through some other rule, it can't. So maybe S \u2192 NT91 NT22 isn't the starting point, but perhaps a different production?\n\nWait, no, according to the grammar, S only has that one production. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Hmm, Chomsky normal form means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two or zero on the right. But wait, in this case, all the productions seem to have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for cases like `S -> NT91 NT22` where NT91 and NT22 might be terminals. Wait, no, looking at the rules, the right-hand sides (RHS) are combinations of NTE and terminal strings. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something. Oh wait, actually in the productions, some NTEs are expanded into terminal strings. For example, I see NT95 -> 't7', which means that NT95 is a terminal. So actually, the grammar mixes non-terminals and terminals on the RHS, which is typical in some CFGs. But since it's in Chomsky normal form, perhaps the non-terminals only expand into other non-terminals except when it's a terminal production.\n\nSo, the string provided is a sequence of terminals: `t7 t9 t3 t7 t7 t9 t3 t8 t8 t8 t8 t7 t0 t7 t3`. I need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll try to see what S can produce. S is broken down into NT91 and NT22 via S->NT91 NT22. So, let's look into NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91, its production is NT78 NT9. NT78 can be broken down into NT55 NT78? Wait, no. Wait, NT91 -> NT78 NT9. Wait, let me check the given rules:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT91 -> NT78 NT9 \u2192 but looking at the rules, does NT91 have any production?

S can produce NT91 NT22, so each of these can be expanded further.\n\nFirst, looking at NT91: NT91 -> NT78 NT9. Let's see if NT9 is a terminal. Wait, in the rules, NT9 is not present directly, but looking through the rules I see NT9 does not have a production, but is this an error? Wait, no, perhaps I didn't list all rules, but looking at the rules again, I don't see NT9 as a non-terminal, only NT91 and others. Hmm, maybe I missed that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT91 is a non-terminal, but no NT9. But in rule NT95 -> 't7', which is a terminal, but NT9 isn't present. That's strange because to expand NT91, I need to know what produces NT9. But I don't see NT9 as a non-terminal. That might mean that NT9 is a terminal, but in that case, the production of NT91 would be NT78 't9', because NT91 -> NT78 NT9, and NT9 is a terminal, so the production would be NT78 followed by 't9'.\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, where is NT9 appearing? Let's scan through each rule to see if NT9 is a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is just 't9' or has 't9' as part of a terminal string.\n\nI see NT22 -> 't8', which is a terminal. Also, NT6 -> 't5' and 't8', and NT26 -> 't7', etc.\n\nBut looking for NT9: It seems that NT9 is not a non-terminal because none of the rules have NT9 on the LHS except for S which is split into NT91 and NT22. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe some non-terminals expand into strings containing terminals, not just single terminals. So, for example, if NT91 -> NT78 NT9, and NT9 is a terminal, then that production would expand to NT78 followed by 't9', provided that NT9 is a terminal. But if NT9 is a non-terminal, we need to know its production.\n\nWait, that can't be because looking through all the rules, I don't see any production for NT9. So perhaps NT9 is actually a terminal. Because all the right-hand sides either expand into non-terminals or into terminal strings. So, if NT9 is not present on the left-hand sides of any production, except where it's in the RHS. Wait, but in the given rules, NT95 is a terminal, correct.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the rules again.\n\nThe rule for NT91 is: NT91 -> NT78 NT9. Now, if NT9 is not a non-terminal, meaning that NT9 is a terminal, then the RHS would be \"t9\", because looking at the rules, no other production includes 't9' except for NT50 -> 't9'. Wait, no. Looking through the RHS, I see NT78 -> 't8' and NT69 -> 't3', etc.\n\nWait no, maybe I should check if NT9 is a terminal or not. If a non-terminal has a production where it's on the LHS, but the RHS doesn't have any non-terminals (i.e., it's a terminal string), then it's considered terminals. Otherwise, it's a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through all the RHS of the given rules:\n\nNT91 -> NT78 NT9: has non-terminals, so NT9 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, that can't be, because if that's the case, it's necessary to have a production for NT9, but looking through all the rules, there's no production for NT9, so perhaps it's a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-247","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier. The string to check is \"t5 t6 t4 t1 t3 t5 t8 t4 t7 t1 t7 t9 t1 t5 t6\".\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) defines each production as either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is useful for building parsers, but for this problem, maybe I can look for a systematic way to derive the string.\n\nThe grammar provided consists of a bunch of non-terminals (like S, NT22, NT23, etc.) and terminals. Each production either splits a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or directly produces a terminal. The terminals in the string are t digits, like t5, t6, etc.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. One approach is to reverse the process: start from the entire string and see if the non-terminals expand down to the start symbol S through each step.\n\nIn reversing, each step would involve taking two consecutive terminals that form a production from a non-terminal. For example, if there's a production A \u2192 BC, and in the string we have B followed by C (or their expansions), then that pair can be collapsed into A.\n\nGiven the length of the string, it's 15 tokens. Starting from the left, I can try to find possible pairs that match any production.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider that in CNF, each step of the derivation increases the length of the string by 1, because each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, and this repeats until terminals are reached. However, in this case, the grammar seems to have some productions that produce terminals directly, so the number of steps can vary.\n\nWait, actually, starting from S, each application of a rule increases the number of symbols. So to see if the string can be generated, the number of steps should correspond to the number of symbols minus 1, since each rule application adds one more non-terminal. But in this case, the string has 15 symbols, so the number of rule applications would be 14. But I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to represent the string in terms of the grammar rules.

Some non-terminals produce terminals, others split into further non-terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT96 produces t7, NT38 produces t2, NT6 produces t5 and sometimes t8, NT26 produces t7 and in some cases t5, t9, etc.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t6 t4 t1 t3 t5 t8 t4 t7 t1 t7 t9 t1 t5 t6.\n\nWait, the last production seems to have a trailing 't6'. Let me see, how long is the string? The string has 15 t's. Let me count: 1 t5, 2 t6, 3 t4, 4 t1, 5 t3, 6 t5, 7 t8, 8 t4, 9 t7, 10 t1, 11 t7, 12 t9, 13 t1, 14 t5, 15 t6. Yeah, 15 tokens.\n\nIn the Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals until terminals are produced. So the parsing tree would have each non-terminal as a parent to two others until leaves are terminals.\n\nBut since this is a string, perhaps we can model it as a reduction problem. Let's think about starting from the start symbol S and expanding it step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nSo the initial step is S, which becomes NT91 and NT22. But wait, in CNF, each production is a single split, so applying S's production appends NT22 after NT91.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think bottom-up. Starting from the string, we can try to find the last two tokens and see if they fit a production. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the full string: [t5, t6, t4, t1, t3, t5, t8, t4, t7, t1, t7, t9, t1, t5, t6]\n\nThe last symbol is t6. Let me see which non-terminals produce t6.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't8' (doesn't fit)\n- NT78 \u2192 't8'\n- NT53 \u2192 't6' (so NT53 \u2192 't6'?)\nWait, no, looking again, the production NT53 \u2192 't6'. So yes, NT53 produces 't6'.\n\nBut in the string, the last token is t6. So the last part of the string could be NT53 \u2192 t6.\n\nBut before that, the second last token is t5. So the part before that is [t5, t5, ... t6]. Wait, that's not right because I need to split the string into pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the end of the string and see what rule could produce the last token, then the second last, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can start from S and see how to expand step by step.

{"custom_id":"request-269","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string I need to check against it. Let's see what I can do. First, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That means all non-terminals expand into two other non-terminals until they hit terminals.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of NT productions and some terminal rules. The string to check is `t9 t6 t4 t4 t2 t7 t9 t0 t6 t3 t0 t4 t4 t2 t9 t1`. It's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar. It seems quite long, but maybe I can find a pattern or see where the string can be broken down. I should probably start by identifying the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is NT91 NT22. So, S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nEach of these, NT91 and NT22, must expand into sequences that produce the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others until we get all terminals.\n\nLet me think about the string. It starts with t9, t6, t4, t4, etc. Let's see if any of the non-terminals produce t9 or other t's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have t's as their productions. For example, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, and NT90 \u2192 NT90 NT79. One of these might produce t9. Wait, NT91 in the start has a production NT91 \u2192 NT13 NT1, and NT13 \u2192 NT0 NT something. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by parsing the string from the start symbol. Since S \u2192 NT91 NT22, the string should be the combination of NT91's expansion and NT22's expansion.\n\nSo, the string is the concatenation of two parts: the expansion of NT91 and the expansion of NT22. Let's see, the string has 16 terminals. So each part should expand into a number of terminals that add up to 16, but given that each step in the grammar could split into more, perhaps branching.\n\nWait, let me think about how many steps the parsing would take. Since each non-terminal production splits into two, the length of the string can be determined by the initial symbol's expansion. But maybe it's easier to check each non-terminal against the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if I can build up the string by substituting the non-terminals.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string should be [NT91_expansion] [NT22_expansion]. Let's denote the string as part1 followed by part2.\n\nLooking at the string, part1 seems to be t9 followed by some t's, and part2 starts with t6, etc. Wait, but NT91 and NT22 each should produce a part. Let me check what terminals are connected to NT91 and NT22.\n\nChecking the grammar, NT91 has a production NT91 \u2192 NT13 NT1. NT13 \u2192 NT0 NT76, and NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. NT69 \u2192 NT6 NT9, and wait, I think I need to map each non-terminal's terminal expansions.\n\nLet me make a list of the non-terminals and their possible terminal outputs. Maybe that would help.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\nNT90 \u2192 NT90 NT79\nNT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\nNT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31\nNT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50\nNT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\nNT45 \u2192 NT55 NT78\nNT55 \u2192 NT55 NT78\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to see if there's a path where the string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to factor the string into possible expansions of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string again: t9 t6 t4 t4 t2 t7 t9 t0 t6 t3 t0 t4 t4 t2 t9 t1.\n\nI can try to group it into substrings that might correspond to the productions of the non-terminals NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet's see, NT91 \u2192 NT13 NT1. NT13 \u2192 NT0 NT76. NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. NT69 \u2192 NT6 NT9. NT6 \u2192 NT6 \u2192 but wait, NT6 has rules: NT6 \u2192 't5' or NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT6.\n\nWait, that's confusing. NT6 can be 't5' directly, or split into two NT6's. So if NT6 is used, it could produce a single 't5' or a longer sequence.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 is the other part. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. Wait, that's the same as NT91's production? So NT95 is NT13 NT1, which is the same as NT91. So NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, which would expand into (NT13 NT1) (NT53). What's NT53? Checking the grammar, NT53 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo back to NT87: NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53 \u2192 (NT13 NT1) (t6). But then NT13 is NT0 NT76, so:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT13 NT1 \u2192 NT0 NT76 NT1 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 which is NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79. NT90 is NT90 NT79, and so on.\n\nThis seems too deep. Maybe instead, I can look for the start symbol and see if the string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can't be generated because certain terminals don't match the productions. For example, let's look for the first few terminals: t9 t6. Do any non-terminals produce 't9' followed by 't6'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT96 has productions: NT96 \u2192 't7', 't6', etc. Wait, NT96 \u2192 't6' and 't7' and also has other productions? No, from the list, NT96 \u2192 't6' and 't7' as terminal rules. But wait, also NT96 has non-terminal productions? Let me check.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT96 \u2192 't7' (direct)\nNT96 \u2192 't6' (direct)\nNT96 \u2192 NT51 NT78 (from NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT96, but maybe that's not relevant)\nWait, perhaps NT96 only has the terminal productions. So, can NT96 produce a single 't9'? No, because from the grammar, NT9's productions only go to NT22, which leads to other parts.\n\nSo t9 can't come directly from a terminal; it's part of a non-terminal's expansion. So t9 must be the result of some non-terminal expanding into.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, for example, NT96 has 't6' and 't7', but no t9. Wait, what about NT90? NT90 \u2192 NT90 NT79 and NT90 \u2192 NT90 NT87. Hmm, I'm not seeing a t9 coming from any of these.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t9, which would have to come from some non-terminal. Looking through the productions, perhaps NT98 has a production: NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. NT90 and NT87 also don't seem to produce t9. Let me check NT6: NT6 can be 't5' or 't6'... No, wait, NT6 has 't5' and 't8'?\n\nWait, let's go step by step. The production rules:\n\nNT6 has two rules: NT6 \u2192 't5' and NT6 \u2192 't8'. Oh, right, so NT6 can directly produce 't5' or 't8'. Looking at the string, the second term is t6, which is different from t5 and t8, so that wouldn't work unless t6 comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t9. So, the first part of the string should come from a non-terminal that starts with t9. Let me see which non-terminals have 't9' as a possible expansion.\n\nLooking through the grammar, any non-terminal's expansion has 't9'? Let's check:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT13 NT1.

{"custom_id":"request-262","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: `t3 t5 t7 t5 t0 t8 t0 t5 t6 t4 t3 t6 t1 t6 t7 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it starts with S and has multiple non-terminals that eventually produce terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number). So the overall structure is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, then each NT... is a production that either breaks down into more non-terminals or directly into terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals. To see if the grammar can generate this string, I can approach it by trying to work backwards from the string to the start symbol S, using the productions.\n\nLet me list the string for clarity: [t3, t5, t7, t5, t0, t8, t0, t5, t6, t4, t3, t6, t1, t6, t7, t6].\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production on the left-hand side generates exactly two terminals or non-terminals. So, starting from the start symbol S, which is at the root, I need to see if I can replace S with NT91 and NT22, and then each of those can be replaced by either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string into chunks that match possible productions. Since each production is from a non-terminal to two other symbols, I can split the string into pairs or single terminals and see if they correspond to any productions.\n\nFirst, looking at the entire string, it's 16 terminals. Since each production is a binary split, the number of steps (derivations) would correspond to the number of non-terminals, but the length of the string is 16. Hmm, since each production of a non-terminal is two symbols, the number of symbols in the string should match the structure built by these binary splits.\n\nWait, actually, let's think about it. The start symbol S produces NT91 NT22, which is two non-terminals. Each of those can then produce other non-terminals or terminals. So the number of symbols in the derived string depends on how many non-terminals are expanded into terminals or not.\n\nI think a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar's productions, maybe using a method like recursive descent or a CYK parser. But given that this is a thought process, I'll try to simulate the parsing step by step.\n\nFirst, the string has 16 terminals. Let me see if I can identify which non-terminals generate each part.\n\nLooking at the NT symbols, for example, NT91 \u2192 t8. So NT91 produces 't8'. Similarly, NT22 \u2192 t8.\n\nWait, let me list out some of the NT productions that result in terminals to see how they contribute to the string.\n\nNT91 \u2192 t8\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT12 \u2192 t1\nNT1 \u2192 t1\nNT51 \u2192 t3\nNT76 \u2192 t5\nNT68 \u2192 t7 or t6?\nWait, let me look back at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple entries. For example:\nNT91 \u2192 t8 (from the entry NT91 -> 't8')\nNT7 -> t1\nNT12 -> t1\nNT26 -> t9\nNT2 -> t5\nNT41 -> t0 \u2192 because NT41 \u2192 t0\nNT54 \u2192 t0, t7, etc.\nWait, some entries are listed as NTx -> NTy NTz, but then others as NTx -> t?\n\nWait, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. For example:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8' is a production.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 't8'.\n\nSo, looking at the string, since the first token is t3, perhaps it's derived from NT51 \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT51 has the production NT51 \u2192 't3'. So that's a direct production.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t3. That can come from NT51.\n\nNow, the next tokens are t5, t7, t5, t0, t8, t0, etc. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's think of the entire string as needing to be generated from S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the overall structure is NT91 NT22, each of which can produce terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but NT91's production is 't8' directly, so S \u2192 NT91 (t8) and NT22 (t8). So the full string would be t8 t8. But the given string is much longer, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me re-examine the provided grammar:\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nThen each NT is a separate non-terminal with their own productions.\n\nLooking at NT91: NT91 \u2192 't8' (a terminal). So NT91 can only produce 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT22: NT22 \u2192 't8'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT91 NT22 would result in 't8 t8', but the string given is much longer, so that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps I'm wrong in my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nWait, this suggests that some of the NT symbols produce terminals. So, for example, NT95 goes to 't7', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT38 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nBut NT91 \u2192 't8' and NT22 \u2192 'NT87 NT98' (non-terminal). So NT22 itself is a non-terminal that needs to produce more.\n\nWait, but the string has 16 tokens, so perhaps the initial NT22 needs to produce a sequence that contributes to the rest of the string.\n\nWait, let's see: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. NT91 is 't8', NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. Then, each of these (NT87 and NT98) can further be broken down or produce terminals.\n\nLet's see NT87: NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. Both are non-terminals, so we have to break them down.\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7', a terminal. NT53 \u2192 ?? Let me check the grammar. Looking for NT53: in the given grammar, I don't see a rule for NT53. Hmm, so that's a problem. Because NT53 isn't defined, so NT53 \u2192 something must exist, but it's not given. So perhaps the grammar is incomplete, but I'm instructed that it's a given grammar, so maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, I rechecked the grammar and NT53 isn't defined. That means that NT53 doesn't have a production, which would make the grammar invalid, as non-terminals must have productions. But perhaps it's a typo, and maybe it's supposed to be another symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string given is shorter than expected. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, let me assume that the grammar is correctly provided.

{"custom_id":"request-287","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is quite long, with multiple production rules, and the string to check is `t7 t2 t2 t0 t5 t8 t8 t6 t2 t0 t0 t4 t4 t8 t1 t4 t3`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful for parsing and simplifying the grammar.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems everything is in CNF. All the right-hand sides of the rules are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which breaks down the start symbol into two non-terminals, and then those can be further expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, each separated by spaces. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the given grammar by expanding the non-terminals step by step until I reach the terminals in the string.\n\nI think the best approach here might be to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. However, given that this is a specific string, maybe a top-down approach or using a recursive descent parser would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break down the string into chunks that match the production rules. Let's try to see how the string can be divided using the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string: `t7 t2 t2 t0 t5 t8 t8 t6 t2 t0 t0 t4 t4 t8 t1 t4 t3`.\n\nThe initial symbol S must expand into two non-terminals, say NT91 and NT22. So, let's see if the first part of the string can be matched by NT91, and the second by NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT7, then NT91's productions... Wait, I think I need to look at each non-terminal's possible expansions.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should construct a reverse mapping, mapping each terminal symbol to the possible production rules that can produce it. That could help in working backward from the string.\n\nBut perhaps working forward is easier. Let's attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So S must generate a string that starts with NT91 and ends with NT22, but in reality, it's a sequence of terminals, so NT91 must generate some string and NT22 another.\n\nBut in the string we have, it's all a single sequence of terminals. So maybe a bottom-up approach is better, but I think bottom-up might be more complex here. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to look for the start of the string matching any production rule.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals, so the string must be exactly two parts, each derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is `t7 t2 t2 t0 t5 t8 t8 t6 t2 t0 t0 t4 t4 t8 t1 t4 t3`. Let's see if this can be divided into two parts that each fit the rules of NT91 and NT22.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list all rules for NT91 and NT22 and see if any of them can collectively generate the string.\n\nWait, let's first look at NT91's productions. From the grammar, I need to check each rule where NT91 appears on the left. Scanning through the rules:\n\nLooking through all the production rules for NT91, it seems that only one rule lists NT91 on the left side. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nHmm, I think in the provided grammar, I need to find all production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is NT91. Looking through each line:\n\nThe relevant part of the grammar is:\n\nNT91 -> NT7, and then I think I need to check the specific productions.\n\nWait, actually, the given grammar is quite extensive, and perhaps I made a mistake in listing all rules. Let me re-examine the provided grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, then NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, and so on.\n\nI think a more efficient approach would be to see where each terminal comes from. Let's see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the given rules, perhaps building the tree from the string backwards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the entire string and trying to split it into possible chunks that match the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: each rule in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, so each production can directly produce a step in the string. Thus, each terminal in the string corresponds to a production of a single terminal, and the non-terminals are the steps where two symbols are combined.\n\nWait, but the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps it's a concatenation of the expansions of two non-terminals, each of which ends in a terminal.\n\nWait, let's try to work backwards, starting from the string, trying to see if the last symbols can be matched by certain productions.\n\nFor example, the last part of the string is ...48 t1 t4 t3. That is, looking at the end, I need to see if the last expansion can match.\n\nLooking at the tree, perhaps the last part is t3, so I can look for a production where a non-terminal A produces t3. Let's check the grammar for that.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, and NT69 \u2192 't3', so NT76 can produce t3 as its first element and another non-terminal.\n\n- NT26 has multiple productions, including NT79, NT69, and others. Wait, let me scan the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is 't3':\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo, 't3' can be generated directly by NT69.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 't9' (among others), so 't9' is a direct production.\n\nNow, the string's last part is t3. So perhaps the last part of the string is the expansion of NT69 \u2192 't3'. \n\nBut perhaps that's too vague. Let me try to outline a possible expansion.\n\nAnother approach is to see that each time a non-terminal is expanded, it may produce another non-terminal or a terminal. Since the grammar is small, perhaps I can manually try to find a path that produces the string.\n\nStarting from the first symbol, which is 't7'. So, let's see where 't7' can come from. Looking through the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't1' and 't0', but also NT41 \u2192 't0', NT54\u2192't0', etc. Hmm, looking for any non-terminal that can directly produce 't7'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't7'. Let me check: \n\nLooking at production rules:\n\nLet me list all rules where the RHS is a terminal:\n\n- NT51 -> 't3'\n\n- NT50 -> 't9'\n\n- NT95 -> 't1'\n\n- NT57 -> ?\n\nWait, perhaps I didn't list all.

The start symbol here is S, and the string is a series of terminal symbols separated by spaces. So, my goal is to see if this string can be derived from S using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the starting point is two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. Each of these needs to be expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nLet me list out the terminal symbols present in the string: t3, t9, t3, t8, t5, t6, t6, t0, t6, t9, t6, t5, t6, t8, t5, t1, t8. So, the string has 17 tokens, and the grammar should generate exactly these in order.\n\nSince the grammar uses Chomsky Normal Form, I can use the CYK algorithm or trace back from the start symbol. Alternatively, maybe a parsing approach step by step could help.\n\nI'll start by noting the top-level production: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first step is to see if NT91 can generate the initial part of the string and NT22 generates the rest, or some combination.\n\nLooking at NT91 and NT22, perhaps I can find their productions step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for each non-terminal's possible expansions and see if they match parts of the string.\n\nFirst, let's analyze NT91. From the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT56 NT95. So, NT91 expands into two non-terminals: NT56 and NT95. \n\nNow, looking into NT56: the productions are NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78 and NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95. But in the given grammar, there might be multiple ways NT56 can expand, but looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\nAlso, NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95, but that's more complex as it's recursive unless it terminates.\n\nLooking at NT78: It's NT78 \u2192 NT53 NT31. So, NT78 splits into NT53 and NT31.\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT6 NT96, and NT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31. \n\nWait, this might get complicated. Let's try a different approach: look for terminals in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t3. I need to find a production that starts with t3. Looking through the grammar, the rule NT6 \u2192 t6, but that's different. Wait, no, checking the rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t6? Or is it elsewhere? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n- NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\n- NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\n- NT38 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 t6? Or wait, looking at the rules provided:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t5\n\nBut wait, are there multiple NT6 productions with different terminals? I need to check.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n- NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\n- NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\n- NT38 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 t5 but wait, another NT6 \u2192 t2 or something else? Let me check.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up the rules. Let me list all NT6 productions:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t5 (from rule \"NT6 -> 't5'\")\n- Another NT6 rule: wait, I see \"NT6 -> 't2'\" elsewhere? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nand another rule:\n\nNT6 -> 't2'\n\nWait, that's a problem because a non-terminal can't have multiple production rules with different terminals if they're the same symbol. Or wait, maybe multiple rules can have the same symbol but different terminals. So, NT6 can produce either t5 or t2.\n\nWait, no, that's not possible in context-free grammars because each non-terminal's productions are fixed. Looking again at the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT6:\n- NT6 \u2192 t5\n- NT6 \u2192 t2\n\nWait, that can't be right because in a typical Chomsky Normal Form grammar, a non-terminal can only have a fixed set of productions. So perhaps that's a mistake, or perhaps in the grammar, there are two rules for NT6, one producing t5 and the other t2. That would mean that NT6 can produce either t5 or t2 depending on which rule is used.\n\nBut that would complicate things a lot. Alternatively, maybe I misread the rules.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe grammar rules given are:\n\n- NT6 -> t5\n- NT6 -> t2\n\nWait, that can't be correct because that would mean that NT6 can expand to either t5 or t2, which is fine because it's a non-terminal. So, in the grammar, NT6 can produce t5 or t2.\n\nSo, let's note that. So, NT6 can be t5 or t2.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals can have multiple options.\n\nNow, with that in mind, let's go back to the string. The first token is t3. So, I need to find what non-terminals can produce t3 as their first terminal.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that have a production leading to t3:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 NT95 NT53, but NT53 \u2192 NT6 NT96, which could produce t5 or t5 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another non-terminal can produce t3.\n\nWait, maybe NT73 \u2192 t6, but no, let's check:\n\nWait, NT76 \u2192 t5 and t9, perhaps. Wait, let me look through all the non-terminals that can produce t3.\n\nLooking through:\n\nLooking for NT rules where a terminal is 't3'.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT76 NT38\n  - NT76 \u2192 t5 and t98\n    - Wait, no, looking at NT76: NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, but then NT69 \u2192 t3, so NT76 can produce t3 through NT69. So perhaps NT76 can expand into t3, but I'm not sure because NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, and each of those can produce t3 and t6 respectively.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to reconstruct the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a parsing approach with the top-down method.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t3 t9 t3 t8 t5 t6 t6 t0 t6 t9 t6 t5 t6 t8 t5 t1 t8\n\nBreaking it down: The first symbol is t3. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t3 as their first step.\n\nLooking through the grammar, it seems that NT76 can produce t3 because NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, and NT69 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo, if NT76 can produce t3, then maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. But let's see what NT91 and NT22 can produce.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the two non-terminals need to produce the parts leading up to t3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first symbol t3 comes from NT91. Let's see.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT56 NT95.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t3, which would come from NT56 NT95. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT91 can produce t3 through one of its expansions.\n\nWait, NT91 \u2192 NT56 NT95. So, let's see each part.\n\nNT56 can produce t5 or t2.\n\nNT95 can produce 't1' or 't69' (no, looking at the given rules, NT95 \u2192 't1', right?

{"custom_id":"request-303","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex, and the string to evaluate is `t4 t7 t1 t2 t2 t8 t6 t3 t2 t6 t9 t8 t0 t5 t4 t7 t6 t1`. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky normal form entails. CNF is a form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this because most of the productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTwz, which are two non-terminals on the right side, and some are terminals like 't3' which is a single terminal. \n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of terminals. To check if the grammar can generate this string, I can use a parsing approach, either top-down (like with the CYK algorithm) or bottom-up. Maybe a recursive descent parser could work, but I think CYK might be more straightforward for a fixed grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to try to parse the string by building a parse tree, starting from the top symbol S and seeing if we can derive the string. The given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first two symbols should come from NT91 and NT22. \n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t4. Let's check which non-terminal can produce t4. Looking at the grammar, I see NT91 and NT73 both have a production that ends with t4. For example, NT91 \u2192 t8 (from earlier productions? Wait, let me check. Looking through the productions, NT91 is involved in NT73 \u2192 t6, but that might not be directly helpful. Wait, actually, each production that ends with a terminal is either a single terminal or a combination. \n\nWait, no, most of the productions are splitting into two non-terminals, and some have a terminal as one of the parts. For example, looking for NT that can produce t4. \n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 t4, NT8 \u2192 t5, NT7 \u2192 t1, but looking through the given productions, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through the non-terminals and their possible terminal productions.\n\nFor example, NT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31, which can eventually produce t2. Hmm, maybe I should list out all non-terminals that directly produce terminals. \n\nLooking through the productions, I can see several non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\n- NT91: It's used in NT73's production, but I don't see NT91 itself having a terminal. For example, NT91 is used in NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT69, which might eventually produce a terminal, but I'm not sure.\nWait, perhaps I should go through each non-terminal and see what they can produce:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38 \u2192 which can then produce t6 and t6, but that leads to t6 t6...\nWait, but the given string starts with t4. So, I need to find a production path where a non-terminal can generate t4.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I can find a few NTs that produce terminals:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t4\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12 \u2192 but this is recursive. When does NT12 produce a terminal? Looking through the rules, perhaps in some productions. Wait, NT12 is in NT76 \u2192 NT99 (or wait, I'm getting confused because the non-terminals have numbers, but perhaps I should list all the NTs and their direct terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all the NTs and see which ones directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 t3\n- NT1 \u2192 t1 t1\n- NT26 \u2192 t7 or t9\n- NT5 \u2192 let me check: NT5 is not listed, but looking at the given grammar, there's NT41 -> NT9 NT51 which produces t0, but not NT5.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce terminals when they split further. For example, NT79 might produce t3 in some step.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit lost here. Let me approach this more methodically. The string starts with t4. So, the first part should be generated by a production that starts with NTx where x can produce t4. Let me see which NTs can produce t4.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT7 (I think NT7 is part of another non-terminal, like NT76 or NT73) might produce t4. Wait, I'm not seeing any NT directly producing t4 except perhaps NT9 \u2192 t4. So, if the first part is t4, then the first NT must be NT9, which produces t4.\n\nBut in the given grammar, where does NT9 come from? Looking through the productions, I don't see NT9 being directly created by another non-terminal. For example, NT9 is used in NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT69, which might produce t6, but that doesn't help. So, perhaps NT91 is used in some way. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the initial production S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the first two non-terminals are NT91 and NT22.\n\nBut the string starts with t4, which has to come from one of these. Let me check what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT91 is mentioned in NT73 \u2192 NT69 NT73? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the non-terminals.

Let me go through each rule step by step to make sure I have them all correct.\n\nLooking back, S starts with NT91 and NT22. So the entire string must be the concatenation of two sequences derived from NT91 and NT22, respectively.\n\nLet me first focus on NT22. Its production is NT87 and NT98. From the rules:\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\nSo NT87 can expand into NT95 NT53, which can then expand further.\n\nLet's see the input starts with t5. So looking for how NT22 can produce t5 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT87: It can go to NT95 and NT53. Let's see:\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\nNT53 -> 't6' (from NT56 -> NT53, but wait, looking at the rules, NT56 -> NT55 NT78, and NT78 is 't8'. Hmm, perhaps it's better to look at each symbol.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the rules. From the given grammar, each production either breaks into two non-terminals or is a terminal. For example, NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'. Similarly, NT22 -> 't8'.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Each production either has two non-terminals or is a terminal. So for NT87: NT87 -> NT95 NT53. Both NT95 and NT53 are non-terminals, so they must further expand.\n\nBut wait, looking at the given rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT95 -> 't7' and NT38 -> 't2', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a way to get the first symbol of the string, which is t5, from NT22.\n\nSo NT22's production is NT87 NT98. Therefore, the first symbol of NT22's derivation would come from NT87's first non-terminal.\n\nWait, but NT87 is a non-terminal, and its production is NT95 NT53. So the first symbol would come from NT95. Looking at NT95's rules: NT95 can produce 't7' directly (from NT95 -> 't7'), or via other paths.\n\nWait, from the rules, NT95 has two productions: NT95 -> 't7' and NT95 -> NT13 NT1.\n\nSo the first symbol could be 't7' or the expansion of NT95 into NT13 NT1, which would then produce two more symbols.\n\nBut our string starts with t5, which is not 't7'. So that's a problem because NT87's first symbol can't be t5; it has to be 't7' or something else, but our string starts with t5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the derivations work. Let me think again.\n\nWait, NT87->NT95 NT53. So the first symbol of NT87's expansion is whatever NT95 produces. The options for NT95 are 't7' or NT13 NT1.\n\nIf NT95 -> 't7', then the first symbol would be 't7', which doesn't match our string's first symbol 't5'. So NT95 can't be producing 't7' here; but since the string starts with 't5', we need another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the grammar rules. Let me check if NT87 can produce anything else. From the given grammar, I don't see another production for NT87 except for NT95 NT53. So NT87 can't directly produce a terminal. It has to expand further until it reaches terminals.\n\nSo let's consider NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nSo the first symbol is whatever NT95 produces. If NT95 can't produce 't5', then we have a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-323","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t5 t1 t2 t1 t7 t5 t1 t4 t9 t3 t2 t9 t9 t7 t0 t7 t2 t7 t6`. That's a lot of tokens, so I need to break this down carefully.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has production rules where each rule's right-hand side (RHS) has exactly two non-terminals, except possibly for the start symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow that because every rule is between two NT's or symbols. The start symbol is S, which is defined as NT91 NT22. \n\nThe strategy I'll use is to try to find a parse tree for the string. Each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. I'll start by looking at the start symbol and see if each part of the string can be derived from it.\n\nThe initial step is to split the string into chunks that might correspond to the main productions. The first production is S -> NT91 NT22. So the first part should be NT91 and then NT22. Let me check the string for possible matches starting at the beginning.\n\nLooking at the start, the tokens are t5, t1, t2, etc. Maybe NT91 produces something that can start with t5. Looking through the grammar, I see NT91 -> NT73 NT78. So NT91 is split into NT73 and NT78.\n\nBreaking down NT73 and NT78: \n- NT73 -> NT77 NT78\n- NT78 -> NT76 NT31\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar:\nActually, let me check. NT73 is in the rules. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT73 -> NT77 NT78? Wait no, looking back, no, the given rules are specific. Let me recheck the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\nNT91 -> NT73 NT78\nNT73 -> NT77 NT78\nNT77 -> ... Hmm, wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT77 or NT78 in the higher-level productions. It might be a chain that eventually terminates into terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps it's better to work from the string backward, trying to match the end of the string to the productions.\n\nSo the last part of the string is ... t7 t6. Let's check if any NT can derive t6. Looking through the grammar, for example, NT13 -> t0. Wait, but t6 is another token. Wait, perhaps I should look for an NT that can produce t6.\n\nWait, looking back, some NT's have direct terminals. For example, NT6 -> t5 and NT6 -> t8 (multiple rules perhaps). Wait, let's check the grammar rules again:\n\nThe grammar has several NT rules that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT6 -> t5\n- NT6 -> t8\n- NT26 -> t7\n- NT56 -> t7\n- NT41 -> t0\n- NT95 -> 't7' (I think there might be a typo here, 't7' could be 't7' or something else, but let's go with that)\n- NT6 -> t2\nWait, actually, some of these might be typos or if they are written as 't7', it's part of the production.\n\nWait, it's possible that some NT rules directly produce a single terminal symbol. Let me list all the NT's that produce a single terminal:\n\nLooking through the given rules, for example:\n\n- NT68 -> NT6 NT41\nWait, no, but some NT's directly produce a terminal:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT26 -> 't7'\nNT41 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't6'\nNT76 -> 't5'\nNT96 -> 't6'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nWait, no, actually, it's written as 't5', 't2', etc. So each rule where RHS is a single terminal is an end production.\n\nSo, for example, NT6 can produce 't5' or 't8', or other terms. So in the string, the last two tokens are t7 and t6.\n\nWait, but that might not make sense because each production produces two non-terminals except when it's a terminal. So each token in the string is the result of a single production that produces a terminal. \n\nWait, wait, no: Each token is the result of a single step in the derivation. So each token corresponds to some NT symbol that has a production whose RHS is that terminal.\n\nSo starting from the end, look for the last token, t6. But in any case, the approach is a bit tricky. Maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string from the start.\n\nS is NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the first two tokens should correspond to NT91 and NT22 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string: t5, t1, t2, t1, t7, t5, t1, t4, t9, t3, t2, t9, t9, t7, t0, t7, t2, t7, t6.\n\nSo the first part is t5, which should be the result of NT91. Let's see what NT91 can produce.\n\nNT91 -> NT73 NT78.\n\nSo NT91 splits into NT73 and NT78, each of which needs to be derived from their respective non-terminals.\n\nSo the first token is t5, which should come from NT73.\n\nWait: NT73 -> NT77 NT78. But then NT77 and NT78 need to be split into terminals, but perhaps these are intermediates that produce other NT's.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I can instead try to create a possible parse tree.\n\nBut another approach is to use the fact that each production in the grammar either splits into two NT's or into a terminal. So each token in the string corresponds to a single terminal symbol, so each step in the derivation must resolve an NT into a terminal.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens, which means 19 steps where each step produces a terminal, each from a single NT.\n\nSo starting from S = NT91 NT22.\n\nThe first two symbols are t5 and t1. But wait, in the string, the first token is t5. But according to S, the first part is NT91, so the first symbol comes from NT91. Similarly, the second symbol comes from NT22.\n\nSo the string is: t5 (from NT91) followed by t1 (from NT22). Wait, but the second symbol is t1, which comes from NT22.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar:\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nSo NT22 splits into NT87 and NT98.\n\nSo the first token is NT91, the second token is NT87 and NT98. The next tokens would expand those.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm complicating it again. Let's try to model a possible expansion step by step.\n\nThe string is: t5 t1 t2 t1 t7 t5 t1 t4 t9 t3 t2 t9 t9 t7 t0 t7 t2 t7 t6.\n\nWe can try to group this into expansions from the grammar.\n\nStart:\n\nS = NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, the first two symbols should be the results of NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t5, which could be from NT91 or NT22? Wait, no, because NT91 is the first part. So the first token is from NT91, second token from NT22.\n\nNT91 -> NT73 NT78.\n\nSo the first two symbols t5 and t1 must come from NT73 and NT78.\n\nBut NT73 is not a terminal, it's an intermediate. So perhaps NT73 is further expanded.\n\nNT73 -> NT77 NT78.\n\nSo the first two symbols t5 and t1 must come from NT77 and NT78, respectively, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but t5 is the first symbol, so t5 = NT77?\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- Start with S: NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the first two symbols in the string must be derived from NT91 and NT22.\n\nThe first token in the string is t5, so t5 must come from NT91.\n\nThe second token is t1, so t1 must come from NT22.\n\nSo, NT91 \u2192 t5?

{"custom_id":"request-330","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t2 t2 t5 t7 t7 t7 t8 t0 t0 t2 t8 t2 t9 t1 t3 t5 t4 t1 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the base cases which expand into terminals. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except when it's A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some NT (Non-Terminal) symbols expand into two other NT symbols, and others expand into terminals. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7', NT38 \u2192 't2', etc. So, the grammar directly connects these non-terminals to terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of a string will have a length that is twice the number of symbols minus one. Wait, let me think about that again. In CNF, each step replaces a single non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols in the sentential form increases by one each step. For a string of length n, the number of steps needed to reach it from the start symbol would require n-1 steps, starting from a single non-terminal. So, for a string of k terminals, the number of productions used in the derivation would be k, starting from 1 (S). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of productions. Each production produces one more symbol, so starting from S (1 symbol), each step adds one until we reach the length of the string.\n\nThe given string has 19 tokens, which means the derivation path would consist of 18 productions. So, the start symbol S will expand into NT91 and NT22. Let's see the first two symbols of the string: t2 and t2. So, looking at the productions, I need to see how to get from S's productions to these ts.\n\nLooking at NT91 \u2192 't8', so that wouldn't help here since we have a t2. Looking at NT76 \u2192 't5', but again that's t5, not t2. Wait, let me check the NTs that expand to t2. Scanning the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't2' and also NT26 \u2192 't2' and NT26 \u2192 't5' but nope. Wait, checking NT76: I see NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, and looking at NT26: it has multiple productions, including some that expand to 't2', 't1', etc. But how do we get to t2?\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. The first symbol in the string is t2. So, it must come from a production of the form X \u2192 t2. From the grammar, I see that NT22 \u2192 't2', NT26 \u2192 't6' or 't5' or 't1' depending on the productions. So, in the first step, since S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and the string starts with t2, which is in NT22, so the first production would have to derive t2.\n\nWait, no, the first symbol is t2, so NT91 would have to produce s that eventually leads to the first t2, but NT91 can only produce NT5 NT4 NT1 (wait, no, let me check the grammar correctly).\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar entries:\n\nI think I might have misread the grammar. The user provided a lot of productions, perhaps with some redundancy, but I need to go through them carefully.\n\nLooking at the NTs that directly produce t2: From the list, NT22 \u2192 't2', NT26 \u2192 't2', and some others?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\nWait, for NT22, is the production NT22 \u2192 't2'? Let me check:\n\nIn the provided grammar, under NT22, I see it's written as NT22 -> NT91 NT22 (but that's not correct because in CNF, each production should be two non-terminals). Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I may have misread it. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nThe grammar seems to have lines like: S -> NT91 NT22, which is correct, and then each line is an NT followed by its production. For example, NT22 -> NT87 NT98, etc.\n\nSo, looking for terminal symbols, those that end with '\u2192 ' and then a terminal. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7' (maybe; looking at the line: 'NT95 -> 't7''... Wait, the user's grammar string shows lines like 'NT95 -> 't7'', with single quotes, so maybe those are terminals.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused here. In the user's input, the grammar is presented as:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n...\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't2'\n...\nNT6 -> 't5'\nand so on.\n\nSo, the '\u2192 ' followed by an apostrophe and a letter or number indicates a terminal, while other productions are non-terminals breaking down further.\n\nSo, the terminals are:\n\n- 't2', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9', etc.\n\nNow, to get the string starting with t2, which is a terminal, it must come from a non-terminal that eventually produces 't2'. So, looking through the grammar, the non-terminals that directly produce terminals include:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT26 \u2192 several options including 't2'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12' earlier, but no, wait, looking again: It seems NT12 has a production that leads to 't12', but I don't see an explicit terminal. Wait, no, looking at the provided grammar again, I see:\n\nWait, let me go through all the lines:\n\nLooking for NTs that directly produce terminals (with 'tX'), we have:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't5' (from two productions)\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't8' (another production)\n\nWait, looking more carefully: the user's grammar includes lines like 'NT6 -> 't5'', 'NT6 -> 't8''\n\nWait, that might be a problem because in CNF, each non-terminal can have only one production in each step, but if a non-terminal has multiple productions, it's fine as long as they are correctly applied.\n\nSo, for the NTs that produce 't2', looking at the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't2'\n\nIs that correct? Let me check: yes, in the user's grammar, under NT26, there are several productions, including 't2' and 't1' and 't5' and 't6', etc. So, NT26 can expand to 't2'.\n\nSo, for the string starting with 't2', the first non-terminal must be either NT22 or NT26.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first symbols are derived from NT91 and NT22.\n\nBut the string starts with 't2', which is from NT22 (since S's first production involves NT91 and NT22, and NT91 perhaps doesn't lead to 't2'). Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, S's first production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, during the first step, the start symbol S will produce two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. Each of these will be expanded further. So, the string starts with the first symbol from NT91 and the second from NT22?\n\nWait, no, not exactly. The productions are applied in parallel. The sentential form starts as S, then expands to NT91 NT22, then each of those NTs expands further, and so on until all are terminals.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. The next steps involve expanding each of these NTs into their respective productions.\n\nBut to get the string starting with 't2', one of the productions must produce 't2' as the first symbol. Let's see:\n\nIn S \u2192 NT91 NT22, the NT91 may expand into something that starts with a terminal, and NT22 may expand into 't2'. So, the first symbol of the string is from NT22's expansion.\n\nSo, looking at NT22's productions: NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, which are also non-terminals. So, from NT22, the first symbol comes from NT87 and NT98, but to get 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each of these non-terminals then breaks down further, either into more non-terminals or terminals.-terminal symbols are the t followed by numbers, which are the actual output tokens. \n\nThe goal string is `t8 t4 t5 t1 t6 t4 t7 t8 t0 t0 t5 t6 t2 t0 t0 t8 t8 t5 t1 t0`. I'll need to see if this corresponds to a valid leftmost derivation from S.\n\nI'll start by writing down the string as a sequence of symbols: t8, t4, t5, t1, t6, t4, t7, t8, t0, t0, t5, t6, t2, t0, t0, t8, t8, t5, t1, t0. There are 20 symbols, so the derivation should produce exactly 20 symbols.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to break down the string into possible subderivations using the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S, which produces NT91 and NT22. Let's look at NT91 and NT22. \n\nLooking at NT91, according to the grammar, it can be replaced by NT95 NT53. So, NT91 -> NT95 NT53. \n\nNT95 can be broken down into NT97 NT1. So, NT95 -> NT97 NT1.\n\nNT97 is a terminal, as indicated by NT97 -> 't1', and NT1 is 't1'. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, looking back: NT97 -> 't1', but NT1 is another rule. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar for NT97 says NT97 -> 't1', and for NT1, it's NT12 NT26, which means I might have to derive further. Wait, no\u2014NT1 is just 't1' as per another rule. Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT97 -> 't1', and NT1 is defined as NT12 NT26. But NT12 produces NT8 NT12, which eventually might terminate into a terminal. Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me make a better organized approach.\n\nPerhaps using a top-down parser approach, trying to match the string step by step.\n\nEach production will produce a sequence of symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So, I'll need to see if the string can be matched in order by applying the rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can parse the string step by step, starting from S and recursively breaking down each symbol into smaller parts, ensuring that the order of the string is matched.\n\nLet me first try to list all production rules for each non-terminal. But that's a lot, so perhaps focusing on the string and seeing if each step can match a production rule.\n\nThe initial S is NT91 NT22. So the string starts with the symbols generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, I'll split the string into two parts corresponding to the two parts of S: the first part is under NT91, the second under NT22.\n\nLooking at the string: t8, t4, t5, t1, t6, t4, t7, t8, t0, t0, t5, t6, t2, t0, t0, t8, t8, t5, t1, t0.\n\nFirst, the left part should be generated by NT91, which breaks down to NT95 NT53. Then, NT53 breaks down into, according to the grammar, NT53 is 't6' or... Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT53, I see that NT53 -> 't6' is one of the options, as it's listed under NT53 as `NT53 -> NT537 -> ... but wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT53 is defined as `NT53 -> t6`. Yes, so NT53 can directly produce 't6' as per the rules.\n\nSo, for NT53, it's just 't6'. So that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, what about NT95? NT95 can be replaced by NT97 NT1. So NT95 -> NT97 NT1.\n\nBut wait, NT97 is 't1' and NT1 is 't1' as well, as per their rules. So NT95 produces t1 t1.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, NT97 is a single terminal 't1', and NT1 is another rule that may produce more symbols.\n\nWait, let me check NT1: NT1 -> NT12 NT26. Then, NT12 is NT8 NT12. Hmm, this seems to loop. Wait, no\u2014looking at NT12, it's NT8 NT12. But NT8 is 't5' according to the rules. Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT8 is defined as a terminal? Looking back, I see NT8 is listed with `NT8 -> 't5'` and `NT8 -> 't8'`? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n- NT8 -> 't5' and 't8'?\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I see something. Let me list the rules again to get clarity:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT8 -> 't8'\n\nAh, so NT8 can produce either 't5' or 't8'.\n\nBut in this case, in NT95 -> NT97 NT1, NT97 is 't1', and NT1 is ?\n\nNT1 is defined as NT12 NT26, which further breaks down. Let's see:\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12. So NT12 can produce NT8 followed by NT12, but since it's Chomsky normal form, it can only produce two symbols, so perhaps in a leftmost derivation, the NT12 would be replaced by NT8 followed by NT12, which in turn would have to be replaced. But if there's a terminal, it will be produced at some point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me instead build the string step by step, matching each symbol.\n\nThe string is 20 symbols: t8, t4, t5, t1, t6, t4, t7, t8, t0, t0, t5, t6, t2, t0, t0, t8, t8, t5, t1, t0.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t8. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminal can produce t8 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking for any NT that can derive t8 as the first step. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT78: `NT78 -> NT53 NT8`. So if NT78 starts with, but it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to start from the start and step through the parse.\n\nBut another approach is to see that each production of NT22, which is the second part of S, starting with S being NT91 NT22. So, the second half of the string is generated by NT22, which is NT87 NT98.\n\nSo the second half of the string is: t4, t5, t1, t6, t4, t7, t8, t0, t0, t5, t6, t2, t0, t0, t8, t8, t5, t1, t0.\n\nWait, that's 19 symbols, but earlier I thought the entire string is 20. Let me recount.\n\nOriginal string: t8, t4, t5, t1, t6, t4, t7, t8, t0, t0, t5, t6, t2, t0, t0, t8, t8, t5, t1, t0. Yes, 20 symbols.\n\nBut then S is NT91 NT22, so each of these will contribute a left part and a right part. So the first NT91 part and the NT22 part.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t8, so perhaps the NT91 part starts with t8.\n\nWait, looking at NT91: NT91 -> NT95 NT53. So NT95 is 't1' and NT53 is 't6' as per rules. So from NT91, the first two symbols would be t1 t6."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

My task is to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Let me take a step-by-step approach to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in Chomsky normal form, every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar fits this form, as all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t1 t9 t5 t3 t8 t5 t4 t1 t3 t2 t5 t6 t9 t2 t8 t2 t9 t6 t8 t6`.\n\nSo, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, so I'll look at the initial production: S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT91 and NT22) will need to be expanded until we reach terminals. Each step corresponds to a production rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT59 NT90 (Wait, no, looking back: The grammar provided doesn't include NT59, but in the list, NT91 is directly in the initial step: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Oh, okay, NT91 and NT22 both seem to be nodes that can be broken down further.\n\nWait, hold on, looking at the production rules:\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, I see that NT91 is actually a terminal 't9 t8' because looking at the list, NT91 -> 't8', right? Or wait, let me check each NT.\n\nWait, looking at the NT definitions, for example, NT91 is defined as 't8'. Let me make sure:\n\n- NT91: looking at the list, I see NT91 -> 't8'\n- Similarly, NT22 is defined as 't8' because NT22 -> 't8'\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT22, yes, it's 't8'.\n\nSo, initially, S \u2192 NT91 NT22 becomes 't8' followed by 't8', which is 't8 t8'. But the given string starts with 't1 t9 t5...' which is different. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, wait: in the grammar, perhaps I misread which NTs lead to terminals. Let me re-express all the NT productions that end in terminals.\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT91 -> 't8' \u2014 yes, that's an atomic terminal.\n\nNT22 -> 't8' \u2014 another terminal.\n\nSo, the initial expansion S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is 't8 t8', but the string starts with 't1 t9... so clearly, that's a problem. So either I made a mistake in understanding the NT productions, or perhaps the NT91 and NT22 are more complex and I misread them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT91 and NT22 can be expanded further into sequences that end with 't1', 't9', etc. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking through the NT definitions:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8' (so cannot be expanded further)\n- NT22 -> 't8' (same, no expansion)\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT91 NT22 leads to 't8 t8', but the string starts with 't1', that's a discrepancy.

The string is a sequence of symbols, and I have to check if it can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes it easier to apply certain parsing algorithms, but for my task, I just need to see if the string can be produced by following the rules, regardless of the parsing method.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see all rules are in CNF. Each rule on the left side (like S) has exactly two non-terminals on the right, or in the case of some rules like NT98 -> 't7', there's a terminal on the right. So, the terminals are the 't' followed by a number, like 't1', 't2', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t3 t1 t2 t7 t9 t5 t9 t3 t0 t2 t3 t9 t9 t2 t6 t1 t3 t6 t8 t6 t4.\n\nI realize that to derive the string, each 't' symbol must come from a production rule where a terminal is on the right side. Since the grammar is in CNF, each rule that produces a terminal must only have that terminal on the right.\n\nSo, the plan is to start from the start symbol S and see if I can expand it step by step until I end up with the target string. Alternatively, since the string is quite long (21 symbols), I might need a recursive approach.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to represent the string as a sequence of terminals and see if they can be matched from the start. I can try to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules at each step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first step is to split the string into parts that correspond to NT91 and NT22. Each of these is a non-terminal, so when I expand, they will eventually be expanded into sequences of 't's and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t3, t1, t2, t7. I need to match the next symbols according to the rules of NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet's take NT91. From the grammar, NT91 can expand to NT76 or other non-terminals, but looking at the rules for NT91, I see it's only on the left side as part of other rules, not as an initial expansion. So, wait, the grammar shows NT91 \u2192 NT8? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT95, NT75, etc., but NT91 is part of the larger structure. Let me look for production rules for NT91.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT95 -> 't7' \u2014 so it produces a terminal.\n\nNT91 -> I don't see NT91 in the left side of any production. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I need to check the given grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, are there any rules for NT91? Let me go through each line:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nSo, NT91 is on the right side of S. But as a left side non-terminal, I'm looking for NT91 -> something.

So, perhaps that's an error, but according to the provided grammar, NT91 is on the right side as part of the initial production, but it's not on the left as a non-terminal rule. So, the problem is that S \u2192 NT91 NT22, but there's no production for NT91, meaning NT91 cannot be expanded further. Similarly, perhaps.\n\nWait, that can't be.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has some terminals and non-terminals. Terminals are things like 't0', 't6', etc., and the non-terminals are the NT with numbers, like NT72 or similar. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if the grammar can derive this exact sequence starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, S directly produces NT91 NT22. So the derivation starts with NT91 and NT22. Let's expand those.\n\nNT91 has a production NT95 NT53, which in turn NT95 goes to NT13 NT1. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I should see if each step can produce the corresponding terminal in the string.\n\nWait, but this might get too deep. Alternatively, perhaps the string corresponds to the leftmost derivation from S. Maybe I can try to match each step.\n\nThe string is t0 t6 t5 t5 t3 t9 t4 t7 t9 t6 t9 t3 t1 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t8 t2 t1. That's 21 symbols.\n\nThe grammar's productions are mostly two non-terminals per production. Let's think about the structure.\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string starts with whatever NT91 produces and then NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91, it's NT95 NT53, which ultimately (if I look at the rules) would probably lead to some terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT95: NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. NT13 \u2192 NT? Wait, NT13's production isn't directly given, but looking at the rules, there's NT13 \u2192 t0. So NT13 \u2192 t0. So NT95 would be NT13 NT1, which would produce t0 from NT95.\n\nWait, but NT95 also has a production: NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1, which seems to be the same as another rule. So maybe NT95 only has one production path, which is to two non-terminals. Hmm, that might not be correct. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT95 rules: Only NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1 is present. There's also NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95, but that's different.\n\nSo, NT95 produces NT13 NT1. Then, NT13 \u2192 t0, so NT95 \u2192 t0 NT1. Then NT1 \u2192 either NT7 or other rules. Looking at NT1, it has rules: NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41 or NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Since the string is a concatenation of terminals, maybe each step in the derivation produces exactly one terminal, and the number of steps should match the length of the string.\n\nGiven that S starts with two non-terminals, each production in the leftmost derivation will replace each non-terminal with something, either a terminal or another set of non-terminals. Since it's CNF, each step will possibly increase the number of non-terminals by one each time.\n\nBut let's think about the structure of the string. The first symbol is t0, so perhaps the first non-terminal to expand is NT91, which produces something that eventually leads to t0.\n\nLooking at NT91: It's NT95 NT53. So NT95 is one part. NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. NT13 \u2192 t0. NT1 \u2192 ... Let me expand NT1.\n\nLooking at NT1 rules: NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41 or NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96, etc. But that's not directly helpful. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each symbol in the string corresponds to the first symbol of a production. So, for the first t0, maybe NT91's first part needs to produce t0.\n\nLooking at NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. NT13 \u2192 t0. So the first symbol would be t0 if NT95 directly leads to t0, but that's not possible as NT95 consists of two non-terminals. So maybe the string starts with the expansion that leads to t0 from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by seeing which non-terminals can derive the starting t0.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, only NT13 \u2192 t0. So to get t0, we must have NT13 somewhere in the derivation. So perhaps after expanding, one of the non-terminals becomes NT13.\n\nBut in the initial step, S is NT91 NT22. Let's see NT91's production: NT95 NT53. So NT95 has to derive something. NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. So NT95 becomes NT13 and NT1. Then NT13 \u2192 t0. That gives the first t0.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is t0, which we can get from NT95's expansion of NT13 \u2192 t0.\n\nThen, after that, the NT1 needs to expand into something. Let's see what NT1 does.\n\nNT1 has two productions: NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41 and NT1 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 ... etc. Wait, looking back, NT1 also has NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12, which is a recursive rule. Hmm, complex.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the second symbol in the string, which is t6. So after t0 comes t6. How can that happen?\n\nLooking back, after NT95 produces t0, we have NT1, which needs to produce t6.\n\nLooking at NT1's production: NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41. Then NT97 \u2192 NT79 NT76. Let's see what NT79 and NT76 produce.\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76. NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68. So NT51 is recursive: NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68. That's a left recursion, which can be expanded multiple times until it hits a terminal or a non-terminal that can be expanded into a terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT51's productions: NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 or NT51 \u2192 NT69 NT56.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT51 has production NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 or NT51 \u2192 NT69 NT56.\n\nSo when expanding NT51, if it uses the first production, it's left-recursive, which would create a long chain. Alternatively, the second production could directly produce NT69 and NT56, which then can expand further.\n\nWait, from the start, after nt91 becomes nt95 nt53, which becomes nt13 nt1.\n\nnt13 becomes t0, and nt1 becomes nt97 nt41. Then nt97 becomes nt79 nt76.\n\nLet's look at nt79: nt79 \u2192 nt51 nt76. Then nt51 can expand in two ways.\n\nIf nt51 expands as nt51 \u2192 nt51 nt68, then nt68 can expand as nt68 \u2192 nt6 nt41 or other options.\n\nWait, nt68: in the given grammar, nt68 \u2192 nt6 nt41. nt6 is a terminal, which is 't5' and 't8' perhaps? Wait, no: looking back, terminals are 't0', 't1', etc. Looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the terminal symbols are:\n\n'm t7', 't5', 't6', 't8', 't9', etc. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41. Then NT6 \u2192 't5' or 't8' (since in the grammar, NT68 \u2192 't5', 't8', etc.)\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, for the non-terminals:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5' (two rules, but same terminal)\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\nNT26 \u2192 't7'\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\nNT41 \u2192 't0'\nNT26 \u2192 't9' etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some non-terminals expand into terminals. For example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5' or 't8' (two rules, same as the given grammar lines)\n\nSo nt6 can be 't5' or 't8'. That helps.\n\nBack to the expansion:\n\nWe have nt79 \u2192 nt51 nt76.\n\nnt51 has two options:\n\n1) nt51 \u2192 nt51 nt68\n2) nt51 \u2192 nt69"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-384","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the string `t8 t5 t6 t7 t5 t1 t8 t1 t1 t1 t6 t1 t4 t6 t5 t7 t4 t7 t4 t3 t1 t4` is generated by this grammar. The grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of production rules, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form grammars are structured such that each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. But looking at the given grammar, some rules have two terminals, which isn't possible because in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. Wait, no, actually, wait. CNF allows rules like A \u2192 a, but some sources also mention that each production should have exactly two non-terminals. So, I'm a bit confused because some rules here have two terminals, like NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'. Hmm, maybe the user input has errors, but perhaps the user intended to write the grammar in CNF regardless. Well, for now, I'll proceed as is.\n\nSo, the approach I'll take is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the non-terminals need to be expanded into terminals using the production rules.\n\nThe string is quite long, but perhaps I can parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, note the initial production S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the entire string should be broken down into two parts, each starting with NT91 and NT22. Let me check the string: it starts with t8, t5, etc. Let me see if I can figure out how NT91 and NT22 might expand.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the rules for NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT91 -> 't9'? No, checking the rules... Hmm, from the given grammar, let me scan each NT rule to see which ones produce terminals or t's. For example:\n\nNT91 -> 't8' ... Wait:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8'? Or is it part of another rule? Let me search each NT...\n\nOh, wait, in the rules provided, NT91 is written as NT91 -> 't8'. So that's a terminal. Similarly:\n\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n\nSo, starting production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which would produce 't8' and 't8', making 't8 t8'. But our string starts with 't8 t5 t6...', which is different. Hmm, that's a problem. If S can only produce t8 t8, then the string can't be generated. But wait, maybe I've misread the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then the other rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and NT22 can be derived, then we might get a longer string. But wait, the initial step would be S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which would start with NT91 producing 't8' and NT22 producing a sequence. But does NT22 always produce 't8', or can it produce more? Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT22's production: NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. Then, each of those can be further broken down. Let's see what NT87 and NT98 produce.\n\nNT87 \u2192 't9' is not present. Wait, looking through all the rules, I don't see NT87 as a terminal. Let me check again. Scanning all the rules:\n\nWait, NT87 is written as NT87 -> 't9'? No, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT87->'t9' is not present. Wait, let me find:\n\nWait, checking each rule:\n\n- NT87-> 't9' is not present. Let me look:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example:\n\n- NT78 -> 't8' -- yes, there's that.\n\n- NT53 -> 't6'.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm missing some terminal rules.\n\nWait, perhaps NT87 is a non-terminal with a production, but none of the given rules have NT87 as a terminal. Let me check if I've missed it. Looking again, the provided rules don't list NT87 as a terminal. So maybe NT87 can only be expanded further.\n\nSo, if NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, and both of those need to expand further.\n\nLet's try to see if NT87 and NT98 can produce terminal strings.\n\nLooking at NT87: looking for any rule where NT87 is on the left. Hmm, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT53 -> 't6' \u2013 so maybe NT87 is derived from NT53? Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps in some other rule, like NT98. Let me check NT98.\n\nNT98 is written as NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. So NT98 expands into two non-terminals, which need to be further broken down.\n\nSo, putting this together, S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nSo, after expanding, we have 't8 NT87 NT98'.\n\nNow, NT87 needs to be expanded. Let's look at rules involving NT87.\n\nLooking through all rules, I find NT53 \u2192 't6', but that's not NT87. So, maybe NT87 is a non-terminal that requires further expansion. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules again to make it clearer.\n\nLet me list out all the NT rules and see which are terminals and which are non-terminals:\n\n1.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars use production rules to generate strings. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each rule's left-hand side must have length one, and the right-hand side can have up to two symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit complex with a lot of rules. Each non-terminal is expanded into a combination of other non-terminals and some terminals. The terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't2', 't4', etc.\n\nThe string to analyze is a sequence of these terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by following the grammar's rules.\n\nLet's start from the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string must begin with NT91 followed by NT22. Looking at the string, the first part is \"t2 t4...\", which seems a bit off because NT91 and NT22 should be starting.\n\nWait, NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals, so they will expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals. Each of these needs to derive into the corresponding terminal string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into possible expansions from the grammar.\n\nFirst, the entire string is: \"t2 t4 t4 t8 t1 t8 t3 t2 t9 t7 t8 t8 t9 t6 t4 t0 t3 t7 t8 t2 t8 t1\"\n\nLet's write this as a list for clarity:\n[ t2, t4, t4, t8, t1, t8, t3, t2, t9, t7, t8, t8, t9, t6, t4, t0, t3, t7, t8, t2, t8, t1 ]\n\nThe string is in order, so the expansion must follow this sequence.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT91 NT22, the beginning must be NT91 followed by NT22. So the first two non-terminals are NT91 and NT22, which must produce the first part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT91's production: NT91 \u2192 NT98 NT51. Hmm, wait, does that make sense? Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, I think I may have misread it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar rules:\n\nNT91: Not in the provided grammar snippet. Hmm, maybe I missed that. Wait, the user wrote the entire grammar, so perhaps the initial post is the entire set, so I need to check all of them.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, the NT rules go from NT95, NT51, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to list all NTs.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar options given, I see the non-terminals like NT95, NT51, etc. But there is no NT91 listed. That seems odd because the start symbol S produces NT91 and NT22, but if NT91 isn't defined anywhere, that might be a problem. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, are all the non-terminals listed correctly? For example, I see NT95 \u2192 't7'; but looking for NT91: I don't see a rule for NT91 except in one place: in the string representation, NT91 is present. Wait, checking the grammar: yes, the user included all the grammar rules. I don't see a rule for NT91\u2014it's only in the terminal expansion.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and NT91 isn't defined as any production, that would mean the string cannot be generated, but the user provided this as the grammar. That seems contradictory. Maybe the user made a mistake in copying the grammar.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the grammar provided. In the non-terminals, I see NT95, NT51, etc., but no NT91. Let me list all the NTs in the grammar:\n\n- NT76\n- NT68\n- NT7\n- NT12\n- NT87\n- NT51\n- NT98\n- NT0\n- NT56\n- NT2\n- NT95\n- NT50\n- NT25\n- NT31\n- NT79\n- NT56\n- NT1\n- NT54\n- NT68\n- NT15(?)\nWait, no, looking through the provided rules, I don't see NT91. So if S \u2192 NT91 NT22, but NT91 is undefined, that would mean S can't produce any string, which contradicts the presence of 't2' in the string.\n\nWait a second, this is confusing. Let me check the initial grammar rules again. The user provided the entire grammar, including:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\nNT38 \u2192 't2'\nNT6 \u2192 't5'\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\nNT26 \u2192 't7'\nNT90 \u2192 't9'\nNT8 \u2192 't5'\nNT56 \u2192 't7'\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\nNT41 \u2192 't0'\nNT25 \u2192 't6'\nNT76 \u2192 't5'\nNT96 \u2192 't6'\nNT96 \u2192 't5'\nWait, but where is NT91?\n\nWait, perhaps the NT91 is supposed to be another name. Let me see: in the provided grammar, is there any rule that I may have missed that expands to t2?\n\nLooking through the terminals, for example, NT56 \u2192 't7', NT7 \u2192 't1', etc. Wait, the initial S \u2192 NT91 NT22, but if NT91 and NT22 aren't defined, then S can't generate any string, which can't be right because the string given starts with t2.\n\nWait, maybe the initial split was incorrect. Perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, is S \u2192 NT91 NT22?\n\nYes, according to the given grammar: `S -> NT91 NT22`.\n\nWait, but looking at the provided grammar, the NT91 production isn't there. The only NT in the rules are listed with arrows pointing to combinations of other NTs and terminals, but there's no NT91 shown.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo. Because without NT91 being defined, S \u2192 NT91 NT22 cannot be used to produce any string that includes t2, as NT91 would have to expand to a terminal and a non-terminal, but if it doesn't exist, the grammar is invalid.\n\nWait, this is a problem. If NT91 is not defined, the grammar is incomplete, meaning it can't generate any strings, which contradicts the presence of a string to analyze. Therefore, it's impossible for the given grammar to generate the string \"t2...\", as the grammar isn't fully specified.\n\nWait, but maybe the user meant that NT91 is part of the grammar and I just missed it. Let me search again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the lines are in the form of NTx \u2192 something. So, in the provided rules, we have:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\n...\n- NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\n...\n- NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\n- NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n- NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n- NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\n- NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n- NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\n- NT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26\n- NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\n- NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT38 \u2192 't2'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- etc.\n\nWait, I see multiple NT definitions that end in terminals, like NT95 \u2192 't7', NT38 \u2192 't2', etc. So it's possible that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, but for S \u2192 NT91 NT22, we need to see if NT91 and NT22 have such productions.\n\nBut in the list provided, I don't see any rules for NT91 or NT22.

{"custom_id":"request-403","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given grammar generates the string `t4 t6 t5 t8 t7 t3 t3 t7 t7 t9 t2 t9 t4 t2 t4 t7 t2 t8 t3 t7 t1 t8 t6`. Since I'm a bit new to this, I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The goal is to parse the string by expanding the start symbol S and checking if it can derive the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT91 NT22. So the first step is to see if the string starts with the concatenation of derivations of NT91 and NT22.\n\nThe string starts with `t4 t6`. So the first part after S is NT91, which should be a sequence of terminals, and NT22 should also be a sequence. Let's split the string into two parts: the first part must match NT91, and the second part must match NT22.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. NT91 is derived from NT91 and what? Let me check the productions:\n\nNT91 -> NT73 NT78.\n\nSo NT91 breaks down into NT73 and NT78. Each of these is another production. Let's see:\n\nNT73 can be NT73 or NT76. Actually, looking back, I see:\nNT73 -> NT73 NT78, according to one line, and also NT73 -> NT69 NT96 in another. So it's more like recursive.\n\nBut that's getting complicated. Maybe instead of working backward, I should try to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help. The string has 21 terminals, so each step in the derivation would split into two parts, leading to a binary tree of height log2(21), which is roughly 5 levels.\n\nBut given that, let me try to analyze the productions for NT91 and NT22, and see how they can produce parts of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the start symbol's productions:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the entire string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT91 and NT22.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the string, from the start, should be the derivation of NT91, and the rest should be the derivation of NT22.\n\nBut the string is a linear sequence, so perhaps I can split it into two parts: one part that matches NT91's expansion and the remaining part that matches NT22.\n\nSo first, let's consider NT91.\n\nLooking at NT91: It can be derived into NT73 and NT78.\n\nSo nt91 is NT73 NT78.\n\nNow, look at NT73. Its production can be either NT73 NT78 or NT69 NT96.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT73 -> NT69 NT96 (from the line \"NT73 -> NT69 NT96\").\n\nSo if NT73 is replaced, it becomes NT69 NT96.\n\nThen, NT69 can be nt6 is 't1'? Wait no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, I'm confused about the terminals. Wait, no\u2014actually, some NT symbols are terminals, but in the given grammar, it looks like many NT symbols have to be further split into more symbols until they become terminals with 't' followed by a digit.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Upon closer inspection, the productions have NTs splitting into other NTs and some that directly produce terminal symbols, like 't6', 't5', etc.\n\nSo for example, NT68 -> NT6 NT41, and NT6 -> 't5', NT41 -> 't0', so NT68 when resolved gives 't5 t0'.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 is 't8'.\n\nSo, for example, NT22 is directly a terminal t8.\n\nWait, no\u2014NT22 -> NT25 NT31, and then in another production, NT25 is NT45 NT50, etc. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, the NT22 production is only \"NT22 -> NT87 NT98\", so it's not directly a terminal. Wait, but I'm looking for the lines where NT22 directly produces a terminal. Wait, no, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking at the lines provided, I see NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So it's another NT production. Then, looking further:\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1.\n\nNT1 is a terminal? Wait, looking for 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, there's a NT56 -> 't7', but I'm looking for NT22 here.\n\nWait, no. Let me look for any NT that directly produce a terminal symbol. For example, NT68 -> 't5' and 't0', and also NT22 is derived into NT87 NT98, but none of those directly expand into terminals. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87.\n\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\n- NT53 -> 't6'.\n\nWait, that's right! So NT53 is a terminal.\n\nBut how does NT22 fit into this? NT22 is derived into NT87 NT98. Then, NT87 is NT95 and NT53.\n\nNT95 is NT13 and NT1.\n\nSo to resolve, we have to see if any of these NTs can produce terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT95 -> NT13 and NT1. So, if NT13 is a terminal or another NT.\n\nLooking back, I see NT26 -> 't7' (one line), and NT76 -> 't5'\u2014so those are terminals. Similarly, NT90 -> 't0', NT56 -> 't7', NT12 -> 't1', etc.\n\nSo, the process is to find the terminal symbols in these productions.\n\nSo, let's take the string given and try to see how it can be broken down.\n\nThe string is: t4 t6 t5 t8 t7 t3 t3 t7 t7 t9 t2 t9 t4 t2 t4 t7 t2 t8 t3 t7 t1 t8 t6.\n\nBut wait, count the number of elements. Wait, that's 21 elements, but I think I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nt4 t6 t5 t8 t7 t3 t3 t7 t7 t9 t2 t9 t4 t2 t4 t7 t2 t8 t3 t7 t1 t8 t6.\n\nThat's 23 elements. Hmm, so the string is 23 tokens.\n\nNow, the grammar is in CNF, which is a binary grammar, so each step in the derivation splits into two parts, resulting in the total number of symbols being 2^n where n is the number of steps after the initial. But since the grammar allows for more than one token in the initial split, perhaps this isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the longest possible derivation, building the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using CYK algorithm for parsing.\n\nBut since I'm just trying to figure it out manually, perhaps I can try to map the string back to the grammar.\n\nLet me start by considering the start symbol S: S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the entire string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT91 and NT22.\n\nFirst, let's figure out what the concatenation would look like.\n\nSo, NT91 -> NT73 NT78, and NT73 -> NT69 NT96, and NT78 can be NT69 NT96 or NT95 NT53.\n\nWait, let me get the derivations right.\n\nWait, it's better to parse the string, assuming that S can generate it.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT91 NT22. So the entire string should be a combination of two parts derived from NT91 and NT22.\n\nBut looking at the string, perhaps I can split it into two halves. But since S could produce NT91 and NT22, which themselves may generate more NTs, it's not necessarily in the middle.

{"custom_id":"request-404","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and each symbol seems to represent a terminal or non-terminal in the grammar. My goal is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules provided.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's given in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, except for the start symbol S, which becomes two non-terminals. Let me list out the productions to see the relationships:\n\n- S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n- NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n- NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n- NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n- NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12 (this looks like a left recursion, but in CNF, it's allowed as long as it's not recursive in a way that can't be resolved, but maybe I should handle it differently or look for leftmost derivations)\n- NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n- NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n- NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\n- NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\n- NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\n- NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\n- NT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n- NT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31\n- NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\n- NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95 (this seems like another left recursion, maybe I need to handle that)\n- NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\n- NT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31 (duplicate from earlier)\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26 (another left recursion here)\n- NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\n- NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT38 \u2192 't2'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5'\n- More productions follow, some with 't' symbols which are terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, some are problematic. For example, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, but then NT26 can go to NT90 NT79, which goes to NT51 NT76 again. This seems circular. Also, NT56 is defined as NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78, but also NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95, which is another left recursion. The same with NT12, which has NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12, another left recursion. So, I need to handle these carefully.\n\nThe string to check is: `t2 t5 t4 t3 t7 t1 t3 t0 t7 t9 t7 t2 t5 t4 t2 t5 t2 t6 t2 t1 t3 t8 t3`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string has several 't' symbols, which are terminals defined in the grammar. Each 't' corresponds to a specific production. For example, 't2' is defined as NT6, 't5' as NT26, 't4' as NT8, etc.\n\nTo validate the string, I'll attempt to construct a derivation starting from S and see if I can obtain the string. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm or parse trees, but given the complexity, perhaps a step-by-step approach would be more manageable.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by breaking it down into possible non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols at a time, so each step of the derivation will take symbols two at a time. This might resemble a parse where each step combines two symbols into a non-terminal.\n\nLet me list out the entire string as a list for easier processing. The string is:\n['t2', 't5', 't4', 't3', 't7', 't1', 't3', 't0', 't7', 't9', 't7', 't2', 't5', 't4', 't2', 't5', 't2', 't6', 't2', 't1', 't3', 't8', 't3']\n\nI need to check if this can be derived from S.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the initial derivation starts with NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me break down each part step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nNow, I need to see what NT91 and NT22 derive into. Let's process NT91 and NT22 one by one.\n\nLooking at NT91:\nFrom the productions, NT91 \u2192 NT79 NT51 (I think, but let me check. Wait, the productions listed include NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1, NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69, etc. For NT91, in the given production list, I don't see an explicit NT91 production. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan the list:\n\nLooking through the productions... I see NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1, and NT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56, etc. Wait, I'm not seeing a direct production for NT91. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake. Let me check again. Oh wait, NT91 is produced in the list as 't8', so NT91 \u2192 't8'? Or wait, looking back: in the list, 't8' corresponds to NT91? Let me see: the grammar productions include NT73 \u2192 t6, NT7 \u2192 t1. Looking in the list, 't8' is defined as NT91 \u2192 't8'? Or is that a mistake. Wait, under the productions:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t6\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT12 \u2192 t1\n- NT38 \u2192 t2\n- NT6 \u2192 t5\n- So, I think 't8' is defined as NT91 \u2192 t8, because in the string, the first symbol is t2, which is NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify:\n\nLooking at the productions, for the terminals:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t6\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT12 \u2192 t1\n- NT38 \u2192 t2\n- NT6 \u2192 t5\n- So, 't8' must come from some NT production.\n\nWait, in the list, I don't see NT8 defined directly. Hmm, maybe it's a longer path. For example, NT8 may be defined via another production. Alternatively, perhaps 't8' is not a terminal but a non-terminal with a production that ends in a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some of the productions end with a terminal or multiple terminals. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. So, to see what NT95 produces, I need to see the productions of NT13 and NT1.\n\nThis might get complex, so perhaps I should build a parse tree backwards starting from the string to see if all symbols can be reduced to the non-terminals as per the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider each symbol in the string and check against the possible derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that in CNF, each symbol in the string (except the start symbol) must be connected by productions, and the length of the string is a power of two because each production splits into two. The string has 24 symbols, which is not a power of two (since 2^4=16, 2^5=32), so that implies that the string length does not fit, making it impossible to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, that's a good point. The length of the string must be 2^n because each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols. So, for a string of length 24, which is not a power of two (16 is 2^4, 32 is 2^5), it would not be possible to derive it because the derivation process would require the length to be a power of two.\n\nLet me verify this. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Wait, no, actually in CNF, the start symbol can also be A \u2192 BC or a single terminal, but all other productions are non-terminals.\n\nWait, the given grammar indeed starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which is a non-terminal to two non-terminals. The other productions are mostly non-terminals being split into two non-terminals, except for cases where terminals are involved.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, besides S, many"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

So NT6 branches into 't5' and 't8'.)\n\nWait, let me go through each production step by step to see how the terminals in the string can be constructed.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't's and numbers, and the grammar converts non-terminals into terminal symbols. So the process is starting from S and deriving the string.\n\nThe given string has 24 symbols, which is a lot. But maybe I can break it down by working backwards from the string towards the start symbol S. Alternatively, I'll try to construct the string step by step using the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a bottom-up approach, starting from the given string and trying to reduce it using the inverse of the production rules until I reach S.\n\nEach production is a rule where a non-terminal can be replaced by two non-terminals. So to reduce, each step would involve combining two symbols into one non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the given string as a list for easier manipulation:\n\nt5 t0 t3 t8 t8 t5 t1 t7 t2 t2 t6 t2 t4 t6 t9 t0 t3 t5 t7 t5 t2 t1 t7 t8\n\nI'll number them as positions 1 to 24 for clarity.\n\nNow, the starting point is to see if the entire string can be represented by S, which is defined as:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nSo, S produces two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. Each of these non-terminals can further split into other non-terminals, and so on, until we bottom out in terminal symbols.\n\nI think the best approach is to see if the string matches the structure starting from S. So S needs to split into two sequences:\n\nFirst part: NT91 -> (some sequence of non-terminals and terminals)\nSecond part: NT22 -> (another sequence of non-terminals and terminals)\n\nThen, each of these sequences must generate the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the production rules, let's see which non-terminals expand into 't5' or other terminal symbols.\n\nFrom the grammar, I can find that:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't7'\n- NT76 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5' (twice)\n- NT6 also can expand to other non-terminals like NT73 and NT76?\nWait, actually looking at the provided rules, NT6 is defined as:\n\nLooking back:\n\n\"NT6 -> 't5'\" and \"NT6 -> 't8'\". So NT6 can produce 't5' or 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, NT79 can produce 't3', which is in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, starting with t5, which can come from NT6 (t5 or t8). But after that, the next is t0, which comes from which production?\n\nLooking for NT that produce 't0':\n\nFrom the rules, NT50 -> 't0' and NT26 -> 't7' but not directly. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12 and then in another rule it is NT12 -> NT26. Hmm, this might get complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from the given string and trying to reduce it step by step.\n\nThe idea is to combine symbols according to the inverse of the production rules. \n\nThe last symbol in the string is t8. Let's see where that can come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NT produces t8:\n\nLooking at the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT76 \u2192 't5' and 't6'? Or wait, let me list all rules that produce 't's and numbers.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT1: Not present.\n\nLooking specifically for 't8' production:\n\nI see NT76 \u2192 't5' and 't8'?\n\nWait, wait, in the provided rules, NT76 is defined as:\n\n\"NT76 -> NT69 NT26\"\n\nHmm, but looking for 't8's:\n\nLooking at each production, 't8's are probably from NT76 \u2192 't5' and 't8'?\n\nWait, but in the given rules, NT76 is NT69 NT26, which are both non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminals directly expanding to 't8's. So perhaps 't8's come from NT76, which is defined as NT69 NT26.\n\nBut NT69 and NT26, are they terminals? \n\nLooking at the rules, I see \"NT69 -> 't3'\", so NT69 produces 't3'.\n\nFor NT26: There are multiple rules for NT26:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n- NT26 \u2192 NT79 NT6\n- NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT6\n- NT26 \u2192 other possibilities?\n\nWait, looking for NT26 expansions leading to t's. From the provided rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't7' (several rules? Let me check the list. Yes, multiple rules where NT26 leads to different combinations, but when they are terminals, like in \"NT26 \u2192 NT76 NT90\" but that's not a terminal. Alternatively, some rules like \"NT26 \u2192 't7' \"? No, wait, the rules for NT26 are:\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT79 NT6\nNT26 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n\nNo, those don't result in terminals. Wait, looking deeper, in the given rules, I see:\n\n\"NT26 -> 't7'\", \"NT90 -> 't0'\", \"NT6 -> 't5'\", \"NT6 -> 't8'\". Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-express the rules correctly:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for NT26: \n\nI see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT76 NT22\nWait, no, looking through the rules again, perhaps I missed it. Let me recount the rules provided:\n\nThe list of rules is extensive, but here's what I have:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT22 -> 't8'\nNT38 -> 't6'\nNT50 -> 't9'\nNT68 -> 't25' (Wait, no, looking at the given rules, I think I'm getting mixed up. Maybe I should list the rules systematically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to see which parts of the string can form the two non-terminals from S: NT91 and NT22.\n\nSince S is NT91 NT22, the first part of the string should come from NT91, and the second from NT22.\n\nSo, the string starts with t5, which likely comes from NT91. Let's see if NT91 can produce 't5'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nI don't see a direct production for NT91 to terminals except possibly via other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, the first few lines mention NT91 -> NT69 NT1.\n\nLooking at that: NT91 \u2192 NT69 NT1.\n\nThen, NT69 is another non-terminal. NT69's rules are:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't3'\n- NT69 \u2192 something else? Let me confirm.\n\nFrom the provided rules: Yes, \"NT69 -> 't3'\". So, NT69 can produce 't3'.\n\nThen, NT1: Let me check NT1's rules. Looking through, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26\nNT41 \u2192 't0'\nWait, looking at the rules, NT41 is defined as \"NT41 -> NT9 NT51\". Wait, no, let me check.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n\"NT41 -> NT9 NT51\"\n\nWait, no, I see:\n\n\"NT51 -> NT51 NT68\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

{"custom_id":"request-447","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t4 t9 t8 t9 t2 t9 t0 t5 t1 t6 t3 t8 t2 t6 t4 t5 t2 t8 t1 t2 t4 t8 t5 t5 t7`. Hmm, that's a long string, but since it's made up of tokens separated by spaces, I guess I just need to process each token in order.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar and see how the string could be built. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the entire string should be derived from expanding S into NT91 and NT22, each of which are non-terminals that eventually produce terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at NT91, it's NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, then NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41, and so on. This seems complex, so maybe I should think about possible derivations or look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to parse the string using the given productions. Each production in the grammar either splits into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal. For example, NT95 can go directly to 't7'. Wait, but in my string, I have 't7' at the end. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the end of the string is ...t5 t5 t7. So I have 't7' towards the end. Let me see which non-terminals can produce 't7'. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT73 can go to 't7', as seen in NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, where NT26 can go to 't5' or other things. Wait, in the productions, I see NT73 \u2192 't6' and 't7'. Hmm, correction: actually, looking back, the given productions don't include NT73 directly, but let's check.\n\nWait, checking the grammar: NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, and NT69 \u2192 't3', so NT76 would produce 't3' followed by NT26. NT26 can go to 't5' sometimes. But does any node produce 't7'?\n\nYes, in the production NT73 \u2192 't7'. So if somewhere, we have NT73, that can produce 't7'. Wait, looking through the productions, yes: NT73 \u2192 't6' and NT73 \u2192 't7'.\n\nWait, actually looking back, in the listed rules, I see NT73 \u2192 't7' and others. So perhaps there's a way to get 't7' in the string.\n\nBut to be honest, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to take the string and try to break it down step by step, looking for possible expansions.\n\nThe string is: t4 t9 t8 t9 t2 t9 t0 t5 t1 t6 t3 t8 t2 t6 t4 t5 t2 t8 t1 t2 t4 t8 t5 t5 t7.\n\nThat's 27 tokens. Let's see if it can be split into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, starting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the entire string should be the concatenation of what NT91 produces and what NT22 produces.\n\nSo let's try to split the string into two parts at some point. Since NT91 and NT22 both start with N, perhaps looking for where they could split.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at NT91: it's NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. So the string would start with NT76, which becomes NT69 and NT26.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 is another non-terminal. Let's see what NT22 can produce. Looking at the rules, NT22 \u2192 NT69 NT26. Hmm, same as NT76? Or perhaps other possibilities.\n\nWait, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each rule is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. So for each non-terminal, it's either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S, it splits into NT91 and NT22. Then, each of those can either split or produce a terminal.\n\nFirst, NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT98. So the next step after S would be NT76 (from NT91) and NT98 (from NT22).\n\nWait, no. NT91 is divided into NT76 and NT22. Because NT76 is part of the production for NT91, which is NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, and NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me outline the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT91: NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, then NT91 is NT76 \u2192 ... So NT91 is split into NT76 and NT98? No, NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT98. So after NT91, it becomes NT76 and NT98.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT76 NT98.\n\nSo S becomes NT76 NT98 NT22.\n\nThen, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26.\n\nSo S becomes NT69 NT26 NT98 NT22.\n\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. Then, S becomes NT69 NT26 NT90 NT87 NT22.\n\nWait, this is getting too fragmented. Maybe it's better to think about the entire string as a concatenation of the expansions, but trying to see if it can be split into paths that each non-terminal can produce.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string as a list: [t4, t9, t8, t9, t2, t9, t0, t5, t1, t6, t3, t8, t2, t6, t4, t5, t2, t8, t1, t2, t4, t8, t5, t5, t7].\n\nLet me see if there's a way to split this into parts that each non-terminal can produce.\n\nFirst, S is split into NT91 and NT22. So the string should be the concatenation of what NT91 produces and NT22 produces.\n\nSimilarly, NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT98, so the part from NT91 should split into NT76 NT98. Each of these can produce a sequence.\n\nWait, but NT76 is further split into NT69 NT26, then each of these split further until terminals.\n\nThis approach might take a long time. Maybe I can look for tokens that are only produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some tokens can only be produced by certain non-terminals. For example, 't7' can only be produced by NT73, as per the rules. Similarly, 't4' can be produced by NT91 (which can lead to 't4') or maybe other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a parsing tree or at least see if the string can be broken down correctly.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step of the parsing process produces two symbols at a time. So for a string of length n, the parse tree would require certain numbers of steps.\n\nLet's count the tokens. The string has 27 tokens. So the parse would involve splits that eventually produce the 27 tokens.\n\nBut 27 is an odd number. Wait, each production either keeps the number of non-terminals the same or increases them by one. Wait, no. Each A \u2192 BC increases the count by one non-terminal, but then B and C can themselves split into more.\n\nBut eventually, each non-terminal expansion leads to a certain number of terminals. The total number of terminals produced depends on the structure.\n\nWait, let me see an example. Take S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So in the first step, S is split into two.\n\nThen, each of NT91 and NT22 will be split into their components, so four non-terminals.\n\nEach of these non-terminals may split further until they produce terminals.\n\nSo the number of terminals depends on the derivation.\n\nBut regardless, the total number of terminals must match. The given string has 27 tokens, so the number of terminals must be 27.\n\nI don't think that's an issue. The key is to see if the order and structure match any possible derivation.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe I can see which tokens can only be produced by certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, 't7' can only be produced by NT73. Because in the grammar, only NT73 \u2192 't7'. So if the string ends with 't7', as it does, then somewhere in the derivation, NT73 must have been used.\n\nLooking back, in the given grammar, NT73 is defined as 't6' and 't7'. So the only way to get 't7' is through NT73"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-449","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the right. But wait, looking at the grammar, all the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which fits CNF.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: \"t5 t3 t2 t1 t6 t9 t1 t1 t0 t3 t8 t7 t0 t1 t9 t3 t3 t4 t7 t9 t7 t8 t0 t7 t5\". So the question is whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nChomsky Normal Form production rules look like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So for a string to be generated, the number of symbols (both non-terminals and terminals) should increase at each step. For a string of length n, the derivation tree should have a certain structure, but I might not need to build that.\n\nWait, but the string is given as a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if it can be built from S through the productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to use a parsing method, like theCYK algorithm, but since the string is manageable, maybe a top-down approach with backtracking could work. Alternatively, I can try to group the string into the productions in reverse.\n\nAnother idea is to work backwards. Starting from the rightmost terminal and see if it can be matched by any production, then move left, etc. Let's try that.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t3 t2 t1 t6 t9 t1 t1 t0 t3 t8 t7 t0 t1 t9 t3 t3 t4 t7 t9 t7 t8 t0 t7 t5.\n\nLet me write it down without spaces: t5 t3 t2 t1 t6 t9 t1 t1 t0 t3 t8 t7 t0 t1 t9 t3 t3 t4 t7 t9 t7 t8 t0 t7 t5.

Hmm. Since S \u2192 NT91 NT22, the initial derivation would expand S into two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22.

The string is `t4 t7 t7 t6 t8 t1 t2 t7 t4 t8 t4 t2 t8 t8 t2 t7 t8 t7 t0 t5 t8 t5 t7 t9 t1 t4`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has a specific structure where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit CNF except for the productions like NT6 \u2192 't8' and NT41 \u2192 't0', which are terminals. So each non-terminal can only produce one node, either a term or another non-terminal.\n\nTo parse the string, I should check if it can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. The strategy is likely to use a recursive descent parser or a top-down approach. But maybe a better way is to trace the derivation step by step.\n\nThe initial step is S \u2192 NT91 NT22.

So NT91 and NT22 should each derive some sequence of terminals matching the string in order.\n\nLet's break the string into two parts: the first part should come from NT91, and the second part from NT22.\n\nBut NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So we can split NT22 into NT87 and NT98.\n\nSo now, the full breakdown would be:\n\nFirst 2 symbols: t4 t7. We expect NT91 to produce t4, and then NT22 to produce t7, but wait, NT22 might produce more tokens. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the string is t4 (from NT91), t7 (from NT22's first symbol), but wait, NT91 is S's first non-terminal, and NT22 is the second. So the first two symbols might be from NT91 and NT22's first symbols.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So when S is being derived, NT91 produces some string and NT22 produces another string, and together they form the entire string.\n\nBut in this case, the string length is 27 tokens. Each production in the grammar either produces a terminal or combines two non-terminals. So perhaps each non-terminal in the grammar can only contribute one terminal or further split into more non-terminals.\n\nI think the key here is to split the string into the parts produced by each non-terminal in the grammar. Starting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT91's derivation and NT22's derivation.\n\nSo the entire string must be splittable into two parts, the first derived from NT91 and the second from NT22.\n\nSo let's see. Let's try to find where NT91 could end. Looking at the production for NT91: Wait, actually, looking back, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, but from the provided grammar, I don't see any further productions for NT91 beyond that. Checking the given grammar, all the NTs have productions like NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, NT95 \u2192 't7', etc. Wait, does NT91 have any more children? It seems that S \u2192 NT91 NT22, but NT91 doesn't split further, as in the provided grammar, I don't see any production that takes NT91 further. Wait, that might be a problem because S is supposed to split into NT91 and NT22, which then each might split into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, there's no production for NT91 beyond S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So that suggests that NT91 is a single terminal? Or is it a non-terminal that can split into something else? Hmm.

That seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check the initial lines again. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then there are several other NT productions.

{"custom_id":"request-468","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the string `t3 t3 t3 t8 t2 t0 t4 t7 t5 t5 t1 t7 t5 t2 t9 t9 t7 t0 t9 t5 t2 t9 t6 t5 t9 t4 t8` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but let me try breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what context-free grammars are and how Chomsky normal form (CNF) works. In CNF, every production is left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that it's mostly in the form of two non-terminals producing two others, but some are also producing terminals directly or via other structures. For example, `NT96 -> t6` is a terminal, which I can use as a marker that this is part of the string.\n\nMy goal is to parse the given string using this grammar. Parsing can be done using a top-down or bottom-up approach, but since the problem is to determine if the string is generated, I might need to see if the grammar can derive the string by some sequence of steps.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, with many non-terminals, this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to construct a parse tree for the string and see if it conforms to any of the production rules.\n\nLet me list the string again to see the sequence: t3 t3 t8 t2 t0 t4 t7 t5 t5 t1 t7 t5 t2 t9 t9 t7 t0 t9 t5 t2 t9 t6 t5 t9 t4 t8.\n\nThat's quite long, 27 tokens. The string is entirely made up of terminals, so each symbol in the string must correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, it's recursive, so perhaps the string can be broken down into phrases that correspond to each production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be viewed as a series of nested productions. But with such a long string, it's impractical to do this manually without a specific strategy.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production in the grammar can generate either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, to generate a string, each non-terminal must expand into the terminals and other non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can note which non-terminals produce which terminals directly. Looking through the given productions:\n\n- NT96 -> t6\n- NT7 -> NT69 NT96 (and 96 is t6, so NT7 can generate t96 plus whatever NT69 can do)\n- NT79 -> NT51 NT76\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68 or NT51 NT6 (wait, looking back, NT51's productions are: NT51 -> NT51 NT68 and NT51 -> NT69 NT96. So NT51 can produce sequences involving NT68 and 96, which are t6 and t6 respectively.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Looking at the given productions:\n\nNT51's productions are:\n\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68\n- NT51 -> NT69 NT96\n\nSo, NT51 can either produce two NT51s (which would allow for recursion) or an NT69 and a NT96. NT96 is t6, and NT69 is another non-terminal.\n\nGoing further, NT69 can produce NT68 or NT26.\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nI think the first step is to analyze the string and see if it can be broken into segments that match the productions. Alternatively, maybe I can see which parts correspond to certain non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to identify what possible strings each non-terminal can generate. For example:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals directly, which could be the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nLet's list which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT96 -> t6\n- NT38 -> t2\n- NT56 -> t7\n- NT95 -> 't1' (Note: No, looking again, NT95 is NT13 NT1, so it can't produce a terminal directly. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, for NT95, it's `NT13 NT1`. So it's a production of two non-terminals, so it doesn't produce a terminal itself. Therefore, each terminal in the string has to be produced by some non-terminal through their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: each terminal token in the string must be the result of a production that eventually reduces to that terminal.\n\nFor example, in the given string, the first token is t3, which is a terminal. So I need to find a production chain for NT(s) that can produce t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t3? Scanning through the productions, for example:\n\n- NT73 -> t6 or t7\nWait no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar has 'NT73 -> t6' or 't7'? Let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar includes:\n\n- NT73 -> t6\n- NT50 -> NT2 NT69\nWait, no, wait the given productions include several for NT73, but actually in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the given production rules:\n\nNT73 has a production `NT73 -> t6`, but not `t7`. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, checking the provided grammar:\n\nWait, after looking through all the Productions:\n\nYes, I see `NT73 -> t6` but not `t7`. Wait, let me look back:\n\nHere are some of the productions:\n\nWait, searching for NT73:\n\nThe user provided a long list, but the critical ones are:\n\nWait, under NT73 -> t6 and another production that includes NT73? Or perhaps other symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find all the productions that result in a specific terminal.\n\nLet me try to find which non-terminals produce t3, t8, etc.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for each terminal in the string:\n\nt3, t3, t8, t2, t0, t4, t7, t5, t5, t1, t7, t5, t2, t9, t9, t7, t0, t9, t5, t2, t9, t6, t5, t9, t4, t8.\n\nSo terminals: t3, t8, t2, t0, t4, t7, t5, t1, t6, t9.\n\nWait, let me check which non-terminals produce these. For example:\n\n- t3: Looking through the productions, I see that NT73 -> t6, but I don't see a production that directly yields t3. Alternatively, maybe through longer productions. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT73 and NT35 or something that can produce t3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-terminal NT73 can produce t3. Wait, checking the production rules:\n\nWait, I think in the provided grammar, NT73 is defined as `NT73 -> t6` or `t7`? Let's go back and check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT73 -> t6\n- NT73 -> t7\n\nWait yes, that is correct. So NT73 can produce either t6 or t7.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t3:\n\nLooking for a production in the grammar that produces t3. I see NT35 or some NT that can produce t3.\n\nWait, but in the provided productions, I don't immediately see any NT that produces t3. Hmm. Perhaps I'm missing it, but looking through, I don't see any NT that directly produces t3.\n\nWait, so does any non-terminal produce t3? Or is it a leaf node? Because if no non-terminal can produce t3, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut let me check the grammar to see if any non-terminal can produce t3.\n\nLooking at the productions one by one:\n\nNT73 -> t6 or t7: so that's t6 or t7.\n\nWhat about NT61? Wait, looking through, I don't see NT61; perhaps I should make a list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a t3 that cannot be derived from any non-terminal, which would mean it's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me search the production rules for any where a terminal t3 is produced.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking for t3 in any production:\n\n- NT31 -> NT54 NT31 (but that's producing NT, not t)\n- NT73 -> t6 or t7\nWait, no NT that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, it's structured in a way that each step of the derivation produces exactly two symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t9 t6 t8 t5 t9 t9 t2 t8 t1 t7 t0 t5 t7 t7 t9 t2 t7 t0 t1 t3 t7 t2 t2 t3 t4 t0 t2.\n\nFirst, I'll note the structure.

For example, NT22 has two rules: NT87 NT98 and another for NT22 itself, which is redundant. Similarly, NT56 appears to have multiple rules.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended some rules to be in CNF. So, I need to see if each rule produces exactly two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT95 -> 't7' is a rule, which is a terminal, so that's fine. Similarly, some rules like NT22 -> NT87 NT98 split into two non-terminals. So, each step can reduce two non-terminals into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string given has 27 tokens (let me count: t9, t6, t8, t5, t9, t9, t2, t8, t1, t7, t0, t5, t7, t7, t9, t2, t7, t0, t1, t3, t7, t2, t2, t3, t4, t0, t2). So 27 symbols. If S produces NT91 and NT22, each of which starts a derivation, and each of those may produce a certain number of symbols.\n\nIn CNF, the number of symbols in a derived string must be 2^n, where n is the number of derivation levels beyond the start symbol. But in this case, the string has 27 symbols, which is not of the form 2^n -1, because 2^5 -1=31, 2^4 -1=15, 2^5=32, so 27 isn't matching either. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, the start symbol S -> NT91 NT22. Each of these can produce a certain number of symbols. So, NT91 and NT22 each may produce some string of symbols. Let me try to see what the possible derivations are.\n\nFirst, NT91: The rule for NT91 isn't directly given, but looking through the rules, I see NT76 -> NT69 NT26, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the rules are written as NTxy, but not all have the same structure. For example, some are split into terminals, others into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a parse tree step by step to see if the given string can be derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to check if the string can be reduced using the grammar rules. Starting from the full string and trying to match any rule in reverse.\n\nEach non-terminal rule can be matched as a sequence of two symbols. So, for example, if the string starts with two symbols that match any non-terminal's production, that non-terminal can be replaced, and the process continues.\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nThe string starts with t9 t6 t8 t5 t9 t9 t2 t8 t1 t7 t0 t5 t7 t7 t9 t2 t7 t0 t1 t3 t7 t2 t2 t3 t4 t0 t2.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which expands to NT91 NT22. So, I need the first two tokens to correspond to a production of NT91 and then NT22.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT91 has a production NT91 -> ...? Hmm, looking back at the rules, I don't see an NT91 directly. Wait, in the rules, some end with 't' symbols, like NT31 -> NT54 NT31, but others don't. Wait, perhaps I need to list all the non-terminal rules properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rules. Let me go through all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nList of NTs:\n\nNT91: Does it have any production? Looking through the rules, I think NT91 isn't directly a non-terminal; perhaps it was a typo, and the correct rule is elsewhere. Wait, no, in the provided rules, I see NT1 -> NT97 NT41, but I don't see an NT91 as a non-terminal. Wait, maybe it's a typo, and it should be NTT91 or something else.

{"custom_id":"request-486","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single terminal symbol. That should make parsing a bit easier.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It has several non-terminal symbols like S, NT22, NT23 (I think they used NT sometimes and others like NT76, NT87, etc.), and each can produce other combinations until they reach terminals like 't5', 't9', etc. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t5 t9 t3 t7 t7 t0 t9 t9 t6 t7 t1 t7 t7 t6 t2 t9 t1 t3 t8 t3 t1 t6 t7 t6 t9 t5 t1.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The grammar starts with S -> NT91 NT22. So S must expand into two parts, each of which will likely expand further until they reach the terminals. So the string should have a length that's twice the number of steps, but I think it's more complicated because each non-terminal can produce multiple symbols.\n\nLooking at S, it's NT91 followed by NT22. So I need to find the derivations of NT91 and NT22. Let me check NT91 first. The rules for NT91: NT91 -> NT68 NT6. NT6 is a terminal, but NT68 can be further expanded. NT68 -> NT6 NT41. Both NT6 and NT41 can be expanded more. NT6 can go to 't5', and NT41 can go to 't0'. So NT68 would be 't5' 't0' (t5t0t5 perhaps? Wait, no: NT68 is NT6 NT41. So NT6 is t5 and NT41 is t0. So NT68 is t5 t0?\n\nWait, no. NT68 is a single symbol: NT6 NT41. So when expanded, it becomes 't5' 't0', making 't5t0'. Then NT91 is NT68 NT6 -> (t5 t0) followed by 't5', so t5 t0 t5.\n\nNow looking at NT22: NT22 -> NT87 NT98. NT87 is NT95 NT53. Let's see. NT95 is a terminal 't1'. NT53 is another non-terminal.

Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT76, NT68, NT7, NT68, NT7, NT12, etc. Wait, there's NT56: NT56 -> NT55 NT78. NT55 isn't in the rules, but wait, I think I might have misread. Let me check all the NT rules.\n\nWait, for NT53, looking at the provided rules, I don't see any production for NT53.

There are two rules for NT96: one says NT96 -> 't6' and another says NT96 -> 't5'. That must be a mistake. Because in a proper grammar, each non-terminal should have a unique expansion. Or perhaps one of them is redundant. Let me see: perhaps the second one overrides the first, or maybe it's a mistake. Let's check which is correct. Wait, no, both can't be correct because that would mean NT96 could be either t6 or t5, which is a problem. So perhaps it's a typo.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT96 has two rules:\n\nNT96 -> 't6'\n\nNT96 -> 't5'\n\nHmm, that's probably an error in the problem statement. It can't be both. So maybe I should pick one. Alternatively, perhaps one of them is supposed to be a different terminal, but in the given string, there's a t6 and t5. Let me keep that in mind.\n\nNow, back to NT91: NT68 NT6. NT68 expands to 't5' 't0' as per earlier. NT6 is 't5'. So NT91 is 't5 t0' 't5' \u2192 t5t0t5.\n\nNow, NT22: NT87 NT98. NT87 is NT95 NT53. NT95 is 't1', and NT53... oh wait, earlier I thought there was no rule for NT53. But perhaps NT53 is a terminal? Or perhaps it's another non-terminal. Wait, checking the rules, I see NT53 isn't present as a left-hand side of any production. So perhaps NT53 is a terminal? But in the string, there's no 't3', but the string has t3 twice. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me double-check: in the rules, looking for NT53. I don't see any NT53 rule. So maybe that's a typo, and it's supposed to be another rule. Or perhaps NT53 is a terminal, but that's not matching the string. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and NT53 is supposed to be something else. Wait, perhaps in the rules, NT53 is missing, which is an error. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and the rule is supposed to be something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT53 is supposed to refer to NT56, but in the rules, NT56 has two possibilities: one is 't7', and another is NT55 NT78. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that NT53 is actually a typo, and it should be NT55 or NT56. For example, maybe NT53 should be NT55. Let me see.\n\nLooking further, I see NT55 isn't in the rules, so perhaps that's another typo. Or perhaps NT53 is a terminal, but that seems unlikely given the string doesn't have 't3' except maybe through another path.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I missed NT53.

{"custom_id":"request-507","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, and the grammar consists of a bunch of non-terminals that eventually resolve into these terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all the productions fit this form. For example, S -> NT91 NT22, which is of the form A->BC, and NT98 -> 't5', which is A->a.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t1 t8 t7 t6 t4 t6 t1 t9 t6 t4 t7 t9 t5 t6 t1 t1 t1 t6 t5 t7 t8 t6 t5 t7 t4 t9 t9 t1`. \n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which must be the result of expanding the non-terminals in the grammar. The challenge is to see if these terminals can be derived in some order from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts with NT91 and NT22. Each of these NTs then splits into other NTs or terminals. My approach would be to work backwards, parsing the string from the end, which is a common strategy for CNF grammars.\n\nIn reverse order, the string ends with 't1'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't1'. Looking through the productions, NT73 can produce 't6' and 't7', and NT7 also produces 't1'. Wait, actually looking again, NT7 -> NT69 NT96. But earlier in the productions, I see NT7 -> 't1' is not listed. Wait, let me check the provided grammar again. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nWait, but when I look through all the productions, I see NT79 -> 't3', NT50 -> 't9', and so on. But looking for NT7, it's only defined as => NT69 NT96, which isn't a terminal. Hmm. Wait, is there any rule that directly produces 't1'? Looking at the list, I have NT7 -> NT69 NT96, but none of the symbols directly produce 't1'. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait a minute, looking through the non-terminals, I see NT79, NT50, etc., but nowhere do I see any non-terminal that directly produces 't1'. Oh wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking at each non-terminal: \n\n- NT7 -> NT69 NT96: not a terminal\n- NT1 -> NT97 NT41: NT97 is 't1' and NT41 is 't0', so NT97 is 't1'? Wait, but NT97 -> 't1' is indeed a production. So NT1 can produce 't1 t0' because NT97 -> 't1' and NT41 -> 't0'.\n\nWait, so in the string, we have a 't1' at the end. That would have to come from NT97 -> 't1'. But looking at the production, NT97 -> 't1' is direct. So if a non-terminal is NT97, it can produce 't1'.\n\nWait, so the last 't1' would have to come from NT97. But in our case, the string ends with 't1', which is likely produced by NT97 as a terminal.\n\nSo, working backwards, the last token is 't1', so the previous symbol must be a non-terminal that produces 't1'. Looking at the grammar, the only way a non-terminal produces 't1' is if it directly does so, which is NT97 -> 't1'. So the production is NT97.\n\nBefore that, we need to have a production that produces NT97 followed by something else? Wait, no, because in reverse, each step should be the leftmost symbol. Wait, maybe I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the parsing strategy in CNF is to read the string from right to left, taking the leftmost symbols and applying productions in reverse. So each step, we take a substring that corresponds to a non-terminal's production.\n\nSo, starting with the full string: t1 t8 t7 t6 t4 t6 t1 t9 t6 t4 t7 t9 t5 t6 t1 t1 t1 t6 t5 t7 t8 t6 t5 t7 t4 t9 t9 t1.\n\nLet me count the tokens: that's 31 tokens. So reversing the string would give 't1' followed by 't9', etc. But perhaps it's easier to process from the end, looking for the symbols that can derive to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be produced by S.\n\nBut trying to parse this manually is going to be time-consuming, but let's try to split the string into productions.\n\nLet me think about how the string is constructed. The string starts with 't1', which isn't a terminal in the first steps but could come from a combination of NTs.\n\nWait, let's start from the beginning. S is NT91 NT22, which would correspond to two symbols: NT91 and NT22. So the entire string must be the combination of the expansion of NT91 and the expansion of NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91: NT91 can produce a terminal if any of its productions result in a terminal. Checking NT91's productions, the first four are NT91 -> NT98 NT95, NT98 -> NT90 NT87, etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to see each production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, let me make a list of non-terminals that directly produce terminals. \n\nFrom the provided grammar, the direct terminals are:\n\n- NT98 -> 't5' (from NT51 -> NT51 NT68? Wait no, wait: wait NT98's production is NT98 -> NT90 NT87. Wait, actually looking at the list:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT98 -> 't5'\n\nWait, yes, line 23: NT98 -> NT90 NT87, but also line 29: NT99? Wait, no. Let me list all the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the listed productions, which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT98 -> 't5' (line 8)\n- NT56 -> 't7' (line 15)\n- NT51 -> 't3' (line 20)\nWait, no, looking again: the list is longer.\n\nWait, let me process each production line:\n\n1.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The grammar starts with the start symbol S, which is rewritten as NT91 NT22.

{"custom_id":"request-526","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's and numbers. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Looking at the grammar, it starts with S -> NT91 NT22, and all the other rules seem to follow this structure, like NT22 -> NT87 NT98, and so on. So each non-terminal eventually breaks down into terminals and other non-terminals, but the key is that each production is two parts.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t3 t9 t1 t2 t4 t7 t3 t2 t6 t5 t3 t0 t9 t7 t2 t0 t0 t4 t8 t3 t7 t4 t9 t8 t5 t7 t0 t8 t4`.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string step by step. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem using a method suitable for CNF, like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can try to simulate the derivation.\n\nLet me first note that each rule in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the terminals are the 't' followed by a digit. For example, 't3' is a terminal. So the left-hand side of each production rule is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, the first step is S -> NT91 NT22. So the entire string must be a derivation starting with NT91 and NT22, each of which must derive a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't3 t9...'. Wait, actually, in the string, each 't' is followed by a number, like 't3'. So the string is a sequence of 23 tokens (since the string has 23 't's followed by numbers).\n\nWait, no, let me count: The string is `t3 t9 t1 t2 t4 t7 t3 t2 t6 t5 t3 t0 t9 t7 t2 t0 t0 t4 t8 t3 t7 t4 t9 t8 t5 t7 t0 t8 t4`. Let me count the number of 't's: Each 't' is followed by a number, but perhaps each 't' is part of a token. So the string has 27 tokens.\n\nWait, no, in the problem statement, the string is written as `t3 t9 t1 t2 t4 ...`, so each 't' is a separate token. So there are 27 tokens in the string.\n\nBut wait, let me count: The string starts with 't3' which is two tokens, then 't9', 't1', etc. Wait, no, wait: Each 't' is part of the token, so 't3' is one token, 't9' is another, so the string is 27 tokens because the string is written as `t3 t9 t1 ...` which is 27 't' followed by digits, each as a separate token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the string is a sequence of 27 tokens, each of which is a 't' followed by a digit. Each of these is a terminal symbol, except perhaps when a non-terminal produces more than one terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string must be a series of terminals, each of which must be derived directly from a production.\n\nSo, the string is 27 tokens, each is 't' followed by a digit. Let me check the grammar to see what the terminals are. Looking at the grammar, the productions end with terminals or another non-terminal. For example, NT9 -> 't9', NT6 -> 't5', etc.\n\nSo, first, the start symbol S -> NT91 NT22. So the string must be derived from NT91 and NT22. So the overall string is the combination of the two parts derived from NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, the first step is to check that the string is split into two parts: one derived from NT91 and the other from NT22. The total tokens in the string would then be the sum of the tokens produced by NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me see: The string has 27 tokens. If NT91 produces m tokens and NT22 produces n tokens, then m + n should be 27. So I need to find if there's a way to split 27 into m and n such that NT91 can produce m tokens and NT22 can produce n tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of steps in the derivation tree would help. But perhaps it's better to consider the possible number of tokens each non-terminal can produce.\n\nMaybe I can create a table of non-terminals and how many tokens they can produce. Let's think about each production:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is two non-terminals, except the terminals. So, for example:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22: So S leads to two non-terminals.\n\nEach of these non-terminals, in turn, produces either two non-terminals or a terminal token.\n\nSo, each non-terminal can generate a sequence of tokens (terminals) and other non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model this as the number of tokens generated at each step. When a non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, each of those can then expand further.\n\nGiven that, the total number of tokens generated by a non-terminal can be variable, but it's influenced by the productions.\n\nWait, but to simplify, maybe we can model this as each non-terminal N has a certain number of generating tokens, and see if the sum matches 27.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the most straightforward way is to start recursively parsing the string from the start symbol, checking if each part can correspond to each non-terminal.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to list all the productions and see how the string can be broken down.\n\nLet me consider that the string must consist of the concatenation of the parts derived from NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the string can be split into two parts where the first part is derived from NT91 and the second from NT22.\n\nGiven that, the total number of tokens for NT91 and NT22 should add up to 27. Let's check the productions of NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT91 -> NT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nWait, no: Wait, let's go step by step.\n\nNT91's production: I see that in the grammar, NT91 is not directly a rule.

First, I'll need to understand the structure of the grammar and see how it can generate the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT22, NT76, etc.) is defined as the concatenation of two other non-terminals. So, the top-level symbol is S, which is NT91 and NT22. Each of these NTs also breaks down further until we reach terminal symbols ('t' followed by numbers).\n\nThe string is a sequence of 30 tokens. My goal is to parse this string according to the grammar's rules. Since all productions are in CNF (each produces two symbols), each step in parsing should reduce two non-terminals to one terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nI'll start from the leftmost symbol, which is S. S is NT91 and NT22. So, I need to decompose both NT91 and NT22 into their components.\n\nLooking at NT91, it's defined as NT95 and NT51.

Or maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map each NT to its possible expansions until it reaches terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to perform a recursive descent parser using the grammar, keeping track of expected tokens.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the given string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt6 t9 t5 t0 t0 t5 t9 t2 t2 t8 t4 t0 t2 t5 t6 t2 t1 t2 t8 t3 t8 t9 t1 t0 t7 t2 t9 t8 t1\n\nI'll number the tokens as 0 to 29 for reference.\n\nStarting with S -> NT91 NT22.

Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see that NT91 is produced by NT95 and NT51.\n\nSo, NT91 -> NT95 NT51.\n\nThen, the first two tokens are t6 and t9, which might correspond to NT95 -> 't9' and NT51 being another NT that can produce 't6'.

If NT22 starts with t6, then NT87 must produce t6 followed by something, and NT98 must produce more tokens. But let me see:\n\nLooking at NT87: it's defined as NT95 and NT53.\n\nWait, NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nIf after t6 t9 comes NT87, then NT95 must produce t6, but looking at the rules, NT95 is 't9' in one rule and could have other rules.\n\nWait, no, maybe NT95 produces a terminal 't9', as per line NT95 -> 't9'.\n\nWait, no: From the rules, looking at line NT95:\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see:\n\nNT95 -> 't9',\n\nYes, so NT95 is 't9'.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 is 't6', from another rule.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, looking for NT53:\n\nLooking through, line NT53 -> 't6'.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules:\n\nNT53 is defined in the rules as 't6'? Yes, here's the rule:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n\"NT53\" -> \"t6\".\n\nWait, here's the line in the rules: \"NT53 -> 't6'\". So NT53 is 't6' and NT95 is 't9'.\n\nSo, NT87 -> NT95 NT53, which is 't9' and 't6', so \"t9 t6\".\n\nBut in the string, after the first two tokens t6 t9 (0: t6, 1: t9), so perhaps NT87 is not the first step because NT87 would produce t9 t6, but the initial step is t6 t9.\n\nWait, maybe I have it reversed. Since NT87 is NT95 (t9) followed by NT53 (t6), so \"t9 t6\". But the string's first two tokens are t6 t9, which is the reverse.\n\nSo perhaps the production is in the opposite order.\n\nWait, in CFGs, the order matters. So, NT87 is NT95 NT53, meaning that the two components are written in order: first NT95, then NT53. So in production, it's \"t9 t6\".\n\nBut in the string, first two tokens are t6 t9, which is \"t6 t9\", not \"t9 t6\".\n\nSo maybe this S's NT22 is being used as the first part. Hmm, but S is NT91 and NT22, so both need to be produced in order.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake: maybe NT91 is NT95 NT51, but NT95 is 't9', and NT51 could produce a non-terminal that produces 't6'? Wait, that's possible, but I need to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is different.

The goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Each of these NT symbols is a non-terminal, so we need to see how they can derive into the string. \n\nNow, let's list all the productions to see how they expand into terminals.\n\nStarting with NT91: NT91 \u2192 t8 (from NT91 \u2192 t8). That's a terminal production.\n\nNT22: NT22 \u2192 t8 (from NT22 \u2192 t8). So NT91 NT22 becomes t8 t8. But the string starts with t1, so that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the string structure. Let me check the string again: the first tokens are t1, t6, etc. So if S starts with NT91 and NT22, which both expand to t8, but the string begins with t1, this seems contradictory. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT symbols can expand into other non-terminals. Let me look at the productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT91's production is only NT91 \u2192 t8. So NT91 can't go any further; it's a terminal. Similarly, NT22 \u2192 t8. So S \u2192 t8 t8, but the string starts with t1. That can't be. So maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the productions. Let me check NT91 and NT22 again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT91: NT91 \u2192 t8 (from NT16: NT96 \u2192 t6, but wait, looking through all the NT91 and NT22:\n\nNT91 \u2192 t8 (from the given rules). So that's the only production. Therefore, S can only produce t8 t8, which is two 't8's. But the given string starts with t1, which is different. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing the steps. Let me double-check: the string starts with t1, but according to the grammar, the initial S expands to t8 t8, which is different. So regardless of the productions of the non-terminals, S cannot produce anything other than t8 t8, which doesn't match the given string at all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Maybe the productions of non-terminals have multiple steps, but I don't see any non-terminal symbols in the initial productions except S and NT91, NT22, etc. But NT91 and NT22 only expand to terminals, so the whole string derived from S would consist of just t8 t8. \n\nTherefore, the given string is t1 t6 ... which doesn't match.

{"custom_id":"request-546","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens: \"t0 t1 t3 t5 t6 t0 t6 t3 t6 t0 t8 t6 t7 t6 t5 t8 t3 t6 t8 t0 t6 t9 t2 t6 t9 t8 t9 t8 t4 t6\".\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. It's a set of rules where each production is either:\n1. A single terminal, like A \u2192 a.\n2. Two non-terminals, like A \u2192 BC.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice most of the productions are non-terminals splitting into two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT87, and so on.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of these terminal tokens (\"t0\", \"t1\", etc.). So I need to see if starting from S, through a series of replacements, I can derive exactly this sequence ending with the entire string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. CYK works by creating a table where each position considers possible non-terminals that could have generated that substring.\n\nStep 1: Split the string into individual tokens. The string is: [t0, t1, t3, t5, t6, t0, t6, t3, t6, t0, t8, t6, t7, t6, t5, t8, t3, t6, t8, t0, t6, t9, t2, t6, t9, t8, t9, t8, t4, t6].\n\nThe length is 30 tokens. Let's note that each step in the derivation of the string must correspond to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the top-level production, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the first two non-terminals should produce t0 and t9? Wait, no: S \u2192 NT91 NT22 means that the string must start with NT91 expanding to a string ending with some t's, and then NT22 expanding to another string. But wait, S is replacing to two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22.\n\nWait, to clarify, in each step, every non-terminal is replaced by something. So starting with S, the first expansion would be two parts: the first part from NT91 and the second from NT22.\n\nSo the entire string must be split such that the first part corresponds to NT91's derivation and the second part to NT22's derivation. Let's check the given string: the first token is t0, then t1, t3, etc.\n\nWait, according to the grammar, let's see what the production is for NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n- NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT87\n- NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nSo S starts as NT91 and NT22. Let's see what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nWait, no: NT91 is non-terminal 91, which is a variable that can be replaced. Looking at the grammar, NT91 is split into NT76 and NT87. Then, each of those can split further.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look at the terminal string and see possible splits that correspond to the grammar's structure.\n\nAnother approach: for the string to be generated by the grammar, there must be a way to parse it using the grammar's rules. Let's consider the CYK algorithm's approach.\n\nThe CYK table will be 30x30, with each cell [i,j] indicating possible non-terminals that can derive the substring s_i...s_j.\n\nWe can start by initializing the table with each single terminal as a possible non-terminal in position [i,i].\n\nThen, for each length from 2 to 30, we'll check possible splits and see which non-terminals can produce the substring.\n\nBut considering that the grammar has many non-terminals and productions, this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for the sequence of terminals and see if they can be grouped into the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t0, t1, t3, t5, t6, t0, t6, t3, t6, t0, t8, t6, t7, t6, t5, t8, t3, t6, t8, t0, t6, t9, t2, t6, t9, t8, t9, t8, t4, t6.\n\nLet me try to group these into possible non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the first part (NT91) should expand to a string ending before some point, and NT22 should expand to another string.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: the first token is t0. But NT91 starts with NT76, which then splits into NT87 and NT98.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see if the entire sequence can be built by starting from S and expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nLet me look at each non-terminal and their productions:\n\n- NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n- NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n- NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n- NT76 is used elsewhere.\n- NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT87 \u2192 so NT76 and NT87 are the next splits.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see which non-terminals produce which terminal sequences.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their possible terminal expansions. The strings given for each non-terminal are based on their productions which either split into two non-terminals or into a terminal.\n\nBut in this case, every production either splits into two non-terminals or is a terminal. So each non-terminal's expansion can't have any single non-terminal expanding into a mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, so for example, NT51 is \"t3\", which is a terminal. Similarly, NT91 is \"t8 t7\", wait no, looking back: Wait, no, in the given grammar, for example, NT51 \u2192 't3', meaning that NT51 directly produces 't3'.\n\nWait no, let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8' 't7'?

So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recheck the entire grammar production to find all terminal cases.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT96 -> 't7' \u2192 Yes, NT96 has a production to 't7'\n\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n\n- NT95 -> 't1'\n\n- NT50 -> 't9'\n\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n\n- NT26 -> 't7'\n\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n\n- NT79 -> 't3'\n\n- NT31 -> 't2'\n\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n\n- NT73 -> 't7'\n\n- NT53 -> 't6'\n\n- NT56 -> 't7'\n\nWait, so let's note the terminals:\n\nNT96 -> 't7'\n\nNT22 -> 't8'\n\nNT98 -> 't5'\n\nNT76 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't5', 't8'\n\nNT56 -> 't7'\n\nNT26 -> 't7', 't9', 't6'\n\nNT95 -> 't1'\n\nNT50 -> 't9'\n\nNow, the string starts with t7, which must come from NT96. So the first part must be NT96.\n\nThe production for NT96 is either 't7' or 't5'. Since the string starts with 't7', that's fine.\n\nSo S -> NT91 NT22, and the first part is 't7', which is from NT96. But wait, S is NT91 NT22, not NT96. Hmm, wait, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, S is NT91 followed by NT22. So when S is expanded, the first part comes from NT91 and the second from NT22.\n\nSo the first token in the string is 't7', which needs to come from NT91. So I need to find a production for NT91 that ends with 't7'.\n\nLooking through the rules, does NT91 have a production to 't7'? Let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT79 -> 't3'\n\nNT95 -> 't1'\n\nNT12 -> 't1', 't2'.\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12.\n\nBut there's another production where NT12 -> 't1' and 't2'? No, wait, the rules provided don't show that. So perhaps I missed that.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I don't see NT12 directly producing a terminal, except maybe in the case of NT12 being part of a chain that leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to trace the derivation.\n\nStart with S: NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the string is derived from NT91 producing some part and NT22 producing others.\n\nThus, the first token in the string is from NT91. So the first part of the string must be a derivation from NT91, ending with the first token 't7'.\n\nSo, let's see what NT91 can produce. Looking through the production rules, I don't see NT91 having a direct production that leads to 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let's check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, does any production for NT91 end with 't7'? Let's see:\n\nThe rules for NT91:\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12 and NT12 -> 't1' and 't2'? No, I don't see this. Wait, in the rules, I don't see NT91 being defined anywhere except that it's part of S.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see if any production leads to 't7'. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that eventually produces 't7'.\n\nLooking at NT96: it directly produces 't7'.\n\nSo if NT96 is part of the string, it must come from a production where a non-terminal is expanded to 't7' or another non-terminal that leads to 't7'.\n\nWait, but in S, we have NT91 and NT22. So maybe NT91 can produce NT96, leading to 't7'?\n\nLooking at NT91, perhaps there's a production that includes NT96.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for production rules that include NT91. Wait, maybe in NT51's production: NT51 -> NT51 NT68.\n\nWait, perhaps looking elsewhere. Let me scan all the rules again.\n\nLooking for any NT91 production: looking through the list, the only production for NT91 is nowhere\u2014it's only in S. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up. Let me list all the NT productions:\n\n1. S -> NT91 NT22\n\n2. NT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\n3. NT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\n4. NT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\n5.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, with A, B, C being non-terminals and a a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and it's defined as S \u2192 NT91 NT22. That means the entire string must be generated starting with NT91 and NT22.

{"custom_id":"request-590","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's see. First, I'll try to understand the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has several production rules, all of which are in the form of two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for NT96, which has three symbols on the right. Wait, no, actually, looking again, all the productions are of the form A -> BC, except maybe I need to check.\n\nWait, the given grammar doesn't have any rules that produce three symbols, right? Let me check again. No, all are two symbols on the right except for NT56 which seems to have two as well. Let me list a couple to be sure. NT95 -> 't7', which is just a terminal symbol. So most rules are like NT12 -> NT8 NT12. Wait, no, that can't be right because in CNF, all productions should have exactly two non-terminals on the left. Wait, no, wait: in Chomsky Normal Form, productions can have only two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So for example, S-> NT91 NT22 is okay because it's two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but some of the rules have something like NT56 -> NT55 NT78. Okay, that's still two on the left, but looking at NT56's rules, I see both NT56 -> NT55 NT78 and NT56 -> NT56 NT95. Hmm, that's a bit tricky because the same NT56 could have a production where it references itself, which might indicate left recursion. But wait, in this grammar, NT56's production NT56 -> NT56 NT95 suggests that NT56 can expand into itself plus another non-terminal, which could lead to infinite recursion unless there's a way to terminate.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe I need to think about the string and how it can be parsed using the grammar.\n\nThe string given is: `t1 t0 t5 t3 t9 t1 t8 t3 t2 t1 t2 t9 t5 t3 t6 t9 t1 t1 t1 t8 t0 t0 t2 t9 t6 t3 t1 t5 t8 t7 t3 t9`.\n\nWow, that's a long string of 35 tokens (separated by spaces). Each token is a terminal symbol, right? So the grammar's start symbol is S, and from the rules, S becomes NT91 and NT22, which are non-terminals. Each of these needs to be expanded into two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because most rules seem to be producing terminals, but some are non-terminals. For example, S-> NT91 NT22. Then NT91->'t8', and NT22->'t8'. So the start symbol S would expand directly into 't8 t8' in one step if NT91 and NT22 can't be further expanded. But wait, in the given string, the first part is t1, so maybe there's a different expansion path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows for multiple expansions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Let me try to break down the string and see if I can find a sequence of productions that would lead to it.\n\nBut before that, I should check if each of the given symbols (like t1, t0, etc.) correspond correctly to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the right-hand sides have terminals like 't1', 't0', 't5', etc. Wait, some of the rules have 't2', 't3', etc. So the string is composed of these terminal tokens.\n\nAlternatively, I can see that the grammar has multiple non-terminals, and each of their expansions leads to either more non-terminals or directly to a terminal symbol.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the grammar: 't1', 't0', 't5', 't3', 't9', 't8', 't7', 't6', 't2', 't4'.\n\nWait, 't4' isn't in the string, so if the string includes any 't4's, it's invalid. But in the given string, I don't see 't4', so maybe that's just a red herring.\n\nNow, looking at the start symbol S: it expands to NT91 and NT22. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT91 -> 't8', and NT22 -> 't8'. So the expansion is 't8 t8' which is \"t8 t8\". But the string starts with 't1', so I don't see how S could directly produce that. That's a problem because the initial expansion of S is \"t8 t8\", but the string starts with 't1'. Therefore, S\u2192NT91 NT22 would produce something that doesn't match the given string.\n\nWait, so maybe that suggests that the string is not in the language, because the initial S expansion immediately gives 't8 t8', which doesn't match the string starting with 't1'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the left-hand side of S is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then NT91 is defined as 't8', and NT22 is 't8'. So yes, S directly expands to 't8 t8'. Therefore, the start symbol's expansion gives two 't8's, which don't match the string provided. Thus, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe NT91 can expand in another way. Let me check NT91's production. According to the grammar, NT91 only has one production: NT91 \u2192 't8'. So there's no other way to expand NT91. Therefore, any expansion starting from S would immediately produce 't8 t8', which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps I'm supposed to consider all possible derivations, but if even the first step doesn't produce a 't1' in the string, then the string is unmatchable.\n\nTherefore, given that the string starts with t1 and S can only produce t8 t8, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-588","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol.\n\nThe task is to check if the string `t3 t2 t5 t7 t9 t9 t3 t5 t0 t2 t0 t0 t6 t0 t3 t1 t6 t6 t6 t9 t4 t3 t1 t3 t6 t1 t2 t8 t5 t8 t1 t9` is in the language generated by this grammar. Each production step in the derivation must consist of replacing a single non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to construct a parse tree for the given string, starting from the start symbol S and working towards the leaves, ensuring that each production step follows the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the string: `t3 t2 t5 t7 t9 t9 t3 t5 t0 t2 t0 t0 t6 t0 t3 t1 t6 t6 t6 t9 t4 t3 t1 t3 t6 t1 t2 t8 t5 t8 t1 t9`\n\nThe first symbol is `t3`. Looking at the grammar, I see that `t3` isn't directly a terminal in the given productions. The productions for `NT73` have `t6` and `t7`, but I don't see any production for `t3`. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the productions for terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8'\n- NT78 -> 't8'\n- NT58 -> 't7' (Wait, is there an NT58? No, looking at the provided list, I don't see any NT58. The closest is NT53: 't6')\nWait, maybe I should list all terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the terminals are:\nt3, t2, t5, t7, t9, t0, t6, and 't1', 't4', 't8', 't5' again.\n\nWait, some of these might be part of the non-terminals. For example, NT91 is 't8'.\n\nThe given string has tokens like `t9`, which appears in NT98-> 't5', etc. But the problem is that `t3` isn't present as a terminal in any production. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT96 -> 't6', NT99 isn't present, NT58 isn't present. Wait, let me check each line:\n\n- NT95 -> 't1'\n- NT73 -> 't6' and 't7'\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't7'\n- NT66 -> Wait, I don't see an NT56 production as a terminal. NT56\u2192 't7' is in the productions as NT56-> NT55 NT78, but also, looking at lower 't's:\n\nWait, looking at the list again:\n\nThe productions for 't's are as follows:\n\n- NT95 -> 't1'\n- NT73 -> 't6' and 't7' (Wait, NT73 is produced by NT76: NT76\u2192 NT69 NT26. NT69 is 't1', and NT26 is 't6' in some cases. But I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map each NT to their corresponding terminal(s). Let me list each NT and their possible terminals:\n\nNT73: I don't see any production for NT73 ending in a terminal, except looking at the productions:\n\nWait, I think I'm getting mixed up because some NTs are productions and others are terminals. Let me re-express each NT and what they produce.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT73 -> NT76 NT38\n\nBut NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n\nNT69 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't6' or 't9' depending on other productions.\n\nThis seems a bit tangled. Maybe another approach is better. Perhaps trying to work backwards from the string and see how each token can be matched.\n\nEach production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (non-terminals or terminals). The string must be built by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals are left.\n\nGiven the string, I'll try to split it into the right components based on the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t3 t2 t5 t7 t9 t9 t3 t5 t0 t2 t0 t0 t6 t0 t3 t1 t6 t6 t6 t9 t4 t3 t1 t3 t6 t1 t2 t8 t5 t8 t1 t9\n\nStarting from the left, the string begins with t3. Looking at the grammar, t3 is not directly a terminal, but perhaps it can come from a production that eventually reduces to t3. Alternatively, maybe a production chain can reach t3.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT6 -> 't5' and 't8' in some cases, but NT6 is used in several NTs:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5' (appears multiple times, maybe in NT6, NT26, etc.)\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to reconstruct a possible parse tree.\n\nBut perhaps, an initial check: does the string contain any symbols that aren't in the set of terminals defined in the grammar?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the terminals are the tokens 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9'. The given string uses only these, so that's good.\n\nNow, let's try to find a way to derive the string. Let's consider that each symbol in the string must be either the right-hand side of a production or can be formed by further expanding non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking for symbols that are directly produced by a production. Let's look at the string:\n\nt3, t2, t5, t7, t9, ...\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to find a production rule that produces t3. Looking at all the productions, I see NT73 and NT53. Let me check:\n\nLooking over, for example, NT31 is written as NT31 -> NT54 NT31. Wait, I'm not seeing a terminal 't3' directly produced. Maybe t3 comes from a longer production path.\n\nWait, NT73 is produced by NT76 -> NT69 NT26. NT69 is 't1', and NT26 can produce 't6' or 't9'.\n\nSo NT76 \u2192 t1 followed by either t6 or t9. So that's t1 t6 or t1 t9.\n\nIf that's the case, then NT73 would be the combination of that, but maybe the 't3' comes from somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to see if any of the symbols can only be generated by certain productions.\n\nFor instance, t9 appears in many places. NT91, NT76, NT98, etc. Let me think: is t9 ever produced as a terminal? Yes, in NT91 as 't8', but t9 is produced in NT98 as 't5' or as a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking through, I think I might have misread some of the productions. For example, NT98 is written as NT98 -> NT90 NT87. Wait, no, I think I need to carefully check each production.\n\nWait, here's the given grammar:\n\nS -> NT91 NT91\n\nWait, no, S -> NT91 NT91? Or perhaps S->NT91 NT91 is a typo and it should be S->NT91 NT91, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, the first line ends with S->NT91 NT91, but that's not a standard terminal.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the initial S rule is S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nYes, the first line is S -> NT91 NT91? No, let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT91 NT91 NT22 ...\"\n\nWait, no, actually, the first line is:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT91 NT91\"\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misremembering.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's a set of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT22, etc.) expands into a combination of other non-terminals or terminals (like t5, t6, etc.). The start symbol is S, which initially expands into NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t7 t6 t6 t6 t1 t3 t2 t3 t3 t0 t1 t2 t1 t6 t6 t1 t2 t8 t4 t8 t1 t8 t1 t6 t2 t0 t2 t8 t6 t5 t6 t1 t7`.\n\nThat's a sequence of 39 tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-605","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except possibly the start symbol. The provided string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, each starting with 't' and some numbers. My job is to figure out whether this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's a set of productions where each non-terminal (like S, NT22, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals or terminals. Some of them expand directly into terminals, which are the actual tokens in the string. For example, NT95 -> 't7' means when you expand NT95, you get 't7'.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t0 t0 t9 t4 t6 t6 t5 t7 t6 t1 t9 t2 t0 t6 t3 t0 t7 t2 t3 t5 t6 t0 t0 t0 t6 t0 t4 t8 t1 t6 t9 t5 t1`.\n\nLet me break it down. The string starts with t0, which I need to find in the grammar. Looking at the productions, some non-terminals expand directly into t0. For example, NT50 -> 't0', NT26 -> 't6', NT6 -> 't5' and 't8', but also some non-terminals expand into t0 through other steps.\n\nWait, looking again: NT50 -> NT2 NT69, and then NT2 and NT69 might expand into 't0's. But let me look at the string. The first token is 't0', so maybe it comes from NT50, which is S's production.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT91 NT22. So S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Now, I need to see what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nLooking at NT91: The only production is NT91 -> NT8 NT9. Wait, no, that's not it. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I think I made a mistake. The grammar is in the form S \u2192 NT91 NT22, where NT91 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. So the string starts with 't0', so that must come from one of these NT non-terminals.\n\nWait, the first token is 't0' in the string. So let's see if any non-terminal expands directly to 't0'. Looking through the productions, I see NT50 -> 't0', NT26 -> 't6' (but it's a non-terminal), and NT6 -> 't8' or 't5', but I don't see other NTs directly expanding to 't0'. So unless it's from a chain.\n\nWait, NT50 -> NT2 NT69. So to get 't0', either NT2 or NT69 must produce 't0'. Let's see NT2: NT2 -> NT73 NT38. Neither of these directly expand to 't0', but let's see further. NT73 -> 't6' and 't7'. NT38 -> 't6' and 't3'. So NT2 would produce something that starts with 't6 t7' or 't6 t3', which don't include 't0'. So maybe I'm wrong about NT50. Wait, perhaps another path.\n\nWait, another production: NT1 -> NT97 NT41, which is likely not useful. NT25 -> NT45 NT50. NT45 -> NT50 NT56. Hmm, but this might be getting too complicated.\n\nLet me instead take a different approach. Let me build the parse tree for the given string. The string is a series of tokens, so each step in the grammar must generate two tokens, each being either a terminal or a non-terminal that further expands. Since all rules in CNF produce two non-terminals, the derivation process will eventually lead to a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe string has 37 tokens: t0, t0, t9, t4, t6, t6, t5, t7, t6, t1, t9, t2, t0, t6, t3, t0, t7, t2, t3, t5, t6, t0, t0, t0, t6, t0, t4, t8, t1, t6, t9, t5, t1.\n\nSo, the first token is 't0'. Let's see if any NT directly produces 't0'. Looking at the grammar, NT50 -> 't0'. So the first 't0' must come from NT50.\n\nSimilarly, the second 't0' would also need to come from NT50. So now, the derivation needs to have S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which then each expand into 't0's, but that seems unlikely because NT91 and NT22 might produce different sequences.\n\nWait, let's consider each 't0' as possibly coming from different NTs. Maybe some of them are from NT50, others from other NTs that eventually produce 't0'.\n\nLet me try the first 't0'. So, it must come from NT50. So, the production NT50 -> 't0'. That's one possibility.\n\nThen the second 't0' could come from another NT50. But let's see the structure. The entire string is a series of 't's and numbers, so it's generated from the start, which is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So both NT91 and NT22 must expand into sequences of tokens that together form the entire string.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't0' comes from a different NT in the expansion. Alternatively, maybe the structure of the string aligns with the productions.\n\nAnother approach: Let me see which non-terminals can produce 't0'. From the grammar, NT50 \u2192 't0', NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0. Wait, NT54 is 't7' and then NT0 is 't0'. So NT54 could lead to 't7 t0', but not just 't0'. Similarly, NT95 \u2192 't7', NT50 \u2192 't0', NT26 \u2192 't6' or 't5', but I don't see how that can lead to 't0'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT50: NT50 -> 't0'\n\nSo, only one production that gives 't0' directly. So any occurrence of 't0' in the string must come from NT50. So in the string, every 't0' must be the result of NT50 \u2192 't0'.\n\nNow, how does the grammar generate the entire string? Let's think about the structure.\n\nThe string begins with 't0 t0 t9 t4 ...', so the first two 't0's must be from two NT50s. But S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which then each must expand into sequences that lead to each 't0' in the string.\n\nSo, let's break down S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Let's see what NT91 and NT22 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT91: The production is NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT9. Wait, but NT9 isn't defined unless we look further. Let's see if there's any other production for NT91.\n\nWait, the initial problem statement says the grammar is in CNF, so each production has two non-terminals, but sometimes those non-terminals expand into terminals. For example, some of the productions like NT95 -> 't7'.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the productions that expand into terminals or the non-terminals that lead to terminals.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT50 -> 't0'\n\nNT26 -> 't6' or 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't5' or 't8'\n\nNT12 -> 't12' (but wait, no, NT12 produces NT8 and NT12. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar is a list of rules, each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, first, let's create a map of NTs that directly produce terminal tokens. From the given list:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7'\n\n- NT50 -> 't0'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n\nWait, NT54 isn't expanding directly to a terminal. But looking through, for example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5' or 't8'\n\nSo, NT6 can expand into 't5' or 't8', which are terminals. Similarly, NT6 can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, let's correct that. The productions from the problem:\n\nLooking back through the grammar rules:\n\nThere are several NTs that expand directly into a terminal:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't5' and '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me break this down. The grammar's rules are a bit complex, so I think the best approach is to try to parse the string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string: `t5 t4 t4 t7 t0 t0 t2 t0 t4 t3 t3 t6 t5 t6 t9 t6 t5 t6 t9 t5 t2 t4 t2 t1 t4 t8 t7 t0 t0 t5 t2 t6 t4 t0`. That's a lot of symbols, but I see each symbol is either a number followed by a letter, like t5, or sometimes t8, t9, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, the terminals are `t5`, `t4`, `t7`, `t0`, `t2`, `t6`, `t9`, `t8`, `t3`, and `t1`. So each 't' followed by a digit is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, or a is a terminal.\n\nSo the starting symbol is S.

It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that all the non-terminals eventually resolve into terminals or combinations that do. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens: t8 t5 t3 t8 t5 t3 t6 t1 t1 t5 t4 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t8 t0 t1 t8 t0 t6 t7 t8 t4 t1 t0 t9 t2 t3 t4 t1 t9 t9. \n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its components and see if it can be constructed from the start symbol S. \n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string should be a sequence of two parts: one derived from NT91 and another from NT22.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts corresponding to NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91: t8 t5 t3 t8 t5 t3 t6 t1 t1 t5 t4 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t8 t0 t1 t8 t0 t6 t7 t8 t4 t1 t0 t9 t2 t3 t4 t1 t9\nNT22: The string is the same as NT91, since NT22 is used here. Wait, no. Actually, the string is divided into NT91 and NT22. Let me check: the entire string is t8 t5 t3 ... up to t9, and since NT91 and NT22 are both non-terminals, each should produce their own part. So perhaps the string is the combination of NT91 and NT22. Hmm, maybe I should parse the string as [NT91] [NT22].\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the entire string is a concatenation of the strings generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nNow, I'll try to parse each part.\n\nFirst, let's process NT91. The string for NT91 is t8 t5 t3 t8 t5 t3 t6 t1 t1 t5 t4 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t8 t0 t1 t8 t0 t6 t7 t8 t4 t1 t0 t9 t2 t3 t4 t1 t9.\n\nNow, looking at the productions for NT91, I see that NT91 \u2192 NT96 NT91.

{"custom_id":"request-645","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in Chomsky normal form, which is a set of production rules where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production can be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but in some definitions, especially the strict one, each RHS must be two non-terminals. Hmm, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT98 -> 't9' which is a terminal, so that makes more sense. But I need to confirm because some rules have two non-terminals. So yes, it seems some rules generate terminals, which is allowed because Chomsky normal form allows for epsilon productions, but here the terminals are like 'tX's, so each NT rule is either a terminal or two NS symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t4 t3 t8 t6 t0 t2 t5 t5 t6 t7 t8 t3 t4 t6 t4 t2 t2 t1 t7 t8 t5 t3 t8 t8 t1 t7 t4 t1 t4 t7 t4.\n\nThat's quite a long string. Let me count the tokens: 42 tokens. So each token is either 'tX' or a terminal. Since the grammar produces 't's, I'll need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So starting from S, each step doubles the length because each production either produces two NTs or a terminal. Since the string has an even number of tokens? Wait, no, 42 is an even number. Wait, no, 42 is even. Wait, no, 42 divided by 2 is 21, which is odd, but each step may not exactly double. Wait, I'm confusing with something else. The initial length from S is 2, each production step can add more NTs, but in the end, they'll produce terminals.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to start from the top and see if we can break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me try to map this step by step. Let's start with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the parse tree starts with S, which has two children: NT91 and NT22.\n\nNow, looking at NT91, I need to find what it expands to. From the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT91 directly. Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8' as per the rule listed. So NT91 is a terminal 't8'.\nSimilarly, NT22 has a rule -> 't8' as well.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't8 t8'? Let me check the string: the first token is t4, so that's a problem. Wait, the first token in the string is t4, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which would give us t8 t8, not t4 t3... So perhaps this string cannot be generated, but I need to check further.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me search for NT91's rule. In the rules provided:\n\nLooking for the form NT91 -> ... I see:\n\nYes, there's a rule NT91 -> 't8'. So S \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 't8' 't8'. So the generated string should start with t8 t8.\n\nBut the input string starts with t4 t3, so it's different. Therefore, the string is not generated by this grammar. But maybe I'm missing something because maybe the string is a part of a larger tree that can be derived from S with more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar allows for more complexity, but I think the initial step is the strongest indicator here. If S expands to t8 t8, but the string starts with t4 t3, then it's impossible.

Wait, no, looking again:\n\nNo, the terminal rules are individual transformations. Let me list all terminal rules:\n\n- NT6 => 't5' (from NT68 -> ... and other paths)\n- NT6 also is a rule: NT6 -> 't8' (Wait, that can't be because it's a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-669","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a specific way where all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. I see that most of the non-terminals (like S, NT22, NT76, etc.) eventually produce a string of terminals. The string of terminals at the end of each production seems to consist of things like 't7', 't5', etc. So for each non-terminal, there are rules that lead to a combination of these terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t2 t3 t1 t9 t7 t4 t9 t7 t8 t9 t3 t6 t0 t3 t7 t3 t1 t1 t7 t0 t1 t3 t2 t0 t2 t7 t7 t3 t0 t1 t1 t2 t3 t1 t6 t1`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the entire string must be derived from the concatenation of two sentences: one from NT91 and one from NT22.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT91 \u2192 t8 t (from NT91 \u2192 t8, but wait, no, NT91 itself is terminal now. Wait no, the production for NT91 is nt91 \u2192 t8 t. Let me check: Yes, in the grammar, NT91 \u2192 t8 and NT7. Hmm, wait, no, looking back, the grammar shows that NT91 is rewritten into t8 and then what? Wait no, the production for NT91 is NT91 \u2192 t8, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT91 -> t8\n- NT7 -> t1\n- NT12 -> t1 (multiple times)\n- NT22 -> t8\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look through the entire grammar to see how each non-terminal eventually reduces to terminals.\n\nLooking more carefully, I notice that some non-terminals produce other non-terminals. For example, NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76, and so on. So, for a top-down approach, I'd need to make sure that the string can be broken down step by step according to these rules.\n\nGiven the string, it starts with 't2', 't3', etc. So the first step is probably NT91 and NT22 each producing a sequence that starts with 't2' and something else.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. Then NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, and NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1, and so on. This seems like it could produce a string that starts with several t's like t9, t5, etc., but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by building a parse tree. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is small, perhaps I can list out all possible terminal sequences from each non-terminal.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string should consist of the concatenation of what NT91 produces and what NT22 produces.\n\nLooking at NT91: From the grammar, I see NT91 \u2192 t8 and NT7. Wait, but NT7 is a non-terminal that leads to t1. So actually, NT91 is a little ambiguous. Let me check all the rules for NT91.\n\nWait, the rule for NT91 is: NT91 \u2192 t8, but also perhaps others if I look back.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, under NT91, it says NT91 \u2192 t8. So actually, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me check again.\n\nThe grammar is: S -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT13 -> t0\n\nAnd so on, it seems that NT87 leads to a terminal sequence like t9, t5, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal ultimately reduces to a specific sequence of terminals, so maybe I can precompute what each non-terminal can produce as a terminal string.\n\nLet me try that. For each non-terminal, I'll find all the possible terminal sequences they can generate.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So NT91 produces a certain string, and NT22 another, concatenated together.\n\nNT91: Let's see. The rules for NT91: Looking through the provided grammar, I see NT91 only appears in a few places. Wait, in the given grammar, the production for NT91 is:\n\nLooking back, in the provided grammar, I think I missed where NT91 is defined. Wait, in the user-provided grammar, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nLooking for NT91: I don't see any other production for NT91 except in the list:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 t8\n\nWait, no, let me check the entire list. Oh, wait, under NT_*, I see:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I find that NT91 is not defined as a terminal, but wait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me scan the list again.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. Each line in the grammar is of the form NT_ab \u2192 NTcd NTef. Except for some lines where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see lines like:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't2'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- NT26 \u2192 't7'\n- etc.\n\nSo, maybe some non-terminals have productions that reach terminals, so I can identify which non-terminals are actually terminal sequences.\n\nBut to find the possible terminal sequences each non-terminal can produce, I'll have to see if it's a terminal or goes further.\n\nLet me go through each line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nSo S produces the concatenation of NT91 and NT22.\n\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nNT22 splits into NT87 and NT98.\n\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-691","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are variables, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides all either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal, so that checks out.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t6 t1 t7 t8 t3 t2 t2 t8 t6 t3 t3 t0 t1 t5 t0 t3 t2 t3 t9 t2 t1 t4 t9 t4 t6 t7 t7 t1 t0 t1 t6 t3 t9 t9 t5 t2 t7`.\n\nSo, to determine if this string is in the language, I'll use a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which parses the string by applying the grammar in a bottom-up manner.\n\nThe approach involves constructing a parse table where each cell represents whether the substring from row i to j can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, we need to check if the entire string can be derived from S starting with NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Identify all the non-terminals in the string. In the given string, I'll parse each token and see if it's a non-terminal or a terminal. Non-terminals are the identifiers on the left-hand side of the rules, like S, NT91, NT22, etc., while the t's are terminals.\n\n2. The first step is to check if the given string can be split into parts that match the productions starting from S. Since S \u2192 NT91 NT22, the entire string should be a sequence of symbols that can be split into two parts, one generated by NT91 and the other by NT22.\n\n3. Let's first look at NT91 and NT22. From the grammar, NT91 can only produce 't8' because NT91 \u2192 't8' as per the rules provided.\n\nSo, if the string is being split into two parts, the first part corresponding to NT91 should only contain 't8's, and the second part should correspond to NT22.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t6, t1, etc., so that won't split correctly because the first symbol t6 doesn't match 't8'. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S \u2192 NT91 NT22 refers to the structure, not that the entire string starts with NT91. So maybe the entire string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the string again: it's a single string of terminals, so the entire string must be generated by NT91 followed by NT22. Therefore, the first part (before the split) must be generated by NT91, which is a single 't8', but the string starts with multiple t's which are all terminals.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because in the grammar, NT91 is a non-terminal, which when expanded, is only a terminal 't8' or via a chain of expansions. But the initial split is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT91 and NT22.\n\nEach of these, NT91 and NT22, can be non-terminals that produce sequences of terminals through their productions.\n\nSo, for the entire string to be generated by S, we'd need the string to be the concatenation of a production of NT91 and a production of NT22.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is all terminals, so each part (the first part generated by NT91 and the second by NT22) must be a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut Nondeterminism complicates things. Let me see: perhaps the string is the result of the concatenation of two non-terminals, but how?\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to list all possible expansion sequences for NT91 and NT22 and see if any combination matches the given string.\n\nStarting with NT91: From the grammar, I can try to build the possible strings that NT91 can generate.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT91, it isn't directly defined\u2014it seems that NT91 is a terminal since it's replaced via some productions. Wait, no: in CNF, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, looking back: the grammar rules have non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT91 \u2192 't8'. So NT91 is a non-terminal that produces a terminal 't8'. So if NT91 \u2192 't8', then any string containing a 't8' could be the result of NT91. But wait, no\u2014the string is a sequence of multiple terminals, so it's possible that NT91 can generate longer sequences through other rules, but in this case, from the given grammar, NT91 only produces 't8' directly. So perhaps NT91 is stuck at 't8'.\n\nBut that can't be right. Let me recheck the rules.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe rules provided are for each non-terminal, their productions. So for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo that would mean that S can produce the string 't8' followed by whatever NT22 can produce.\n\nSimilarly, NT22's rule is NT22 \u2192 NT98 NT91\n\nBut wait, that can't be because S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so expanding S would require expanding both NT91 and NT22.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model all possible expansions of the grammar and see if the string can be generated.\n\nLet me create a list of all the non-terminals and their possible productions.\n\nList of non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31 (Also from NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41)\n\nWait, so for example, NT6 is a terminal, as per the rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5'\n\nSimilarly, NT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT6: two rules: NT6 \u2192 't5' and NT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nSimilarly, NT26: NT26 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95 and also NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78, as well as others.\n\nWait, but this seems messy. Perhaps I can identify for each non-terminal what possible strings they can generate.\n\nWait, let's start by seeing if we can parse the given string.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt6 t1 t7 t8 t3 t2 t2 t8 t6 t3 t3 t0 t1 t5 t0 t3 t2 t3 t9 t2 t1 t4 t9 t4 t6 t7 t7 t1 t0 t1 t6 t3 t9 t9 t5 t2 t7\n\nThat's a lot of t's. To manage, perhaps I can break it down into smaller chunks, but it's still going to be quite long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the grammar and see if this string can be built.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is to check if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, considering that S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and assuming that the entire string is a combination of NT91 and NT22, the first part should be generated by NT91 and the second by NT22.\n\nSo, let's consider the first part of the string, which would be generated by NT91. But looking at the NT91 rules, it only directly produces 't8', and via rules maybe it can produce longer sequences. Wait, looking at the rules, do any of them start with NT91?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, the left-hand sides are all NTs with certain numbers, but I don't see any rules that have NT91 on the left except for S \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-687","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this task to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like and how it works. CNF means that each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. In this case, each rule on the left side has two non-terminals on the right. Except, some have a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking again, all produce two parts. For example, S -> NT91 NT22, which are both non-terminals. NT22 -> NT87 NT98, same here. So all productions in this grammar are of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals or one is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually in CNF, productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a single terminal. So in this grammar, some rules produce terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT7 -> NT69 NT96; NT91 -> NT96 NT51. Hmm, does that matter? Or wait, maybe not, because in this case, all the rules seem to have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. Looking through the rules, yes, each right-hand side has two non-terminals, except for some cases like NT2 -> 't5', which is a terminal. So there are some rules that produce a single terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, we need to see if we can derive the given string starting from S and applying the productions step by step, ensuring that each step breaks down into the given terminals until we reach the leaves.\n\nThe string to check is: t7 t7 t6 t5 t1 t8 t0 t2 t1 t8 t5 t4 t2 t4 t9 t3 t3 t3 t5 t3 t7 t8 t6 t0 t7 t3 t2 t9 t8 t3 t9 t0 t8 t4 t4 t4 t0.\n\nThat's quite a long string, 44 tokens. That suggests the derivation will involve several steps, but since each production can split into two non-terminals, the number of steps will be at most the depth of the tree, which for a string length of n in a fully expanded grammar, would be log(n) if the grammar is efficient.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually would be tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if there's a way to model this with a top-down approach, perhaps using dynamic programming, or check the structure of the grammar to see if the string fits the possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S and trying to build the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t7. So I need to see which non-terminal can produce t7 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of the productions to see if any produce a terminal as the start symbol. \n\nLooking at the grammar:\nS -> NT91 NT22\nNT91 -> NT96 NT51\nNT96 -> NT9->t9...

{"custom_id":"request-711","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is either a terminal or a non-terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar rules provided. From what I can see, the grammar starts with S and has a series of production rules. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, which is consistent with CNF. However, when I look closer, some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right side, like NT98 -> NT90 NT87. Wait, but CNF only allows productions with two non-terminals or a single non-terminal on the right. So maybe some of these are actually left-hand side productions where the single non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, effectively.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t5 t3 t7 t4 t5 t4 t0 t9 t7 t4 t0 t6 t4 t0 t2 t5 t4 t9 t3 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t1 t9 t2 t6 t8 t3 t1 t3 t0 t1 t4 t4 t9 t0`. It's a sequence of t's followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. \n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step, ensuring that each production step results in a sequence that matches the given string. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I might use a parser generator or apply the CYK algorithm, but that might be too time-consuming by hand. Another approach is to look for possible sequences of productions that could lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that S -> NT91 NT22. Let's see what NT91 and NT22 expand into. NT91 -> NT76 NT98, and NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So S becomes NT76 NT98 NT87 NT98. Then, each of these non-terminals needs to expand further.\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26. NT98 -> NT90 NT87. So we have NT69 NT26 NT90 NT87 NT87. Then NT69 -> NT6 NT6 NT6? Wait, looking back, NT68 -> NT25 NT31, but NT6 has a rule NT6 -> 't5' or something else? Wait, the rules say NT6 -> 't5' and also NT6 -> 't8' elsewhere. Hmm, that's confusing because each non-terminal should have a fixed set of productions. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nLooking at the list, NT6 has two rules: NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'. That can't be right because a non-terminal in CNF should only have one production. Wait, maybe it's a typo, or perhaps I misread. Let me check again. Oh, I see: NT66 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'. Wait, no, looking at the list, for example, NT68 has NT68 -> NT6 NT31, and another rule NT68 -> NT25 NT31. Also, NT6 has two rules, which is not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules have typos, and I misread them. Let me list the rules correctly. The user provided a lot of rules. Let me see: NT6 has two rules? Or is it that each rule for a non-terminal is separate? Wait, I think I misread. Let's see:\n\nLooking through, for example:\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, that's two productions for NT6, which is not allowed in CNF. Because in CNF, each non-terminal should have exactly one production, unless it's a terminal, but terminals can't have productions. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me look again.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each rule is A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So for each non-terminal, there are multiple rules, each consisting of two non-terminals or a terminal. But each non-terminal can have multiple rules, that's okay; it's just that each has one left-hand side and multiple right-hand sides.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, each non-terminal has multiple production rules on the right-hand side. So that's fine because the grammar is in CNF, which allows for that. For example, S has one rule, NT91 has two rules, NT22 has one rule, etc.\n\nSo, getting back to the string. The string starts with t5, t3, etc. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, S -> NT91 NT22. So the string should start with the expansion of NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet's expand NT91: NT91 has two rules: one is NT76 NT98. So let's pick that. So NT91 becomes NT76 NT98. Similarly, NT22 has one rule: NT87 NT98. So the string starts with NT76 NT98 NT87 NT98.\n\nNow, each of these needs to expand. Let's take NT76 first: NT76 has one rule: NT69 NT26.\n\nSo now, the string is NT69 NT26 NT98 NT87 NT98.\n\nNext, NT69: looking at the rules, I don't see any for NT69. Wait, checking the list: NT69 appears in several places. Oh, in the list, I see NT54 -> NT50 NT56, NT69 -> NT6 NT6? No, wait, looking through, I might have to check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, let me list all the rules for each non-terminal to make sure. For example, NT69: looking through the provided rules, is there a rule for NT69?\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> NT50 NT56\n- NT68 -> NT25 NT31\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT12\n- NT73 -> NT73 NT7\n- NT69 -> NT6 NT6? Wait, no. Wait, I think I may have made a mistake. Let's read each line carefully.\n\nLooking through, each line is of the form Non-terminal -> production. For example, the lines are:\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nNT97 -> 't1'\n\nWait, so I think it's better to list all rules for each non-terminal. Let's note that each non-terminal may have multiple rules.\n\nNT76: NT69 NT26\n\nNT98: NT90 NT87\n\nNT51: NT51 NT68\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a dictionary mapping each non-terminal to its possible productions.\n\nBut for the sake of time, I can proceed step by step.\n\nSo after S, we have NT91 -> NT76 NT98, and NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nSo the string starts as NT76 NT98 NT87 NT98.\n\nNow, NT76 -> NT69 NT26.\n\nSo adding that, the string becomes NT69 NT26 NT98 NT87 NT98.\n\nNow, NT69: I'm trying to recall, does NT69 have any rules? Let me check. Looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't3'\n\nNT76 -> 't5'\n\nNT79 -> 't3'\n\nNT96 -> 't0'\n\nWait, but for NT69, perhaps there's a rule I'm missing.\n\nWait, in the list, looking for NT69's rules. Hmm, I don't see any NT69 rules. Maybe it's a non-terminal that only has a single rule that's a terminal? No, because in Chomsky Normal Form, every rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, NT69 should have a rule where it's a single terminal, but looking through the provided rules, I don't see any NT69 -> 'something'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nLooking through each rule line:\n\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\n- NT97 -> 't1'\n\nWait, so NT97 is a terminal? But in the string, we have 't7' as a token, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try to map the given string into a parse tree.\n\nEach token in the string is either a terminal or a non-terminal. So, let's parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt5 t3 t7 t4 t5 t4 t0 t9 t7 t4 t0 t6 t4 t0 t2 t5 t4 t9 t3 t3 t5 t5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's quite extensive with multiple non-terminals and terminals. Each production rule seems to consist of exactly two non-terminals on the left and, on the right, each term is a pair of non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals here are 't0' to 't9' and some 't' followed by numbers or letters. Wait, actually, most of the terminals look like 't' followed by a digit, like 't2', 't5', etc., except for a few like 't7' without anything after. Hmm, that might be significant.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t2 t5 t2 t7 t6 t5 t4 t6 t8 t6 t1 t9 t8 t0 t5 t6 t6 t1 t3 t9 t4 t5 t0 t1 t2 t1 t9 t6 t1 t3 t5 t1 t4 t4 t0 t9 t3 t3`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, the derivation starts from the start symbol S and each step replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols (either non-terminals or terminals).\n\nI think the approach here is to model the parsing process, starting from the string and trying to reduce it using the grammar rules. Alternatively, I can attempt to build a parse tree that follows the grammar rules to produce the given string.\n\nLooking at the structure, each non-terminal may produce two terminals or another non-terminal pair. Let's see which non-terminals lead to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT98 becomes 't5' because its rule is NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, and both NT90 and NT87 have rules that lead to 't9' and 't5', but wait, looking closer, actually, NT98's rule is NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, and then:\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT8 (which becomes 't8') and NT90 \u2192 NT0 (which becomes 't0'), so wait, actually, maybe I'm confused. Wait, no. I need to check all the productions properly.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for each non-terminal. For example, looking at NT98: NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, and then looking at NT90 and NT87:\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT8 | NT0 \nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n\nSo NT98 would be replaced by either NT90 NT87, which further breaks down. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to start from the given string and try to see if it can be reduced using the grammar rules. Let's write out the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t2 t5 t2 t7 t6 t5 t4 t6 t8 t6 t1 t9 t8 t0 t5 t6 t6 t1 t3 t9 t4 t5 t0 t1 t2 t1 t9 t6 t1 t3 t5 t1 t4 t4 t0 t9 t3 t3.\n\nWait, actually, I think I misread it. Looking again, the string is provided as a sequence starting with t2, then t5, t2, t7, t6, etc. Let me list them all properly:\n\n1. t2\n2. t5\n3. t2\n4. t7\n5. t6\n6. t5\n7. t4\n8. t6\n9. t8\n10. t6\n11. t1\n12. t9\n13. t8\n14. t0\n15. t5\n16. t6\n17. t6\n18. t1\n19. t3\n20. t9\n21. t4\n22. t5\n23. t0\n24. t1\n25. t2\n26. t1\n27. t9\n28. t6\n29. t1\n30. t3\n31. t5\n32. t1\n33. t4\n34. t4\n35. t0\n36. t9\n37. t3\n38. t3\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Starting with t2, which might be the result of a non-terminal that produces 't2'. Looking at the productions, I see NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38. NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT6, or NT73 \u2192 NT7. Since NT73 has production rules, I think we can break it down. Similarly, NT38 is NT6 (from NT38 \u2192 NT6). Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, let me get this straight.

The string to evaluate is: `t8 t8 t5 t3 t2 t7 t8 t5 t1 t0 t2 t7 t3 t7 t4 t3 t1 t9 t0 t7 t6 t6 t0 t6`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure, so that's a good start. \n\nThe given grammar has a series of production rules for non-terminals (like S, NT22, NT76, etc.) each leading to a combination of other non-terminals or terminals. Each of these non-terminals eventually resolves to specific terminal symbols, some directly and others through intermediate steps.\n\nMy approach will involve working backwards from the given string, trying to break it down into the terminal symbols and see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me write down the string: t8 t8 t5 t3 t2 t7 t8 t5 t1 t0 t2 t7 t3 t7 t4 t3 t1 t9 t0 t7 t6 t6 t0 t6.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar. The first step is to determine the structure of the string and see if it can be parsed according to the production rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree, with each non-terminal having exactly two children, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol, S. The production for S is NT91 NT22. So, S must be split into NT91 and NT22, each of which will generate their own substrings of the input.\n\nWait, but looking at the input, it's all terminals, so S must first generate two sequences that concatenate to form the entire string. Since S is two symbols, the string is of length 24, so each part from NT91 and NT22 should concatenate to 24.\n\nLet me check the production rules for NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91's production: NT51 NT6\nNT22's production: NT87 NT98\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT91 NT22 becomes NT51 NT6 \u2192 ... and NT87 NT98 \u2192 ...\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. S is NT91 and NT22, which each have their own productions. So, to get a string from S, we first need to expand S into NT91 and NT22. Each of these can then expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal on the left, so S is a single non-terminal that expands into NT91 and NT22, each of which are non-terminals. So, the string generated would be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, the string must be able to be split into two parts, with the first part generated by NT91 and the second by NT22.\n\nLooking at the given string, which is all terminals, each of these substrings must themselves be generated by their respective non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string is 24 terminals long. So, after S expands into NT91 and NT22, each of those must expand into a substring whose combined length adds up to 24.\n\nWait, no, because in CNF, each production is a binary split, so each non-terminal will produce a string of terminals, and the total length is just the sum of the lengths of those two parts.\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into two parts under NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me see. NT91 is NT51 NT6, and NT22 is NT87 NT98.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the grammar, each production for NT91 is NT51 NT6, so that means NT91 expands into NT51 followed by NT6. Similarly, NT22 expands into NT87 followed by NT98.\n\nSo, the next step is to expand NT51 and NT6 from NT91, and NT87 and NT98 from NT22.\n\nEach of these now becomes their own non-terminals, so the string from NT91 will be the output of NT51 concatenated with the output of NT6, and the string from NT22 will be the output of NT87 concatenated with the output of NT98.\n\nSo, let me look at NT51 and NT6 first.\n\nNT51's production: NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 or NT51 \u2192 NT9.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the production for NT51 is: NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 or NT51 \u2192 NT9.\n\nSo, NT51 can either produce another NT51 and NT68 or terminate with 't9'.\n\nSimilarly, NT6's production is NT6 \u2192 't5' or 't6' or 't8', as per the productions.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, for NT6, it's: NT6 \u2192 't5', 't6', 't8', each as separate productions. So NT6 can be expanded directly into one of these terminals.\n\nSame for NT5: NT56 \u2192 't7' multiple times, but here for NT6, it's more straightforward.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions given for NT6 include both the rules for NT6 \u2192 't5', 't6', 't8'.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, the production for NT6 is: NT6 \u2192 't5', 't6', 't8'. So three separate productions. So NT6 can be 't5', 't6', or 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, NT51 has two productions: NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 or NT51 \u2192 NT9.\n\nSo, to expand NT51, it can either continue expanding as NT51 NT68, which would lead to a recursive expansion, or it can terminate with 't9'.\n\nSo, the substring from NT51 and NT6 will have two parts: one from NT51 and one from NT6.\n\nLet me see. The entire string is 24 terminals, so if NT91 and NT22 are each generating 12 terminals each, that would sum to 24. Alternatively, depending on the recursive splits, it could be different lengths, but with the current productions, it's possible.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to approach this step by step, trying to see if the entire string can be parsed.\n\nGiven the string:\n\nt8 t8 t5 t3 t2 t7 t8 t5 t1 t0 t2 t7 t3 t7 t4 t3 t1 t9 t0 t7 t6 t6 t0 t6\n\nLet me try to see if this can be split into two parts that each correspond to NT91 and NT22.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this using the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars in CNF.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm just trying to see if the string is in the language, perhaps I can traverse the string from left to right, choosing appropriate splits based on the grammar.\n\nLet me first look at NT91's possible expansions.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT51 NT6\n\nSo, the first part of the string from NT91 will be the expansion of NT51, followed by the expansion of NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nSo, the second part of the string from NT22 will be the expansion of NT87 followed by the expansion of NT98.\n\nSo, the entire string is the concatenation of NT91's expansion and NT22's expansion.\n\nSo, the first part (NT91) must be a string that can be derived from NT51 followed by NT6, and the second part (NT22) must be a string derived from NT87 followed by NT98.\n\nSo, I'll split the input string into two parts: from the start until before the point where NT22's expansion starts, and the rest.\n\nWait, but how do I know where to split? Maybe I can look for possible splits where the end of NT91's expansion is the start of NT22's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start trying to match the string from the start, using the productions.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so we have two parts: NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me consider NT91 first.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT51 NT6\n\nSo, the first part is NT51, which can be:\n\nEither NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 (recursive case) or NT51 \u2192 NT9 (terminal 't9').\n\nBut looking at the first few symbols of the string, we have '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t5 t6 t3 t5 t9 t1 t2 t7 t2 t5 t9 t6 t9 t5 t6 t5 t3 t5 t9 t2 t4 t7 t0 t7 t9 t0 t5 t0 t5 t7 t4 t1 t0 t0 t3 t4 t8 t5 t0`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal on the right, or a terminal. Looking at the rules:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which goes to NT91 NT22. So the string must start with the two non-terminals NT91 and NT22.\n\nNext, I should build a parse tree step by step. Starting from S, the first part is NT91, which goes to NT69 NT96. Then, each of those will have their own productions, and so on until we reach the terminals (the 't' tokens) which match our string.\n\nI can map this out step by step, breaking down each non-terminal into their components:\n\n1. NT91 -> NT69 NT96\n2. NT22 -> NT68 NT26\n3. NT69 -> t1 or other non-terminals? Hmm, NT69 in the rules has `t3` as an option, but also in NT6's rules, there's NT6 -> t5, t8, t6, t2, etc. Wait, looking again: NT68 -> NT6 NT41, and NT65 isn't here. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look up all the non-terminals step by step. \n\nStarting with NT91: From the rules, NT91 -> NT8. Wait, no, looking again, the rules for NT8 are: NT87 -> NT95 NT53, NT8 -> t5, etc. Hmm, maybe it's better to list all the non-terminals and their productions systematically.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, since the string is a sequence of 't's, each derived from a non-terminal's terminal production. Each step in the parse should produce one or two 't's, depending on the rules. Since this is CNF, each production either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. However, in CNF, each production produces a terminal or two non-terminals, not multiple.\n\nSo, the process would involve starting with S, then looking at S -> NT91 NT22. So each of these needs to produce a sequence of 't's. That means NT91 and NT22 each would need to produce a list of 't's through their chain of productions.\n\nLooking at NT91: NT91 -> NT69 NT96. Now, I need to see what NT69 and NT96 produce. \n\nNT69: Looking at the rules, does NT69 have a production that's a terminal? Let me check the rules. Oh, I see NT6 has several productions, but NT69 itself (the one in NT91's production) is part of NT91. Wait, actually, in the rules, NT69 is used as a non-terminal in S's production, but I don't see NT69 having a direct production unless I'm missing something. Wait, looking back, the rules listed include:\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95, but that's a non-terminal. I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not listing all the non-terminals and their possible productions. Maybe this is taking too long. Let me see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the string length. The string has 49 't's (counting the spaces). Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. Each split increases the depth of the parse tree. The number of steps in the parse tree for a string of length n is n-1 splits, so the total number of nodes would be n, but the start symbol S must generate this entire string through a series of splits.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if I can find a path that generates the string. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nStart with S: S -> NT91 NT22. So the string starts with NT91 and NT22. \n\nNT91 -> NT69 NT96.\n\nNT69: Let's see what NT69 can become. Looking through the rules, does NT69 have any production that leads to terminals? Currently, in the rules, NT69's productions are not directly listed. Only NT6: NT6 -> NT6 NT2, etc. Wait, I think I'm mixing up NT6 and NT69. NT6 is a different non-terminal than NT69.\n\nWait, looking again at the rules: NT68 -> NT6 NT41. But NT69 isn't listed as a main non-terminal. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rule for NT91: NT91 -> NT69 NT96. And then NT69 -> ... I don't see a production for NT69 except as a part of other rules. For example, NT96 -> 't7' via NT96 -> 't6' or 't5' or something else. Wait, no, checking the rules:\n\nLooking for NT69: Wait, in the list, I see NT96 -> 't6' and 't5'. Hmm, but NT69 is only seen in NT91's production. So NT91 -> NT69 NT96. Then, NT69 isn't further broken down except as part of NT91. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the rules for NT68: NT68 -> NT6 NT41, and NT6 is a non-terminal that may go further. Similarly, NT41 may produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this as a parse tree and see if each non-terminal can produce the correct sequence of 't's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm could help. But since I'm doing this manually, let's try another approach.\n\nLet me assume that each non-terminal eventually leads to a series of 't's. So for NT91, it's NT69 and NT96.\n\nIf NT69 leads to some 't's, and NT96 leads to others, then the combination of their outputs should match the first part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with t5, t6, t3, t5, t9, t1, t2, t7, t2, t5, t9, t6, t9, t5, t6, etc.\n\nAssume S -> NT91 NT22. So the first symbol after S is t5 if NT91 produces t5 and NT22 produces t6, or something. Let's check each NT.\n\nNT91: NT91 -> NT69 NT96.\n\nNT69: Where does NT69 go? The rules show NT95 -> 't7' and NT56 -> 't7', etc. But NT69 as a non-terminal doesn't have a direct production to a terminal. Wait, looking back, NT69 is only in S's production, so perhaps NT69 and NT96 both go to terminal sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a tree structure for the entire string.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming. Alternatively, I can check for all occurrences of two 't's in a row to see if they match any production. But since each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, the string must be a concatenation of such steps.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each production can be derived by the string. Let's try to parse the string step by step, starting from S.\n\n1. S = NT91 NT22\n   - NT91 must produce a part of the string.\n   - Assume NT91 -> NT69 NT96.\n     - So, NT69 and NT96 must produce a sequence of 't's.\n\n2. NT69 -> ?\n\n   Looking at the rules, does NT69 have any production that leads to terminals? I don't see NT69 having direct productions to terminals, only as part of larger non-terminals. Hmm.\n\n3. Maybe instead, I should look for the production rules that lead to 't's.\n\nLooking at the rules, several NTs produce terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5', 't8', 't6', etc.\n- NT26 -> 't7', 't9', etc.\n- NT56 -> 't7', etc.\n- NT76 -> 't3'.\n- NT91 -> leads to NT69 and NT96, which must produce 't's.\n- NT96 -> is a terminal 't'?\n\nWait, checking the rules for NT96: In"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the production rules are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal, except for some that have two terminals on the right. Wait, hold on. The CNF allows for A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if any rule has more than two non-terminals, it's not in CNF. Checking some of these, I see that NT56 \u2192 NT56 \u2192 't0' is okay because it's a terminal, but there's also NT56 \u2192 NT56 and other rules with two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014actually, NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78 is in the grammar, which is two non-terminals, which is fine in CNF. Similarly, NT56 \u2192 NT56 is not in the given grammar, so perhaps all the productions are in CNF. Maybe I misread. Let me check again. Yes, all the right-hand sides of the productions seem to be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t9 t5 t8 t5 t4 t2 t6 t2 t7 t8 t7 t5 t3 t7 t3 t8 t1 t5 t7 t1 t4 t0 t3 t7 t1 t8 t5 t0 t9`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar.\n\nIn CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each internal node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal. So for the string to be generated, every terminal must be covered by exactly one production, and the entire string must be derived from S.\n\nOne approach is to reconstruct the parse tree, ensuring that each production corresponds correctly. But the string is quite long, so manually parsing it might be time-consuming. An alternative is to use the fact that in CNF, the number of symbols in the string (excluding non-terminals) must be one less than a power of two. Wait, not exactly. The length of the string (excluding non-terminals) is important. Let's count the number of symbols in the string: t9 has 1, t5=1, t8=1, t5=1, t4=1, t2=1, t6=1, t2=1, t7=1, t8=1, t7=1, t5=1, t3=1, t7=1, t3=1, t8=1, t1=1, t5=1, t7=1, t1=1, t4=1, t0=1, t3=1, t7=1, t1=1, t8=1, t5=1, t0=1, t9=1. That's 31 symbols. For a CNF grammar, the length of the string must be 2^n -1 for some n, as each step doubles the length after accounting for non-terminals. 31 is 2^5 -1, which is 32-1=31. So it's possible because 31 fits the condition. That means the string could have been generated. However, this is just a necessary condition, not sufficient. So it's possible, but there might be cases where the condition is met, but the string can't be generated due to incorrect non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to simulate the parse. Since the start symbol is S, which produces NT91 and NT22. Then each of those must be expanded, and so on until the entire string is covered.\n\nWait, but NT91 appears in the production S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Let me check where NT91 leads. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT91 on the left side of any rule. So NT91 is an unusual non-terminal. Similarly, NT22: does it appear on the left? Let me check the rules. Yes, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So from S, we can produce S \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 NT91 \u2192 (what?) Wait, in the given grammar, NT91 is not on the left of any production. Did I miss it? Let me go through the grammar again. The provided rules: NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12, NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, etc. I don't see NT91 as a non-terminal in the productions. That's a problem because if NT91 isn't a non-terminal but appears on the right, it must have a production. However, in the grammar given, NT91 doesn't have a rule. So that would mean NT91 either doesn't exist or perhaps it's a typo or error. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the grammar provided starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So NT91 is used on the right-hand side. If there's no production for NT91, that would mean NT91 is a terminal. But the string starts with t9, which is part of the string, but in the grammar, NT91 could be a terminal if it's mapped to a specific symbol. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the productions. Let me recheck: The production NT91 is used as part of S's rule, but NT91 is only on the right-hand side without a rule on the left, unless it's implicitly defined by some other rules.\n\nBut looking through all the grammar rules, I don't see any line with NT91 \u2192 something. That suggests that NT91 is a terminal, which would be unusual because usually, terminals are specific symbols. So, if NT91 is a terminal, then the first part of the string, t9, must correspond to NT91.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t9. So, is there a production that leads NT91 to t9? Let me see. In the grammar, I don't see any NT91 \u2192 't9' line. Hmm, this suggests that there's no production for NT91, making it a terminal that must be mapped elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I've made an error in associating NT91 correctly. But according to the given grammar, there's no production for NT91. So, in that case, the string cannot be generated because the parser would need to produce t9, but NT91 doesn't resolve to anything, so it's a dead end.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I misread. Let me re-examine the grammar lines:\n\n- S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n- All other NT rules have NT on the left. So, no production for NT91. So if T9 is in the string, which maps to NT91, but NT91 doesn't have a production, that's a problem. So the string can't be generated because we can't resolve NT91.\n\nWait, but perhaps NT91 is resolved to 't9' because there's a line like NT91 \u2192 't9' that I missed. Let me check the lines again:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT75 \u2192 't1' (if any), etc.\n- Let me check NT91: There's no line with NT91 \u2192 something. So NT91 is undefined. So if the string starts with t9, which is supposed to be NT91, but without a production, it's impossible. So this suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parsing. Let me try another approach: Let's think of each non-terminal and see if their productions can be resolved.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the string starts with t9, which must be the start of NT91's production. But NT91 doesn't have a production, so it can't produce any terminals. Therefore, the string starts with t9, which can't be derived from NT91 since there's no rule for NT91. Therefore, the entire string cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. For instance, NT91 could be an alias for another non-terminal. But in this grammar, all non-terminals are defined by their own production rules except for NT91. Therefore, NT91 is not a part of any production chain, making it impossible for the string to start with t9 if NT91 has no production.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because NT91 doesn't have a production to map to 't9', causing a dead end in parsing.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-743","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is either a single terminal, two non-terminals, or a single non-terminal that branches into two non-terminals. That usually makes things a bit more structured.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar. It's a bit long, but I notice that many non-terminals are being reduced to terminals (like 't7', 't2', 't9', etc.) and some are combinations. The string I'm evaluating is a series of these 't' symbols, and some non-terminals like NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nThe string is: `t2 t9 t1 t8 t5 t4 t8 t3 t5 t9 t4 t5 t5 t5 t8 t2 t2 t7 t3 t9 t9 t0 t6 t7 t9 t2 t6 t8 t7 t5 t6 t4 t6 t3 t2 t0 t3 t5 t7 t2`\n\nFirst, I should note that the grammar's initial symbol is S, and the first production is S -> NT91 NT22. So, the string has to be derived from S by expanding these non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the start, S generates NT91 and NT22. So, in the string, if I can find that the first two symbols come from NT91 and NT22, that could work.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the string, it's a sequence of all the t symbols. So each production step in the grammar would expand into either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the entire string will be a combination of expanding NTs into t's and non-terminals into other NTs until everything is t's.\n\nSo the string is 39 symbols long, which suggests that the grammar would need to build a structure that expands down to this length. Each step potentially increases the depth but may not necessarily increase the number of t's immediately.\n\nTo approach this, maybe I can look for the leftmost derivation or some pattern. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps the string's length should be a power of 2, but that's only true for non-recursive grammars. Let me check: the string length is 39, which isn't a power of 2, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's invalid. So that might not help.\n\nInstead, maybe I should look for specific non-terminals that produce certain sequences of t's.\n\nLet me look at some of the non-terminals and see how they expand. For example, NT59 might produce t9, but I have to check the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, let's take some key ones:\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\nNT69 -> 't3'\nNT96 -> 't6'\nSo NT7 expands to t3 t6.\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\nNT9 -> 't4'\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\nWait, NT56 -> NT55 NT78\nNT55 -> NT0 NT56\nWait, this seems a bit nested. Maybe I should find the rules that directly produce t's because ultimately, all non-terminals will have to reduce to t's.\n\nLooking for any rules that directly produce t's, like NT38 -> 't2' or NT6 -> 't2', etc. Since the string is a sequence of these t's, I can maybe backtrack the possible NTs that could generate them.\n\nLet me try starting from the string and see if I can work backward.\n\nThe last symbol in the string is t2. Let's look at the rules that produce t2.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT38 -> 't2', NT6 -> 't2', NT26 -> 't2' (wait, actually, looking back at the rules, some have 't2' and others like NT22 -> 't8', but I need to find which NTs produce t2.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT38 -> 't2'\n- NT6 -> 't2'\n- NT26 -> 't2'\n- Also, I see NT12 -> 't1' or 't9', but 't2' maybe comes from NT22?\n\nWait, looking at the rules again:\n\n- NT22 -> 't8', not 't2'. Hmm, another rule might have t2. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nNT6 -> 't2'\nNT6 -> 't5' too? Or wait, it says NT6 has two rules: 't2' and 't5'. So each NT6 is either 't2' or 't5'. Similarly, NT26 has multiple rules like 't7', 't9', 't3', 't6', 't5', 't2' etc.\n\nWait, so for NT26, looking through all the rules, it seems that NT26 can produce several t's, including 't2'? Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT26's rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT26 -> NT76 NT26 (maybe)\nWait, actually, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> NT69 NT50\n- NT50 -> NT2 NT69 \u2192 but NT26 also has:\n- Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, from the given grammar rules, looking for NT26:\n\nLooking through the provided list:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT26 is mentioned in rules like:\n\n- NT26 -> NT79 NT53\n- NT53 -> 't6'\n- So NT26 -> 't9' and 't6', so combined production is 't9 t6'.\n\nWait, but I might need to list all NT26 rules:\n\nLooking again, the rules have:\n\n- NT26 -> 't7' and 't9'? Or is that another NT.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to list all rules for each NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create a decision tree, starting from the string and trying to see if it can be broken down into the rules.\n\nThe string is a series of t's. Let's list them in order:\n\nt2, t9, t1, t8, t5, t4, t8, t3, t5, t9, t4, t5, t5, t5, t8, t2, t2, t7, t3, t9, t9, t0, t6, t7, t9, t2, t6, t8, t7, t5, t6, t4, t6, t3, t2, t0, t3, t5, t7, t2.\n\nThat's 39 t's.\n\nThe initial symbol in the grammar is S, which expands into NT91 and NT22. So the first symbol should be the expansion of NT91 and NT22. But in the string, the first two are t2 and t9. So let's see if NT91 and NT22 can start with t2 and t9.\n\nWait, but NT91 and NT22 each expand into two symbols.\n\nNT91 expands into, say, something that, when expanded, gives the first few symbols of the string.\n\nLet me check the rules for NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules:\n\n- NT91 -> NT95 NT8\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68\n- And so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find the rules that produce t's directly, because otherwise, without a rule generating t's, we can't get to the string.\n\nLooking at the rules, many non-terminals have two terminals:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT38 -> 't2'\n- NT6 -> 't2' and 't5'\n- NT26 has several 't's: like 't7', 't9', 't6', 't3', etc.\n- NT95 -> 't7' (but that's one of the more nested rules)\n- NT0 -> 't0'\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n- NT96 -> 't6'\n- And so on.\n\nWait, so perhaps we can model the string as a combination of NTs that generate a sequence of these t's.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree from the string upwards, expanding non-terminals until we reach S.\n\nBut since the grammar is quite extensive, this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check the counts of certain terminals to see if they make sense with the rules.\n\nWait, considering that each non-terminal expansion replaces one NT with two NTs or a terminal and another NT. So perhaps the number of terminals generated must equal the number of leftmost and rightmost derivations, but this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, since the string starts with t2 and t9, which could correspond to NT91 and NT22, as S splits into NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, NT91 can be 't2' (from the rule NT91 -> ...?

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal on the left side of the arrow expands into exactly two non-terminals. Each production is like A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. Also, terminal symbols are on the right side, but if a production has two terminals, like A \u2192 a b, it's not allowed in CNF because each expansion must produce two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually CNF allows for A \u2192 a B or A \u2192 B a where 'a' is a terminal, but each production should have exactly two symbols on the right. Oh, right, each production must produce two symbols, which can be either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most productions are of the form NTxxx \u2192 NTyyyy NTzzzz, which are two non-terminals. But there are some that have a terminal followed by a non-terminal or vice versa, such as NT95 -> 't7' or NT38 -> 't2', etc. So each production has exactly two symbols on the right, which could be terminals or non-terminals. That seems correct for CNF because each rule splits into two parts.\n\nNow, the key is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these production rules. The start symbol is S, and it has the rule S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the first step is to see if the string can be broken down into the sequences that NT91 and NT22 generate.\n\nLet me write out the string:\n\nt6 t8 t8 t0 t4 t0 t0 t1 t5 t5 t1 t8 t9 t8 t7 t6 t0 t4 t0 t8 t8 t9 t1 t2 t1 t2 t1 t1 t2 t3 t9 t9 t2 t3 t0 t6 t0 t3 t9 t1 t1\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. I'll need to check how each of these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the first step would be to see what NT91 can produce. From the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT95 NT51. So the first two tokens must be the sequence generated by NT95 and NT51.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t6. So that's a terminal. Let's see what NT95 can produce. From the grammar, NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. So it's two non-terminals, NT13 and NT1.\n\nNow, the second token in the string is t8. So let's see what NT1 can produce. From the grammar, NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41. NT97 \u2192 't1', which is a terminal. NT41 \u2192 't0' and 't1'. Wait, no, the production for NT41 is \u2192 NT9 NT51. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, looking back, for NT41 there are two productions:\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nand\n\nNT41 -> 't0'\n\nSo NT41 can either split into two non-terminals or produce 't0'. Hmm, but in our string, after the second token t8, the next is t8 again. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach this differently. Since the starting point is S, which produces NT91 and NT22, and each of these needs to generate a sequence of t's and stuff.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to walk through the string step by step, trying to match each part to the grammatical structure.\n\nLooking at the first part, S produces NT91 NT22. So the string should start with the concatenation of what NT91 and NT22 can produce.\n\nFrom NT91 \u2192 NT95 NT51.\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7' (from the grammar: NT95 -> 't7').\n\nSo that gives us 't7' as the first part, but wait, the first token in the string is 't6', not 't7'. So that's a problem. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me recheck the NT95 production. The grammar for NT95 is indeed NT95 -> 't7'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't6', not 't7'. So that would mean that the first part of the string, t6, can't be generated by NT91 because NT91 splits into NT95 (which is 't7') and NT51. So that would require 't7' followed by whatever NT51 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with 't6', which would need to be part of the NT51 production if NT91 is broken into 't7' and NT51. Wait, no, let's think again.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. NT91 is 't7' followed by NT51. So if NT91 must produce 't7' and then whatever NT51 produces, then the first token must be 't7', but in our string, it's 't6'. So that would suggest that the string cannot start with 't6' if it's supposed to be generated by NT91, which starts with 't7'.\n\nBut that can't be right because perhaps NT22 is producing something else. Wait, no, S is splitting into NT91 and NT22, so the whole string is the concatenation of what NT91 produces and what NT22 produces.\n\nSo for NT91, the first symbol is 't7', so the string should start with 't7', but it starts with 't6', which is a conflict.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking at the NT95 production. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, under NT95: it says NT95 -> 't7', so that's a terminal. So that production is terminal; that is, when a non-terminal is replaced by this, it produces just 't7'.\n\nSo, the NT91 produces 't7' followed by NT51. So NT91's expansion is t7 (from NT95) followed by whatever NT51 produces.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't6', which would mean that the entire string can't be generated by S, unless NT51 somehow can generate some tokens that would result in 't6' followed by 't7... but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the NT91 is not the starting point. Wait, no, S always starts with NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, if the first token is 't6', but the initial production requires 't7' as the first part, that suggests that the string is not derivable from this grammar because it starts with 't6' instead of 't7'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something because NT1 could possibly generate 't6' via another path. Let me check if there's another production for NT1.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, for NT1: there are two productions: NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41 and NT1 \u2192 't0'.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT1:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT1 is under which production? Let me find where NT1 is defined.\n\nWait, I think I missed some entries. Let me scan through all the NT entries again:\n\nWait, looking for NT1:\n\nLooking through all the NT entries, I see that there's an NT12 rule: NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12, and NT1 rule is:\n\nLooking for NT1:\n\nYes, here's the line:\n\nNT1 -> 't0'\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully:\n\nThe lines are:\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nand\n\nNT1 -> 't0'\n\nWait, did I miss that earlier? Let me check the list again.\n\nAfter NT54 comes NT1:\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nYes, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\n\n...\n\nFurther down:\n\nNT6 -> 't3'\n\nWait, somewhere else:\n\nWait, the list includes:\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nand also:\n\nNT1 -> 't0'\n\nYes, this is the case. So NT1 has two productions: one that splits into NT97 and NT41, and one that produces 't0' as a terminal.\n\nSo, for NT1, it can either produce 't0' directly or split into two non-terminals, NT97 and NT41.\n\nSo, going back to the initial assumption that the string starts with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-768","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's structured with several production rules starting from S and breaking down into other non-terminals (NT) until reaching terminals (t's and some letters). My task is to figure out if the string `t9 t6 t6 t6 t3 t2 t8 t4 t7 t1 t0 t2 t1 t4 t6 t1 t9 t3 t4 t5 t4 t3 t0 t2 t3 t3 t5 t2 t4 t0 t9 t8 t7 t0 t4 t2 t2 t4 t1 t9 t3` is derived from this grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the final steps where a non-terminal can produce a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see that many of the non-terminals directly produce a single terminal symbol, like NT98 \u2192 t5, NT7 \u2192 t1, etc. Others produce two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I can reverse-engineer the derivation starting from S and see if the string can be split into the required non-terminals. Each step in the derivation would consume two non-terminals from the string and replace them with their respective productions.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into pairs since CNF uses two symbols per production, except for the leaves which produce terminals. Let's see how many symbols are in the string. Counting them: 30 symbols. That suggests that the derivation would need to handle 15 steps, each combining two symbols into a non-terminal.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first two symbols should be NT91 and NT22. Looking at the string: the start is `t9 t6`, so let's check if NT91 can produce t9 and NT22 can produce t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I check NT98 \u2192 t9 (since NT98 is in the rules as NT98 \u2192 t9). Wait, but NT91 isn't directly in the rules. Hmm, so maybe that's a problem. Because in the grammar provided, NT91 is part of the productions, but do we actually have a production from NT91 that produces something?\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has:\nNT95 \u2192 t1,\nbut NT91 is part of the rules in NT91 \u2192 NT56 NT95? Wait no, checking the grammar:\n\nWait, the user listed the grammar rules, let me check carefully. I see several NT rules, but specifically for NT91: no, it's not listed. Hmm. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar is listed as:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nThen, the NT rules are listed later. Oh, here's NT95 -> t1,\nand other rules like NT68 -> NT6 NT41,\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96,\nand others.\n\nBut looking for NT91 in the rules, I don't see it. Wait, did I miss it? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list: I don't see a rule for NT91. It's only defined in S as NT91. So, that's a problem. Because in CNF, each non-terminal has production rules. If NT91 is only in S as a non-terminal, but not defined further, then it's not a terminal. However, in the string, the first symbol is t9. So if S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and the first symbol is t9, it would require NT91 to produce t9. But unless NT91 has a production that ends with t9, this might not be possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again carefully. Let me go through the list of NT rules:\n\nNT95 \u2192 t1,\nNT38 \u2192 t2,\nNT6 \u2192 t5,\nNT6 \u2192 t8,\nNT26 \u2192 t7,\nNT90 \u2192 t9,\nNT8 \u2192 t5,\nNT79 \u2192 t3,\nNT31 \u2192 t2,\nNT55 \u2192 t8,\nand others.\n\nBut nowhere do I see a production for NT91. It's only used in the top-level rule S \u2192 NT91 NT22. That suggests that NT91 isn't further defined, so perhaps that's a mistake, but maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check again. The rules are:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68 <-- Wait, NT51 appears here.\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1 <-- Hmm, that's a production.\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31 <-- self-embedding, which in CNF should be handled via epsilon productions or another way, but in this case, it's split into two.\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95 <-- another rule, which might suggest a loop or something?\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56 <-- another production.\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51 <-- production.\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0 <-- another production.\n\nNT95 -> 't7' <-- Ah, wait, is this possible?\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT95 -> 't7' <-- Oh, so some non-terminals can produce a terminal directly, not just two non-terminals. That would make sense, as in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So NT95 can produce 't7'.\n\nWait, but in this case, looking at the grammar, several of the NT rules produce a single terminal, like NT98 \u2192 t5, NT7 \u2192 t1, etc. So, perhaps NT95 is another such rule.

For example, NT6 appears twice with 't5' and 't8', which seems conflicting. Similarly, NT22 appears as 't8', but also as 't2', and so on. That might complicate things, but perhaps these are typos or I'm misinterpreting. Let me check carefully.\n\nLooking at NT6: two rules: NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'. Similarly, NT22 has two different productions. That makes the grammar ambiguous, but since it's in CNF, perhaps it's okay as long as all productions conform to two non-terminals on the right. Wait, S is the start, but all other rules have two non-terminals except some which may produce terminals directly. Hmm, maybe not. Let me see.\n\nBut the key is that the grammar needs to generate a string, which is a sequence of terminals. So, each production must expand until all symbols are terminals. Let's look at the string provided: it's a sequence of 42 tokens, all starting with 't', except for the numbers. Wait, no, looking at the string, it's a series like 't5 t6 t8 t1 ...', so all are 't' followed by digits. So all are terminals. Wait, but in the grammar, the symbols are NT and numbers, but the only terminals are 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The grammar has non-terminals like S, NT22, NT87, etc., and some production rules directly produce terminals like 't7', 't2', etc. So the entire string is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.\n\nThe given string is quite long, but perhaps I can find a way to parse it using the grammar. Alternatively, maybe the string can be broken down step by step using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to write out the possible expansions and see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut with the given grammar, perhaps it's simpler to construct a parse tree from the string upwards. Let's start with the entire string and see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, maybe I should look for patterns or see if the non-terminals can be chained together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to see if each part of the string can be matched by some production. Let's consider the start symbol S, which produces NT91 and NT22. So S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first parts after S would be the concatenation of the expansions of NT91 and NT22. So let's split the string into two parts: one part to be generated by NT91 and another by NT22.\n\nBut the string is a single sequence, so maybe I can try to find splits that match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the entire string can be generated by S, which requires that the string is the concatenation of the two components produced by NT91 and NT22.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by stepping through the string from the start and seeing how it can be broken down.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's complicated given the length. Alternatively, maybe I can look for some key markers in the string and map them to the productions.\n\nLooking at NT91: from the grammar, NT91 produces 't8'. So NT91 \u2192 't8'. So if the string starts with 't8', then that would correspond to NT91. Alternatively, if it's followed by something, maybe NT91 can produce more.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT91 only produces 't8', so if NT91 must be followed by nothing except 't8' unless there are other productions I'm missing. But in the given grammar, NT91's production is only to 't8', so if NT91 is part of the string, it must correspond exactly to 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT22: production is 't8', so if the other part of S is NT22, then the string must have 't8' as its second part.\n\nWait, so if S \u2192 NT91 NT22, then the entire string must be the concatenation of NT91's expansion and NT22's expansion. So if the first part of the string is 't8' (from NT91) and the second is 't8' (from NT22), the starting two tokens would be 't8 t8', but looking at the string, the first token is 't5', not 't8'. So that's a problem. Hmm, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than that, and it's possible that NT91 is not directly 't8' but through some other productions. Wait, no: in the given grammar, NT91's only production is to 't8'. So if S is NT91 NT22, then the entire string must start with 't8' followed by the expansion of NT22. But the first token in the given string is 't5', which doesn't match. So perhaps S cannot derive the given string, meaning the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check the grammar rules. Oh, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and NT91 \u2192 't8', so combining, S must produce 't8' followed by NT22's expansion, which starts with 't8' (from NT22's production). So the entire string must start with 't8 t8', but the given string starts with 't5', so that can't be.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because S can only produce a string starting with 't8 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-783","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complex, and the string is quite long, so I need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This usually makes it easier to analyze and parse strings.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that each rule except \"NT96\" and \"NT95\" branches into two non-terminals. Wait, actually, most rules seem to split into two non-terminals until I look at NT96 and NT95. Let me double-check that. \n\nWait, NT96 has two rules: NT96 \u2192 t7 and NT96 \u2192 t5. Similarly, NT95 has two rules: NT95 \u2192 t6 and NT95 \u2192 t5. So, all non-terminals either produce two non-terminals or are terminals. That aligns with CNF. Good.\n\nNow, the string provided is `t0 t4 t0 t6 t2 t2 t1 t2 t2 t0 t9 t0 t3 t3 t2 t8 t2 t0 t4 t3 t1 t8 t6 t2 t4 t0 t2 t2 t3 t2 t0 t6 t4 t5 t8 t9 t6 t9 t1 t5 t6 t5`. It's a sequence of tokens, each being a terminal symbol.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step in the parsing process will either expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal. This means that the parse tree will be a binary tree, with each non-terminal node having exactly two children, either non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string's length should correspond to 2^n -1 for some n, which would be the number of leaves in the parse tree. But looking at the string, it has 63 tokens. Let me calculate: 63 is one less than 64, which is 2^6. So, that suggests that the derivation tree might be of height 6, meaning the start symbol S would have to be expanded 6 times, each time doubling the number of symbols.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal. So for the start symbol S, each expansion increases the count by one (since S becomes two non-terminals, then each of those can become two, etc.), but the actual number of tokens depends on how many of those are terminals.\n\nBut since the string length is 63, which is 2^6 -1, that suggests 6 productions from each non-terminal, so perhaps 6 steps down the tree. Let me think about the start rule: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So S starts with two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22.\n\nEach of these can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So the initial expansion from S gives two symbols. Then each of those can split again, leading to more symbols. The number of terminals in the final string depends on how many non-terminals are expanded into terminals versus staying as non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree from the string upwards or trying to match the structure.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a way to represent the string as a series of productions. Since it's a bit complicated, maybe I should look for any obvious discrepancies. For instance, if any token in the string doesn't have a corresponding production, that would immediately mean the string is invalid.\n\nLooking through the string, I see tokens like t0, t4, t2, etc. I need to check if these correspond to any non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT96 can produce t7 or t5.\n- NT95 can produce t6 or t5.\n- NT96 is used when a t7 or t5 is needed. Similarly for NT95.\n\nWait, but in the string, there are multiple t0, t4, etc. So perhaps I need to see if there's a path from S through the grammar that can produce this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to try to traverse the string and see if each step in a possible derivation matches.\n\nLet me start with the first token: t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NT produces t0. Checking the production rules:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69, but that doesn't produce t0. Wait, in the provided grammar, under NT50: NT50 \u2192 NT26 NT69. Hmm, looking at NT26 production: NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT26 or NT6 or NT98.\n\nWait, let me list all non-terminals that can produce t0.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nHmm, looking through all the non-terminals, the NT96 and NT95 produce terminals, but none directly produce t0.

{"custom_id":"request-807","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's see. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help because each production breaks down the string into smaller parts, and I can try to parse the string from the top down.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S -> NT91 NT22. So, S must start the string. Looking at the string, the first token is t7. Let me see what the production for NT91 is. Looking through the rules, NT91 -> NT73 NT95. Wait, no, I might have misread. Let me check again: NT96 has two entries. Oh, no, NT96 isn't relevant here. Let me look for NT91. Hmm, in the rules, NT91 isn't directly present. Wait, maybe I missed it. Looking again... There's NT95 -> NT13 NT1, NT96 is a production that sometimes becomes 't6', but what's NT91? Looking through the rules, perhaps I overlooked it earlier. Oh, wait, the first set of rules: I think I'm missing NT91 in my initial glance. Let me check again. Hmm, maybe I should make a list of all the NT productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this methodically. Let's list out all the NT rules and see how they can derive the string. The string is a sequence of t tokens and sometimes other NTs. Since each production is either a terminal or a combination of two NTs, the parse would involve replacing each NT with its right-hand side until all are terminals.\n\nBut this string is quite long, so processing it step by step might be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if the grammar can produce the string.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string: t7. Wait, wait, in the grammar, some NTs are terminals. For example, NT68 has a production NT68 -> NT6 NT41, but both NT6 and NT41 might resolve to 't5' and 't0' respectively. Wait, looking at NT6-> 't2' because in the rules, NT6 is 't2'. Similarly, NT41 is 't1' because NT41 -> NT9 NT51, which eventually resolve to 't0' and 't4', but wait, let me check NT41's production: NT41 -> NT9 NT51, but the rules say NT41 -> NT9 NT51, which I'm not sure. Alternatively, looking at the last rules, I see NT41 -> 't0' because in the first part, NT41 is 't0'. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, let me go step by step. Let's find each part of the string and see how they can be derived.\n\nThe string starts with t7. Looking at the grammar, which NTs can produce 't7'? Let's look through the rules:\n\n- NT95: NT95 -> 't7'\n- NT22: NT22 -> 't8'\nBut wait, I'm looking for 't7' so NT95 and others?\n\nWait, wait, no, I'm looking for which non-terminals have a production that includes 't7'. Let's see:\n\n- NT95: Not directly, but its production is NT95 -> NT13 NT1. So, not terminal.\n- NT73: Does NT73 have a production that results in 't7'? Let's see: NT73 -> 't6', so it can't become 't7'. Alternatively, NT73 is not a terminal, but another NT.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think recursively. Let's consider each token and see if it's directly a terminal or can be broken down.\n\nLet me list all the terminal symbols. Looking through all the rules, the terminals are:\n\n't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't8', etc.\n\nSo the string is made up of these terminals. Now, the goal is to parse this string top-down.\n\nThe first symbol is t7. Looking at the grammar, which NTs can produce t7?\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7' because in the rules, NT95 has a production NT95 -> 't7'? Let me check: Oh, yes, I think the lines with 't9', 't8', etc., are terminal symbols, so some NTs directly expand to 't7'. Let me check each line:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, each rule is a production. For example:\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1, and some lines are like 't7' etc.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT95 -> 't7', yes. Also, NT50 -> 't0', etc.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t7, which must be produced by NT95. So, the first part of the string is derived from NT95, which is one non-terminal.\n\nSo the string starts with t7, which comes from NT95, so we have NT95 -> 't7'.\n\nBut wait, the rest of the string is longer, so perhaps NT95 is part of a larger production. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The full production for NT95 is NT95 -> NT13 NT1. So, perhaps NT95 can produce 't7' directly or via another path. Wait no, no. Looking at the grammar again, NT95 is defined as NT95 -> NT13 NT1, so it's always a combination of two NTs, except in some cases where it directly maps to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at all the lines again, some have 'tX' as the second part. For example, looking through the rules:\n\nLine 2: NT22 -> 't8'\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me check all lines.

My goal is to determine whether the string is generated by the grammar. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right or just one terminal.\n\nLooking at the structure, the top-level production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string must start with the concatenation of what NT91 and NT22 generate. Both NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals, so I'll need to expand each to their respective terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t7 t5 t9 t3 t7 t4 t2 t6 t5 t5 t1 t2 t2 t4 t9 t2 t0 t4 t7 t9 t9 t2 t4 t1 t0 t3 t3 t6 t9 t8 t7 t8 t7 t0 t8 t6 t7 t5 t7 t5 t0 t9`.\n\nThat's 47 tokens long. Since each production can produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal, I might need to do a lot of expansions, or perhaps there's a pattern or a way to represent this as a tree.\n\nLet me start by expanding S. S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string starts with NT91's expansion followed by NT22's expansion. Let me first figure out what each of these non-terminals expand into.\n\nLooking at NT91: The production is NT91 \u2192 NT7 NT96. NT7 is another non-terminal. Expanding NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96. Let's see where NT69 and NT96 go.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT56 NT56. Wait, is that correct? Wait, looking back, I see NT69's production: Wait, in the grammar, I think I have to find each NT's production. Let me check:\n\nThe grammar has:\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\nNT91 -> NT7 NT96\nWait, looking for NT69: I see NT69 is not directly listed, but maybe it's in another production. Wait, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, I think I might have missed some. For example, looking for NT69, I see:\n\nWait, looking again, NT68 is NT6 \u2192 't5' and NT6 \u2192 't8'? Wait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\nNT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, but some non-terminals have two productions, like NT6: NT68 -> NT6 NT41, and NT6 -> 't5' or 't8'. Wait, no, no, the productions are all either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, the grammar seems a bit jumbled. Let me take it slowly.

Wait, no, let's see: NT26's productions: In the grammar, looking up NT26:\n\nLooking through the list, I spot NT26 appears here: NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, and other lines. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the production for NT26 is: NT26 \u2192 't7'. Wait, let me find NT26's production.\n\nLooking through the list: I see:\n\n- NT26 isn't directly listed as a production on the right-hand side of any rule except perhaps implicitly. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through all productions, it seems NT26 is defined in NT76 as NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, but NT26's production isn't directly listed. Wait, no, looking through all the productions, I don't see any line starting with NT26 \u2192 something. So perhaps NT26 is a terminal? Or perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\n- NT26's productions: Hmm, in the list, I don't see a line where NT26 is on the left. That suggests that NT26 must be a terminal, as it's not present on the left of any production. So the production rules only have NT26 as a terminal, meaning it's a terminal symbol. So in the string, when I see 't7', it could correspond to NT26. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in the grammar, if a non-terminal has a production that results in terminals, but if it's not on the left, then it's a terminal. So NT26 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the productions are all rules that start with a non-terminal on the left. So any non-terminal that isn't on the left of any rule is a terminal? Or perhaps more accurately, any symbol that appears only on the right side is a terminal. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7', so 't7' is a terminal.\n\nSo, let's check: NT26 appears only on the right-hand side of NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. So NT26 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals like NT69, NT56, etc., have rules, so they are non-terminals.\n\nSo, now, going back to expanding S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string starts with NT91's expansion followed by NT22's.\n\nLet's tackle NT91 first: NT91 \u2192 NT7 NT96.\n\nSo, the expansion will be [NT7] [NT96].\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96.\n\nSo, the expansion is [NT69 NT96 NT96] ?\n\nWait, no, NT7's production is NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96, so substituting into NT91:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT7 NT96 \u2192 (NT69 NT96) NT96 \u2192 NT69 NT96 NT96.\n\nSo the string so far is NT69 NT96 NT96.\n\nBut NT69 \u2192 NT56 NT56.\n\nSo, replacing NT69:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of symbols like 't3', 't1', etc. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol S, which produces NT91 NT22.

So perhaps NT91 only appears in this way, meaning it's an auxiliary symbol or perhaps a non-terminal. Wait, maybe I missed a rule for NT91.\n\nWait, looking at the list again. The rules are as provided: after NT87, NT12, etc., I think that's all. So the only place NT91 appears is in S, so perhaps it's only used there. But then S can't produce anything else except NT91 and NT22. Wait, but that suggests that NT91 and NT22 are the only non-terminals used from S. But in the given rules, I don't see NT91 having a production beyond that. So perhaps NT91 can only derive 't8' because rule 25: NT95->'t7', but wait, let's trace all rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's approach this differently.\n\nEach rule is a production where the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is two non-terminals (except for those that are terminals, which only have one terminal as RHS when they are terminal).\n\nLooking at the rules, let's find which non-terminals are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nBased on the rules, any non-terminal that has a production ending with a terminal symbol must have that terminal as a direct derivation.\n\nSo, for example, NT95 -> 't7' implies that NT95 can be rewritten to 't7', so 't7' is a string symbol, not a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT56->'t7' makes 't7' a terminal.\n\nLooking at all the rules, let's see:\n\nNT2-> 't5'\n\nNT2-> 't8'\n\nWait, but NT2 appears in two rules: one is production 12: NT2->NT73 NT38\n\nAnother is rule 33: NT2 -> 't5'\n\nWait, so if NT2 can be NT73 NT38 or 't5', then when deriving, depending on the path taken, NT2 can produce either of these. But since the system considers leftmost derivations, the steps might be crucial.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check all the rules where the RHS is a terminal.\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\nNT26->'t7'\n\nNT8->'t5'\n\nNT8->'t4' (rule 35?)\n\nWait, let me check the list again.\n\nWait, rule 27: NT6 -> 't5'\n\nRule 28: NT6 -> 't8'\n\nRule 29: NT26 -> 't7'\n\nRule 30: NT90->'t9'\n\nRule 31: NT8 -> 't5'\n\nRule 32: NT56 -> 't7'\n\nRule 34: NT41 -> 't0'\n\nRule 35: NT8 -> 't4'\n\nRule 36: NT79-> 't7'\n\nRule 37: NT9-> 't4'\n\nRule 38: NT45-> 't6'\n\nRule 19: NT1->'t8'?

For example:\n- NT6 \u2192 't5' (appears twice)\n- NT6 \u2192 't8' (appears three times)\n\nThis might be a typo, perhaps they meant to have different productions, but for now, I'll note that NT6 can produce either t5 or t8.\n\nSimilarly, NT56 has two productions:\n- NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\n- NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n\nThis seems a bit redundant unless one of these produces a terminal symbol eventually.\n\nOther important parts to look at are NT91, NT22, and the subsequent productions.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So from S, we need to derive NT91 and NT22.\n\nFor NT91: Looking at the grammar, there's NT91 \u2192 NT91 NT90, and then NT90 \u2192 NT90 NT87?

{"custom_id":"request-845","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a single non-terminal. But looking at the grammar, some rules produce terminal symbols directly, like `NT95 -> 't7'`. That's allowed in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t9 t5 t8 t9 t6 t6 t8 t9 t8 t9 t8 t9 t2 t0 t8 t5 t0 t7 t3 t0 t9 t7 t6 t8 t6 t3 t1 t5 t0 t1 t5 t8 t8 t9 t7 t8 t3 t9 t8 t8 t9 t0 t4 t7 t8`.\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nLet me outline the steps I think I should take:\n\n1. **Understand the Grammar Structure**: Each non-terminal on the left side of the production produces exactly two symbols on the right. Some of these are further non-terminals, others are terminals. So, each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two symbols, which may themselves be non-terminals or terminals.\n\n2. **Determine the Length of the String**: The given string has 50 tokens separated by spaces. Each production rule in the grammar results in either two non-terminals or two terminals. Therefore, the number of symbols in the string should be equal to 2^k, where k is the number of steps from the start symbol. Since the string length is 50, which is not a power of two, this might already indicate a problem because the number of symbols should be a power of two (each step doubles the number of symbols from the previous level).\n\n3. **Check the Length Fit**: Let's see, starting from S, each production step doubles the number of symbols. So the possible numbers of symbols after k steps would be 2^k. The initial symbol S produces a string of length 2 after one step, then 4, 8, 16, etc. However, the given string has 50 symbols, which is not a power of two. The closest powers of two are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). Since 50 isn't a power of two, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a solid point. Let me double-check. If each production rule replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, then starting from S, the first expansion would produce 2 symbols, then 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. So 50 isn't a power of two. Therefore, the string can't be generated because the length is incorrect.\n\nBut I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the grammar works. Let me think again.\n\nIn the grammar, each production is two symbols (non-terminals or terminals). So each application of a production rule to a non-terminal adds one more symbol to the string (since each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, so the total length increases by one each time). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, no. If the start symbol is S, then the first step replaces S with NT91 and NT22, so the string becomes two symbols (assuming NT91 and NT22 are terminals or non-terminals). Each NT might be a terminal or another non-terminal. If NT91 is a terminal, then the string would have two symbols after the first production. If it's a non-terminal, then it would be replaced by two symbols in the next step, so the total would be four symbols after two steps, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Each production rule produces exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So the total length in terms of symbols (terminal and non-terminal) is always 2^k after k steps. However, when considering only terminals, the length depends on how many non-terminals are resolved into terminals at each step. But regardless, the total number of terminal symbols must be equal to 2^k for some k because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, maintaining the exponential growth.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each application of a production rule replaces one non-terminal (which could be a non-terminal or a terminal) with two symbols. So the number of symbols (both terminals and non-terminals) is multiplied by one each time a non-terminal is expanded. For example, if you have a string of length n (with m non-terminals), after expanding one non-terminal, the string becomes n+1. So the total length grows by one each time a non-terminal is expanded.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify: In CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, where A is a single non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. So each application of a production rule increases the number of symbols in the string by 1 because one non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. However, if those symbols are non-terminals, they must be expanded further. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, producing the final string.\n\nTherefore, the number of terminal symbols in the final string should be equal to the number of non-terminals expanded plus the initial symbols. But I'm getting myself confused. Alternatively, the total number of terminal symbols in the produced string must be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is 2^k, where k is the height of the parse tree (number of times non-terminals were expanded). So the number of terminals should be a power of two.\n\nIn this case, the string has 50 terminal symbols. 50 is not a power of two (since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64). Therefore, it's impossible for this string to be generated by the given grammar because the grammar only produces strings with a number of terminals that's a power of two.\n\nAdditionally, looking at some of the production rules, for example, NT56 can produce NT5 and 't7', which are a terminal and a non-terminal. But regardless, the total number of terminals must be a power of two because each non-terminal expansion doubles the number of symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-842","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t0 t5 t0 t7 t1 t7 t0 t9 t9 t0 t1 t6 t9 t8 t7 t9 t4 t3 t5 t6 t8 t1 t6 t8 t5 t9 t8 t0 t9 t8 t1 t5 t6 t9 t8 t7 t5 t7 t5 t3 t7 t1 t6 t4 t9`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The grammar starts with S -> NT91 NT22, which means the start symbol S will expand into NT91 and NT22. Each of these should eventually lead to sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are a lot of non-terminals that eventually produce 't's or other non-terminals. The approach is to parse the string from the start and see if it can be derived using the grammar.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into parts. The string has 42 tokens, so I'll need to see if the grammar can generate 42 terminals. Since each non-terminal S produces two non-terminals, I'll need to ensure that the entire string can be formed by these expansions.\n\nI think the best way is to try to parse the string by starting from the beginning and seeing which non-terminals can produce the sequence. For example, the first part of the string is 't0 t5 t0 t7 t1 t7 t0 t9 t9 t0 t1 t6 t9 t8 t7 t9 t4 t3 t5 t6 t8 t1 t6 t8 t5 t9 t8 t0 t9 t8 t1 t5 t6 t9 t8 t7 t5 t7 t5 t3 t7 t1 t6 t4 t9'. \n\nWait, actually, that's a lot. Since the string is quite long, maybe it's better to think about what the grammar produces in terms of patterns. For example, each rule might correspond to certain sequences of 't's and terminals. \n\nLooking at the rules for NT91, NT22, etc., each seems to eventually produce some 't's or sequences that lead to 't's. For example, NT91 -> 't8', which is a single 't'. So if the string starts with 't8', that would be a match. But in this case, the first token is 't0'. So I need to see which rule produces 't0'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT50 -> 't9', NT97 -> 't1', NT41 -> 't0', and a few others. Wait, does any of the non-terminals directly produce 't0'? Let me check the rules. \n\nYes, NT41 -> 't0' and NT26 -> 't1', NT2 -> 't5', etc. Also, NT51 -> 't3', NT79 -> 't7', etc. So none of the immediate productions give 't0', except perhaps through other rules.\n\nWait, but maybe through a chain of productions. For example, NT26 -> 't1', which may come from other rules. Alternatively, perhaps the initial grammar rules are such that S splits into two parts, and each part needs to produce a specific sequence of 't's and non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the steps are recursive. For example, S -> NT91 NT22, so the first part could be NT91 and the second NT22. Each of these non-terminals eventually leads to certain sequences. So the entire string would be formed by concatenating the sequences from NT91 and NT22.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string is divided into two parts: the first part corresponds to NT91, the second to NT22. So I can split the string into two halves and see if each half can be derived from their respective non-terminals.\n\nBut let me check the string length. 42 tokens. If each non-terminal S -> NT91 NT22, then the string is the concatenation of NT91's tokens and NT22's tokens. So total tokens should be len(NT91_sequence) + len(NT22_sequence) = 42.\n\nBut let's see, the string is length 42. So each non-terminal must generate a certain number of tokens. But without knowing the exact counts from NT91 and NT22, it's hard to split. Alternatively, perhaps some rule leads to a longer string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's start with the first token, which is 't0'. So which non-terminals produce 't0'? Looking at the rules, NT41 -> 't0'. So that would be good.\n\nNow, to get 't0', the rule could be directly S -> NT91 NT22, so if one of these is NT41, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, if either NT91 or NT22 produces 't0' through a chain. Let's see.\n\nLet me check the NT41 rule. NT41 -> 't0'? Or wait, no. Looking back:\n\nNT41: NT41 -> NT9 NT51, which seems to go on. It's not directly 't0'. Wait, no, I'm looking back. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the user message above, the grammar rules include:\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51, then NT5 -> NT90 NT79. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps NT41 can produce 't0' via a series of rules.\n\nLooking again at the rules:\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nNT9 -> 't4'\n\nNT51 -> 't3'\n\nWait, so that would produce 't4' and 't3', but I'm not getting 't0' that way.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules more carefully. Looking at the grammar provided:\n\nIn the list, there's NT41 -> NT9 NT51, and NT51-> 't3'. Similarly, NT9-> 't4'. So NT41 would produce 't4' 't3' which is 't4t3'.\n\nBut that's not 't0'. So maybe NT41 can't directly produce 't0'.\n\nWait, but earlier, I noticed that NT26 -> 't1', and NT12 -> NT8 NT12, which could lead to 't8's or more rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the top-down approach is better. Let's try to see if the string can be generated by S.\n\nStarting with S -> NT91 NT22. The string starts with 't0 t5...', so the first symbol from NT91 would be 't0'.\n\nWait, but how does NT91 produce 't0'? Let me see the rules for NT91.\n\nLooking at NT91, the rule is NT91 -> 't8'. So if NT91 is 't8', that would be the first symbol. But the string starts with 't0', not 't8', so this can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the NT91 and NT22 roles switched. Maybe NT22 produces the first tokens. Let's check NT22's rules.\n\nNT22: NT22 -> NT87 NT98. Let's look at NT87: NT87-> 't95' NT53. NT95 is a terminal: NT95->'t1'. NT53 is NT53: NT53->'t3'. So NT87->'t95' 't3' which is 't95t3', but 't95' is not a terminal\u2014it's another non-terminal in the grammar? Wait, in the user message, the rules include 't5', 't8', etc., but wait: some of these appear in the rules as NT -> 't...'. Let me see all the rules where a non-terminal is followed by t and a number.\n\nLooking through the user message:\n\n- NT51->'t3'\n- NT79->'t7'\n- NT98->'t5'\n- NT26->'t1'\n- NT96->'t0' (I think, checking: NT96->'t0' is not in the user message.

{"custom_id":"request-866","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) that's presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar looks a bit complex with all those non-terminals, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it indeed follows this structure. Each non-terminal on the left produces two other non-terminals on the right, except for a few that produce terminals like 't7', 't2', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t4 t0 t1 t0 t3 t9 t7 t6 t8 t9 t9 t3 t1 t0 t5 t1 t4 t6 t5 t9 t2 t7 t3 t0 t0 t4 t4 t7 t9 t7`. It's quite long, so breaking it down into smaller chunks might help.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can apply a recursive descent parser or a simple parsing algorithm. Each production allows us to split the string into chunks defined by these terminals.\n\nStarting with the top-level production: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string must start with NT91 producing the first part and NT22 producing the second part. Let's look at the string:\n\nIt starts with t4 t0 t1 t0 t3 t9 t7 t6 t8 t9 t9 t3 t1 t0 t5 t1 t4 t6 t5 t9 t2 t7 t3 t0 t0 t4 t4 t7 t9 t7.\n\nFirst, check NT91. Looking at the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT13 NT1. Wait, but looking through the list, I don't see any production for NT91. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nWait, I see a production NT91 -> nt8 nt9. Hmm, or actually, looking through the list, I see that NT91 is not directly present as a rule. The rules provided are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, I see NT91 -> NT73 NT78. Then NT73 can be broken down further: NT73 \u2192 NT69 NT76. NT69 \u2192 NT3, and NT76 \u2192 NT3 as well.\n\nWait, no, let me recheck:\n\nThe rules are listed in the context, so let's go through each line:\n\n- NT91 -> NT73 NT78\n- NT73 -> NT69 NT73\n- NT76 -> NT68 NT26\n- NT68 -> NT25 NT31\n- NT25 -> NT45 NT50\n- NT50 -> NT2 NT69\n- NT41 -> NT9 NT51\n- NT51 -> ... etc.\n\nWait, it's a bit confusing because there are many rules. Let's try to map out the structure.\n\nWait, maybe the first step is to identify all the non-terminals and their productions. But maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, we can represent it as a set of productions and try to match the string from start to finish.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the string must be split into two parts corresponding to NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, let's first process NT91, which breaks down into NT73 NT78.\n\nLooking at NT73 and NT78:\n\nWait, NT73 \u2192 NT69 NT73, which seems like a recursive rule. Similarly, NT78? Hmm, looking back, is there a production for NT78? Let me scan through the list again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I don't see NT78 directly, but perhaps it's derived from other productions. Wait, I see NT78 in the string. Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking for NT78 productions: I see several rules producing it. For example, NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41. Not NT78. Hmm, but I need to find NT78 in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68, which seems like a recursive rule. Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach.\n\nInstead of focusing on the non-terminals, perhaps I can directly parse the string by matching from the top down. Each production generates two terminals, so the string should be split into pairs of terminals generated by each production.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of 39 terminals. If each production step corresponds to generating two terminals, then the total number of steps would be such that 2^k = 39, which doesn't make sense because 39 is not a power of two. Therefore, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, no, actually, the parsing approach isn't necessarily generating all possible pairs. The grammar's leftmost derivation splits the string into parts where each step combines two symbols into one non-terminal. So the string is just a sequence of terminals, and each step in the parse combines two terminals into a non-terminal, eventually leading up to the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, since it's CNF, we can represent the grammar using a tree where each node is a non-terminal and has two children, which are either terminals or non-terminals. The string must match this tree structure.\n\nSo, starting from the root S, which is NT91 NT22. So, let's separate the string into first part corresponding to NT91 and the second to NT22.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe first part is t4 t0 t1 t0 t3 t9 t7 t6 t8 t9 t9 t3 t1 t0 t5 t1 t4 t6 t5 t9 t2 t7 t3 t0 t0 t4 t4 t7 t9 t7.\n\nWe need to split this string into two parts: the first part must be generated by NT91 and the second by NT22.\n\nLet's process NT91 first. NT91 \u2192 NT73 NT78.\n\nNow, NT73: Looking through the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT69 NT73, which suggests NT73 can split into NT69 and NT73. So recursively, this could generate a string of multiple NT69 and NT73s, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nBut this seems a bit circular. Let's see if NT73 can produce a terminal directly. Looking back, do any rules for NT73 produce a terminal? I don't see it. It only breaks down into NT69 NT73. So perhaps NT73 can only generate a terminal if there's another way to break it down.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up from the leaves towards the root. Each terminal is a token, so each production step combines two terminals. So perhaps the parsing is about grouping the string into pairs of terminals based on the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the most straightforward way is to simulate the parse.\n\nLet's write the string as a list: [t4, t0, t1, t0, t3, t9, t7, t6, t8, t9, t9, t3, t1, t0, t5, t1, t4, t6, t5, t9, t2, t7, t3, t0, t0, t4, t4, t7, t9, t7]\n\nThe top-level production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the full string is the concatenation of the parse of NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet's first parse NT91. NT91 \u2192 NT73 NT78.\n\nSo we need to split the string into two parts: the first part is the parse of NT73 and the second is the parse of NT78.\n\nBut wait, how are we splitting the string? Because NT73 is a non-terminal that may consist of multiple terminals and non-terminals. So this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a memoization approach or a recursive function where each function tries to parse a given substring into a specific non-terminal.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let's try a different approach. Maybe start from the leaves.\n\nLooking for the terminals in the string, let's see if any of them directly correspond to a production that produces a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, we see that several rules produce single terminals. For example:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT56: but both are non-terminals.\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31: same.\n- Hmm, wait, looking again: do any of the rules produce a single terminal?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The string I need to check is quite long, so this might take some time.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules and see if I can identify any patterns or key points. The start symbol is S, and it's broken down into NT91 and NT22. So S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then, each of those NT symbols seems to be composed of other NT symbols until they eventually produce terminals (like t5, t7, etc.).\n\nI notice that some NT symbols directly produce terminals. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7', NT38 \u2192 't2', NT6 \u2192 't5', etc. So the idea is to trace back from the string to see if each terminal can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string again to visualize it: `t4 t8 t9 t5 t2 t5 t2 t0 t3 t4 t7 t8 t4 t8 t8 t5 t3 t5 t2 t9 t5 t7 t6 t2 t2 t6 t4 t4 t9 t8 t5 t8 t3 t2 t8 t3 t7 t8 t2 t8 t9 t3 t2 t5 t5 t1`.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t4, t8, t9, t5, and so on. Let's see if each of these can be linked to some production.\n\nStarting from the beginning, t4. I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t4. Looking through the grammar, I see NT91 \u2192 't8', NT95 \u2192 't7', NT38 \u2192 't2', NT6 \u2192 't5'. Wait, where is 't4'? Hmm, I think I might have missed it. Wait, checking the grammar again, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't4'. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. Looking through all the NT rules, I don't see any NT that produces 't4' directly. That could be a problem because if t4 can't be generated, then the string can't be part of the language. But that doesn't seem right because the string starts with t4, so I must be making a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps there's an NT that does produce t4. Let's go through them systematically. NT95 \u2192 't7', NT38 \u2192 't2', NT12 \u2192 't1', NT76 \u2192 't5', NT2 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't4', NT41 \u2192 't0', NT56 \u2192 't7', NT22 \u2192 't8', etc. Oh, wait, NT9 \u2192 't4'. Yes, there's a NT9 rule: 't9' \u2192 't4'? No, wait, looking up: NT9 is not a terminal. Let's see, under NT9: no, NT9 is part of a production. Let me check one by one.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5' (twice)\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT99 (not here)\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me go through each NT and see if any produce 't4'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT38 \u2192 't2'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5' (x2)\n- NT6 \u2192 't3'? No, in NT6's rules: NT6 \u2192 't5' and NT6 \u2192 't2'? Wait, I'm confused. Let me parse each rule correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar is structured such that each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for cases when they have terminals? Or wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, yes, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example, NT95 \u2192 't7' is a terminal, so that NT95 can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\nNT38 \u2192 't2'\nNT6 \u2192 't5'\nNT6 \u2192 't8' (x2)\nWait, no: let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\nNT1 \u2192 NT79 NT41\nNT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\nWait, that's a bit tricky. So for example, NT95 is a terminal 't7'. So, any NT that can produce 't4' must be an NT that can directly produce 't4' or have a chain of productions leading to 't4'.\n\nLet me look through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\n- NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\n- NT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31\n- NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT26 (Wait, no, that's a rule for NT12)\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NTs and see which produce terminals.\n\nLet's go through each NT:\n\n1.

Let's parse the grammar properly.\n\nThe grammar is in CNF, so each rule is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a.\n\nSo looking at the given grammar:\n\n- S -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT91 -> NT51 NT6 (twice), but wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT productions and their right-hand sides:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-888","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string to be evaluated: `t8 t1 t4 t1 t0 t0 t2 t8 t3 t5 t0 t4 t8 t1 t0 t1 t8 t9 t4 t0 t4 t6 t5 t3 t9 t5 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2`. It's a sequence of 39 tokens, all of which are terminals since none are non-terminals. The non-terminals in the grammar are as follows:\n\nNT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9, NT12, NT22, NT25, NT26, NT31, NT38, NT41, NT45, NT50, NT51, NT53, NT56, NT68, NT73, NT76, NT79, NT87, NT95, NT98, NT0.\n\nEach production in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since all the tokens in the string are terminals, the derivation will go through productions that terminate in terminals.\n\nMy strategy will be to model the string as a parse tree starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first step must be S \u2192 NT91 NT22. That means I need to parse 't8 t1' (from NT91 and NT22) as the top-level structure.\n\nWait, no. Actually, NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals. Each of these must be expanded into sequences of terminals. So, I'll need to expand NT91 and NT22 step by step, ensuring that each of them can derive a sequence of terminals that match the corresponding part of the string.\n\nLet me break down the string into segments corresponding to the productions. For S \u2192 NT91 NT22, the string would be divided into the part derived from NT91 and the part derived from NT22.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT91 can be further broken down. Looking up NT91's productions:\n\nNT91 -> NT95 NT51. So, NT91 must produce two non-terminals. Each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nNT95 can produce 't1' as a terminal (NT95 -> 't1'). So, NT95 -> 't1' directly.\n\nNT51 can expand into two non-terminals: NT51 -> NT51 NT68 or NT51 -> 't3'. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68 or NT51 -> 't3'. So, to derive a terminal, it must terminate with 't3'. Alternatively, it can produce another NT51 and NT68, which might themselves be terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 in S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is a production that directly becomes 't8' (NT22 \u2192 't8'). So, in the string, after S, the first part is 't8', which matches NT22. So, S \u2192 NT91 't8'.\n\nSo, the string begins with S \u2192 NT91 't8'. Then, the rest of the string should be the expansion of NT91 followed by NT22. Wait, no, because S is NT91 AND NT22. So, the entire expansion must use both NT91 and NT22 to produce the entire string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so to parse it correctly, we must start with S, which produces NT91 NT22. So, the string will be the concatenation of the expansion of NT91 and the expansion of NT22.\n\nSince NT22 directly produces 't8', that's the first token of the string. Then, NT91 must produce the remaining tokens: 't1 t4 t1 t0 t0 t2 t8 t3 t5 t0 t4 t8 t1 t0 t1 t8 t9 t4 t0 t4 t6 t5 t3 t9 t5 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2'.\n\nWait, that's 38 tokens, but the entire string is 39, so maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's count: The string is t8, then 38 more terms. So, the S production is NT91 (expands into tokens) followed by NT22 (which is 't8'). Therefore, the entire string would be the expansion of NT91 plus 't8'.\n\nSo, the first token is 't8', which matches NT22. Then, the rest must be from NT91. Let's split the string accordingly.\n\nThe entire string is 't8 t1 t4 t1 t0 t0 t2 t8 t3 t5 t0 t4 t8 t1 t0 t1 t8 t9 t4 t0 t4 t6 t5 t3 t9 t5 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2'. Wait, that's 39 tokens.\n\nWait, wait, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first step is that the entire string should be the expansion of NT91 followed by the expansion of NT22.\n\nSince NT22 is 't8', it's the first token. Then, the rest 38 tokens are supposed to be the expansion of NT91.\n\nWait, 3 tokens: t8 is NT22, so the remaining is 38 tokens for NT91. But that doesn't match the count. Let me check:\n\nThe string is:\n1. t8\n2. t1\n3. t4\n4. t1\n5. t0\n6. t0\n7. t2\n8. t8\n9. t3\n10. t5\n11. t0\n12. t4\n13. t8\n14. t1\n15. t0\n16. t1\n17. t8\n18. t9\n19. t4\n20. t0\n21. t4\n22. t6\n23. t5\n24. t3\n25. t9\n26. t5\n27. t2\n28. t0\n29. t0\n30. t4\n31. t2\n\nNo, that's 31 tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-883","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is composed of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are the terminals. The grammar has a bunch of non-terminals and the rules that define how they can expand. \n\nLet me start by understanding the structure of the problem. A context-free grammar has three parts: the start symbol, production rules, and terminals. In this case, the start symbol is S. All the other non-terminals are on the left side of the productions, and the right sides consist of sequences of non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That makes sense for CNF. Now, I need to generate the string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of tokens: t5, t8, t4, t2, t0, t4, t3, t1, t5, t7, t5, t2, t0, t4, t8, t0, t6, t1, t2, t0, t7, t3, t2, t8, t1, t5, t8, t5, t0, t9, t5, t7, t7, t4, t9, t9, t5, t1, t2, t0, t7, t5, t5, t7, t1, t3, t6. Let me count the number of tokens. Hmm, that's 43 tokens.\n\nTo see if this string is generated by the grammar, I can try to parse it using the given rules. Parsing can be done using a top-down approach, possibly with a stack or a recursive descent method, but since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent is feasible.\n\nLet me plan the steps for parsing:\n\n1. I'll start with S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production for a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n2. For each non-terminal, I'll look at possible productions and see if any expansion matches the current position in the string.\n3. I'll need to keep track of the current position in the string as I consume the tokens.\n4. Any time a production leads to a terminal, I'll check if the consumed token matches. If not, that production isn't viable.\n5. If a production leads to two non-terminals, I'll recursively try to parse those.\n\nBut trying to do this step-by-step manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down into parts that the grammar can handle.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5. Looking at the grammar rules, the only terminal 't5' I see is in NT6, NT7, NT68, NT26, NT96, NT2, NT5, etc. So the first token 't5' could come from any of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is a combination of non-terminals. So the entire string is a series of terminals, and we have to see if the sequence can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until I reach the terminals that form the string. But with a string of 43 tokens, that's a lot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use memoization or dynamic programming to see if the string can be parsed. But again, manual computation isn't practical.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the string follows a certain pattern. For example, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals, so each terminal in the string must be at a position that can be generated by a non-terminal production. \n\nWait, but it's more complex because non-terminals can produce two non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals, until they hit a terminal.\n\nHmm. Perhaps I should trace possible expansions of S to see if it can generate a sequence that matches the input.\n\nLet me start with the initial symbol S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So S is two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22.\n\nNow, I need to generate t5 t8 t4 ... so let's see what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nLooking at the NT91 production: NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT38. So NT91 is followed by NT76 and NT38.\n\nBut wait, the first token is t5. So, the first production after S would be NT91 followed by NT22. But NT91 is followed by NT76 and NT38. So perhaps that's not matching.\n\nWait, no. Because S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So to get the string starting with t5, maybe NT91 produces a terminal, or maybe NT22 produces the t5.\n\nWait, but S is replaced by NT91 and NT22, which might themselves be replaced by other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Now, let's look at NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT76 NT38.\n\nSo, to process NT91, we would split into NT76 and NT38.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t5. Let's see what terminal t5 can come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't5' appears in several productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t5\n- NT6 \u2192 t8 (Wait, no, looking back, NT6 has two rules: \"t5\" and \"t8\".

{"custom_id":"request-904","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string I need to check against it. I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Hmm, Chomsky normal form means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, I notice that some are two non-terminals, some are a non-terminal and a terminal, but I also see some rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal and a number like 't'? Or wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nOh, wait. Looking closely, I see something like NT79 -> NT51 NT76 and then NT79's substitution eventually leads to 't9', right? So these are productions where a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal symbol, like 't...'. So each non-terminal either leads to two non-terminals, producing the string when two rules are applied, or directly to a terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like \"t1 t0 t8 t3 t8 t3 t8 t4...\" and so on. Each 't' is followed by a number which seems to represent the step in the derivation, I think.\n\nNow, the task is to see if this string can be formed starting from S.\n\nSo, the grammar starts with S -> NT91 NT22. So the first step would be to expand S into NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me outline how the string could be generated.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t1, t0, t8, t3... So let's see how these could be generated.\n\nStarting with S, we have NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 expands to NT56 and NT91? Wait no, the grammar for NT91 is NT73 NT78. Wait no, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back: The grammar is provided with rules like NT91 -> NT73 NT78. So NT91 produces two non-terminals. Then each of those can expand further.\n\nWait, let's go through this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t1, which is a terminal. So that must come from a non-terminal that directly expands into that t. Looking through the rules, I see NT91 -> 't9', wait no, NT91 is a non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar, the right-hand sides can be two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT79 -> NT51 NT76, which are both non-terminals, but others like NT54 -> NT50 NT56, etc.\n\nWait, but the terminal sequences in the grammar seem to be things like 't1', 't0', 't8', etc. So for example, in the given grammar, NT54 has a production NT54 -> 't6' in one of the rules. Wait no, looking again: the rules are like NT54 -> NT50 NT56 and also NT54 -> NT7 NT0. Then in another line, NT54 -> 't7', but I think that's not correct because each rule must have either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait no, perhaps the grammar uses a mix where some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. For example, some rules have a non-terminal leading to a terminal like 't7' or 't8'.\n\nSo, for example, looking at the rules:\n\nNT79 -> 't9'\nNT73 -> 't3'\nNT78 -> 't8'\nNT76 -> 't6'\nNT91 -> NT73 NT78\nSo NT91 would produce t3 t8, meaning t3 immediately followed by t8 when NT91 is expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT78 -> NT90 NT87, which themselves expand.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t9, but no, the string starts with t1. Let's see:\n\nThe string is t1 t0 t8 t3 t8 t3 t8 t4 t3 t0 t2 t0 t6 t9 t3 t3 t7 t3 t9 t6 t4 t2 t3 t5 t6 t4 t7 t4 t9 t0 t1 t4 t6 t4 t0 t7 t6 t0 t0 t6 t9 t5 t3 t0 t4 t1 t3 t2.\n\nHmm, let's try to see the steps.\n\nSince S is NT91 NT22, which starts the derivation.\n\nNT91 expands to NT73 NT78, so S -> NT73 NT78.\n\nNow, NT73 expands: let's look at the rules. Wait, in the given grammar,NT73 is not directly there. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT73: I see NT73 has two rules: NT73 -> NT69 NT26 and NT73 -> NT6 NT26.\n\nSo NT73 can expand into two non-terminals, each of which then expand further.\n\nSimilarly, NT78: Looking up the rules, NT78 -> NT90 NT53. So NT78 expands to two non-terminals.\n\nSo after expanding S, we have NT73 NT78, which each expand into two non-terminals, leading to four non-terminals: NT69, NT26, NT90, NT53.\n\nBut wait, no: NT73 is replaced by, say, NT69 NT26, and NT78 becomes NT90 NT53. Then, each of those non-terminals needs to be expanded.\n\nThis could take a lot of steps, but perhaps we can find a pattern or a way to see if the string can be built.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to write out the grammar's possible expansions and see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better approach. Instead of going through all steps, let's look for the initial part of the string and see if it can come from S.\n\nThe string starts with t1 t0 t8 t3 t8 t3 t8 t4 t3 t0 t2 t0 t6 t9 t3 t3 t7 t3 t9 t6 t4 t2 t3 t5 t6 t4 t7 t4 t9 t0 t1 t4 t6 t4 t0 t7 t6 t0 t0 t6 t9 t5 t3 t0 t4 t1 t3 t2.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t1 t0 t8...\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example:\n\nNT76 -> 't6' (from NT76 -> 't6')\n\nWait, I can see some rules where NT... becomes t1, t0, t8, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be segmented into chunks that correspond to the productions.\n\nFor example, the first t1 would come from a production that directly yields 't1'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly yielding 't1'. Wait, let me check: in the given grammar, the right-hand sides include 't1' in NT41-> 't1' and NT6-> 't1'?\n\nWait, looking at the given rules:\n\nNT1 -> ... not seeing direct t1. Let me check all the terminals in the rules.\n\nLooking through the list of rules, I see NT79 -> 't9', NT73->'t3', NT78->... Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nWait, looking carefully, I see:\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\nNT95 -> 't1'\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me find a rule where a non-terminal produces 't1'. Oh, yes, in the rules:\n\nNT95 -> 't1'\n\nThere's also NT5 -> 't4' and NT4 -> 't6', etc.\n\nSo NT95 can produce 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT73 -> 't3' (from NT73 -> 't3'?)\n\nWait, is that correct? Looking for NT... -> t... in the rules:\n\nI see NT54 -> 't7', but I'm not seeing 't1'. Hmm, wait:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT95 -> 't1'\n\nSo that's one way to get 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT76 -> 't6' (I think NT76 -> 't6')\n\nWait, the grammar rules under NT76: 'NT76 -> NT69 NT26' or is there a rule where it directly produces a terminal?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT76 directly producing a terminal, unless I missed it.\n\nWait, the rules include:\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nand\n\nNT79 -> 't9'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing a rule where NT76 produces a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-905","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are terminal symbols. The grammar consists of a start symbol S and several non-terminal symbols (NT prefixes), each of which can be rewritten using other non-terminals or terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to see how the non-terminals can expand. Each production is in CNF, meaning each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. However, some RHS might consist of two terminals, which is allowed since CNF allows productions of two symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t1 t8 t3 t1 t5 t0 t5 t4 t8 t6 t0 t7 t3 t0 t3 t7 t8 t0 t1 t0 t2 t9 t0 t7 t0 t8 t2 t4 t7 t3 t0 t5 t3 t2 t1 t7 t5 t`.\n\nI'll try to parse this string step by step using the grammar. Parsing can be done using a top-down approach, such as the CYK algorithm, or a recursive method, but since the string is quite long, I might look for a way to break it down or find patterns.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S -> NT91 NT22. So, the entire string must be generated by expanding S into NT91 and NT22, each of which expands into their respective components, and so on until terminal symbols are reached.\n\nLooking at the production for NT91: NT91 -> NT8 NT9, but looking back, I see that NT91 is actually NT91 -> NT89 NT1. Wait, let me check the grammar rules provided:\n\nWait, I see some lines like NT91 -> NT89 NT1 and NT79 -> NT51 NT76, etc. So, it's possible that the parsing may involve multiple levels of expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to write down the entire expansion tree or see if there's a pattern that generates the string. Given the complexity, it might help to look for the rightmost or leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, think about the terminals. The string starts with t1, t8, t3, etc., so each production step needs to generate these.\n\nI'll attempt to start from the top and see if I can match parts of the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the string starts with t1, t8, t3, t1,... Let's see if NT91 can produce t1 or t8.\n\nLooking up NT91: I see it as NT91 -> NT89 NT1. Wait, let me check the production rules again:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see that NT91 is mentioned as NT91 -> NT89 NT1, right? Because some lines have NT91 -> NT89 NT1. But in the list, I see: \n\nLooking back, here's the relevant part:\n\nNT91 -> NT89 NT1.\n\nWait, I might be misparsing. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT9 ?\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nI think I might have made a mistake in reading.

For example, NT91 -> 't8', so that's a production that produces the terminal t8 immediately.\n\nSo, for the string, the first token is t1. So S -> NT91 NT22. Let's see what's generated by NT91 and NT22. But wait, that would produce two tokens, the first from NT91 and the second from NT22. However, the string has 25 tokens, which is an odd number, so each production adds one token, so the parse would require an even number of steps. Wait, no, because each step can split into two parts, so it's possible to have strings with different lengths.\n\nWait, but each non-terminal production adds exactly two symbols, either two terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in this case, the given grammar seems to have rules where some RHS produce two terminals.\n\nWait, but in this case, some rules produce two terminals. For example, NT91 -> NT89 NT1. Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, looking again, some rules have RHS made of two terminals. For example, in the given list, NT91 -> 't8', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT76 -> 't5', etc. So it's possible that some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, but each production is in CNF, meaning each RHS is either two non-terminals or a single non-terminal. However, the problem says the grammar is in CNF, which typically means each RHS is two non-terminals, but perhaps in this case, some productions are to terminals. So NT91 -> 't8' is a terminal production, meaning it generates the terminal 't8' directly.\n\nWait, so some of these non-terminals are epsilon productions? No, because in the list, for example, NT56 -> 't0', so that's a terminal. So perhaps the grammar has both two non-terminals and some terminals as productions.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting because in standard CNF, all productions are to two non-terminals.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, I see that most of the productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-926","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It seems like all the non-terminals are on the left side, and each production is of the form NTXY -> NTAB, where AB and XY are digits. Some of these non-terminals have productions that directly correspond to terminals, which are 't' followed by a number, or some are already terminals. For example, NT95 -> 't7' means when we expand NT95, it directly becomes 't7'.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these 't' terms: t6 t3 t0 t4 t7 t1 t8 t8 t4 t7 t2 t0 t3 t1 t7 t4 t4 t5 t6 t2 t4 t7 t0 t8 t5 t1 t5 t8 t9 t6 t2 t0 t5 t7 t1 t7 t3 t7 t9 t4 t3 t7 t4 t8 t5 t7 t1 t5 t6.\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S has the production S -> NT91 NT22. So the expansion will start with NT91 and NT22, each of which will need to be expanded further.\n\nI can approach this by trying to parse the string back from the terminals. Each terminal is the result of a non-terminal production when it's the last symbol. So, I'll work from the beginning of the string, trying to match the symbols and see if their corresponding non-terminals can form valid productions.\n\nLooking at the string's first few symbols:\n\n1. t6\n2. t3\n3. t0\n4. t4\n5. t7\n6. t1\n7. t8\n8. t8\n9. t4\n10. t7\n11. t2\n12. t0\n13. t3\n14. t1\n15. t7\n16. t4\n17. t4\n18. t5\n19. t6\n20. t2\n21. t4\n22. t7\n23. t0\n24. t8\n25. t5\n26. t1\n27. t5\n28. t8\n29. t9\n30. t6\n31. t2\n32. t0\n33. t5\n34. t7\n35. t1\n36. t7\n37. t3\n38. t7\n39. t9\n40. t4\n41. t3\n42. t7\n43. t4\n44. t8\n45. t5\n46. t7\n47. t1\n48. t5\n49. t6\n\nNow, the start symbol S is NT91 NT22. So S represents the production NT91 -> something and NT22 -> something. Looking at the grammar, NT91 -> NT96 NT68. So from NT91, we get NT96 and NT68.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 has multiple productions. Let me see: NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So that's one possibility. Wait, but NT22 also has other rules? Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT22 has the production NT22 -> NT87 NT98, which seems to be used here, perhaps.\n\nWait, but looking at the first symbol, t6, which would come from a non-terminal that ends with 't6'. Looking at the grammar, NT68 -> NT25 NT31, and also NT68 -> NT2 -> t5. So wait, NT68 can be a terminal NT2, which is 't5'? But in the string, the first symbol is t6, so that would require NT68 to expand to a terminal, but in the grammar, NT68 is NT6 -> t2 or NT6 -> t8, according to the given rules. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar again. The production NT68 -> NT6 NT41. Both NT6 and NT41 have productions to terminals. Specifically, NT6 -> t2 and NT6 -> t8 (from NT6 -> t2 and NT6 -> t8). Wait, but according to the given rules, NT6 has two productions: NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nSo NT6 can be either t5 or t8. Similarly, NT41 has NT41 -> 't0', but also NT41 -> 't1'. So NT6 can become t5 or t8, and NT41 can become t0 or t1.\n\nWait, but NT68 is NT6 -> NT41, so NT68 can be NT41. So if NT68 is derived from NT6 and NT41, then NT6 would produce either t5 or t8, and NT41 would produce t0 or t1. But that would mean that NT68 can produce t5 followed by t0, t5 followed by t1, t8 followed by t0, or t8 followed by t1. But looking at the given string, the first symbol is t6, which isn't among these. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express this.\n\nThe string starts with t6. So we have to find a non-terminal that can produce t6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT69 -> 't3', NT66 -> 't5', NT63 -> 't7', etc. But maybe the relevant non-terminals are those that directly expand to t digits.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see NT6 -> 't5', and NT6 -> 't8'. So NT6 can generate t5 or t8.\n\nBut the string starts with t6. Looking at the grammar, is there any non-terminal that expands to 't6'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see NT26 -> 't7', NT26 -> 't9', etc., but not a production that leads to 't6'. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions that end in 't' and see their non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT69 -> 't3'\nNT26 -> 't7'\nNT26 -> 't9'\nNT96 -> 't6'\nNT22 -> 't8' (from NT22's production, if it's an NT that eventually ends in t8)\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think again.\n\nThe string starts with t6, so the first part must come from a non-terminal that expands to t6. Looking at the grammar, is there any non-terminal that directly goes to t6?\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT96 -> 't6'\nYes, that's in the grammar. So if a non-terminal can derive NT96, then we'd get t6.\n\nSo, looking further, NT96 in the grammar has a production NT96 -> NT37 NT85, but also NT96 -> NT37 NT85. Wait, but perhaps that's not the case. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I think I might have misread it. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT96-> 't6'\n\nNT37-> ... ?\n\nWait, the grammar as given:\n\n...\nNT96 -> NT37 NT85\n...\n\nAnd also NT56 -> NT65 NT78, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NTs that directly produce 't' symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT96 -> 't6'\n\nSo that's one way. Also, others:\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12 (this produces t5 or t8 each time, but since it's a recursion, perhaps it's used for longer strings)\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT78-> 't8'\nNT7> etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parse tree, starting from S, and see if the string can be generated.\n\nS is NT91 NT22.\n\nLet me note that S's production is NT91->NT96 NT68. So starting from S, the expansion is NT96 and NT68.\n\nSo the first two parts of the string must be derived from NT96 and NT68.\n\nWait, but the string is a flat sequence, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to match it. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string as leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a recursive descent approach is better, but given"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So the starting symbol is S -> NT91 NT22. \n\nLooking at the productions, each NT symbol eventually terminates into terminal symbols (like 't*' or 't*' where * is some digit). So the entire string is built by recursively expanding these NT symbols until they're replaced by terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards. Since the string starts with t4, I need to see which NT symbol can derive a substring starting with t4.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT56 -> NT55 NT78\n- NT95 -> 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't5' (multiple entries)\n- NT91 -> 't8'\n- NT50 -> NT2 NT69 or NT25 NT50 etc.\n\nLooking at the first symbol t4.

Wait, let me check all productions again.\n\nLooking through the list, the only NT that directly produces t4 is NT9 \u2192 't4'. So the first symbol t4 must come from NT9.\n\nSo, the first production must be NT9, which produces 't4'. \n\nThen, the next symbol after 't4' is 't9'. So now, the substring after 't4' is 't9 ... '.\n\nWait, no, the string is 't4 t9 t9 t2 t7 ...' so the entire expansion should be broken into NT9 -> 't4' followed by whatever NT22 produces.\n\nWait, S -> NT91 NT22. So the entire string starts with NT91 and NT22. But when I look earlier in the productions, S -> NT91 NT22. So the string is NT91 NT22.\n\nBut according to the production of NT91: NT91 -> 't8', so the first t is 't8', but the actual string starts with 't4'. So that can't be. Therefore, there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe I got the order wrong. Wait, S -> NT91 NT22. So the string should start with NT91, which is 't8', but the string starts with t4. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first part is NT91 which produces 't8', but the string starts with 't4'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals (A) and terminals (B, C).\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. Each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and has two non-terminals on the right, except for some rules where a terminal appears as part of the right-hand side. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t5 t2 t4 t4 t3 t3 t2 t6 t5 t5 t6 t3 t6 t2 t5 t7 t3 t8 t8 t0 t2 t3 t6 t1 t3 t2 t2 t7 t3 t2 t1 t9 t3 t2 t3 t8 t1 t0 t9 t3 t4 t3 t0 t1 t5 t3 t2 t0 t1`.\n\nI need to build parse trees starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string. Alternatively, since the grammar is context-free, I can also use the CYK algorithm or other parsing methods, but given the size of the string, that might be time-consuming. Since I'm just thinking through this, maybe I'll use a top-down approach, like the recursive descent method.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts with NT91 NT22. Let me see what the RHS of these are.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT78 NT37 (Wait, no, in the grammar, NT91 is given as `NT91 -> NT8 t8`?

Looking at the grammar, which rules produce t0? Let's look:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, any rule that ultimately produces 't0' will help.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT95 \u2192 't7', which doesn't help.

{"custom_id":"request-31","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string \"t8 t7 t6 t5\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we need to check.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is between two non-terminals or a terminal, and all left-hand sides have exactly two symbols. That should help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the structure of the grammar, we see that the start symbol is S, which expands into NT91 and NT22. Each of these is a combination of two non-terminals. The goal is to see if we can derive the string \"t8 t7 t6 t5\" from S.\n\nWait, but how do the non-terminals expand into the terminals? I see that some of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal in the productions. For example, NT95 -> 't7', so whenever we need a 't7', we can use that production.\n\nFirst, I'll try to find the derivation path that could lead to the string \"t8 t7 t6 t5\". Let's think about the possible sequences of non-terminals.\n\nStarting from S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, S would expand into NT91 followed by NT22. Let's see what each of these can expand into.\n\nLooking at NT91, I see that NT91 -> NT95 NT5. So NT91 becomes NT95 and NT5. Similarly, NT22 -> NT87 NT98, since NT22's production isn't directly given, but looking through the rules, yes, NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nSo now the string is split into NT95 NT5 and NT87 NT98. Each of these needs to expand further.\n\nNT95: Let's see, NT95 -> 't7'. Okay, that's a terminal. So that's a single 't7'.\n\nNT5: From the production list, NT5 isn't directly a terminal, but looking at the rules, I see NT56 -> 't7', NT64 -> 't2', etc. Wait, NT5 isn't directly listed as a terminal. Let me double-check. Looking at the rules, NT5 doesn't seem to produce a terminal, but maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking back, the production for NT5 is not listed. Hmm, so maybe I need to find how NT5 expands. Or maybe NT5 is part of another production.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, let's check for NT55: NT55 -> NT50 NT56. But NT50 and NT56 don't directly produce terminals either. This might get complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead try to find the correct expansion for each step.\n\nWait, the start is S -> NT91 NT22. So first, NT91 and NT22 need to each expand into strings of terminals.\n\nNT91 -> NT95 NT5. So if I expand this, I get NT95 followed by NT5. NT95 is a terminal 't7' as per NT95 -> 't7'.\n\nNow, NT5. Looking at the rules, NT5 isn't a terminal. So I need to find out which production NT5 is involved in. Wait, checking the rules, I don't see NT5 as a start symbol. Oh, but perhaps NT5 is part of another production. Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I don't see any rule where NT5 is on the left side. So maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a rule where NT5 is the result of a production.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. Looking through all the rules, the start is S. Then the non-terminals are NT91, NT22, etc. So I need to make sure each non-terminal is correctly processed.\n\nWait, let me take a step back. Starting with the string \"t8 t7 t6 t5\". Let's see if this can break down into two parts, each derived from NT91 and NT22, since S is NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the entire string is supposed to be a concatenation of the expansion of NT91 and NT22. Therefore, the string should split into two parts, the first part being the expansion of NT91 and the second the expansion of NT22.\n\nLooking at the target string: \"t8 t7 t6 t5\". It has four tokens. So perhaps the first part is 2 tokens and the second is 2, but the grammar's S is two non-terminals, each of which should produce a string that then can be further split.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think recursively. Let's see what the grammar produces.\n\nLooking at S -> NT91 NT22. So for \"t8 t7 t6 t5\" to be produced, perhaps NT91 expands to \"t8 t7\" and NT22 expands to \"t6 t5\". Let me check.\n\nSo first, NT91. NT91 -> NT95 NT5. NT95 is 't7', so that's good. Now, what about NT5? From the rules, NT5 isn't immediately giving a terminal, but perhaps NT5 expands into NT9 or something. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT9 -> 't4', NT41 -> NT4, etc. Hmm, let me check NT5.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I don't see a production for NT5. So perhaps NT5 is not part of any production, which would be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the rule lookups.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the rules. Oh, I just noticed that some non-terminals have multiple productions, so maybe I can find a way to derive 't5' from some non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, looking at NT6, I see NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8'. So NT6 can produce 't5' or 't8'. So if I can get NT6 to produce 't5', that could be useful.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT79 -> NT51 NT76, and then NT51 -> NT51 NT68, etc. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a stack-based parser or try to follow the derivations step by step.\n\nLet me try expanding the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S: S.\n\nS expands to NT91 NT22.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into terminals, but perhaps they produce other non-terminals that eventually go to terminals.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string from the left, breaking it down into the two parts of NT91 and NT22.\n\nSuppose NT91 is generating the first part of the string and NT22 is generating the second part.\n\nGiven the target string is \"t8 t7 t6 t5\", maybe NT91 produces \"t8 t7\" and NT22 produces \"t6 t5\".\n\nLet's see what NT91 produces.\n\nNT91 -> NT95 NT5. NT95 -> 't7'. So the first part is 't7' and then NT5.\n\nNow, NT5. Since NT5 isn't in the rules as a start symbol, maybe it's part of a longer production. Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see NT5, but I see NT56, NT50, etc. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps NT5 is part of a production that produces a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check NT50. NT50 -> NT2 NT69. Wait, that's for NT50. So NT50 can go to NT2 and NT69.\n\nBut that doesn't help with NT5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake and NT5 is actually part of a longer production.\n\nWait, looking back. Wait, I think I might have mixed up some non-terminals. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT79 -> NT51 NT76. And NT51 -> NT51 NT68, but also NT51 -> 't3'? No, looking through, NT51 doesn't seem to produce a terminal. Wait, let me check if I missed any rule for NT51.\n\nLooking through the rules: I see NT51 -> NT51 NT68 and also NT51 -> 't3'? Wait, I don't see that. Wait, no, in the rules, I see NT95 -> 't7', NT38 -> 't6', etc., but NT51's rules are NT51-> NT51 NT68 and NT51-> NT73 NT3. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar again:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7'\n- NT38 -> 't6'\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't7'\n- NT90 -> 't0'\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-56","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string \"t8 t0 t7 t1 t6 t5\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single terminal on the left. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. The right-hand sides of the rules seem to all result in either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production step breaks down a symbol into two parts, either more symbols or a terminal.\n\nThe target string is a sequence of six terminals: t8, t0, t7, t1, t6, t5. Each \"t\" is followed by a number, which looks like it's part of a token. So, I think each of these is a separate token in the string.\n\nI think the approach here is to reconstruct the parse tree in reverse, starting from the target string and trying to see if each token can be produced by the grammar. Since it's a sequence of terminals, each step should match a production rule that can generate each part.\n\nLet me list the tokens again: t8, t0, t7, t1, t6, t5.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to start from the most nested structure and work my way outwards. Alternatively, maybe using a bottom-up approach (like the CYK algorithm) might help, but since I'm not very familiar with CYK, perhaps a top-down approach would be better.\n\nWait, but the grammar is given, and I need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S. So, the string is a concatenation of S's expansion leading to this sequence.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S -> NT91 NT22. So, S breaks into two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22.\n\nEach of these NT symbols must expand into something that can generate the corresponding part of the string. So, the string \"t8 t0 t7 t1 t6 t5\" can be divided into two parts: \"t8 t0 t7 t1\" and \"t6 t5\" perhaps? Or maybe the first part corresponds to NT91 and the second to NT22.\n\nWait, let me think. The NT symbols have specific productions. So, I should first check what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nNT91's production is not given in the rules. Wait, no, in the rules, I see that NT91 -> 't8', or NT91 -> 't8' and maybe another option? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a rule NT91 -> 't8'. So, NT91 directly produces t8.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 is in the production of NT22 -> NT87 NT98. And looking at NT87, which is NT87 -> 't5', so NT87 produces t5. NT98 -> 't5' as well. So, NT98 also produces t5. So, NT22 -> NT87 NT98 can be rewritten as t5 t5, which would be \"t5 t5\". But in our target string, the end of the second part is t6 t5, not t5 t5.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. So, maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overall string is structured differently. Since the string is six tokens long, and the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, perhaps these two non-terminals expand into three and three tokens each. Let me see.\n\nBut looking at NT91's expansion: it can only produce t8, so the part after S is just t8, meaning the first token is t8. Then, the second part from S is NT22, which seems to generate two t5s. But in the target string, after t8, the next tokens are t0, t7, t1, t6, t5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Perhaps the string is split into more parts based on grammar derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is longer, but no, the string is only six tokens. Alternatively, perhaps S's production is S -> NT91 NT22, and both NT91 and NT22 can themselves expand into more symbols, leading to the full string.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I should try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by successively replacing symbols with their productions.\n\nBut that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for possible reductions in the string or see if each part can be consumed by the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the structure step by step. The string is t8 t0 t7 t1 t6 t5.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the first expansion is NT91 and NT22. So, I'd consume t8, which matches NT91 \u2192 't8', leaving the rest as 't0 t7 t1 t6 t5'. Now, the remaining part should be generated by NT22, which expands into NT87 NT98. So, the next tokens are 't0', 't7', etc.\n\nSo, after 't8' comes 't0'. Let's see if NT22 can produce a sequence starting with 't0'. Looking at the rules for NT87 and NT98.\n\nWait, NT87's production is NT87 \u2192 't5', and NT98 is NT98 \u2192 't5'. So, NT22 \u2192 't5 t5', which would be 't5 t5', but the string starts with 't0 t7 t1 t6 t5' after 't8'. That doesn't match, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I've misread the NT symbols. Alternatively, perhaps S's production is NT91 NT22, and each can expand further.\n\nWait, maybe I should try another approach. Perhaps I should look at the symbols from the end and see if each can be reduced.\n\nLet me try that. Let's start at the end of the string with 't5' and see which symbol can produce it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, any symbol that can produce 't5' would be a candidate.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, but I don't see NT76 producing 't5' directly. However, I see that NT6 has several productions including 't5'. Let me check:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5' (twice). So NT6 can produce 't5'.\n\nAnother symbol is NT19 (no, wait, NT2 is NT95, which doesn't produce 't5' in some rules). Wait, looking for symbols that can produce 't5' directly.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT6 produces 't5' in two places: NT6 \u2192 't5' (twice), so that's two options. Additionally, NT2, looking at the production, for example, NT2\u2192 NT73 NT38, but does any production for NT2 end with 't5'? Wait, looking through the list:\n\nNT2: NT25 NT31, and NT25 is NT45 NT50, and so on. I don't see any symbol directly producing 't5' except NT6.\n\nSo, the last symbol must be NT6, since it can produce 't5'.\n\nBut then, before that, 't6' \u2014 wait, the next token before 't5' is 't6'. So after 't8 t0 t7 t1 t6 t5', we have 't6' before 't5'.\n\nWait, but 't5' can be produced by NT6. So, if the production is ... 't6' 't5', then the part before 't6' must produce 't6', and the part after 't6' produces 't5'.\n\nBut the order is reversed. Let me correct this. The full string is t8 t0 t7 t1 t6 t5. So, working from the end, 't5' is the last token. So, that must be produced by NT6, as per the rule.\n\nThus, the part before 't5' is 't6', which must be part of a structure. But the last token is 't5', produced by NT6, so the 't6' before it must have been generated by a production that ends with 't6 NT6', but I'm a bit confused here.\n\nPerhaps I should model the string as a list and try reducing it from the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let's model it as a list: [t8, t0, t7, t1, t6, t5]\n\nEach step, we try to find a production that matches a part of the string, starting from a non-terminal, and replace it with the corresponding right-hand side, thus reducing the string.\n\nSince starting from S, the production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first part is NT91, which immediately produces 't8', so the string starts with 't8', leaving [t0, t7, t1, t6, t5].\n\nNow, after 't8', the next part should come"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Then each of those can be expanded further.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 is a start symbol with NT22 -> NT87 NT98. NT87 and NT98 can each be broken down further.\n\nBut this might get complex. Maybe I should traverse the string step by step, seeing if each \"t\" can be matched by the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to represent the string as a sequence of symbols: t8, t0, t1, t5, t6, t5.\n\nEach of these should come from the productions of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the NT terms:\n\nLet me list all the NT symbols and see what each can produce in terms of the string:\n\n1. NT91 -> NT8 NT5\n2. NT22 -> NT87 NT98\n3. NT76 -> NT69 NT26\n4. NT68 -> NT6 NT41\n5. NT7 -> NT69 NT96\n6. NT12 -> NT8 NT12 (so it can produce t8 followed by any sequence generated by NT12, but since NT12 can produce a cycle, perhaps it's infinite)\n7. NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n8. NT51 -> NT51 NT68 (cycle, leads to infinite possibilities)\n9. NT98 -> NT90 NT87\n10. NT0 -> NT90 NT79\n11. NT56 -> NT55 NT78\n12. NT2 -> NT73 NT38\n13. NT95 -> NT13 NT1\n14. NT50 -> NT2 NT69\n15. NT25 -> NT45 NT50\n16. NT31 -> NT54 NT31\n17. NT79 -> NT51 NT76\n18. NT56 -> NT56 NT95 (cycle)\n19. NT1 -> NT97 NT41\n20. NT54 -> NT50 NT56 (and 56 can cycle)\n21. NT68 -> NT25 NT31\n22. NT1 -> NT12 NT26 (so another cycle)\n23. NT41 -> NT9 NT51 (cycle)\n24. NT54 -> NT7 NT0\n25. NT95 -> 't7' (terminal)\n26. NT38 -> 't2'\n27. NT6 -> 't5' (though NT6 appears on the left, but here it's a terminal)\n28. NT6 -> 't8'\n29. NT26 -> 't7'\n30. NT90 -> 't9'\n31. NT8 -> 't5'\n32. NT56 -> 't7'\n33. NT2 -> 't5'\n34. NT41 -> 't0'\n35. NT8 -> 't4'\n36. NT79 -> 't7'\n37. NT9 -> 't4'\n38. NT45 -> 't6'\n39. NT91 -> 't8' (via NT91->NT8 NT5)\n40. NT78 -> 't8'\n41. NT53 -> 't6'\n42. NT13 -> 't0'\n43. NT73 -> 't6'\n44. NT73 -> 't7' (since in the production NT73 -> NT73 NT76, but also in another production NT73 -> NT6 NT...) Wait, looking back, the productions for NT73 are actually not listed here. Let me check: Looking through the list, I see NT73 is produced by NT73 -> NT73 NT76, which is a cycle. But also, according to some previous entries, perhaps other NT symbols like NT73 are in the productions. Wait, looking at the provided grammar: I see NT73 is mentioned as a production for another symbol, maybe NT41. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, I see that NT12 is defined as NT8 NT12, which is a recursive definition that can produce infinite sequences. Also, NT73 appears as a RHS in the production NT41 -> NT9 NT51 (which doesn't involve NT73), and in NT79 -> NT51 NT76. Hmm, perhaps NT73 has a production, maybe it's not in the list provided, but perhaps it's part of some larger structure.\n\nWait, actually, looking through all the productions, I don't see NT73 on the left side. It seems the productions involve other non-terminals, so maybe NT73 is not a start non-terminal and doesn't have its own production except through the chain of other productions. Hmm, perhaps I need to track each step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a parse tree. Let me try to build the parse tree for the given string.\n\nThe string is \"t8 t0 t1 t5 t6 t5\". Let me list the tokens in order:\n\n1. t8\n2. t0\n3. t1\n4. t5\n5. t6\n6. t5\n\nI need to see if these can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nSo the first two tokens in the string should come from NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet's see NT91's productions:\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT5\n\nSo NT91 should produce a sequence starting with NT8 followed by NT5. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t8, which corresponds to NT8. So that matches.\n\nSo after NT91, which is now expanded into NT8, we have NT5. But the next part in the string is t0. But NT5's productions?\n\nLooking, do we have NT5? I don't see NT5 in the given grammar, but looking through all the productions, perhaps it's a terminal. Wait, the initial tokens start with t8, which is a terminal. So let's look for whether NT5 can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any production for NT5, which might mean that NT5 is a non-terminal that can't produce a terminal directly. Wait, but that's a problem because the string has t5 as a terminal, so perhaps there's a production from NT5 that produces 't5' or maybe 't5' is derived from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT38 -> 't2', which is a terminal. So I'm wondering, perhaps NT6 is a non-terminal which produces either 't5' or 't8'.\n\nLooking at the NT6 productions: in the given grammar, NT68 -> NT6 NT41. So when NT68 is expanded, it's broken down into NT6, which can then be expanded into NT6 followed by NT41. Similarly, NT6 -> 't5' or 't8'.\n\nWait, looking through the provided productions, NT6 appears on both sides. I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n\nSo NT6 can produce either 't5' or 't8' as terminals.\n\nSo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-80","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t8 t0 t5 t7 t1 t6 t5`. I need to determine whether this string is in the language defined by the provided grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. That should help in parsing the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT91 NT22. So, the string should expand from S, which starts by expanding NT91 and NT22. I can think of the string as a sequence of these terminal symbols, so I need to see if it can be derived from S.\n\nLet me break down the string: it's seven tokens long, each being a terminal symbol. The order is t8, t0, t5, t7, t1, t6, t5. So the string is quite long, but since the grammar is built from a series of productions that may connect through non-terminals, I need to see if each step can produce the corresponding token.\n\nI'll start by looking at the productions to see if any can generate these tokens. Let me list out the relevant productions that produce terminals because that's where the tokens come from.\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 T5\n- NT79 \u2192 T3\n- NT68 \u2192 T25 NT31, but wait, NT68 production actually goes to NT6 NT41, so that's non-terminals. Let me check each production.\n\nWait, no, some productions directly give a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 T1\n- NT56 \u2192 T7\n- NT2 \u2192 T5\n- NT9 \u2192 T4\n- NT76 \u2192 T5\n- NT96 \u2192 T6\n- NT73 \u2192 T6 or T7\n- NT69 \u2192 T3\n- NT26 \u2192 T7 or T9 or other term?\n\nWait, I think I might be getting confused because the productions are all written as NTxyz \u2192 NT... or with terminals.\n\nWait, no, the productions like NT95 \u2192 't7' mean that NT95 is directly a terminal 't7'?\n\nWait no, I think the way it's written is that in some productions, the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is a sequence of non-terminals or terminals. So, for example, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. So, NT76 expands into two non-terminals, NT69 and NT26.\n\nBut other productions have terminals as possible outputs. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. Or some might have terminals like 't7' etc.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, some RHS have terminal symbols like 't8', 't0', 't5', etc. So those are terminals that can be part of the string.\n\nWait, but in the given string, all symbols are lowercase t followed by numbers. So each token is a single 't' followed by a digit.\n\nI should note that each token is a single 't' followed by a number, so each can be assigned to a specific non-terminal.\n\nSo first, let's list the productions that produce each terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 NT95 NT53. Wait, that's two non-terminals, but perhaps eventually, NT95 and NT53 can produce terminals.\n\nWait, here's the list of productions and their possible terminals:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 NT95 NT53 \u2192 I need to see what NT95 and NT53 produce.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find all the productions that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given list:\n\n1. NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n2. NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT5\nWait, NT91 seems to be NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT5. Wait, NT5 is not a terminal.\n\nWait, to clarify, perhaps the RHS of each production is a combination of non-terminals, but some may eventually produce terminals.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself. Let me approach it differently: for each terminal in the string, see which non-terminal can derive it, and then track the possible expansion.\n\nThe string is `t8 t0 t5 t7 t1 t6 t5`. So the sequence of terminals is: t8, t0, t5, t7, t1, t6, t5.\n\nTo derive this, starting from S, which is NT91 NT22, each of these must be expanded into the corresponding part of the string.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- NT91 will need to produce t8, t0, t5, t7, t1, t6, t5? But that doesn't make sense because NT91 is a non-terminal, so it's a single step.\n\nWait, no. The string is seven symbols, which suggests that the expansion from S would involve several steps, where each non-terminal is expanded into smaller sequences until they become terminals.\n\nSo each non-terminal must produce a sequence that, when combined, form the string. Let me think of the grammar as a series of steps that produce the string by replacing non-terminals with their productions until all are terminals.\n\nLet me write the string as a list of terminals: [t8, t0, t5, t7, t1, t6, t5].\n\nStarting from S: NT91 NT22.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Therefore, the first two symbols of the string (t8, t0) must come from NT91 and NT22. Wait, but the first token is t8. So perhaps NT91 expands into a sequence that starts with t8, followed by what NT22 expands into, which starts with t0.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's seven tokens, so S must expand into a sequence of seven terminals. That means each non-terminal expansion must contribute the required number of terminals.\n\nWait, but let me check the productions again. Each production for a non-terminal either breaks it down into two non-terminals or produces a terminal. So let's see which non-terminals can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions for each NT:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n- NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\n- NT9 \u2192 NT74 NT31\n- NT96 \u2192 NT91 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\n- NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n- NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n- NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\n- NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n- NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\n- NT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26\n- NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\n- NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT38 \u2192 't2'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5' (appears twice)\n- NT26 \u2192 't7' or 't9' (wait, let me check the productions again).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the non-terminals and their possible productions, focusing on the terminals they can produce directly or eventually.\n\nI think it's best to create a mapping from each terminal to the non-terminals that can produce it.\n\nFrom the productions:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT98 \u2192 NT95 NT53 \u2192 So NT98 can produce a sequence that starts with t7 (from NT95) if NT53 can produce a terminal. Let's check NT53: NT53's productions are not listed here directly, but I need to see elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I don't see NT53 appearing as a production that leads to a terminal. So maybe NT53 is a chain that eventually leads to a terminal. Let's check.\n\nLooking back, NT53 has any productions? I don't see NT53 in the given productions. Wait, let me scan all the rules:\n\nNo, NT53 is not a LHS of any production, which means NT53 is a terminal symbol. But 't53' is not a terminal in the given string. So NT53 can't be part of the string. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, the string doesn't have 't53', so perhaps NT53 doesn't come into play here.\n\nLet me think again.

{"custom_id":"request-77","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t8 t0 t5 t1 t5 t6 t5` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember has productions where each left side has exactly two non-terminals, and right sides can be a combination of them or terminals. But sometimes, terminals can also appear on the left, like in S -> NT91 NT22 where S is the start symbol, so that's not a standard CNF. Wait, no, CNF requires all productions to be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So in this case, the start symbol S is on the left of a production, but since S is the start, maybe that's okay. I'm a bit confused about that, but I'll set that aside for now.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's a bit complex with many non-terminals and terminals. The string to check is `t8 t0 t5 t1 t5 t6 t5`, which has seven tokens. I need to see if there's a derivation path that starts from S and ends with this string using the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S -> NT91 NT22. So any string derived from S must start with NT91 followed by NT22. But the given string starts with t8, which is a terminal. Wait a second, that suggests that S directly produces a terminal, but looking at the grammar, S only goes to NT91 NT22, which would be non-terminals followed by another non-terminal. So that can't be. Unless there's a way to derive a terminal from NT91 or NT22.\n\nWait, let me think. If S can't produce a terminal, but the string starts with t8, that's a problem. Unless I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the start symbol S. The initial production is S -> NT91 NT22. So S must be expanded into two non-terminals. So the first step would be S => NT91 NT22. So the string should start with a terminal derived from NT91 and then the terminal from NT22, but that's not the case here. The string starts with t8, so perhaps one of the NT's can derive t8.\n\nLooking at NT91: It's production is NT91 -> NT89 NT51, according to the given grammar. But wait, does NT91 have any direct terminal production? Looking through the productions, I see lines like NT91 -> 't8', which is terminal 't8'. Yes, so NT91 can produce 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT22: Its only production is NT22 -> NT98 NT93, according to the grammar. Let me check if any of NT22's productions result in terminals. Wait, in the grammar, NT22 is defined as -> NT98 NT93. But none of these are terminals. Oh, but in the list, looking for NT22's productions, it's only NT22 -> NT98 NT93. So how does NT22 derive a terminal? It seems like NT22 doesn't have a production that leads to a terminal, unless I missed something.\n\nWait, looking back, I might have made a mistake. Let me reread the grammar provided:\n\nLooking at NT22: It has only one production, NT22 -> NT98 NT93, no terminals. So NT22 can't produce a terminal, only non-terminals. So S, which directly produces NT91 NT22, would have to first produce 't8' from NT91, and then somehow NT22 would have to produce some terminal. But it can't, so this would mean the string can't start with t8 because NT22 can't produce any terminals. That would suggest that the given string isn't possible, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other productions for NT91 or NT22. Let me scan through all the grammar rules for these:\n\nNT91: Its production is NT91 -> NT89 NT51, and also, looking at other lines, does it have a terminal? I see NT91 -> 't8'. Yes, that's it. So NT91 can derive 't8'. But what about NT22? Checking all NT22 lines, just NT22 -> NT98 NT93. There are no terminals there. So NT22 can only produce non-terminals, meaning that the string after 't8' from NT91 would have to be derived from NT22, which can't produce any terminals. So the initial step would produce t8, and then something, but the string after that starts with t0, which would need to come from NT22, which can't, unless NT22 can somehow produce t0.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that S directly produces NT91 NT22. Maybe there's a way for other productions to reach a terminal. Let me think differently. Maybe the string starts with t8, so maybe NT91 can produce t8, but then what about the second NT22? Can it produce any terminals? Because the string after t8 is t0, t5, etc., but the production of NT22 doesn't include any terminals. So unless there's a chain of productions from NT22 that eventually produces a terminal, which I don't see in the given grammar, the string t8 t0 t5 t1 t5 t6 t5 is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing some production that allows NT22 to derive a terminal. Let me look through all the productions again for NT22. I don't see any. The only production is NT22 -> NT98 NT93. So NT22 can only produce non-terminals, meaning that the second symbol in the string must come from NT22's expansion. Since no NT22 production leads to a terminal, that can't be. So the string can't be generated because after t8, it requires NT22 to produce a terminal, which it can't.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the string is not in the language.

{"custom_id":"request-96","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided with various production rules, and the string to evaluate is \"t8 t0 t1 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand how Chomsky normal form (CNF) works. In CNF, each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to have multiple production rules. My goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these production rules step by step. \n\nThe string is a series of terminals: t8, t0, t1, t1, t6, t9, t7, t6. So, I need to see if these appear in the correct order when expanding from S.\n\nStarting with the production S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, S must derive into two parts, NT91 and NT22. Let's look at each of these.\n\nNT91: From the rules, NT91 \u2192 NT56 NT91'. Wait, no, let me check. Looking at the grammar, I see NT91 \u2192 NT87 NT53. No, wait, actually, looking back, the rules might be a bit different. Let me list out the relevant ones for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me parse the grammar correctly. The grammar is a list of rules, each starting with a non-terminal on the left. For example:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI think I need to approach this by trying to break down the string into parts that match the possible terminal sequences from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a parse tree for the string using the given grammar. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each production must generate these in the correct order.\n\nLet me try to see if each terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule. Starting with the first symbol, t8. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT6 \u2192 't6', NT8 \u2192 't5', etc. Wait, let me check each production that ends with a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through each rule, I notice that some NTs produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\n\nBut not sure. Wait, no, NT56 has a rule like NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95 and another NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95, which seems recursive and perhaps not terminal. Let me list all the rules that end with a terminal symbol.\n\nFor instance:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't6'\n\nAnd others like NT90 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't4', etc. \n\nSo, each NT can produce a sequence of other NTs, which eventually must derive into the terminals in the string.\n\nThe string is t8 t0 t1 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nLet me try to split this string into possible segments that can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the CYK algorithm to check parsing, but since the grammar is given, maybe I can reverse-engineer the parse.\n\nAlternatively, since the production S \u2192 NT91 NT22 could lead to the string, perhaps the string starts with some combination that comes from NT91 and then NT22.\n\nWait, let me see NT91: Looking through the rules, there's NT91 \u2192 NT87 NT53, right? Because in the given rules, I see:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nWhich is a direct production, but I need to find NT91.\n\nWait, let me check: looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT91->'t8'\u2014Wait, no, looking again, yes, there's a line: NT91->'t8'\n\nYes, line by line:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nBut then there's NT91 -> 't8' (line: NT91 -> 't8')\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user's grammar is presented as:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nNT26 -> 't7'\n\nNT90 -> 't9'\n\nNT8 -> 't5'\n\nNT56 -> 't7'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT41 -> 't0'\n\nNT25 -> 't6'\n\nNT76 -> 't5'\n\nNT96 -> 't6'\n\nNT96 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't2'\n\nNT41 -> 't1'\n\nNT8 -> 't4'\n\nNT79 -> 't7'\n\nNT9 -> 't4'\n\nNT45 -> 't6'\n\nNT91 -> 't8'\n\nNT78 -> 't8'\n\nNT53 -> 't6'\n\nNT13 -> 't0'\n\nNT73 -> 't6'\n\nNT73 -> 't7'\n\nNT69 -> 't3'\n\nNT22 -> 't8'\n\nNT98 -> 't5'\n\nNT51 -> 't3'\n\nNT50 -> 't9'\n\nNT97 -> 't1'\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT12 -> 't1'\n\nNT38 -> 't6'\n\nNT12 -> 't9'\n\nNT26 -> 't1'\n\nNT69 -> 't1'\n\nNT26 -> 't9'\n\nNT12 -> 't7'\n\nNT6 -> 't3'\n\nNT26 -> 't6'\n\nNT26 -> 't5'\n\nNT0 -> 't0'\n\nNT56 -> 't0'\n\nNT90 -> 't0'\n\nNT79 -> 't3'\n\nNT31 -> 't2'\n\nNT55 -> 't8'\n\nNT9 -> 't3'\n\nNT76 -> 't3'\n\nNT96 -> 't0'\n\nNT68 -> 't7'\n\nWait, so looking at these rules, I see that some NTs directly produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-95","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step because it's a bit complex, but I think I can manage if I take it slowly.\n\nFirst, I know that in CNF, each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That makes parsing easier because it's a simple structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, let me list out all the production rules to get a better picture. It seems like all the non-terminals have productions that either split into two other non-terminals or end up generating a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and then NT91 and NT22 each split further until they eventually produce terminals like 't8', 't7', etc.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is `t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t5 t6`. This looks like a sequence of terminals. The question is whether this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI remember that in CNF, we can parse the string top-down using either the CYK algorithm or by simulating a pushdown automaton. Since I'm not very familiar with CYK, maybe I'll try the latter approach, building a parse tree or seeing if each step can be matched.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S. But since the string is quite long, eight tokens, I might need to consider all possible splits and see if any production rules lead to this string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S, which produces NT91 NT22. So, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into terminal sequences that when combined, form parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT91: From the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96. So NT91 can produce a string starting with NT69 and NT96. Let's see, NT69 \u2192 NT26, which goes on to produce more non-terminals. For example, NT26 \u2192 NT6 \u2192 't5' or some other terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach it by recursively checking if each production in the grammar can derive the corresponding part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a leftmost derivation. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the string starts with NT91 NT22. The given string starts with t8 t7. Let me see what NT91 produces.\n\nLooking at NT91: The production is NT91 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96.\n\nSo NT7 can produce NT69 NT96. Then NT69 \u2192 NT26 \u2192 NT6. And NT96 is in the grammar, looking up:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT96, which also has a production: NT96 \u2192 t6. Oh wait, actually, in the original productions, I see NT91 is split into NT7 and NT96. Let me check the exact productions again.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, NT91 has a production: NT91 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 and another branch, but I'm not sure. Wait, looking back, I see that NT91 \u2192 NT7 and then NT7 has its own production. So perhaps NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96.\n\nLet's track this.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96.\n\nThen NT69 \u2192 NT26. NT69 can also split into NT56 \u2192 wait, no, NT69's production is: From earlier, NT69 \u2192 NT26. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions listed, I think I might have misread some. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nHere are the key rules that might be relevant:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\n- NT69 \u2192 NT26\n- NT96 \u2192 NT? Looking through the productions, I see NT96 might have productions, but let's check.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT26 -> NT6\n- NT96 -> t6\n- NT6 -> t5\n- NT6 can go to t5 or t8?\nWait, no. Looking at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't2'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n- Similarly, NT26 has productions to 't5' and 't6'.\n\nSo, NT69 \u2192 NT26, which then can produce 't5' or 't6'. Let me verify.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT26.\n\nFrom the grammar: \n- NT26 \u2192 NT6 or NT26 \u2192 't5' or 't6' (since looking for the end part, I see NT26 \u2192 't5' or 't6').\n\nWait, the productions in the grammar include:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't5'\n- NT26 \u2192 't6'\n\nSo, from NT26, we can produce 't5' or 't6'. That means NT69 \u2192 NT26, which then can go to 't5' or 't6'.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 has a production: Let me check the grammar. Looking at the end, I see:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't7'\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting sidetracked. Let me get back to NT7.\n\nSo, NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96, and NT96 is another non-terminal. Looking at NT96's productions, I see in the grammar:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT51? No, wait, let's check. Looking through the grammar, I spot NT96 \u2192 NT56 \u2192 't7'? Wait, perhaps I should list all productions for NT96.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't7'\n- NT56 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, no. Wait, the last entries are:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 t6\n- NT56 \u2192 't7'\n- NT56 \u2192 't5'\nWait, that's not correct. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar definitions, I see:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't0'\n- NT73 \u2192 't6'\n- NT73 \u2192 't7'\n- NT69 \u2192 't3'\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n- NT51 \u2192 't3'\n- NT50 \u2192 't9'\n- NT97 \u2192 't1'\n- NT41 \u2192 't0'\n- NT25 \u2192 't6'\n- NT76 \u2192 't5'\n- NT96 \u2192 't6'\n- NT96 \u2192 't5'\n- NT68 \u2192 't8'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's list the terminal productions to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nTerminals are any node without a non-terminal, or when the productions end in terminals.\n\nLooking through, the terminal productions are (looking for non-terminals that have a production ending directly in a terminal):\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n- NT98 \u2192 't5'\n- NT51 \u2192 't3'\n- NT76 \u2192 't5'\n- NT26 \u2192 't5' or 't6' (from NT26 definition)\n- NT90 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't4' (Wait, wait, I don't see it. Wait, looking through all the NT productions, I see some have 't5', 't6', etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list of all terminal productions. Let me go through each rule and see if it ends with a terminal.\n\nTerminals (each 't' followed by a number) are part of the language. So, I need to see if a production can generate exactly the given string.\n\nAlternatively, I can build the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to recognize that in this grammar, each step in the parse reduces two symbols into one terminal or another non-terminal. So, starting from S (non-terminal), each step combines two symbols.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to see if there's a leftmost derivation from S to the string `t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t5 t6`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the possible expansions.\n\nWait, starting at S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, the string starts with `t8 t7 t6 ...` I'm trying to match that. Let's see:\n\nSuppose S generates NT91 and NT22. Then, the first part is NT91, which produces NT7, which in turn produces NT69 NT96.\n\nSo, for the first two tokens, we have `t8 t7`.

{"custom_id":"request-113","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t8 t0 t5 t4 t4 t1 t5 t6 t5`, and the grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form is. CNF is a specific form of CFG where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. Also, it ensures that derivations are of a certain structure, which might help in parsing.\n\nNow, looking at the given grammar, I see that the only terminal symbols are 't' followed by numbers, like 't8', 't0', etc. Each production seems to either break down non-terminals into pairs of non-terminals or a terminal symbol. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which means S can be replaced with NT91 followed by NT22.\n\nThe string to check is a series of terminals: `t8 t0 t5 t4 t4 t1 t5 t6 t5`. So, the entire string is made up of terminal symbols, and I need to see if the non-terminals can expand into this sequence.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I know that the maximum length of the string derived from the start symbol S is related to the number of productions. But I'm not sure about the exact count here. However, maybe instead of calculating that, I can try to parse the string step by step, ensuring that each terminal can match some production.\n\nWait, the end symbols in the productions are either non-terminals or single terminals. So, each production either introduces two non-terminals (which would lead to further production steps until terminals are reached) or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string's length is 9 tokens (counting each 't' as part of the token). Let's list them: t8, t0, t5, t4, t4, t1, t5, t6, t5.\n\nI think I can approach this by trying to match the string from left to right, using the productions to break down the non-terminals as I go. Since each production splits a non-terminal into two parts, it's a matter of matching each terminal in the string to one side of a production.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure about the exact method. Let me think about it differently. In CNF, each step breaks down a non-terminal into two others or a terminal. So, the string can be viewed as an expansion of the start symbol S into a sequence of non-terminals and terminals that must exactly match the string.\n\nI might need to build a leftmost or rightmost derivation tree, but that could be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can check if each consecutive pair of terminals in the string can be matched by a production.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string should be such that it's a certain structure. From the start symbol S, each replacement doubles the length. So, the maximum string length would be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of productions, but I'm not sure about the exact relation here.\n\nLooking at the string length, it's 9, which is an odd number. In a typical leftmost derivation, starting from S, each step doubles the number of non-terminals until you get to the leaves which are terminals. The terminal string length would be 2^n, so 9 isn't a power of two. Wait, 2^3 is 8, and 2^4 is 16. So, 9 isn't a power of two, which might mean that the string can't be derived from S using a normal leftmost or rightmost derivation. But I'm not entirely sure about this because the grammar might have specific rules that allow for more flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar's productions can allow for overlapping or different expansion patterns. Perhaps the length doesn't matter because the grammar can handle it through multiple non-terminals and different production rules.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example, NT98 \u2192 't9', and others like NT51 \u2192 't3', NT41 \u2192 't1', etc. So, the string could have some terminals generated directly, but the overall structure requires that the string is formed by a specific sequence of these expansions.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe I can parse the string using a recursive descent approach or using the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is small, perhaps I can manually check.\n\nLet's try to break down the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t5 t4 t4 t1 t5 t6 t5.\n\nSo, nine tokens. Let's think of it as a sequence from left to right.\n\nWe need to start from S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, the first two tokens in the string should be generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't8', so maybe NT91 \u2192 't8' followed by something else. But looking at the productions, NT91 is defined as... Wait, looking back, yes: looking at the list, there is a production NT91 \u2192 't8'. So, NT91 can produce a single terminal 't8'.\n\nThen, the next part is NT22. The string's second token is 't0', so NT22 should produce 't0'. Looking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. Hmm, so NT22 can't produce 't0' directly because it splits into two non-terminals.\n\nWait a minute, that's a problem. Because the first non-terminal from S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is NT91, which produces 't8' directly. Then, the second part is NT22, which can't produce 't0' directly because it's split into NT87 and NT98, which would each need to produce terminals. So, let's check what NT87 and NT98 can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions: NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, and NT53 is 't6'. NT95 \u2192 't1'. So, NT87 would first split into NT95 and NT53, expanding to 't1' and 't6', i.e., 't1 t6'.\n\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. NT90 is 't9', and NT87, as above, is 't1 t6'. So, NT98 would expand to 't9 t1 t6'.\n\nWait, but wait a second: S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and NT22 can only produce two non-terminals. But the second token in the string is 't0', which would require that NT22 somehow produces 't0' directly, but looking at the productions, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, which don't produce 't0'. So, perhaps the grammar can't produce this string because the first part is 't8', and the second part is 't0', but NT22 doesn't have a production that directly gives 't0'. Instead, it always splits into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck. The string is t8 t0 t5 t4 t4 t1 t5 t6 t5.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8', which is the first token, matching the string.\n\nThen, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. These would need to correspond to the next tokens.\n\nBut the next token is 't0'. If NT87 and NT98 each produce 't0', but that's not possible because NT87 and NT98 can't directly produce 't0'. So, perhaps the approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-terminal is NT91, which is 't8', then NT22 needs to produce 't0', but it doesn't have a production that directly yields 't0'. Therefore, the string should not be in the language. But that seems too hasty; perhaps there's another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching it wrong. The leftmost derivation would process the non-terminals in order. So, let's see.\n\nThe entire string is a series of tokens: t8, t0, t5, t4, t4, t1, t5, t6, t5.\n\nThe first step is to replace S with NT91 NT22, so the first two symbols in the derivation are NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, the first token is 't8', which is provided by NT91. Then, the second symbol is NT22, which as per the grammar expands into NT87 NT98. So, the next step would be replacing these non-terminals:\n\nSo, NT91 \u2192 't8' and NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nBut the string's second token is 't0', so how do NT87 and NT98 relate to 't0'?

{"custom_id":"request-116","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string `t8 t0 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the grammar is structured in a way where each non-terminal can produce two other non-terminals, and eventually, some of those produce terminal symbols like 'tX'. My string consists of a sequence of terminals, each ending with a number, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting from S, which is `S -> NT91 NT22`. So, the string should be generated by expanding NT91 and NT22 into their respective components, and each of those would produce more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me list the string again: `t8 t0 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6`. That's a series of 9 tokens, so it's length 9. Since the grammar is CNG, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. Starting from S, each step either produces two terminals or keeps the structure.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of productions needed. The string has 9 tokens, so we're dealing with a derivation that needs to produce 9 symbols. Since each production step splits a single non-terminal into two (either non-terminals or terminals), the number of symbols increases by one each time a non-terminal is expanded into two symbols until we reach the desired count. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the process as a binary tree, where each node represents a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal. The string corresponds to a specific path from the root to a leaf. But given that the string is a linear sequence of terminals, I might need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to reconstruct the possible parse tree for the given string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string: t8 t0 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6. Let me list them in order as positions 1 to 9.\n\nNow, the start symbol S is `S -> NT91 NT22`. So, the first expansion would produce two parts: the first part will generate some sequence ending in tX, and the second part another sequence.\n\nWait, but in the string, the order is important. So, whatever generates t8 must come from the first part (NT91), and the rest from NT22? Or maybe it's more like the entire string must be built by expanding in a certain way.\n\nLet's consider that the string is a concatenation of the sequences generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, string = sequence1 + sequence2, where sequence1 comes from NT91 and sequence2 from NT22.\n\nLooking at the NT productions:\n\nNT91 -> NT76 NT26? Wait, but I'm looking for NT91's options. From the grammar, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the grammar:\n\nWait, NT91 is in the list? Let me scan through the productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like `NT91 -> 't8'`, so NT91 is a terminal that directly produces t8. Wait, no, the grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, some of the productions are to terminals. For example, `NT38 -> 't2'`. So, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, others produce two non-terminals.\n\nSo, starting from S, which expands to NT91 NT22. Since NT91 directly produces t8, that's the first token. Then NT22 needs to produce the rest: t0 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6. Wait, no, wait: the full string is nine tokens, so if S expands to NT91 (t8) and NT22, then NT22 must produce the remaining eight tokens. That seems unlikely because each production can only add one token at a time.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. Starting from S, which is two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. NT91 can be a terminal or a non-terminal. Looking back, I think I see NT91 -> 't8', so NT91 is a terminal. So, the first token is t8, and the second part must generate the remaining eight tokens. That is, NT22 must produce t0 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nWait, no, because NT22 is a single non-terminal that, when expanded, becomes two symbols. So, NT22 can't directly produce eight tokens; it's a two-symbol production. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the non-terminals expand.\n\nWait, each non-terminal when expanded can either be a terminal or another pair of non-terminals. So, if NT91 is a terminal producing t8, then S produces t8 and the expansion of NT22. So, the overall string would be t8 followed by whatever the expansion of NT22 is.\n\nBut the string given starts with t8, then t0, etc. So, the expansion of NT22 must be t0 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6. But that's eight tokens, which would require NT22 to expand in a way that results in eight terminals. But each expansion of NT22 can only produce two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe that's not possible. Let me think. If NT22 is expanded, it would produce two symbols. Those two symbols could themselves be terminals or non-terminals. So, the total number of symbols would increase by one each time a non-terminal is expanded. So, starting with S, which is two symbols (after expansion). Then, each expansion step increases the number of symbols by one. Wait, that's not right because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, so the count would depend on how many are non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as a parse tree and see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by looking at the possible sequences that can be generated starting from each non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to see what each non-terminal could generate. For example, NT91 -> 't8', which is a terminal. So, any expansion through NT91 will only produce t8. Therefore, if S is the start symbol and S -> NT91 NT22, then the first token must be t8. But the given string starts with t8, so that's good. Now, we need to see what NT22 can produce.\n\nSo, NT22 -> NT87 NT98. Now, both NT87 and NT98 need to be considered.\n\nLooking at NT87: NT87 -> NT95 NT53. Then, NT95 -> 't1' (from the grammar: NT95 -> 't1'), which is a terminal. NT53 -> 't6'. So, NT87 -> 't1' 't6', which would produce 't1t6'. So, NT87 is 't1t6'.\n\nThen, NT98 -> NT90 NT87. We've just determined that NT87 is 't1t6'. So, NT90 -> 't9' directly (from the grammar). So, NT90 is 't9'. Therefore, NT98 -> 't9' 't1t6' = 't9t1t6'.\n\nWait, but NT87 is 't1t6', so NT98 is 't9 t1 t6'.\n\nWait, let me clarify: NT98 is NT90 NT87, so both are non-terminals. NT90 is 't9' and NT87 is 't1t6', so combining them, we get t9 followed by t1t6, which is t9t1t6.\n\nSo, putting this together: NT22 is NT87 NT98, which is 't1t6' followed by 't9t1t6', which together is 't1t6t9t1t6'. That gives us five symbols, but our target after the initial t8 is eight more tokens. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's recheck.\n\nWait, starting with S: S -> NT91 NT22. NT91 is 't8', NT22 is 't1t6t9t1t6', so combining, the entire string would be t8 t1t6t9t1t6, which is t8 t1 t6 t9 t1 t6, six tokens. But the target is nine tokens, so there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in expanding NT22. Let me try again.\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nExpanding NT87: NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nNT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-133","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but I think I can handle it by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT22, NT76, etc.) expands into exactly two other symbols, which can be another non-terminal or a terminal (like 't8', 't5', etc.). Since it's in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t8 t0 t5 t4 t4 t4 t1 t1 t6 t5`. So it's a sequence of terminals, which suggests that the string must be derived directly from the terminals without any remaining non-terminals at the end.\n\nMy plan is to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to find any production rules that could have generated it. If I can decompose the string into symbols that match the grammar, then the string is part of the language.\n\nLet me list the string again: t8 t0 t5 t4 t4 t4 t1 t1 t6 t5. There are 10 symbols. Since each production in CNF produces two symbols, the number of steps to derive from S would depend on the length. Let's see: S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which is two symbols, so for the string of length n, I need (n-1)\/2 steps, but that's more about the derivation tree. Maybe I don't need that.\n\nAlternatively, since each step produces two symbols, starting from the top, S gives two, then each of those can give two more, so it's exponential growth. But for a string of 10 symbols, that would require 4 steps or something like that. Maybe. But perhaps it's better to try to match the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be traced back through the grammar. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be factored into the non-terminals that each produce two symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the end symbols matching the productions for each non-terminal. Let me go through the grammar and see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLet me make a list of all the terminal symbols. The terminals seem to be 't0', 't1', 't2', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9'. Some non-terminals produce these.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, and both NT90 and NT87 have productions that end with 't9', 't8', etc. But that's not helpful yet.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for which NTs produce 't8' as their end symbol. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, which non-terminals have terminals as their right-hand sides:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8' (since NT91 \u2192 't8')\nNT78 \u2192 't8'\nNT96 \u2192 't6' (Wait, no, earlier productions have NT96 \u2192 't6') Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all NTVs that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each production is either a terminal or another non-terminale. Let's see:\n\nNT98 \u2192 't5'\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me methodically list all the productions where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\nWait a minute, the grammar seems to have both terminals and non-terminals as right-hand sides. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are either non-terminals or terminals, but I think in this case, all productions are non-terminals splitting into two non-terminals, except for some that split into a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals. Wait, but I think the user provided the grammar as a list of productions, some of which end with two non-terminals (like S\u2192NT91 NT22), but looking closer, for example:\n\nNT98 \u2192 't5'\nWait, no. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nThe production for NT98 is: NT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nThen, NT90 -> 't9'\nAnd NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nWait, so actually, NT98 produces NT90 and NT87, which further produce 't9' and NT95\/ NT53 respectively. So to find a terminal in the expansion, I need to see if in the productions, a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I think some NTVs directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT9 -> 't4' (Is that correct? Let me check: NT9 -> 't4') Yes.\n\nSimilarly, NT38 -> 't6', NT6 -> 't5', etc. So some NTVs have terminals as their RHS.\n\nSo for the given string `t8 t0 t5 t4 t4 t4 t1 t1 t6 t5`, each of these must be either directly produced by an NTV or the result of expanding non-terminals.\n\nSo, to see if this string is possible, I can work from right to left, trying to group the string into pairs that match the RHS of the productions, and see if I can decompose it all the way back to S.\n\nLet me write the string as a list: [t8, t0, t5, t4, t4, t4, t1, t1, t6, t5]\n\nI need to see if I can split the string into pairs that each match an NTV's production.\n\nAlternatively, starting from the end, group the last two symbols and see if they are the RHS of any NTV.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to try to build the string by combining pairs according to the production rules until I reach S.\n\nLet me try starting from the front. The first symbol is t8, which must be produced by some NTV. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo the first symbol t8 could be the result of NT91. Then, the next symbol t0 must be the result of another NTV, because each production yields two symbols.\n\nWait, but the structure is that each step in the derivation adds two symbols. So perhaps the string must be a sequence where every pair of symbols comes from an NTV's production.\n\nWait, that makes me think. Each step in the derivation starts with a single symbol and replaces it with two symbols from its production, so the string grows by one symbol each time. But that can't be because each production is of length two, so the number of symbols increases as 2^n -1. So for example, S (n=1) \u2192 two symbols (n=2), then each of those symbols could produce two, making four symbols (n=3), etc.\n\nBut the given string has 10 symbols, which is 2^4 -6, not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to repeatedly split the string into pairs that match the RHS of the productions, starting from the beginning.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe string is t8 t0 t5 t4 t4 t4 t1 t1 t6 t5.\n\nLet me group the string into possible pairs:\n\nOption 1: Group them into pairs from the start:\n\nt8 | t0 | t5 | t4 | t4 | t4 | t1 | t1 | t6 | t5 \u2192 Wait, but that's 10 symbols, which is 5 pairs. So maybe I can group them into 5 pairs.\n\nWait, but to derive the string, I must have 5 productions because each production produces two symbols, so starting from S (1 symbol), after 1 step: 2, after 2 steps: 4, after 3 steps: 8, after 4 steps: 16. But our string is 10, which is not a power of two. Hmm, this suggests that the string might not be derivable, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string by starting from S and trying to match the beginning symbols, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nWait, another approach: Each production in Chomsky Normal Form consists of replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. So, for example, NT91 \u2192 't8', which is a terminal, so 't8' can only be produced from NT91.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is 't8' which must come from NT91.\n\nSo the first two symbols would be 't8' and then the next symbol must be the continuation.\n\nWait, but the derivation of S starts with NT91 and NT22, so maybe it's better to consider that the string must be decomposable into a sequence of NTVs expanding their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-139","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is \"t8 t0 t1 t5 t6 t9 t0 t9 t6 t6\", and the grammar consists of a bunch of production rules with non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production has either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals on the left and the right is two terminals or a single non-terminal. But looking at the rules, all seem to have two terminals except for some like NT7->NT69 NT96, which goes to two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, some have two non-terminals, like NT12->NT8 NT12, but according to CNF, it should be either one symbol or two symbols on the left, but the right side must be two terminals or a single non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I need to check if all the productions are in CNF. But perhaps that's not necessary for this problem since the user provided it in CNF, so I can assume each production is in the correct form.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string using the grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals. So I should start from the start symbol, which is S. Looking back at the grammar, S->NT91 NT22. So S splits into two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22. Each of these needs to derive a string that together forms the input.\n\nLet me write down the string again: t8 t0 t1 t5 t6 t9 t0 t9 t6 t6. So that's 10 tokens. Since S splits into NT91 and NT22, each of those should generate a string of 5 and 5 tokens respectively, because 5+5=10. Alternatively, maybe they split differently, but I'll check as I go.\n\nLooking at NT91 and NT22 in the grammar. NT91 has a production NT91->NT96 NT91. Wait, that's a recursive rule. Hmm, that's part of the productions. So NT91 produces NT96 followed by NT91. So this can generate a string where each step adds an 't0' because looking at the rules:\n\nNT96->t0. So every time NT96 appears, it's replaced by 't0'. Similarly, for NT91, let's see:\n\nNT91->NT96 NT91. So when we apply this rule once, we get t0 followed by NT91. Then applying it again, we get t0 t0 followed by NT91, and so on. So in general, NT91 can only produce strings of the form t0^n, where n is a positive integer because it's recursively applying this rule. So for NT91, the derived string must start with one or more 't0's.\n\nNow, looking at NT22. The production is NT22->NT87 NT98. NT87->NT95 NT53, and NT95->t1. NT53->t6. So NT87 becomes t1 followed by t6, which is 't1 t6'. Similarly, NT98->t9 t7. So NT22 is NT87 followed by NT98, which is 't1 t6 t9 t7'. So combining, NT22 produces 't1 t6 t9 t7'.\n\nWait, but the total string is t8 t0 t1 t5 t6 t9 t0 t9 t6 t6. The first token is 't8', which would have to come from somewhere. But in the start symbol S, we have NT91 and NT22. NT22 starts with 't1', but the string starts with 't8', so that doesn't match. So that's a problem. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parse tree can have different structures. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT91 could produce a single 't8' somehow. Let me check the NT91 productions. Looking back, the grammar for NT91: NT91->NT96 NT91. But none of the rules for NT96 directly produce 't8'. So that can't happen. Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking for NT91: It's only NT91->NT96 NT91, which is recursive. So there's no way NT91 can produce a single token. So the only way to get 't8' is if one of the non-terminals in NT91's derivation directly produces 't8'. But I don't see any production that does that. So that's a problem because the string starts with 't8', which can't be derived from NT91.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Did I miss any production for NT91 that produces a terminal? Looking at the given rules, I see:\n\nNT96->t0\nNT95->t1\nNT13->t0\nNT73->t6\nNT7->t1\nNT12->t1\nNT38->t6\nNT12->t9\nNT26->t1\nWait, that's in the list. But for NT91, the only production is NT96 NT91, so it can't produce a terminal directly. So NT91 can only produce a sequence starting with t0(s). But the input string starts with 't8', which suggests that the first part of the string, from NT91, should be 't8', but it's not possible.\n\nThis suggests that the string cannot be derived from the given grammar, so the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any other way. Maybe the NT91 can derive something else. Looking back, perhaps I see another production for NT91: NT91->NT53 NT51? Wait, no, according to the given rules, NT91's productions are:\n\nLooking back, the user-provided grammar for NT91 is:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think I might have misread it. Let me list all the NT91 productions:\n\nLooking at the list provided, I don't see an NT91-> anything else except for NT91->NT96 NT91. So, no, NT91 can't produce 't8' directly or through any sequence of steps, because the only production for NT91 is recursive on itself, leading to 't0's.\n\nTherefore, the first token in the string is 't8', which cannot be generated by the grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the process to derive the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each non-terminal (like S, NT91, NT22, etc.) can only produce two parts. Since the string is a series of terminals separated by spaces, I'll process them step by step.\n\nThe string has 11 tokens: t8, t0, t1, t4, t3, t7, t7, t2, t0, t6, t5. I'll need to see if a derivation can produce this sequence starting from S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT91 NT22. So S expands into two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me write down the target string and see how it can be broken down.\n\nStarting from S, we have NT91 NT22. So the derivations for T and T22 need to produce t8, t0, etc.\n\nWait, actually, the string is t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t7 t2 t0 t6 t5. Let's consider the tokens as T1 to T11. Each part must come from an expansion in the grammar.\n\nLet me think in reverse. The last token is t5. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t5? Let's check all the productions to see where 't5' appears as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many non-terminals end with 't5'. For example, NT41 -> 't0'; NT41 was also 't0' previously. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41, and NT68's terminal is t8? Wait, no, when I look through the list, many non-terminals have specific terminals. From the top:\n\nNT91 -> 't8'? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking down the list, NT91 is used in S and also has a terminal as 't8'? Let me check the list:\n\nLooking through all non-terminals, at the end, I see:\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\nNT55 -> NT50 NT56\n\nAlso, NT96 has 't6', NT78 has 't8', etc.\n\nWait, it's a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to list all the productions that produce each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build the parse tree starting from the target string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar's rules.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that in CNF, each production is a binary tree, so the derivation corresponds to splitting the string into parts at certain points and checking if they match the grammar.\n\nBut with 11 tokens, it's going to be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps constructing the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to break down the string.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\nt8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t7 t2 t0 t6 t5\n\nWe can think of this as a concatenation of 11 tokens.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nSo we need NT91 to derive to the first part, which is t8 to perhaps t5, and NT22 to derive the rest.\n\nWait, but actually, the string is t8 followed by t0, etc. So NT91 should expand into t8 followed by something, and NT22 into the rest.\n\nBut wait, NT91's production leads to a terminal or two. Let's check what NT91 produces. From the grammar, looking for NT91:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT95 -> 't7', but not NT91.\n\nWait, in the initial list, under NT91: I don't see an explicit production for NT91 except in S. So NT91 must derive further.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar provided lists all non-terminals as NT followed by numbers. Each non-terminal has a production that either goes to two non-terminals or to a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT91 is on the left side of some production. Let me search the entire grammar for NT91.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any production for NT91 except S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So NT91 must expand further. Let's see where it can go.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT91 is in S, but it's not in any other place. Wait, in the list, under NT95 there's 't7', but not NT91. Wait, no\u2014looking back:\n\nThe list includes:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'?\n\nWait, checking:\n\nYes, there's a production NT95 -> 't7'.\n\nBut also, looking for NT91, I don't see it anywhere except in S. So perhaps NT91 must go to two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I skipped something. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking for 'NT91':\n\nIn the entire grammar, after 'S -> NT91 NT22', I don't see any other NT91 \u2192 ... So perhaps, NT91 is only present in S.\n\nSo NT91 can only expand to... let's see, is there any production for NT91 beyond S? Or maybe in the bottom of the list, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, after several entries, I see:\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69,\n\nBut that's not NT91.\n\nWait, maybe each non-terminal is only on the left side once. So NT91 is only in S's production. Thus, any occurrence of NT91 must be expanded further.\n\nBut in the grammar, does NT91 have a production beyond S? Or is S the only production for NT91?\n\nWait, let me re-express the grammar:\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, no, looking through the entire list, I think I might have misread.

{"custom_id":"request-180","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to evaluate. The string is \"t8 t0 t5 t4 t9 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t7 t6\". My goal is to determine whether this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This form is helpful because it simplifies the analysis, especially for parsers and whether a string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that all the non-terminals eventually produce terminal symbols when expanded. For example, NT98 produces 't5' and NT51 produces 't3'. So, each non-terminal has a clear path to terminals, which is good because it means there are no cycles in the grammar that aren't already terminating with terminals.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of terminals: t8, t0, t5, t4, t9, t7, t6, t0, t0, t1, t7, t6. I'll need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the derivation of any string must begin with NT91 followed by NT22. Let me check the given string starts with t8. Looking at NT91, I see in the productions that NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT87. Wait, so from S, the first step is to expand NT91 into NT76 and NT87. Then, each of these non-terminals must be expanded further until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first term is t8. Looking at NT91's production, it doesn't directly produce t8. Instead, it goes to NT76 and NT87. So, perhaps I should look at how NT76 and NT87 produce terms.\n\nLooking at NT76: NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. Hmm, so first, NT76 becomes NT69 and NT26. Then each of those must produce something. Let's see NT69 and NT26.\n\nNT69, according to the productions, has multiple rules: NT69 \u2192 NT58, NT58, etc. Wait, the list seems a bit long. Let me check the given grammar:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT69 \u2192 NT58 and others. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the rules for each non-terminal step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parse tree, starting from the start symbol S and expanding until we reach the string. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to see if each step of the string can be mapped to the production rules.\n\nLet me list out the string: t8, t0, t5, t4, t9, t7, t6, t0, t0, t1, t7, t6.\n\nWait, but the string has 12 terms, but according to the start symbol S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which would need to produce 12 terms, but NT91 and NT22 each would need to produce a certain number. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string must be a combination of the expansions from NT91 and NT22.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to model this as a top-down parsing process, keeping track of the current non-terminal and the remaining string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent each possible expansion step and see if the string can be built up.\n\nLet me start by considering S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first production would be NT91 and NT22. Now, I'll look at the first term in the string, which is t8.\n\nLooking at NT91, the first rule is NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT87. So, to produce t8, perhaps NT87 can produce t8, but looking at the rules, NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. Hmm, that doesn't directly give t8. Alternatively, perhaps I need to follow the production rules until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting complicated. Maybe I should create a reverse mapping: for each terminal, find which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, here's how it breaks down:\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and terminals they produce.\n\nNT98 \u2192 't5'\nNT91 \u2192 NT76 NT87\nNT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\nNT69 \u2192 NT58\nNT58 might produce 't9', but wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT58 directly producing anything except other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-175","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string 't8 t0 t5 t5 t7 t9 t6 t0 t0 t1 t1 t6' is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CFC in CNF means each production is either a single terminal symbol or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT91 NT22. Each of these NT symbols will then produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t8, t0, t5, t5, t7, t9, t6, t0, t0, t1, t1, t6. I think the first step is to see if the entire string can be parsed using the given productions.\n\nSince S can be split into NT91 and NT22, let's see what each produces. The string is 12 terms, so maybe NT91 and NT22 each produce half of it.\n\nLet me see NT91 and NT22. Looking at the productions, I think NT91 can produce certain parts. For example, NT91 -> NT78 NT9. Wait, but in the string, after t8, it's t0. Maybe I need to check how each NT expands.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if the given string corresponds to the leftmost derivation from S. Starting from S -> NT91 NT22, so the string should be formed by expanding NT91 and NT22 into sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT91, what does it produce? The productions for NT91 are... Wait, I don't see NT91 in the provided productions. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the provided grammar again. Yes, looking through, I see NT91 -> NT82 NT9? Wait no. Wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see NT91 until... No, looking again, it seems the NT91 is a terminal, right? Because in the given grammar, 't8' is a terminal, so wait, does NT91 produce a terminal?\n\nWait, looking back, no. Each NT in the grammar is a non-terminal. For example, NT91 is on the left side, and the right side is either two NTs or a terminal? Let me check: in the provided list, I see entries like 't7', 't2', etc., which are terminals. But looking through all the NTs, I don't see any that produce these terminals, except perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, wait, wait. No, in the given grammar, all the NTs are defined as non-terminals except those that have a production to a terminal. For example, NT95 -> 't7', meaning NT95 produces a terminal t7. Similarly, NT38 -> 't2', and others like that.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, some NTs produce terminals, others produce two NTs. So, for example, S -> NT91 NT22. Both NT91 and NT22 must expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nNow, the start is S -> NT91 NT22. So, the string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT91 and NT22. So, the total length is 12, so each NT should expand into a string of 6 terminals each, but that might not be necessary because non-terminals can also produce more symbols, but in this case, the production rules are such that the non-terminals are either pushing more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut the string is 12, so perhaps each NT91 and NT22 produce 6 terminal symbols each, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, some paths may produce more symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NTs can produce a combination of terminals and non-terminals, and when we fully expand, all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps I should try to do a leftmost derivation for the string.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nStarting with S: S => NT91 NT22.\n\nWe need to expand NT91 and NT22 until we get all terminals. Let me see where each NT goes.\n\nFirst, let's try expanding NT91.\n\nNT91: Looking at the grammar, does NT91 have any production? Wait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT91 is listed as a terminal with 't8', but wait, no. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list out all the NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8' (since 't8' is a terminal, but wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT91 -> 't8'; instead, earlier entries are like NT95 -> 't7', so perhaps 't8' is produced by another NT.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see 't8' as a production. Let me check... No, 't8' is not directly a production, but looking through, I see NT95 -> 't7', NT38 -> 't2', NT0 -> 't0', etc. But what about NT91? Wait, in the given grammar, it's possible that NT91 may have a production that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at all NTs and their possible productions.\n\nWait, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8' (Wait, this seems duplicated, maybe a typo)\n\nNT26 -> 't7'\n\nNT90 -> 't9'\n\nNT8 -> 't5'\n\nNT56 -> 't7'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT41 -> 't0'\n\nNT25 -> 't6'\n\nNT76 -> 't5'\n\nNT96 -> 't6'\n\nNT96 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't2'\n\nNT41 -> 't1'\n\nNT8 -> 't4'\n\nNT79 -> 't7'\n\nNT9 -> 't4'\n\nNT45 -> 't6'\n\nNT91 -> 't8' (Wait, so finally, NT91 may produce 't8')\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see it.

{"custom_id":"request-199","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t0 t5 t5 t1 t6 t6`.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF grammars have each production rule either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any right-hand side (RHS). So, looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions like S \u2192 NT91 NT22 are in CNF, and some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT95 \u2192 't7'. That seems correct.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of terminals: t8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t6, t9, t0, t5, t5, t1, t6, t6. I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the problem using a methodical approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step will involve replacing a single non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal. The overall length of the string is 13 tokens, so the derivation will have to produce 13 terminals in the end. The start symbol S is on the left, so I'll start from S and see how it can expand.\n\nLet me write down the production for S: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the first step must be S becoming NT91 NT22. That means the string starts with t8, which is 't8', so I have to see how NT91 and NT22 can produce t8 or parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT91: From the list, NT91 \u2192 't8'. So NT91 directly produces t8. That's good because the first token is t8. So after S \u2192 NT91 NT22, we now have t8, and the rest of the string must come from NT22.\n\nSo now, we look at NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So NT22 breaks into two non-terminals: NT87 and NT98. The next token in the string after t8 is t0, so we need to figure out how NT87 and NT98 can produce t0.\n\nWait a second, looking at the productions for NT87: NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. And for NT53, I see it's 't6' \u2192 't6'. So NT87 is NT95 and NT53. Then NT95 has a production: NT95 \u2192 't7'. So NT87 would produce NT95 followed by 't6', then 't7'? Hmm, I think I need to retrace.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's try to map the string step by step.\n\n1. Starting symbol: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So after this step, we have t8 as the first token.\n\n2. Now, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So after S, we have t8, and then NT87 and NT98.\n\n3. The next token is t0. So we need to see what NT87 and NT98 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT87's productions: NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. So NT87 can produce two non-terminals, NT95 and NT53.\n\nNT95's productions: NT95 \u2192 't7'. So NT95 becomes t7. NT53 \u2192 't6'. So NT53 becomes t6.\n\nSo when we expand NT87, it becomes 't7' followed by 't6'. So after S \u2192 NT91 NT87 NT98, we have t8 t7 t6.\n\nBut the second token in the string is t0, not t7 t6. So this path doesn't seem to work. So maybe NT22 can't directly produce that. Maybe there's a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check NT98. NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. So NT98 can produce NT90 and NT87.\n\nSo, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. Then NT90 \u2192 't9', so NT90 becomes t9. NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53 \u2192 t7 t6. So putting it together, NT98 would produce 't9 t7 t6'.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT91 (t8) then NT87 and NT98. Let's see NT87 is t7 t6 and NT98 is t9 t7 t6. So putting it together, after S, the initial expansion would be t8 t7 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nBut our string starts as t8 t0. Hmm, there's no way NT91 and NT22 can produce t8 followed by t0 because NT87 and NT98 would produce longer sequences starting with t7 or t9. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is correct, but NT22 can produce a t0, maybe through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe NT22 can be broken down differently. Let's check NT22's productions. NT22 only has one production: NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So there's no way to get a terminal directly from NT22. Therefore, NT22 must be expanded into NT87 and NT98, which further expand into non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThis suggests that after S, NT22 expands into two non-terminals, leading to at least two more steps. So the initial breakdown is T8 followed by NT87 (t7 t6) and NT98 (t9 t7 t6). But the string after t8 is t0, which isn't t7 or t9.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to see if there's another path. Maybe the grammar allows for a different expansion path, but from the given productions, it seems that NT22 only produces NT87 and NT98. So perhaps the initial step is correct, but I need to backtrack.\n\nWait, maybe NT98 can produce other things. Let me check NT98's productions: NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. NT90 \u2192 't9', so NT90 is t9. NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, which is t7 t6. So NT98 is t9 t7 t6. So after the initial t8, the next tokens would be t9 t7 t6, which doesn't match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me visualize the entire string length. The string has 13 tokens, so the parsing must result in 13 steps. Each production in CNF adds one token per step, so the derivation must produce 13 tokens after starting with S and possibly non-terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: parsing the string and seeing if each terminal can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build the parse tree manually, but this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar doesn't produce such a string because the sequence includes t0, which is only produced by certain non-terminals. Let me check where t0 comes from in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any non-terminal producing 't0'. All non-terminals either produce terminals like t7, t8, etc., or other non-terminals. So 't0' is never directly produced by any rule. That suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because 't0' isn't present in any production. Wait, let's verify.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, all the terminal productions are 't's with numbers, but I don't see any production that ends with 't0'. So if the string contains 't0', it's impossible because the grammar doesn't produce 't0' anywhere. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, did I miss a production somewhere? Let me scan all the terminal rules again. Yes, all are 't5', 't6', etc., but I see no 't0'. So 't0' is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the presence of 't0' in the string means the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since I'm not familiar with the exact steps of the CYK algorithm, I'll try to construct a parse tree manually.\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t5 t4 t5 t7 t9 t6 t9 t0 t9 t5 t6.\n\nEach of these is a token, so the string has 13 tokens. I'll need to see if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list all the production rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n3. NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n4.

NT98 \u2192 't5'\n54. NT51 -> 't3'\n55. NT50 -> 't9'\n64. NT90 -> 't0'\n... and so on (some duplicated entries)\n\nWait, I think some of these are duplicates or have multiple productions. For example, NT56 has two rules: NT55 NT78 and NT56 NT95. Also, NT73 has two rules: NT73 NT7 and something else, but looking again, it's actually NT73 appears in two different productions, but the actual rules are:\n\nLine 50: NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT68\nAnd another line: NT73 \u2192 NT77 NT87?\n\nWait, no, the actual rules in the grammar given are:\n\nLooking back, the user listed all the rules. Let me list them properly without duplicates.\n\nProbably, some are repeated, like NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95 and NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78. So, each line is a separate production.\n\nNow, for the string, it's 13 tokens. Chomsky Normal Form typically uses two steps per production, so for a string of length n, the parse table is manageable, but manually constructing it is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work from the bottom up. Since all the symbols in the grammar must derive to terminals, I can start by seeing which symbols in the grammar correspond to the given terminals.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: t8, t0, t5, t4, etc. Let me see which non-terminals produce each of these.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT73 can produce 't6' (line 51: NT73 \u2192 t6) or NT73 can be further split (line 50: NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT68). Hmm, but line 50 says NT73\u2192NT73 NT68. Wait, but in the second part, line 50 is NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT68, and line 51 is NT73 \u2192 something else? Or maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, reviewing the user's grammar lines, line 49: NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT68 (twice?), no, I see:\n\nLines 49: NT73 -> NT73 NT68, and line 50: NT73 -> NT77 NT87? Or maybe line 49 is NT73 -> NT73 NT68, line 50: NT73 -> NT77 NT87, but looking again, line 49 is NT73 -> NT73 NT68, and line 50 is NT73 -> NT77 NT87. Wait, no, the user didn't specify NT77\u2014it's unclear. Maybe I should double-check.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, line 49 is NT73->NT73 NT68, and line 50 is NT73->NT77 NT87. But NT77 isn't defined anywhere in the grammar provided, which suggests that line 50 is invalid because NT77 isn't part of the grammar. Therefore, only line 49 is valid for NT73: NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT68. But that would imply that NT73 can only produce more NT73s, which would lead to an infinite loop unless there's a base case. However, looking further, I don't see NT73 producing any terminal, which suggests that NT73 doesn't appear in the productions except as a left-hand side, which would be problematic because it needs to terminate as a terminal. Therefore, this might be a mistake, but perhaps I should proceed, assuming that the productions are correct as given.\n\nBut maybe I should proceed by checking which non-terminals can produce the given terminal symbols.\n\nLet me list each terminal and see if any non-terminal directly produces it:\n\n- t8: NT95 (line 25: NT95\u2192't7' and line 27: NT95\u2192't5').\nWait, let's recheck:\n\nLooking at the terminals:\n\nt8: produced by NT95? Wait, line 25: NT95 \u2192 't7', line 26: NT38 \u2192 't2', line 27: NT6 \u2192 't5', line 28: NT6 \u2192 't8', line 29: NT26 \u2192 't7', line 30: NT90\u2192't9', line 31: NT8\u2192't5', line 32: NT56\u2192't7', line 33: NT2\u2192't5', line 34: NT41\u2192't0', line 35: NT25\u2192't6', line 36: NT76\u2192't5', line 37"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-219","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal on the left. The start symbol is S, and it's broken down into NT91 and NT22. So the string we're checking starts with t8, t0, which must come from these.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- S -> NT91 NT22: So the string starts with whatever NT91 produces. But wait, the string starts with t8, so I need to see what NT91 can produce. Let me check NT91's productions. Looking through the list, I don't immediately see NT91 as a right-hand side of any production. Maybe I missed it. Oh, I see: NT96 -> t6 and NT78 -> t8? No, that's not NT91. Wait, looking again, I don't see NT91 being defined as a non-terminal on the left. It says NT91 -> t8 somewhere? Looking at the list, yeah, I do see NT91 -> t8. Perfect, so NT91 can derive t8.\n\nNext, the second part is NT22 -> t0. Checking NT22's productions: I don't see NT22 being a non-terminal on the left. Wait, the list says NT22 -> t8? Or is it something else? Let me look. Hmm, looking through the productions, I see NT22 in a production: NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So that's a production, not directly a terminal. So wait, I must have misread earlier. So after S, it's NT22, which eventually needs to generate t0 and other parts. So the string starts with t8 and t0. \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe string is t8 t0 t9 t6 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t6. So the first two symbols are t8 and t0.\n\nFrom S -> NT91 NT22, we have NT91 gives t8, so that's good. Now, NT22 must give t0 followed by the rest. But wait, NT22's production is NT87 NT98, so that's a non-terminal. Hmm, so how does that generate t0?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure. Let's think recursively. The entire string must be produced by S. So S-> NT91 NT22. NT91 produces t8, and NT22 should produce the rest of the string after t8, which is t0 t9 t6 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t6. \n\nWait, that can't be right because t0 is the second symbol after t8. So the whole string is t8 t0 t9 ... So the first part is t8 (from NT91), then t0 comes from NT22. But NT22 is supposed to produce t0 and the rest. But NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So how does that produce t0? Looking at NT87 and NT98, I think I need to find if their productions can generate t0.\n\nWait, NT98 is in the productions. Let me check NT98. Looking through the list, I see NT98 -> NT90 NT87. Hmm, that's a chain. Not helpful. Or is there a production that directly produces a terminal? Looking at the list, I see NT0 -> NT90 NT79. Oh, not directly. Wait, let me look for any NT that directly produces t0.\n\nAh, I see NT98 -> t5? No. Wait, checking the list, I don't see any NT producing t0 directly except maybe NT31 -> NT54 NT31 and so on, but that's for NT31. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe the string starts with t8, which is from NT91. Then, the part after t8 is t0, which comes from NT22, but how? Because NT22 is NT87 NT98. So NT22 must generate t0, which requires NT87 and NT98 to produce t0. But looking at NT87's productions, I don't see any NT87 -> t0. NT87 -> NT95 NT53. NT53 is NT98, which again leads us into the chain.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, node S with two children: NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 -> t8: That's easy, so we get t8.\n\nNow, NT22 needs to produce the rest of the string: t0 t9 t6 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t6.\n\nNT22 is NT87 NT98.\n\nSo, for NT22, each of its children must derive a string. Let's say the first part is t0 and the second part is t9 t6 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t6.\n\nSo NT87 and NT98 must derive t0 and t9 t6 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t6.\n\nLooking at NT87's production: NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nAnd NT53 is NT98.\n\nSo NT87 is NT95 and NT98.\n\nNow, NT95 is a terminal? Let's check the productions. NT95 is on the left of a production: NT95 -> t1.\n\nYes! So NT95 -> t1.\n\nSo NT87 -> t1 NT98.\n\nNow, NT98's production is NT90 NT87.\n\nWait, so NT98 -> NT90 NT87, which itself has NT90 -> t9. So NT90 is t9.\n\nSo let's see: NT87 (t1) and NT98 (which is NT90 t9 and NT87).\n\nWait, this is getting recursive. Maybe I should step through each step.\n\nWait, the NT22 is NT87 NT98, so the production would be [NT87] [NT98]. So the string they produce is the combination of NT87's string and NT98's string.\n\nBut NT87 -> t1 (since NT95 -> t1) and NT98 -> NT90 NT87.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because NT98 is NT90 NT87, which itself is t9 and t1. But then NT98's production is recursively defined, which would cause an infinite loop unless something else happens.\n\nWait, but the string after t8 is t0, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Oh no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me start over.\n\nThe string is t8 t0 t9 t6 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t6.\n\nS starts as NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the entire string must be derived as t8 (from NT91) concatenated with t0 t9 ... (from NT22).\n\nBut how does NT22 generate t0? Because it's NT87 NT98, which is two non-terminals. So one must generate t0 and the other something else, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the first symbol after NT91 is t8, then the NT22 string starts with t0. So the entire string is t8 followed by the NT22-generated part, which must be t0 followed by the rest.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the NT22 production: NT87 NT98.\n\nLet me check what NT87 and NT98 can produce. \n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nNT53 -> NT98.\n\nSo NT87 -> t1 (from NT95) and NT98.\n\nBut then NT98 is NT90 NT87, which is t9 and t1.\n\nWait, that would mean NT87 -> t1, and NT98 -> t9 t1, making NT22's production for this part t1 t9 t1. But in our string, after t8, it's t0, so that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing some steps. Let me see if any of the non-terminals can produce t0 as a combination of their terminals.\n\nLooking at NT0: NT0 -> t0? Or is that an intermediate that needs to eventually produce t0?\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t0.

{"custom_id":"request-215","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has each production rule as having two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. The string I need to check is \"t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t2 t2 t0 t6\". \n\nFirst, I'll count the number of tokens. There are 14 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one, adding two symbols each step. So, starting from S, the initial string is one symbol. For each production, the number of symbols increases by one (since we replace a non-terminal with two symbols). So, to get 14 symbols, the derivation must have 13 steps because each step adds one token.\n\nWait, but actually, in CNF, each production is A -> BC or A->a. So each step adds one more non-terminal. So starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The number of symbols in the sentential form increases by one each step. So for a string of length n, the number of steps is n.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The number of symbols is the number of leaves in the derivation tree. For example, S (1 non-terminal) can lead to A B (2 symbols, both non-terminals). Then each of those can produce more symbols until all are terminals. The number of terminals in the final string is the length of the string. So the number of steps is such that the initial number of symbols (n=1) increases to n'=n+1 each time, until it reaches the size of the string. So, for a string of length m, the number of steps is m-1. So for a 14-symbols string, we'd need 13 steps.\n\nNow, the string given is \"t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t2 t2 t0 t6\". Let me note down the sequence of terminals: t8, t7, t6, t9, t0, t1, t3, t3, t6, t9, t2, t2, t0, t6. So, the number of tokens is 14.\n\nWait, but the given grammar only has certain terminals. Let me check which terminals are present. Looking at the productions, the terminals are t8, t7, t6, t9, t0, t1, t3, t2, t4, t5. Wait, does it have t4? Let's see: NT53 -> 't6', so t6 is present. Wait, looking through the rules, I see t8, t7, t6, t9, t0, t1, t3, t2, t4, t5. Because, for example, NT56 -> 't7', NT25 -> 't6', NT68 -> 't25 NT31' which eventually becomes 't6 t9' etc.\n\nWait, so the string has t8, t7, t6, t9, t0, t1, t3, t3, t6, t9, t2, t2, t0, t6. All those terminals are allowed, so the string could be possible.\n\nNext, I need to see if these terminals can be derived from S using the given productions.

The string is `t8 t0 t1 t1 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t7 t3 t1 t6`, which has 15 tokens. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which should make things a bit easier because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the grammar. Each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal and B, C are non-terminals. This usually implies that the language is a Dyck language or has some kind of nested structure, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the given grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string must start and end with these non-terminals, right? Wait, actually, the string is composed of terminals, so let's make sure about that. The grammar starts with S producing NT91 NT22, so the string should be a combination of the expansions of these two non-terminals, followed by other expansions, maybe.\n\nWait, but the string is all terminals. So S produces two non-terminals, each of which will expand until they produce terminals. So each of these non-terminals, like NT91 and NT22, will themselves produce terminals through their own productions.\n\nLet me check the productions:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT98 NT53, which then breaks down into NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, etc. But wait, looking at the end of the string, we have t8 t0 t1 t1 t6, etc. But maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string step by step, trying to match it to the grammar. But considering that each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, each step reduces the number of symbols by one, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so maybe a leftmost derivation would be the way to go.\n\nBut this seems complicated because the grammar is quite large, and there are many non-terminals. Maybe I can represent the grammar as a tree or find a pattern in the productions. Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that some non-terminals lead to specific terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals, such as:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\nNT51 \u2192 't3'\nNT56 \u2192 't0' or 't5'\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nActually, from the given list, for example:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\nWait, no, wait: the grammar has:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\nThat's not a terminal. Other NT95 productions? Wait, no, looking back: the data only shows certain productions, so maybe I need to see which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n- NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78 or NT56 NT95\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm getting the data wrong.\n\nWait, let me read the grammar again properly.

NT38 -> 't6' (This is conflicting with NT38 -> 't2' above? Wait, but in the given data, sometimes a non-terminal may have multiple productions, including a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar may actually have multiple productions for the same non-terminal, some being terminals. For example, NT22 has two productions: NT87 NT98 and 't8'. Similarly, NT56 can produce t7 or t0.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, lines 25, 36, etc., have some NT entries leading to terminals, but others may produce non-terminals.\n\nSo, given this, the approach would be to parse the string step by step, matching it with the grammar.\n\nBut manually doing a full parse on such a long string (15 tokens) is going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or recursion I can exploit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each terminal in the string can be reached by some path in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, the string is linear: t8, t0, t1, t1, t6, t9, t0, t1, t4, t3, t7, t7, t3, t1, t6.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t8, which comes from NT22.\n\nLooking at NT22, the production is NT87 NT98 and 't8'. So the first t8 could come from NT22.\n\nThen, after the initial 't8', the string continues with 't0'. The next step would involve expanding whatever NT98 or NT87 produces.\n\nWait, after the first 't8', we're at the next symbol, which is 't0'. So perhaps after NT22 produces 't8', the remaining part to parse is 't0 t1 t1 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t7 t3 t1 t6'.\n\nBut how does NT22 produce 't8' and then something else? Because NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So after producing 't8', we now have to parse NT87 and NT98 together.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Actually, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, so S \u2192 NT91 NT87 NT98. But the string starts with t8, which is a terminal from NT22, but the expansion of NT22 could be NT87 and NT98, which themselves might produce other terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production is applied left-most, so for example, in the string, the first 't8' comes from NT22, but perhaps the next step is to expand the NT87 and NT98 into their own terminals or non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string must be represented as a concatenation of the terminals generated by each non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar follows this, so each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to perform a parsing process. Starting from the start symbol S, I'll try to derive the string step by step, ensuring that each step follows the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t8`. Let me check the productions that produce t8. Scanning the productions, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\nBut wait, no, that's NT68. Wait, looking back, the productions for 't8' are under NT6: NT6 \u2192 't5' and NT6 \u2192 't8'. So NT6 can directly produce t8 or other terms. Also, looking at the list, I see NT6 \u2192 't8' and NT6 \u2192 't5', so that's how it works.\n\nWait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check the productions again. Looking back, I see NT6 has two rules: 't5' and 't8'. So NT6 can directly produce t8.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the productions, it's more like:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, no, I'm confusing. Let me look again.\n\nIn the productions, I see entries like:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n\nYes, so NT6 can directly produce 't5' or 't8'. So since the string starts with 't8', we must have NT6 \u21d2 t8. But wait, the start symbol is S, and the first production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo S directly produces NT91 followed by NT22. Therefore, S can be considered as NT91 NT22.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t8, so maybe we have to parse S into something that starts with t8.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The string starts with t8, so perhaps one of the NTs in the breakdown must produce t8. But since the start symbol is S, the first step is to split S into NT91 NT22. So the first production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then, each of these NTs must produce a substring, and when concatenated, should form the given string.\n\nSo the string is t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t4 t3 t6. Let me note that as a list:\n\nPositions:\n0: t8\n1: t0\n2: t1\n3: t3\n4: t3\n5: t6\n6: t0\n7: t0\n8: t1\n9: t3\n10: t3\n11: t5\n12: t4\n13: t3\n14: t6\n\nWait, that's 15 tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-256","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t6 t9 t7 t2 t6 t9 t0 t1 t5 t6`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain optimizations in generating strings.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems all the productions are in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, and so on. Each non-terminal expands into two others or directly into a terminal like 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals. Each part of the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nOne approach is to work backwards from the string to see if it can be broken down into the non-terminals' productions. But this might be complex given the number of steps. Alternatively, I can try to construct the parse tree step by step, ensuring that each part of the string matches the grammar's production rules.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the number of non-terminals and terminals, each production in CNF allows the number of non-terminals to decrease by one each step. Since each rule consumes two non-terminals and produces one per step, the total number of steps needed to derive the string from S would be related to the length of the string.\n\nWait, the string has 16 tokens. Each application of a rule reduces the count of non-terminals by one. Starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, to get to n non-terminals, you need n-1 applications. But in this case, we have 16 terminals, so each step would involve generating two non-terminals until we have enough terminals. Hmm, I might be mixing up the levels here.\n\nAlternatively, each production in CNF produces exactly two non-terminals, except for when they produce terminals directly. But looking at the given grammar, I see rules like NT98 -> NT90 NT87. Wait, NT98 is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals, which in turn could produce more.\n\nWait, the process to derive a string from S would involve expanding non-terminals until all that's left are terminals. Each expansion step can only go so far. So for a string of length 16, I'd need to expand until there are 16 generated terminals.\n\nBut since each production creates two non-terminals at most if following rules, the number of steps required would be such that 2^n >= 16, but that's for a binary tree structure.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see each token in the string and try to find a production that matches it. Each token is like 't8', 't0', etc., which are terminals. So I need to check if each terminal can be derived from some non-terminal, and then see if the sequence can be linked through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the productions, many non-terminals produce two different non-terminals, which in turn produce more. Each non-terminal has specific productions. For example, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, which would produce 't9' and 't8' eventually.\n\nBut perhaps I can look for a chain that builds up the string. Let's start from the beginning:\n\nThe first token is 't8'. Looking at the grammar, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. From NT90, NT90's production includes 't9', so the first step could involve NT98 \u2192 NT90 't9' but wait, NT90 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal can directly produce certain terminals, so for example, looking at each NT and its terminals, some NTs produce a single terminal, others produce two.\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 't9' (from NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, but wait, I need to see if any production of NT98 directly gives a terminal. Looking again, in the given grammar, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. So it's a production of two non-terminals. There's no production where NT98 directly produces 't9'. Wait, let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT90 appears to have a production 't90', but in the rules provided, NT90 \u2192 't9' is present. Yes, the rule NT96 \u2192 't6' is there, but looking through, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't0'\nNT90 \u2192 't9'\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 't8' must be present if it appears, but looking through the provided rules, I see NT98's production is NT90 and NT87, not a terminal. Wait, is there a terminal for NT98?\n\nLet me check each non-terminal in the grammar:\n\n- NT98's production is NT58? Wait, no, from the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\nNT91 \u2192 NT98 't7'\nOh, wait, here's a production where 't98' is used in a rule. But it's part of a longer production. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to create a list of all possible terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n3.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and each production seems to split symbols into two non-terminals on the left side, except for some that directly translate to terminals. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has several productions that map directly to 't' symbols followed by numbers, like `NT95 -> 't7'`. The string provided starts with `t8` and `t7`, so I need to see if the grammar can produce these.\n\nLet me look at how `S` starts: `S -> NT91 NT22`. So from S, we have two NTs. `NT91` must produce a sequence ending with `t8`, and `NT22` must produce `t7`. \n\nLooking at `NT91`, it can produce `NT5` and `NT96`.

Wait, looking for any production of NT73. I see:\n\nWait, the list is quite long. Let me go step by step from the start.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT73, is there a production? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see NT73 on the left side, except maybe in other places.

Wait, let's go through the entire list:\n\nLooking for 'NT73' in the left side of any rule:\n\n- No, I see NT2, NT38, NT95, etc., but not NT73. So NT73 is a terminal. Therefore, NT73 can only generate the terminal 't2'? Or is it?\n\nWait, no, looking back, I don't see any production where NT73 is on the left side, so it must be a terminal. But in that case, when NT2 produces NT73 NT38, then NT73 would be a terminal and must have a production, but if there is none, perhaps it's considered to not be in the language.

{"custom_id":"request-278","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t7 t7 t3 t0 t6 t2 t7 t7 t7 t6 t5`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way of structuring grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Given the grammar provided, it seems to consist only of these kinds of rules. That might help in parsing the string, as each step in the derivation process would replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string starts with these two non-terminals. Let's look at their expansions.\n\nNT91 can be broken down using its production: NT91 \u2192 NT12 NT87. \n\nWait, but let me check the grammar rules more carefully. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT91: NT12 NT87\n- NT87: NT95 NT53\n- NT12: NT8 NT12\n- NT53: NT68 NT31\n- NT8: t5 (from the terminal rules)\n- NT95: t1\n- NT53: t6\n- NT31: t2\n- NT68: t7 (from terminal rules)\nSo, starting with NT91, expanding to NT12 NT87, then NT12 can expand into NT8 NT12. NT8 is t5, and the other NT12 can further expand into more steps. This seems a bit recursive. Let me try tracing this.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the given string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or the CYK algorithm, but maybe manually trying to parse the string token by token would work.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t tokens and numbers. Each production in CNF can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the parse might involve checking each terminal and seeing if it matches the top of the stack.\n\nLet me list the string again: t8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t7, t7, t7, t3, t0, t6, t2, t7, t7, t7, t6, t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for each non-terminal like NT91, its expansion starts with NT12 NT87. So the initial expansion would give us a parse tree that starts with NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet's consider the first few t tokens:\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, the first part is NT91, which is t5 (from NT91's expansion) and NT87. Wait, no, NT91 \u2192 NT12 NT87. So when expanding NT91, it becomes NT12 NT87.\n\nBut NT12 can be NT8 NT12, which can further expand. Let me see the first few steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n   - The first symbol is t8. Looking at the grammar, t8 is produced by NT8 \u2192 t8, so NT8 expands to t8.\n\nBut let me think: is t8 part of NT91's expansion? NT91 is NT12 NT87.\n\nSo, the first part after S is NT91, which is NT12 NT87. So after S, we have NT91, then NT22.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the parsing process.\n\nAnother way is to use a top-down approach with memoization, but since this is a sequence of terminals, perhaps a stack-based approach would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to check each t token against the possible non-terminals that can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT8 \u2192 t8, NT6 \u2192 t5 (wait, checking again, NT6 has t5 and t8 as terminals? Let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t8 (since NT68 \u2192 t8 as per the terminal rules listed after the non-terminals)\n- NT79 \u2192 t3 (from NT79 \u2192 t3)\n- NT26 \u2192 t7 (from NT26 \u2192 t7)\n- NT56 \u2192 t7\n- NT90 \u2192 t0\n- NT75... etc.\n\nWait, let me parse through the grammar carefully to list all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLet me go through each production:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT12 NT87 \u2192 then NT12 is NT8 NT12, and NT87 is NT95 NT53.\n- NT87 \u2192 t1 (No, NT87 is NT95 NT53), but wait, NT87 isn't a terminal. So actually, NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, both of which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me go step by step.\n\nThe grammar has several production rules. Each non-terminal can be replaced either by two non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals in the grammar are based on the right-hand side of these rules. So let me list which non-terminals expand into which terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78, which are non-terminals, so no terminal here.\n- NT22 \u2192 t8 (terminal)\n- NT98 \u2192 t5 (terminal)\n- NT0 \u2192 t0\n- NT51 \u2192 t3 (since NT51 \u2192 t3)\n- NT95 \u2192 t1\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT12 \u2192 t1\nWait, wait, let's not do this, perhaps a better approach is to create a mapping of which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n   So the expansion starts with S producing NT91 and NT22.\n\n2. NT22 \u2192 t8 \u2192 So when NT22 is expanded, it's t8.\n\nSo, the first token is t8, so the NT22 must expand to t8.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT91 t8.\n\nNow, we need to expand NT91.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT12 NT87.\n\nSo, the next step is to expand NT91 into NT12 and NT87.\n\nSo now, the string is t8, and then we have NT12 and NT87 to expand.\n\nSo, the grammar proceeds by expanding NT12 and NT87.\n\nLet me think about NT12.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12.\n\nSo, that's a recursive expansion. Let's see, when we have NT12, it can expand into NT8 and then another NT12, which could repeat.\n\nWait, but NT8 can expand into t5 or t8, right?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT8 \u2192 t8 (from the given rules: NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, which are non-terminals, but perhaps other rules):\n\nWait, let me check all the rules again to see if any non-terminals directly expand into t8. \n\nLooking through the grammar, NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. No, that's two non-terminals. How about NT51 \u2192 t3. Wait, not t8.\n\nLooking further, NT68 \u2192 t8? Let me see. Looking at NT6 \u2192 t8? No, NT6 is in the terminals with t5 and t8, right?\n\nWait, let's look through the terminal rules:\n\nIn the grammar, the terminal rules are:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t8\nNT22 \u2192 t8\nNT98 \u2192 t5\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT0 \u2192 t0\nNT51 \u2192 t3\nNT95 \u2192 t1\nNT79 \u2192 t3\nNT38 \u2192 t6\nNT12 \u2192 t1\nNT90 \u2192 t0\nNT56 \u2192 t7\nNT8 \u2192 t4? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

Let's start by looking at the grammar rules and the string.\n\nThe string given is \"t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t3 t1 t7 t8 t4 t3 t3 t0 t6 t9 t7 t6\". That's a sequence of t's with numbers. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the non-terminals are like S, NT22, NT76, etc., and all of their productions eventually reduce to terminals which are these tX forms. Each production seems to split into two parts, e.g., S -> NT91 NT22. So each step, the string is built by replacing a non-terminal with two others, until we're left with only terminals.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning each production is either A->BC or A->a. So each step, the number of symbols increases by one if we produce a terminal, or stays the same but as two non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided has 17 tokens, meaning the leftmost derivation of the string must have 17 symbols, each being a terminal. \n\nLet me see the start symbol: S.

{"custom_id":"request-300","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm supposed to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember is a form where all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's a bunch of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT22, NT76, etc.) eventually breaks down into terminals like 't7', 't8', and so on. My task is to check if the string `t8 t0 t1 t0 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t9 t8 t8 t2 t7 t6` can be generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string into a sequence of terminals and see if it corresponds to any possible derivation from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t1 t0 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t9 t8 t8 t2 t7 t6.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens: that's 18 tokens. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which are two non-terminals. So the string derived from S should have an even number of terminals because each production after S either splits into two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC) or terminals.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true because non-terminals can continue splitting and the process is asynchronous. Maybe a better approach is to apply the grammar step by step, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the string as a sequence of terminals that need to be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is given, I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be matched starting from S.\n\nBut considering the size of the problem, maybe a better approach is to model this as a parsing problem and see if the parser would accept the string.\n\nWait, another thought: since the grammar uses unit productions and is in CNF, it's a simple context-free grammar without \u03b5 productions or mixed productions. Each step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or with a terminal.\n\nThe process would involve starting from S and seeing if we can replace non-terminals step by step until we're left with the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the possible steps.\n\nLooking at the production rules, let's try to build a parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So S is split into NT91 and NT22.\n\nThe string has t8 t0 t1 t0 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t9 t8 t8 t2 t7 t6.\n\nSo after S, we have NT91 and NT22. Each of these will produce a left and right part of the string.\n\nSo let's process NT91 and NT22 separately.\n\nNT91: According to the grammar, NT91 \u2192 t9 t8 (since in the productions, I saw NT91 -> t8). Wait, I need to check the production rules again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT91 \u2192 t9 t8. Wait, let me scan the productions:\n\nI see NT95 \u2192 t1, NT79 \u2192 t7, etc. Wait, looking for NT91:\n\nYes, here: NT91 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo NT91 produces 't8'. So the first part of the string after S is 't8'.\n\nOkay, so from NT91, we get 't8', so that's the first token of the string.\n\nNext, processing NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT98 NT98 (from the rule NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98? Wait, let's check the productions. \n\nWait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nLooking at NT22: the productions for NT22 are not clear. Let me list the rules for NT22:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nBut wait, looking at the given grammar, the rules are all for various non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nSo NT22 must be expanded into NT87 and NT98. So each of these is another non-terminal.\n\nSo after S, we have NT91 (which produces 't8') and NT22 (which splits into NT87 and NT98).\n\nNow, let's process NT87 and NT98.\n\nFirst, NT87: According to the productions, looking for NT87. Let's see:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n\nBecause I see NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nThen, each of these, NT95 and NT53, will be further expanded.\n\nNT95: Looking for NT95 in the productions. I see NT95 \u2192 't1' (from NT95 -> 't7'? Wait, no, let's check again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT95 -> 't1' (from NT95 -> 't1'? Wait, let me check:\n\nYes, here: NT95 -> t1.\n\nWait, no, let's see. scrolling through, I find:\n\nNT95 -> 't7' ?\n\nWait, actually, in the list, I found:\n\nNT95 -> 't1' is in the list: \"NT95 -> t1\"\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the list: I see NT95 -> t1 (from \"NT95 -> 't1'?)\" Let me confirm.\n\nYes, here: \"NT95 -> t1\"\n\nSo NT95 produces 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, for NT53: Looking through the productions, I find NT53 -> 't6' because:\n\nLooking at \"NT53 -> 't6'\". Yes, \"NT53 -> t6\".\n\nSo NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53 expands into t1 t6.\n\nSo NT87 contributes 't1' and 't6'.\n\nSimilarly, Now let's process NT98: NT98's production is NT90 NT87.\n\nFrom the productions, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nSo NT98 splits into NT90 and NT87.\n\nSo our current partial string from S's expansion is: 't8' (from NT91) followed by 't1' and 't6' (from NT87), and then 't90' (from NT90 and 't87' from NT87). Wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nSo NT98 is split into NT90 and NT87.\n\nSo we need to expand both NT90 and NT87.\n\nNT90: According to the productions, I see NT90 \u2192 't0' (since \"NT90 -> t0\"?)\n\nWait, in the list: \"NT56 -> t7\", \"NT90 -> t0\". Yes.\n\nSo NT90 \u2192 't0'.\n\nThen NT87, which we already know is NT95 NT53, which is 't1' and 't6'.\n\nSo putting that together, NT98 contributes 't0' and then 't1' and 't6'.\n\nSo the sequence from NT22 is: 't8' (from NT91), followed by the expansion of NT22 which is 't1 t6 t0 t1 t6'.\n\nWait, no. Wait: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. NT91 produces 't8', and NT22 produces NT87 NT90, which in turn produce (from NT87: t1 t6) and (NT90: t0). So the entire expansion after S is 't8 t1 t6 t0'.\n\nWait, but that's not right. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo NT91 produces 't8', and NT22 produces NT87 NT90, which in turn produce 't1 t6 t0'.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT22 expansion is a bit different. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nSo, S is split into NT91 and NT22. Then, both are expanded:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT90 \u2192 (NT95 NT53) (NT90).\n\nNT95 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT53 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT90 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo, the expansion of NT22 is 't1 t6 t0'.\n\nTherefore, the entire string after S is 't8 t1 t6 t0'.\n\nBut the original string is t8 t0 t1 t0 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t9 t8 t8 t2 t7 t6.\n\nWait, after 't8', we have 't0', but according to this, after 't8', we have 't1 t6 t0', which starts with 't1'.

{"custom_id":"request-296","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t2 t0 t7 t5 t3 t3 t6 t2 t7 t6`, and the grammar is a bit complex with a lot of non-terminal rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how to approach this. Usually, with context-free grammars, one method is to use the CYK algorithm, which parses the string based on the grammar's rules. But since I'm just doing this step-by-step, maybe I can try to see how the string can be built up from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and according to the production, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string should start with NT91 and then NT22. The given string starts with t8, which is the start of NT8, and the end is a bunch of t's. Wait, but the string is broken down into individual t's separated by spaces, so each part corresponds to a NT production.\n\nWait, no, the way it's written, it's the string that's a series of t's and numbers, but the grammar's non-terminals are defined as combinations of t's and numbers. Hmm, actually, looking at the grammar, each production seems to have two parts, each of which is a combination of letters and numbers, like NT91, NT22, etc.\n\nEach production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals. The terminals seem to be the 't' followed by numbers. So each non-terminal's production is made up of two other non-terminals, which eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nSo the string is a series of these terminals connected by spaces, meaning each 'tX' is a single terminal symbol. So the string is t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t2 t0 t7 t5 t3 t3 t6 t2 t7 t6. That's 15 terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals, so each step of the derivation would double the number of symbols. But with the given string, which is 15 symbols, it's odd, which may be a problem, but since it's a context-free grammar, it's possible through multiple levels.\n\nBut maybe I should look at the tree structure. Starting from S \u2192 NT91 NT22, each of these needs to be expanded until we get terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at NT91: from the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT96 NT68. So NT91 splits into NT96 and NT68. Now, each of these needs to be expanded further.\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT13 NT1. Both of these are single productions. NT13 is a non-terminal, as per the rules: NT13 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT87. Wait, no, NT13's production: NT13 \u2192 NT0, but wait, looking back, the grammar has NT13 \u2192 NT0? Or maybe I'm misreading. Let's check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT13 \u2192 NT0. Then NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79. So NT13 \u2192 NT0, and NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79. So expanding that:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 (NT90 \u2192 t9) (NT79 \u2192 t3). So NT13 expands to t9 t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41. NT97 \u2192 't1', as per the grammar terminal definitions: NT97 \u2192 't1'. Also, NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 't4' (because NT9 \u2192 't4'), and NT51 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 't4', but wait, wait, let me recheck.\n\nNo, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\nWait, no, that's for NT51. Let me look again:\n\nWait, the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\nNT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\nAnd NT9 \u2192 't4'\nNT51 \u2192 't3'\nWait, no, sorry, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't4'\nNT51 \u2192 't3'\nSo NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51 \u2192 't4' 't3' \u2192 t4 t3.\n\nSo putting that together, NT13 \u2192 t9 t3, and NT1 \u2192 t1 t4 t3.\n\nWait, no, actually, NT13 \u2192 NT0, which \u2192 NT90 NT79. NT90 \u2192 't9', NT79 \u2192 't3', so NT13 \u2192 t9 t3. Then NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41 \u2192 't1' 't4 t3' because NT41 is 't4' 't3'? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nNo, NT41's production is NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51. NT9 \u2192 't4', NT51 \u2192 't3', so NT41 \u2192 't4' 't3', which is t4 t3. Therefore, NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41 \u2192 't1' 't4 t3' \u2192 t1 t4 t3. So the expansion of NT1 is t1 t4 t3.\n\nWait, but NT13 \u2192 t9 t3, and NT1 \u2192 't1' 't4 t3', so that would be 't1 t4 t3' as the expansion. So NT13 and NT1 together would be t9 t3 t1 t4 t3.\n\nHmm, but the grammar's S is NT91 NT22. Let me check the production of NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. Then each of these needs to expand.\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, each of which is a non-terminal. NT95 \u2192 't1' (from NT95 \u2192 't1'). NT53 \u2192 't6' (NT53 \u2192 't6'). So NT87 \u2192 't1 t6' \u2192 t1 t6.\n\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. NT90 \u2192 't9', NT87 \u2192 't1 t6'. So NT98 \u2192 t9 t1 t6.\n\nTherefore, S \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 (NT96 NT68) (NT87 NT98) \u2192 (t9 t3) (t1 t6) (t1 t6). Wait, no: S is NT91 NT22, which expands to NT96 NT68 (from NT91) and NT87 NT98 (from NT22). So each part is:\n\nNT96 \u2192 't1', as per NT96 \u2192 't1'.\n\nNT68 \u2192 from OT68 \u2192 NT69 NT26. NT69 \u2192 't3', NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT6. Wait, NT26's production is 't1', as per NT26 \u2192 't3' or 't1'?\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, NT26 is defined by a few productions, including NT26 \u2192 't3' and NT26 \u2192 't1'. So it's ambiguous. So in our case, NT69 \u2192 't3', and NT26 \u2192 't1', so NT68 \u2192 't3' 't1' \u2192 t3 t1.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The grammar has:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n\nNT69 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo, yes, NT68 \u2192 't3 t1' \u2192 t3 t1.\n\nSo going back, NT91 \u2192 't9 t3', NT22 \u2192 't1 t6' (from NT87) and 't9 t1 t6' (from NT98) \u2192 Wait, NT22 produces two parts, NT87 and NT98, each of which expand to t1 t6 and t9 t1 t6 respectively. So NT22 \u2192 [t1 t6][t9 t1 t6] \u2192 t1 t6 t9 t1 t6. \n\nWait no, because NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, and each is a separate non-terminal. So each non-terminal in NT22 will expand separately, so the concatenation is (expansion of NT87)(expansion of NT98).\n\nSo NT87 \u2192 't1 t6', NT98 \u2192 't9 t1 t6'.

Let me count again to ensure accuracy:\n\nPositions:\n\n1. t8\n\n2. t0\n\n3. t1\n\n4. t3\n\n5. t3\n\n6. t6\n\n7. t7\n\n8. t2\n\n9. t1\n\n10. t1\n\n11. t0\n\n12. t0\n\n13. t2\n\n14. t6\n\n15. t2\n\n16. t2\n\n17. t0\n\n18. t6\n\n19. t5\n\nSo, it's 19 tokens. Hmm.\n\nSince the grammar's start symbol is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Let's consider how to parse the string.\n\nEach production in CNF only allows for two non-terminals expanding into one or more terminals. So, the initial expansion would be S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then, each of these non-terminals would have to expand further until we reach the terminals in the string.\n\nBut given the string is 19 tokens, but S \u2192 NT91 NT22 would directly produce two tokens, so perhaps we need multiple productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is to consider that S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which is the beginning. So, the first two non-terminals would need to expand into the start.\n\nBut to better understand, maybe we can think about the parse tree. Let's try a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and checking if it can be reduced.\n\nThe process would involve combining tokens from the string into non-terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check the overall structure of the string against the possible rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, which expands to NT91 and NT22. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT91 produces and NT22 produces.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Actually, each production in CNF can split into any possible non-terminals, so the string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT91 and NT22.\n\nTherefore, the string must be such that the first part is derived from NT91 and the second part from NT22, with their respective lengths.\n\nBut without knowing the exact derivation, this might be too vague. Let me look for direct matches of the terminals in the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, looking for tokens in the string that are terminals:\n\nThe tokens are t8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t6, t7, t2, t1, t1, t0, t0, t2, t6, t2, t2, t0, t6, t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of these terminals have specific non-terminals expanding into them:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT51 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5' or 't8'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT98 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT87 \u2192 't9' (Wait, is that correct? Let me check: looking at NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. So, NT87 is followed by NT95 and NT53, which then expand to 't7' and 't6' respectively. So, NT87 would produce 't7' and 't6', concatenated. But in the string, I don't see 't5's coming from 't7' and 't6's.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT53 \u2192 't6'\n\nSo, NT87 \u2192 t7 t6.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n\nNT90 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT87 \u2192 t7 t6\n\nSo, NT90 \u2192 't9', NT87 \u2192 't7 t6' \u2192 so NT98 \u2192 't9 t7 t6'.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79, which would be 't9' 't7' 't6' (from NT90) and 't7' (from NT79).

{"custom_id":"request-314","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if the given string `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t7 t6 t3 t2 t7 t3 t4 t3 t7 t8 t0 t6 t5` can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string in question. The grammar consists of a series of productions that start from the start symbol S and derive other symbols through a series of steps. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't8', which I assume correspond to terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production on the left side has two non-terminals on the right side. This is typical of a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, with A, B, and C being non-terminals, or B and C being terminals.\n\nThe string is a concatenation of several 't' followed by numbers, but each 't' is part of the terminal symbols. So, to generate the string, the grammar must be able to produce each of these terminal substrings through its productions.\n\nOne approach to solving this is to use a bottom-up parsing method, starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions to see if we can derive the string. Alternatively, a top-down approach, where we start from S and attempt to match the string step by step. Given that the string is a single sequence of terminals, I think a top-down approach might be feasible.\n\nLet me outline the strategy:\n\n1. **Start with the start symbol S**:\n   S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\n   So, the string must start with the concatenation of NT91 and NT22.\n\n2. **Check the string for the beginning**:\n   The string starts with 't8 t0 t1 t3...', which, when considering the first production from S, would require that NT91 and NT22 each generate the appropriate segments of the string.\n\n   Wait, no. Wait, each production in the grammar splits into two non-terminals. So, S\u2192NT91 NT22 means that NT91 must generate a substring, and NT22 must generate another substring, which together form the entire string.\n\n   So, the first two steps would require that NT91's derivation and NT22's derivation each produce a part of the string. Let me split the string into parts according to the grammar productions.\n\n   Let me think: the entire string is `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t7 t6 t3 t2 t7 t3 t4 t3 t7 t8 t0 t6 t5`.\n\n   Let me count the tokens to see the length: 19 tokens. Hmm, but the grammar's rules might split the string in a way that allows for this.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps I need to find a derivation path from S that can reach the string.\n\n   Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to see if the string can be broken down using the productions. Let me list all possible ways the string can be split into two parts, as each production rule has two non-terminals on the right.\n\n   So, starting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, then NT91 must produce the first part of the string, and NT22 must produce the second part.\n\n   Similarly, I can consider each NT production and see if they can produce the corresponding parts.\n\n   Let's see:\n\n   First, let's check S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\n   The entire string is the concatenation of NT91's output and NT22's output.\n\n   So, the string is len 19, so NT91 must generate the first k tokens, and NT22 the remaining 19 - k tokens, where k can vary.\n\n   Let me try to split the string after the first part that NT91 could produce.\n\n   Similarly, I can try each NT production to see if it can generate a substring.\n\n   Let me list some NTs and their possible productions:\n\n   NT91 \u2192 NT8, t or something else? Wait, let me look again.\n\n   Wait, hold on. All the productions have each NT on the left, and on the right, they split into two NTs or something else. Each production of NTs ends when it reaches a terminal.\n\n   So, for example, NT91's production is `NT5 \u2192 ...` but I think I need to map all the NTs to their productions.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I should create a list of the productions for each NT.\n\n   Let me start writing the productions for each NT as the left-hand side of their respective rules.\n\n   Looking through the given grammar:\n\n   S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\n   NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\n   NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\n\n   NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n\n   NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\n\n   NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\n\n   NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n\n   NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n\n   NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\n\n   NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\n\n   NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\n\n   NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\n\n   NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\n   NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\n\n   NT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n\n   NT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31\n\n   NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\n\n   NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n\n   NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\n\n   NT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n\n   NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31\n\n   NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26\n\n   NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\n\n   NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n\n   NT95 \u2192 't7'\n\n   NT38 \u2192 't2'\n\n   NT6 \u2192 't5'\n\n   NT6 \u2192 't8'?

Hmm, let me start by looking at the grammar rules and the string carefully.\n\nFirst, I see the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT91 NT22. So the entire string must be derived from these non-terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t1 t6 t9 t1 t0 t5 t1 t0 t2 t3 t3 t3 t6 t5. I need to see if this can be formed by substituting the non-terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me look at the top-level productions. From S, we get NT91 NT22. So the string should be split into two parts, each part generated by NT91 and NT22 respectively. So I'll need to check if the string is a concatenation of two sequences that can be generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nNext, looking at NT91, I see its productions. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT91 on the left side of any production. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar provided. Wait, no, the actual grammar has several NT91 productions, but the non-terminals on the left are the left-hand side (LHS) symbols. Let me list all the productions to get a better overview.\n\nWait, I can see some NT91 productions: NT91 -> NT95 NT53, NT91 -> NT56 NT53, and one that leads to 't8'. Oh, right, the start point is S -> NT91 NT22, and then NT91 has a rule NT91 -> 't8' which is a terminal. So if NT91 directly produces 't8', that's one way to terminate that part of the derivation.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 has a production NT22 -> 't5', which I think is one of its rules. Wait, looking back, I see NT22 -> NT98 NT90 and then from the string, the second part starts with t0, which may relate to NT90 or another NT.\n\nWait, I need to plan how to parse this string. Let me think of this as a top-down parsing problem, using the grammar to see if the string can be generated.\n\nThe string is long, so perhaps I should break it down into parts that match the rules. Let's try to analyze the structure step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t8, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT91 can produce 't8' (I think, let me check). Yes, one of the NT91 productions is NT91 -> 't8' (maybe I need to confirm that). Wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT91 -> 't8' is not present. Wait, I need to check each production carefully. Oh, no, I think I might have missed that. Let me look:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT51 -> 't3', NT53 -> 't6', NT56 -> 't7', NT68 -> 't5', NT69 -> 't3', and so on. Wait, does any NT91 have a terminal production?\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8' is probably not, but looking back, I think I might have an error. Wait, let me list all NT91 productions.\n\nWait, the grammar provided includes:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT13 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT38 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't9'\n- NT26 -> 't7'\n- NT26 -> 't9'\n- NT12 -> 't7'\n\nWait, no, I don't see an NT91 production. Hmm, perhaps I misread. Wait, let me re-examine:\n\nThe lines are:\n\n- NT95 -> 't1'\n- NT79-> 't7'\n- NT87-> 't5'\n- NT98-> 't5'\n- NT0-> 't0'\n- NT56-> 't7'\n- NT50-> 't9'\n- NT96-> 't6' (Wait, this is under NT96->, I think I'm getting confused because the first part may not be well-formatted. Maybe the user used backslashes or something. But from the user's grammar, it seems like each non-terminal has a set of productions, some leading to terminals and others to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to list each non-terminal's productions correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to consider that each NT has certain productions, some of which are terminals and others of which are concatenations of non-terminals. Since the string is a series of terminals, the derivation must proceed by expanding the non-terminals into these terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me start by considering that S can produce two parts: NT91 and NT22. So the string should be a concatenation of strings generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, let's assume that the first part of the string comes from NT91 and the second from NT22.\n\nLooking at the string: t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t1 t6 t9 t1 t0 t5 t1 t0 t2 t3 t3 t3 t6 t5.\n\nIf the first part is t8, that would correspond to NT91 -> 't8'. But wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT91 -> 't8' production. Or do I? Let me check the lines again. Scanning the grammar, I see NT51 -> 't3', NT53 -> 't6', NT56 -> 't7', etc., but no NT91 producing 't8'. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string doesn't start with t8, but maybe it's split in another way. Hmm, no, the string starts with t8. So perhaps S produces NT91 and NT22, each generating parts of the overall string. So the entire string would be NT91's string concatenated with NT22's string.\n\nSo, first, the leading t8 must come from NT91's expansion. But I don't see a direct production for NT91 -> 't8' in the grammar. So maybe that suggests it's not possible, but I must have missed it. Let me double-check all the productions for NT91.\n\nLooking through all NT91 productions:\n\nI see NT91 -> NT95 NT53\n\nIs that all? I don't see any other NT91 productions leading to t8. So perhaps t8 comes from NT91's expansion. Therefore, if there's no rule for NT91 -> 't8', then the only way for 't8' to appear in the string is if NT91 can produce it through a series of expansions, but that doesn't seem possible because NT91 can only expand into other non-terminals that themselves expand into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, let me confirm: the grammar doesn't have a rule where NT91 directly reduces to 't8', so 't8' must come from another NT91 production. Therefore, how?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for NT91 productions. Let me re-examine the grammar provided:\n\nHere, looking for NT91:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I think that NT91 isn't directly being expanded to 't8' or 'tsomething else. Wait, perhaps the production NT91 -> 't8' is elsewhere. Let me check the provided lines again.\n\nWait, no, the initial lines list NT98->'t5' etc., but I don't see NT91-> anything that's a terminal directly. So for NT91 to produce 't8', there must be a derivation that starts from NT91 and ends with 't8', but I don't see such a path.\n\nSo this suggests that the string starting with 't8' cannot be generated by the grammar, because the only way to get 't8' is if there is a production in the grammar that allows NT91 to produce 't8'. But looking through all the production rules, it doesn't seem to be the case. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a step. Let me think again: perhaps NT95 has a production that includes 't7' and 't1' or similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the string is split into two parts by S is incorrect."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing and allows for efficient algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm doing this manually, I can probably parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it consists of a series of productions where non-terminals break down into other non-terminals and terminals. Each production is in the form of A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which fits the CNF criteria.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t8 t4 t3 t2 t4 t3 t7 t6 t2 t6 t2 t6 t2 t6 t5`.\n\nI notice that the string is composed of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar. To do this, I can try to work backwards from the string and see if I can reconstruct the non-terminals that lead back to the start symbol S.\n\nLet's list out the string as tokens: t8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t8, t4, t3, t2, t4, t3, t7, t6, t2, t6, t2, t6, t2, t6, t5.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S produces NT91 NT22. So the string must be built by first producing NT91 and then NT22.\n\nSo the string can be split into two parts: the production of NT91 followed by NT22. Let's see if that holds.\n\nLooking at NT91's productions, from the grammar, NT91 can go to NT5 (which is 't5') via NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78, and then NT55 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 't3', but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT91 -> NT56 NT78.\n\nThen NT56 can produce either NT55 NT78 or NT56 NT95, which can further produce more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nThis might get complex, but perhaps another approach is to look for each production in the string and see if each terminal can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the string starts with the production of NT91, which eventually needs to produce a sequence that begins with t8, or something else.\n\nLooking at NT91's productions:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT56 NT78.\n\nSo to get the first part of the string, which is t8, let's see what produces t8.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7'\n- NT68 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't6'\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n- NT41 -> 't0'\n- NT54 -> 't5', 't0' (wait, NT54 can produce NT7 and NT0, which then produce 't7' and 't0').\n\nWait, focusing on t8: looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't8'.

Let me re-examine the user's grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT69 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT95 -> 't1'\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n\nLooking through all the terminals:\n\nLooking at the last part of the user's grammar:\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't2'\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8' (Wait, is that correct? Because NT6 appears twice with different terminals.)\n\nWait, hold on, the grammar provided lists:\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n...\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, that can't be right because each non-terminal's productions can have two symbols, but the terminal productions should each produce a single terminal. So in this case, NT6 can produce 't5' or 't8'.\n\nSo NT6 can be 't5' or 't8'.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t8. So that could come from NT6.\n\nSo, the first part of S \u2192 NT91 NT22 could have NT91 producing something leading to t8.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT56 NT78\n\nNT56 \u2192 't5' (from somewhere?

So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string that supposedly might be generated by it. My job is to determine whether that string is in the language defined by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The grammar is given with multiple production rules, each starting with a non-terminal on the left side (like S, NT22, etc.) and being rewritten into two non-terminals on the right. Some of these production rules directly produce terminal symbols (like 't7', 't2', etc.), which are the building blocks of the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t9 t0 t7 t6 t1 t8 t8 t2 t6 t9 t0 t1 t1 t6`.\n\nHmm, that's a pretty long string. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules. \n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. That simplifies things a bit because when parsing, each step increases the sentential form by one token, and reducing it by one step would require matching the right-hand side of a production to a substring of the current sentential form.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the best approach is to try to parse the string from the bottom up: starting from the terminals and trying to find production rules that match them, then work backwards to see if we can reach the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe a top-down approach would be more efficient. Starting from S, and decomposing it into non-terminals according to the production rules. Each step would generate a more complex tree, until we reach the terminals that match the input string.\n\nWait, but the string is a linear sequence of terminals, so perhaps it's easier to parse it step by step, breaking it down into chunks that match the production rules.\n\nBut I might get stuck tracking all possibilities. Maybe another approach is to represent the string as a list of tokens and see if we can recursively apply the production rules.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the production rules for non-terminals:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\nNT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\nNT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\nNT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\nNT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\nNT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\nNT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50\nNT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31\nNT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\nNT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\nNT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\nNT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\nNT68\u2192 NT25 NT31\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26\nNT41\u2192 NT9 NT51\nNT54\u2192 NT7 NT0\nNT95\u2192 't7'\nNT38\u2192 't2'\nNT6\u2192 't5' twice, and also 't8' and 't4' via other paths.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, some terminals are not covered, but maybe they can be derived through non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT6 can produce 't5' and 't8', and NT6 -> 't2' elsewhere? Wait, looking back, no\u2014actually, some of these non-terminals might derive into multiple terminals, but it's probably more structured.\n\nWait, but in the given production rules, some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, which in turn produce terminals.

The grammar is structured such that each non-terminal on the left side of an arrow produces two non-terminals on the right, except for the terminals which represent the leaves. I notice that some of the non-terminals are defined recursively, so I'll need to trace how these can be expanded to form the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT91 NT22. Each of these needs to be broken down further.\n\nLooking at NT91, according to the rules, NT91 -> NT96 NT95. Then NT95 has two rules: NT51 NT1 and NT96 NT95, but the one that applies here seems to be NT51 NT1. Wait, the rule for NT95 is actually NT95 -> NT13 NT1 or NT96 NT95. Hmm, perhaps I should look more closely. Wait, the rule is:\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\nand\nNT95 -> NT96 NT95.\n\nSo when we look at the derivation, perhaps NT95 will expand into NT13 NT1.

Let me re-examine the initial rules.\n\nWait, the initial rules are:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe target string is t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t5 t3 t2 t2 t4 t3 t7 t6 t9 t2 t6 t2 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nTo check if this string can be generated, we can attempt to parse it using the grammar. Each non-terminal in the grammar can be expanded into exactly two symbols until we reach the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, it's easier to use a recursive approach to check if each part matches.\n\nLet me list the string as a list of tokens for clarity:\n\n['t8', 't0', 't1', 't4', 't3', 't6', 't5', 't3', 't2', 't2', 't4', 't3', 't7', 't6', 't9', 't2', 't6', 't2', 't6', 't9', 't7', 't6']\n\nI can try to parse this string from left to right, matching it against the grammar.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which expands to NT91 NT22. So the string must start with NT91 and NT22 derived into the first and second parts, respectively.\n\nSo, the first two parts must be generated by NT91 and NT22, but wait, NT91 is followed by NT22. Wait, the initial rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, meaning the string should start with NT91 followed by NT22.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts. The first part would be the entire string up to a point where it can be divided, but it's more complicated because the non-terminals can have recursive expansions.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use a top-down parsing approach, ensuring that each part of the string can be represented by the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, the entire string must be the concatenation of two strings: one generated by NT91 and the other by NT22.\n\nSo, the string must be split as [t8 t0 t1 ... ] followed by [ ... ], but it's not clear where to split. Alternatively, each part is generated by NT91 and NT22, and we can try to see if that's possible.\n\nLet's first consider NT91. According to the grammar:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT96 NT95\n\nSo, it's two non-terminals: NT96 and NT95.\n\nThen, let's look at NT96 and NT95.\n\nLooking at NT96: The rules are NT96 \u2192 NT96 NT95 and NT96 \u2192 something else?\n\nWait, in the grammar provided:\n\nLooking for NT96, we have:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT96 NT95\n\nAnd also, perhaps another rule, but looking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT96 appears in NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT69 NT96\n\n- In NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76, which is covered elsewhere.\n\nSo, the rules for NT96:\n\nNT96: NT96 NT95 [production 1]?\n\nWait, in the given rules, looking for NT96:\n\nLooking back through:\n\n- NT96: NT51 NT68\n\nWait, yes, looking through the provided rules:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n\nWait, that's a different non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules provided:\n\nNT51: NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me list all the rules for NT96:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT96 is defined as NT95.\n\nWait, no, looking through, I don't see any direct rule for NT96 except in other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me go through all the non-terminals and their rules step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see the rules as:\n\nNT95 has two rules:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT96 NT95\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n\nNT68 appears in NT78 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list each non-terminal and see their possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to construct the parse tree.\n\nWait, let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, we have [Part A: generated by NT91] concatenated with [Part B: generated by NT22].\n\nEach part must match the respective substrings of the input.\n\nSo, let's find out what NT91 can expand into.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT96 NT95\n\nSo, Part A is NT96 NT95.\n\nNow, each of these must be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT96: from the provided rules, is there a rule for NT96?\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT96: NT51 NT68.\n\nWait, because in the list of non-terminals, I see NT51 and others. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 \u2192 Wait, perhaps I got that wrong earlier. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT51 is defined as NT51 NT68. Yes, here:\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nBut wait, that can't be a production because it would cause an infinite loop. Hmm, perhaps that's a typo in the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68 ?\n\nYes, the line says: NT51 -> NT51 NT68.\n\nWait, that's a rule that can lead to infinite recursion unless it has a terminal somewhere.\n\nWait, but in the string given, perhaps we can see if NT51 expands into something that produces t0.\n\nWait, let me check other rules for NT51:\n\nNT51: NT51 -> NT51 NT68\n\nThen, is there another rule? Let me scan all the rules.\n\nWait, the rules for NT51 are only that one line: NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68.\n\nThat seems wrong because it would cause infinite recursion. Maybe it's supposed to be another rule. Perhaps a typo, maybe NT51 \u2192 NT69 NT96.\n\nWait, looking elsewhere in the rules, I see:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\nWait, maybe NT51 is supposed to expand into something else. Wait, looking through all the NT51 rules again, only NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 is present.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct, but that would mean NT51 can only produce more NT51 and NT68, leading"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-375","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is useful for parsing, especially with algorithms like CYK.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see all non-terminals on the left side of the productions. The terminals are various 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT79 \u2192 't7' and others.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t8 t1 t3 t1 t6 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t1 t0 t7 t2 t6.\n\nFirst, let's count the tokens. There are 21 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of non-terminals in the derivation will be related to the string length.\n\nIn CNF grammars, the minimum number of steps to derive a string of length n is (n-1)*2 due to the way the non-terminals split. But more importantly, the string length minus one divided by two gives an idea of the tree depth.\n\nLet's see how the starting symbol S \u2192 NT91 NT22 can split. Each of these non-terminals will be processed, so the first two tokens should be from either NT91 or NT22.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT91: NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT98.\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, and NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8. Looking at the NT91 productions:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT76 NT98 \u2192 then each of those split again.\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26 \u2192 which both go into 't3' or something else. Wait, actually, NT76 is split into NT69 and NT26. Let me check their productions.\n\nWait, let me make a tree:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT76 NT98 (from the production).\n\nSo, t8 t0... Let me look at the starting symbols.\n\nWait, let's see the string and try to see if it can be split accordingly.\n\nThe first token is t8. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t8.\n\nLooking through, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26, which don't directly produce t8.

Wait, in the given grammar, it's written:\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1 \u2192 't1'\n\nYes, so NT95 can produce 't1' directly.\n\nWait, but looking for t8, so I'm interested in non-terminals that can produce t8 when they split. Looking at the productions, let me find which non-terminals produce t8.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT98 \u2192 't6' and NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. NT90 is 't9'; NT87 is 't95' and produces 't9' and 't5'? Wait, maybe I should list the direct terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to list all non-terminals and see which ones produce t8. From the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53 \u2192 't5', 't3' perhaps?\n\nWait, looking at each production's right-hand side:\n\nLooking through all productions, which have a terminal of t8. I see:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 NT53 NT58? Wait, I don't see a t8 in any production's terminal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the productions are listed as:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78 \u2192 and then NT58 is not a terminal but another non-terminal? So no t8 in that path.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any t8 except possibly in NT73 \u2192 't7' or 't3'? Let me check each production:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't3' and 't6'\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let's create a list of all the right-hand sides that produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38 \u2192 and then NT73 \u2192 't6', NT38 \u2192 't3' and 't6'. So NT2 can produce t6 and t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT76 \u2192 't3' and 't26' non-terminals?\n\nWait, no. Let me go through each production:\n\nWait, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26.\n\nThe productions for NT69 and NT26 might produce terminals, but looking through:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 NT6 NT2 \u2192 NT6 produces 't6' and 't6' and NT2 produces 't5' or 't8'?\n\nWait, no. Let me see NT6:\n\nNT6 is split into NT6 \u2192 't6' and 't6' again. So NT6 can produce 't6' directly.\n\nWait, no. NT6's productions are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't6' and 't6'?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT6: \n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT6:\n\nThere are two lines:\n\nNT6 -> 't6'\n\nNT6 -> 't6'\n\nSo NT6 can produce 't6' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT2:\n\nLooking back, NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38. NT73 \u2192 't6' and NT38 can be 't3' or 't6'.\n\nWait, so NT2 can produce 't6' via NT73 \u2192 't6', and via NT38 \u2192 't3' or 't6'.\n\nHmm. Now, t8 is in the string first. Let me see if any production leads to 't8'.\n\nLooking through the terminal symbols in the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n\nYes, because looking at the grammar:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nThen, looking at NT87 and NT98:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53 \u2192 which might produce 't1' (from NT95 \u2192 't1') and NT53. NT53's production may produce more non-terminals. Wait, NT53 is not in the terminals. Let's see: NT53 \u2192 't5' is it? Or is that another non-terminal? No, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, NT53 \u2192 maybe it's a non-terminal. Let me check:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78, which might lead to 't5's, but perhaps not. Wait, let me check NT95.\n\nNT95 has two productions: one into 't1' and another into NT13 NT1. Hmm, not directly producing t8.\n\nWait, back to NT22. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98 \u2192 so the string starts with t8. So perhaps the first two symbols come from NT87 \u2192 't8', and then something else.\n\nWait, no, looking at NT87's productions: NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. So NT87 can produce 't1' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8. So perhaps the first t8 comes from NT22, but let me check if NT22 can directly produce t8. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, which don't produce t8 directly. So perhaps the first symbol t8 comes from another path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to look for which non-terminals can produce 't8'.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I see that:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't0' and 't9'?\n\nWait, let me check NT70's production: NT70 \u2192 NT2 NT69. That's a production, but that's a split into two non-terminals, neither of which produce a terminal 't8'.\n\nLooking through other non-terminals:\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT53 NT58 (where NT58 is not a terminal).\n\nWait, perhaps I should systematically check each non-terminal for whether it can produce 't8':\n\n1.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It looks like the starting symbol is S, which is defined as NT91 NT22. Both NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals, so the string should start with whatever productions they can derive into.\n\nLooking at NT91, the rule is NT91 -> NT87 NT98. NT87 is given as NT95 NT53, and NT98 is NT90 NT87. Let me follow that path step by step.\n\nStarting with NT91:\n- NT91 -> NT87 NT98\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87 (But wait, that's the same as NT87; so NT87 is recursive here. Let me see if I can break it down further)\n- Wait, no, NT98 is NT90 NT87, and NT87 is NT95 NT53, which might be terminal.\n\nLet me see the terminal productions in the grammar:\nLooking through the rules, I notice some where the non-terminals are replaced by 't' followed by numbers, like NT95 -> 't7', NT38 -> 't2', NT6 -> 't5', etc. So when these non-terminals appear, they produce specific terminal strings.\n\nBut for NT98: it's NT90 NT87. Let's see what NT90 produces. NT90 is NT8->? Wait, looking at the rules: NT90 isn't a production in the list. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the list seems long, but I might have skipped over NT90. Looking again: I see NT95 -> 't7', NT38->t2, NT6->t5, but NT90? Let me scan all the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT8->'t4', but no NT90. Wait, maybe NT90 is derived from some other rule. Let me check the list: NT0 is defined as NT90 NT79. Oh, so NT90 is part of NT0's production, but NT0 isn't in the string we're evaluating. Hmm, perhaps the string doesn't involve NT0, so maybe NT90 isn't directly involved here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check NT98. NT98 is NT90 NT87. Both NT90 and NT87 are non-terminals, but if NT90 is NT90 NT79, which is also recursive. That doesn't seem helpful. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me retrace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try to parse the string step by step, seeing if it can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t1 t0 t3 t5 t0 t2 t2 t0 t8 t1 t2 t0 t7 t7 t6 t5\n\nSo, the first symbol is t8. Let me see what productions end with t8. Looking at the grammar, NT87 -> NT95 NT53, and then NT95 -> 't7'. So that's one possibility. Wait, but the first token is t8. Let me see if any rule produces t8.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT8 -> 't4', NT2->'t5', but no NT8->'t8'. Maybe NT95->'t7', so how does t8 get produced?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. The grammar is given as S -> NT91 NT22. Let me see what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nNT91: NT91 -> NT87 NT98\nNT87: NT95 NT53\nNT53: looking through the rules, I don't see NT53 being defined as terminals. Wait, is there a rule for NT53? I don't see any, so maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rules. Let me re-examine the grammar carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, for NT53, I don't see any production. That would mean NT53 is a non-terminal, so it can't be used in the string. So, that path is invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me instead look for t0 in the string and see which rules produce t0.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT51 -> 't3', NT41->'t0', NT79->'t3', NT50->'t9', NT95->'t7', etc. So, perhaps t0 comes from NT41->'t0', but looking at the grammar, do any non-terminals produce NT41?\n\nWait, the starting symbol is S->NT91 NT22, so I need to follow those.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to find the parse tree for the string, working from the string backwards. Let's try using memoization and look for possible splits.\n\nThe string starts with t8, which could be part of a larger production. For example, NT95->'t7', so if I have a production that includes NT95, but t8 doesn't come from that. Wait, perhaps I should see if any non-terminal directly produces t8. I don't think so, because looking through all the terminal productions, none of them produce 't8' at the top.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me list all the terminal productions I can find:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't2'\nNT6 -> 't5' (appears in multiple places)\nNT6 -> 't8' (Wait, looking back: I think I might have copied wrong. Let me recheck the grammar rules as provided.)\n\nWait, the grammar rules as given at the top include:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, that's two rules for NT6: NT6 can produce 't5' or 't8'. So, when a NT6 appears in the grammar, it can derive either 't5' or 't8'.\n\nSo, if the string has a 't8', that could come from NT6 in the production where NT6 -> 't8'.\n\nBut in our string, the first token is t8. So the first step is to see if the entire string can be generated starting from S->NT91 NT22, which would have to produce the string.\n\nWait, but S produces NT91 and NT22. So NT91 would produce the first part of the string, and NT22 the second part. So let's consider how S splits into NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me look at the production for NT91: NT91 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53. Now, NT95 produces 't7', and NT53 is a non-terminal that probably can't generate t8, but the string starts with t8, so maybe this path isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step where a NT6 in the productions can generate t8.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step, trying to find a possible split.\n\nLet me consider that the first symbol in the string is t8. So, in NT91's production, after NT87 (which is NT95 NT53), if NT95 is 't7', then the first part would produce 't7', but the string starts with 't8', so that wouldn't match. So perhaps NT91 isn't producing that part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong branch. Let me check if there's another way NT91 can produce t8, but from the rules, I don't see any non-terminals in NT91's production leading directly to t8.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for other possible non-terminals in NT91's production that can produce t8.\n\nWait, perhaps NT91 can't produce t8, so maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nLet me consider NT22's production: NT22->NT87 NT98.\n\nNT87 is NT95 NT53, as before. Then NT98->NT90 NT87. So, if both NT95 and NT90 can produce t's, maybe that can give us the t8 at the beginning.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's try to break down the entire string into parts that could match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: [t8] [t0] [t1] [t4] [t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It starts with the production S -> NT91 NT22. So, any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. Looking at the productions, these NTs are made up of other NTs until they reach terminals (like 'tX' and other letters), which eventually resolve to actual 't's or digits.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t1 t5 t0 t3 t6 t0 t3 t3 t1 t0 t9 t7 t1 t0 t2 t6 t5`.\n\nWait, actually, I think some terms here might be confusing because the grammar has NT symbols followed by numbers, like NT91. But in the string, the tokens are all lowercase t's and numbers, which are probably the terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S, it must derive to NT91 NT22. Let's check if the string can be broken down into two parts corresponding to NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll split it into two parts. The first part should be NT91, and the second NT22.\n\nThe first part: `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t1 t5 t0 t3 t6 t0 t3 t3 t1 t0 t9 t7 t1 t0 t2 t6 t5` \nWait, that's too long. Wait, the string might be split as two parts, each possibly up to certain lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the string as a sequence of 'nt's and their expansions. Each 'nt' (like NT91) is a non-terminal that expands into a sequence of terminals or other non-terminals, which eventually resolve to the actual terminals.\n\nWait, no, the grammar itself is given as S -> NT91 NT22, so the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals, which in turn expand further until they reach terminals. But looking at the grammar, after S, the expansions seem to be of the form NTx, which are non-terminals that eventually resolve into a terminal followed by another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait, let me list out some of the grammar productions to see how they expand:\n\nNT91 -> `t8` `t0`\nWait, looking at the given grammar, let me find NT91's production.\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't2'\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8' \nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

That can't be correct. Perhaps it's a typo, and one of them should be another NT symbol, like NT6-> 't5' and NT66-> 't8' or something. But as it stands, the grammar as written has a contradiction, which is impossible. So perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the grammar.\n\nBut assuming that it's correct, perhaps it's a misrepresentation, and the actual grammar is correctly structured without such inconsistencies. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have one production for NT6, such as NT6-> 't5', and another NT like NT8-> 't8' (but perhaps the grammar lines are misaligned).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a multi-line issue where some lines have multiple productions. Alternatively, perhaps each NT production is in a separate line.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the grammar correctly. Looking at the grammar as presented:\n\nIt starts with S, then other NT symbols and their productions.\n\nEach production line starts with the NT on the left, followed by an arrow, and then the right-hand side.\n\nSo, for example, the first line after S is:\n\nNT22-> NT87 NT98\n\nSo, NT22 is replaced by NT87 NT98.\n\nThen, each subsequent line is another production of a different NT.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, it starts with S and then lists each NT and its production:\n\nS -> NT91 NT22\n\nNT22-> NT87 NT98\n\nNT76-> NT69 NT26\n\nNT68-> NT6 NT41\n\nNT7-> NT69 NT96\n\nNT12-> NT8 NT12\n\nNT87-> NT95 NT53\n\nNT51-> NT51 NT68\n\nNT98-> NT90 NT87\n\nNT0-> NT90 NT79\n\nNT56-> NT55 NT78\n\nNT2-> NT73 NT38\n\nNT95-> NT13 NT1\n\nNT50-> NT2 NT69\n\nNT25-> NT45 NT50\n\nNT31-> NT54 NT31\n\nNT79-> NT51 NT76\n\nNT56-> NT56 NT95\n\nNT1-> NT97 NT41\n\nNT54-> NT50 NT56\n\nNT68-> NT25 NT31\n\nNT1-> NT12 NT26\n\nNT41-> NT9 NT51\n\nNT54-> NT7 NT0\n\nNT95-> 't7'\n\nNT38-> 't2'\n\nNT6-> 't5'\n\nNT6-> 't8'\n\nWait, as I see, some NTs have multiple productions, some have the same production in two lines, but also in some cases, an NT points to another NT and a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking more carefully, each production for an NT seems to be a combination of other NTs or terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-417","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's see. First, I should probably understand the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar starts with S and the productions go from S to NT91 NT22, then each of those NTs (non-terminals) produce other NTs or terminals. Looking closer, I notice some NTs have terminals as productions, like NT95 -> 't7', and others don't. So the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, and the NTs are more complex.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t0 t7 t2 t1 t0 t0 t1 t0 t2 t5 t1 t7 t7 t6`.\n\nThat's a sequence of 24 tokens. I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting with S.\n\nLet me outline the approach. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A->BC or A->\u03c3, where A, B, C are non-terminals and \u03c3 is a terminal string. In this case, the non-terminals seem to have productions either pointing to other non-terminals or directly to a single terminal.\n\nThe key idea in CNF is that each production rule leads to exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to parse the given string, I can work backwards: start from the string and try to split it into parts that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nIf the entire string can be broken down according to these productions, starting from S, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nBut wait, actually, working forward might be more complicated, especially since the string is quite long. But since the end symbol must be matched at each step, starting from S and expanding step by step might be tedious. Alternatively, parsing from the end might be better because we can try to match the string from the end towards the start.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nThe string ends with t7 t7 t6. Looking at the grammar, NT1 -> 't7', but wait, actually NT96 is a production that leads to 't6' and 't7'. Wait no, NT96 could be production, but in the given grammar, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT96, I see multiple entries: NT96 -> 't7', 't6', which seems off because in CNF, each non-terminal should have productions with exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A->BC or A->a, so all productions for NT must be either two non-terminals or a terminal. The issue is that the user might have mistyped some entries, maybe.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT96 -> NT96 NT55\nNT55 -> NT8 NT9\nNT9 -> 't4'\nAnd other productions. Hmm, so some NTs lead to multiple steps.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to list all the NTs and their possible terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't6' (is there more than one? It seems so. Wait, NT38 appears here: NT38 -> 't2', but also in another production? Wait, looking again, I see NT38 -> 't2' but no, actually, in the given rules, I think there might be multiple entries for each NT.\n\nWait, actually, I think the way the grammar is presented is with all the productions for each NT. So for NT95, the production is NT95 -> 't7', as per the rule. Similarly, looking for other NTs that have terminal productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5' (twice? No, I think the user listed it twice, which might be a mistake, but the actual production is once)\n- NT6 -> 't8' (again, same NT6 has two such lines)\n- NT26 -> 't7', 't9', 't6' (three productions)\n- NT0 -> 't0' (four times)\n- NT56 -> 't0' (three times)\n- NT90 -> 't0' (twice)\n- NT79 -> 't3', 't9' (two times)\n- NT2 -> 't5' (twice)\n- NT41 -> 't0' (twice)\n- NT54 -> 't5' (twice)\n- NT91 -> 't8' (twice)\n- NT76 -> 't5' (twice)\n- NT96 -> 't6' (twice)\n- NT56 -> 't7' (twice)\n- NT22 -> 't8' (twice)\n- NT5 -> 't0'? Wait, no, looking again, I realize that the grammar provided might have errors because many NTs have multiple same terminal productions, but the problem is that in CNF, each non-terminal can have only one production that leads to a terminal, or else we can't apply the standard CYK parsing.\n\nWait, maybe each NT can have only one production that ends in a terminal. Otherwise, it's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT can have multiple productions, but all non-terminals must have only one production that leads to a terminal, but that's not necessarily true. Hmm, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A->BC or A->a. So, for a production to have multiple a's, they would have to be split into multiple steps. So perhaps the grammar has some NTs with multiple a productions, which would require breaking them down.\n\nWait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should focus on the string and see how it can be split.\n\nThe string is: t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t0 t7 t2 t1 t0 t0 t1 t0 t2 t5 t1 t7 t7 t6.\n\nLet me write it as a list for easier handling:\n\n1. t8\n2. t7\n3. t6\n4. t9\n5. t0\n6. t1\n7. t3\n8. t3\n9. t6\n10. t9\n11. t0\n12. t7\n13. t2\n14. t1\n15. t0\n16. t0\n17. t1\n18. t0\n19. t2\n20. t5\n21. t1\n22. t7\n23. t7\n24. t6\n\nNow, since the string must be generated starting with S, and S splits into NT91 NT22, which in turn requires t8 and t7, which correspond to the first two tokens.\n\nWait, S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nSo for S, the left part NT91 must produce t8, and NT22 must produce t7. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at NT95 -> 't7', but that's not NT91. Looking at NT91's productions: NT91 -> 't8' (twice), so NT91 can produce t8.\n\nSo NT91 -> t8.\n\nThen NT22: the productions for NT22 are 't8' (twice). So NT22 can produce t8 or t7?\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, looking at the given grammar, the production NT22 is: NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Did I misinterpret the grammar?\n\nLooking back, in the given grammar, S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nAnd looking at NT91: NT91 -> 't8' (twice). So NT91 can produce t8.\n\nBut for NT22: looking at the given rules, I don't see any production that starts with NT22 leading to a terminal. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the original grammar, the rules for NT22 are: NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nThat means NT22 is a non-terminal that, according to the given grammar, expands into NT87 and NT98. Wait, so NT22 is an intermediate that needs to be expanded further, and in this case, we need to see if the second part (t7) can be derived from NT98.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nI think I misread the initial grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-413","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t3 t3 t3 t7 t6 t9 t5 t1 t7 t7 t9 t0 t2 t8 t1 t7 t6 t5`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens. I'm not entirely sure where to start, but let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where each rule either produces a symbol (like a terminal) or another non-terminal. The grammar given is in CNF, so that helps because each step in the derivation will produce exactly one symbol or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that each non-terminal S and NT... is defined as producing two non-terminals. The process will likely involve repeatedly expanding these non-terminals until we have all terminals. The string has 24 tokens, which is a lot, so I'll need to see if the grammar can produce a string of that length. Each expansion increases the number of symbols by one until we can't expand anymore, so the number of steps is related to the depth of the derivation.\n\nLet me look at the string and see the sequence of tokens:\n\nt8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t7, t3, t3, t3, t7, t6, t9, t5, t1, t7, t7, t9, t0, t2, t8, t1, t7, t6, t5.\n\nWait, that's 24 tokens. Since the grammar starts with S -> NT91 NT22, which after expansion will produce 2 symbols. Each non-terminal can produce two symbols each time. So the number of symbols increases exponentially with the number of steps.\n\nBut maybe instead of tracking that, I should try to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing is the process of building a parse tree by applying the grammar rules.\n\nParsing can be done with methods like recursive descent or using an automaton, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll look for the non-terminals in the grammar that match sequences in the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if each non-terminal in the grammar corresponds to a substring of the main string, and check if the grammar can accept that.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the possible non-terminals and see how the string can be broken down. Let me look at the grammar again. It's structured with NT followed by two other NTs or a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT91 -> NT81 NT9? Wait, looking back, the grammar seems to have NT91 in the first rule. Let me list all the rules again to get a clearer picture.\n\nThe starting rule is S -> NT91 NT22. So to derive the string, the full string must be produced from NT91 and NT22.\n\nLet me see, but the string is quite long, so maybe I can look at it in parts. The string starts with t8, so perhaps it's generated by some non-terminal that can produce t8. Looking through the grammar, I see NT87 -> NT95 NT53, NT51 -> some product, but wait, are any of the non-terminals directly producing t8? Let me check the last few rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT91 -> ... Maybe I should list all non-terminal productions and see which can produce a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT51 -> NT51 NT68. Wait, but NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41, and NT6 \u2192 't5' (I can see in the list, NT6 is 't5'), NT41 is 't0' (from NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51, but wait, no, looking back, wait, the grammar shows:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68 (but wait, does that mean it's a recursive production? That might be problematic if needed, but let's keep going).\n- NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41. NT6 is 't5', NT41 is 't0', so NT68 would produce t5 t0, right? Because NT68 is split into NT6 and NT41, which then produce 't5' and 't0'. So combining, NT68 would produce 't5 t0'.\n\nWait, but looking at the list, some rules have things like NT26 -> NT79, maybe? No, wait, the rules are:\n\nNT90 -> 't9', so it's a terminal. Similarly, NT51 -> 't9', etc.\n\nLet me look for tokens that are terminals and see if the grammar has rules that can produce those.\n\nSo, for example, the first token is t8. Does any non-terminal produce t8? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. So that's two parts.\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'?\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT95 -> 't1'; no, wait, no, the list says:\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each non-terminal and what they produce.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be decomposed starting from the beginning. For example, the string starts with t8, t0, t1... Maybe the first non-terminal in the grammar can start with t8.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the full string must be the production of NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, is the string a concatenation of the productions of NT91 and NT22? If so, I can split the string into two parts, one produced by NT91 and the other by NT22.\n\nLooking at the string: It's 24 tokens. Let's see if splitting them into two parts somewhere is possible. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each part of the string corresponds to a part of a production.\n\nBut this might take a while. Maybe I should look for the tokens that are leaves in the grammar, i.e., the terminals, and see if their sequence can be traced back to the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to create a parse tree for the string. Starting from S, which produces NT91 NT22. Let's consider each NT.\n\nFirst, looking at NT91. What can NT91 produce?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I only see S -> NT91 NT22. I don't remember NT91 being listed elsewhere. Wait, looking further:\n\n- Looking through all the non-terminals, I don't see any production for NT91 except its usage in S. So, maybe NT91 can only be derived further if it's part of another production. Wait, perhaps I missed a rule.\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\n- The rules for NT91: I don't see any other production except the first one, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So that suggests that NT91 is a terminal, right? Because it doesn't have a production. But wait, no, all non-terminals must have a production because it's a context-free grammar in CNF. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, non-terminals must have exactly two non-terminals, unless it's a terminal, which can't have a production.\n\nWait, but some non-terminals might produce a terminal. So, for example, NT51 \u2192 't9' and NT98 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, some rules appear on the left side and produce two non-terminals, but others actually produce a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check each production and see if any produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n\nSimilarly, NT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n\nBut NT6 \u2192 't5' and NT41 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all rules that have the form NTx -> 't?'. Yes, like NT5 \u2192 't5', NT6 \u2192 't5', NT6\u2192't5' again, etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT51 \u2192 NT69 NT56. Wait, no. Wait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\n\nWait, no, that seems like a recursive production, which might be problematic because if we have a production that refers to itself, it might lead to an infinite loop, but perhaps it's allowed as a base case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake, and the rules are all properly defined. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nFor NT5: NT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nSimilarly, NT6 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT6 \u2192 another production: NT6 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, looking at the entire list:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with rules like S -> NT91 NT22, and each non-terminal (NT91, NT22, etc.) has its own production. Each of these non-terminals eventually expands into a combination of terminals ('t' followed by numbers) or other non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the string, I see that it's a sequence of 26 tokens. Each token is 't' followed by a number, like 't6' or 't8'. My goal is to see if these can be derived from the grammar's rules.\n\nI need to parse the string from the start symbol S. Let's start by breaking down the grammar's initial rule: S -> NT91 NT22. So S is split into two parts: NT91 and NT22. Each of these must generate a part of the string.\n\nLet me look at the productions for NT91 and NT22. NT91 has a production NT95 NT51, which then breaks down further. Let's see if I can follow a chain of substitutions.\n\nStarting with NT91:\n- NT91 -> NT95 NT51\n- NT95 -> NT13 NT1\n- NT1 -> NT97 NT41\n- NT97 -> NT1\n- NT41 -> NT9 NT51\n- NT9 -> NT3\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68\n- Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe I should instead look for the terminals and see how the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down parsing approach would work. Let's try to see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nBut without knowing the exact parsing tree, it's tough. Maybe I can reconstruct the production steps.\n\nLooking at the string starting with 't8', let's see which non-terminals produce 't8'.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side, except for the start symbol which can have the empty string. \n\nFirst, I'll note that each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT22, NT12, etc.) eventually resolves into a string of terminals (the 't' tokens with numbers). The grammar seems a bit complex, with multiple recursive rules. My goal is to see if the entire string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string has 25 tokens, so I need to check if there's a way to split this string into the components that the grammar produces. Since it's in CNF, each step of the derivation will add exactly two tokens to the string. Wait, no\u2014actually, that's only if the grammar is being applied step by step, but in reality, each production expands a single non-terminal into two non-terminals, which can then themselves expand further until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me consider how the string length relates to the grammar. In CNF, each production replaces one non-terminal with two, so for a string of length n, the number of steps needed to derive it is n-1. But in this case, the string has 25 tokens, so starting from S, we'd need 24 steps. However, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals can produce terminal symbols directly. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7', so that's a direct terminal.\n\nI'll try to see if I can break down the string into parts that match the grammar's rules. Let's list all the possible non-terminals that produce terminals and their corresponding 't' strings:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (from looking at productions like NT6 \u2192 't5', etc. Wait, multiple rules produce 't5', 't6', etc.)\nWait, actually, many non-terminals have productions that result in terminal symbols. For example, NT66: Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see something like NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31, and then NT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50, and NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69. This seems to break down into various 't's.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this by working backward from the string. Let me think about the structure of the grammar. The start symbol S is the top-level rule: S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string must start with whatever NT91 produces and be followed by whatever NT22 produces.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with 't8', ends with 't5'.\n\nLet me check what NT91 and NT22 can produce.\n\nNT91: Let's see the productions for NT91. Looking through the rules, I see that NT95 \u2192 't7' and other rules, but I don't see NT91 in the provided rules. Wait, is NT91 even a defined non-terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I only see productions for NT91 if it's on the left side. For example, in the given grammar: NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96, NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, NT66... Wait, actually, in the provided rules, I don't see NT91 except possibly in one rule: \"NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\". No, that's not it. Wait, let me scan all the left-hand sides.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nOther rules:\n\nNT72, NT87, NT76, NT68, NT7, NT12, NT87, NT51, NT98, NT0, NT56, NT2, NT95, NT50, NT25, NT31, NT79, NT56, NT1, NT54, NT68, NT1, NT41, NT54, NT95, etc.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I don't see any production starting with NT91 except for S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So NT91 is only used in S's production. That means that NT91 must expand into something. But looking through the rules, I don't see any rule for NT91 except perhaps as part of S's production. So NT91 is a non-terminal that's only on the left side of one rule, which is the start symbol S's production. Therefore, to find what NT91 expands into, we need to see its definition. Wait, does the grammar define NT91 beyond what's given?\n\nLooking back, I don't see NT91 being defined as a rule. It's only on the right side of S's rule. That could be a problem because if NT91 is a non-terminal that's only used in S's production but isn't defined itself (i.e., it doesn't have a production rule for itself), then it's undefined, meaning it can't produce any string, so the entire string can't be generated. But that doesn't make sense because it's given as a start symbol. Maybe I missed a rule for NT91.\n\nWait, let's look through all the rules again. Hmm. Oh, I see: \"NT95 \u2192 't7'\", \"NT7 \u2192 't1'\", \"NT8 \u2192 't4'\", etc. But I don't see any rules for NT91 except perhaps in S's rule. So that would mean NT91 doesn't have a production rule in the grammar. If that's the case, then the grammar is invalid because S can't expand into something that can't be further expanded, right? So NT91 must have a production rule. Wait, but according to the provided grammar, it's not there. So does this mean that NT91 is undefined, making the entire grammar invalid or that S can't generate any string because it can't expand further?\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me double-check. S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then, NT91... If there's no rule for NT91, then it's not a valid grammar because the start symbol must expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, each of which must have a production.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the rules. Let me look again. The user provided:\n\nThe first line: ```S -> NT91 NT22```\n\nThen all the other rules start with something like `NT22 -> ...`, etc.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I missed a production for NT91. Looking again, I don't see any rule starting with NT91 except for the start symbol S. Therefore, NT91 must have a production rule. But looking through all the rules, there is no NT91 production. So that implies that NT91 is not defined, which is a problem because S can't expand into something that isn't a non-terminal that can be further expanded.\n\nTherefore, the grammar is malformed because the start symbol S depends on NT91, which has no production. That would mean that the grammar can't generate any string because S can't expand into anything. But this can't be right because the problem gives this as a grammar and asks whether the string is generated by it. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in reading the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me look again. Oh, wait! In the list, the last few entries include \"NT95 \u2192 't7'...\". Before that, I see \"NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\", and \"NT73 \u2192 NT67 NT38\"\u2014no, wait, actually looking at the given rules:\n\nWait, scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n...\nYeah, looking through all the production rules, the first line is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and then all others are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. So I must have read that incorrectly; maybe NT91 does have a production rule.\n\nWait, let's check all the rules again carefully. I might have missed it earlier.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT91 NT22, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\nNT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\nNT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87\nNT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\nNT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\nNT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\nNT25 \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-455","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So every non-terminal A expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. That should make parsing a bit easier.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. There are a bunch of rules, each starting with something like S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and then each NT has its own rules. I notice many of the non-terminals lead directly to terminals, like NT95 \u2192 't7' or NT50 \u2192 't9'. So these are the leaf nodes of the derivation tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t0 t9 t8 t8 t1 t0 t2 t7 t6 t5 t3 t5 t1 t0 t2 t6 t0 t7 t6.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. Let me try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the first step is to derive NT91 and NT22. Let's see what each of these produce.\n\nLooking at NT91, I don't see a rule for it in the provided grammar. Wait, maybe I missed it. Scanning through... No, I don't see NT91 as a non-terminal; all the rules start with NT something but maybe it's not a terminal. Oh, maybe NT91 is supposed to break down further. Hmm, but in the given grammar, NT95 \u2192 't7', which is a terminal. So maybe NT91 is a terminal. But in the string, the first symbol is t8, which isn't t7, so maybe NT91 leads to another non-terminal that eventually leads to t8.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NTs and their possible expansions. Let me go through each NT in the rules.\n\nStarting with NT91: It doesn't have a rule listed, so maybe it's a terminal. But t8 is the first symbol. So NT91 should derive 't8' somehow. Let me check if any other rules involve NT91. For example, do any other NTs have rules leading to NT91? Let me see: looking through all the rules, none have NT91 as the left side except for NT91 \u2192 maybe something. Wait, no, in the rules provided, I don't see NT91 on the left side. Wait, no, the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So that rule doesn't show what NT91 expands into. So that's an issue. Maybe the grammar is incomplete, but I have to assume it's well-formed. Alternatively, perhaps NT91 is a terminal and can directly produce a symbol, but since S starts with NT91, perhaps NT91 produces a production that starts with t8.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check NT91 again. Looking through all the rules:\n\nI see NT95 \u2192 't7', NT50 \u2192 't9', NT68 \u2192 't5', etc. But NT91 is not listed as a source of terminals. So perhaps NT91 has a rule that leads into another NT that produces a terminal. For instance, perhaps NT91 expands into something like NT95 NT6, which could then produce t7 t5 or something. But I don't have that rule. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in scanning the rules. Let me check each rule again. I don't see NT91 as a production in the given rules, which suggests that either it's a terminal or it's a non-terminal that's supposed to lead to other symbols. Since the first symbol in the string is t8, maybe NT91 produces some combination that starts with t8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see what NT22 produces, since S starts with NT91 NT22, and then perhaps the second part is NT22, which may produce t22. Wait, no, in the string, after t8 comes t0, which is t0, t1, etc. So maybe the parse tree is more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to construct the parse tree step by step, using the given rules.\n\nStart with S: S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the first step is to generate NT91 and NT22. Let's look at each.\n\nNT91: Since there's no rule for NT91 except possibly another one. Wait, in the first part of the rules, NT95 \u2192 't7', but NT91 isn't directly defined. So maybe NT91 is a terminal, and the string starts with t8, which would mean NT91 must produce t8. But in the given rules, none of the NTs are defined for NT91 as producing 't8'. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe NT91 can expand into another combination.\n\nWait, perhaps NT91 is part of a higher rule. For example, maybe NT91 \u2192 NT95 NT6. Let me check if NT95 has a rule. Yes, NT95 \u2192 't7'. Then NT6 \u2192 t5 or t8 or t2 or t6, etc. So NT95 is 't7', and NT6 is another terminal. So NT91 could potentially produce 't7' followed by 't5' (if NT6 is 't5'), but in the string, the first symbol is t8, which suggests that the first NT91 must produce a terminal that starts with t8. Since there's no rule for NT91 as a terminal, maybe this path is blocked, and the string can't be generated, so the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules again. Wait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So that's a primary split into NT91 and NT22. Let me go to NT22. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nSo NT22 expands into NT87 and NT98. Let's see what those expand into.\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. So NT87 becomes NT95 and NT53.\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'. NT53 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo NT87 \u2192 't7' 't6' \u2192 t7 t6.\n\nThen NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. Let's break this down.\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nNT90 \u2192 't9'. NT87 \u2192 't7' 't6' as before.\n\nSo NT98 \u2192 't9' 't7' 't6'.\n\nPutting this all together, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98 \u2192 (t7 t6) (t9 t7 t6) \u2192 t7 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nSo NT22 produces the sequence t7 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nNow, looking back at the string, the first symbol is t8, but in the parse tree above, the first parts are t7, t6, t9, etc. So the initial NT22 can't produce t8. That suggests that the overall derivation might not start with NT91, but perhaps something else. Wait, but the first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the overall derivation starts with NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo the first part of the derived string is what comes from NT91 and the second part is what comes from NT22. For the string to be correct, the first symbol must come from NT91's expansion, which, if NT91 is a terminal that starts with t8, but there's no rule for NT91 as a terminal. Therefore, NT91 must expand into something that starts with t8, but all the rules define NT91 as part of a larger production, which isn't provided here.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire NT91 expansion eventually leads to t8. Let me try to follow NT91 if there's an expansion path that leads to t8.\n\nWait, I don't have the rule for NT91, but the starting rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So unless NT91 has a rule that eventually leads to t8, the entire string can't start with t8, which is the first symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a rule for NT91. Let me check again. Looking through all the given rules, I don't see any rule where NT91 is on the left-hand side as a production, except S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So unless there's an implicit rule for NT91, like NT91 \u2192 't8', but that's not provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the grammar might have been truncated, and NT91 is supposed to have a rule that leads to t8, perhaps through other non-terminals. Let me check the available rules again.\n\nLooking through the other rules, perhaps NT91 can expand into NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-461","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, or a terminal. The string I'm checking is a sequence of terminals: `t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t6 t7 t6 t3 t9 t0 t7 t2 t1 t0 t2 t6 t7 t6 t1 t2 t6`. That's a lot of symbols!\n\nFirst, I remember that since it's an ambiguous grammar, the same string can be derived in multiple ways. But I need to find at least one path that constructs this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I should probably start from the start symbol S and see how it can expand. The grammar starts with S -> NT91 NT22. So S needs to produce two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 can be broken down using the productions given. From the grammar, NT91 -> NT56 NT91. That's a recursive production, which might suggest some kind of loop, but perhaps there's a way to terminate it with a terminal symbol. Wait, looking through all the NT rules, I see NT96 -> 't6', which might not help here. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me go step by step. Let's take the string and see how each 't' could be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start from the top-down approach, trying to match the string from the initial production.\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the first part is NT91, and the second is NT22. The string starts with t8. Let me see what NT91 can derive. Looking at the rules, NT91 \u2192 NT56 NT91. So that's a recursive rule, which suggests that NT91 might generate a sequence that includes some terminals and other NTs, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider all possible ways to get t8 t7... But this could get complex.\n\nLet me try to build the string step by step. Maybe the first step is to get the first t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT73 \u2192 't6', NT73 also has another production. Wait, checking the productions:\n\nLooking through the NT91 production, it's NT91 \u2192 NT56 NT91. So to get t8 t7..., perhaps I need to look for a production that starts with t8.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, and NT95 \u2192 't1'. Hmm, but not t8. NT87 is part of other productions like NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. Wait, NT22 is one of the parts of S.\n\nWait, let me step back. The first part is NT91. Let me see if NT91 can produce a terminal.\n\nFrom NT91 \u2192 NT56 NT91. So I need to expand NT56. NT56 has rules: NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78, and also NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95, and NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95. Hmm, perhaps I can find a path that leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking for NT56, it's used in NT95 -> 't1' but I don't see NT56 leading directly to a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rule. Let me check all the NT56 rules:\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT55 -> NT50 NT56\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\n\nSo NT50 can be expanded into NT2 NT69. NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38. So NT2 can become NT73 NT38. NT73 \u2192 't6', and NT38 \u2192 't3'? Wait, looking at NT38:\n\nWait, in the rules, NT38 is defined as NT6 \u2192 't6' and maybe others. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, no, in the list, I have:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41\n\nWait, but also NT38 appears in a production. Wait, let me look:\n\nNT38 is not directly a non-terminal in the rules. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the rule NT55 \u2192 NT50 NT56. And NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69. Then NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38. Oh, wait, but NT38 is not in the rules. Wait, in my earlier list, I think I may have made a mistake. Let me check all the rules carefully.\n\nWait, in the list provided, looking for NT38: There's NT38 \u2192 't6' and NT6 \u2192 't6'? Or is that something else?\n\nWait, let me check all the NT rules again, just to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38\n\nBut wait, does NT38 have any production rules? It's not listed in the rules as a non-terminal. So does that mean NT38 is a terminal? Or is that a mistake?\n\nWait, that can't be. Because in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So NT38 probably doesn't have a rule, meaning it's a terminal. But in the given grammar, NT38 is present as the left-hand side of some production. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, I think I might have a typo in my list. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that for NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95 and NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78. Wait, perhaps I misread NT38. Let me check if NT38 has any production.\n\nWait, in the list, I have:\n\nNT38 \u2192 't6' (maybe this is NT38 producing 't6') but that seems wrong because NT38 is a non-terminal, right? Because all the NTs on the left are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides can have a mix of NTs and terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, for NT56, NT38 isn't listed as a non-terminal elsewhere. Maybe NT38 is actually a terminal because it's a single terminal symbol. So if I see NT38 in a production, it must be a terminal, not a non-terminal. That would make sense.\n\nSo if NT38 is a terminal symbol, then in the rule NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38, NT38 would expand to 't6'. Similarly, NT26 could expand into something. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, but in the list, there's an NT26 rule that says NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT38, and NT73 \u2192 't6', so NT26 would produce 't6' t6? Or wait, no. Wait, if NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT38, then since NT73 is 't6' and NT38 is 't6', NT26 \u2192 't6' 't6'? So that would generate 't6t6'.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see 't7 t6 t6...'. Hmm, maybe that's not relevant yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, trying to build the string from the start.\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the first part is NT91, then NT22. The string starts with 't8 t7 t6 t9 t0...'. So the first part should produce 't8', but S's first part is NT91. So perhaps NT91 \u2192 something that starts with 't8'.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the NT91 production:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT56 NT91.\n\nBut in the rules, is there any production that leads to a terminal? Let's look.\n\nWait, I don't see NT91 leading to 't8' directly. So perhaps there's no direct way, meaning that NT91 must itself be part of a longer production that eventually terminates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT91 NT22 doesn't directly produce 't8', so perhaps there's no way for S to generate the given string. But that can't be right because the answer is supposed to be either Yes or No.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the NT rules to see if any NT91 or NT22 can produce 't8'.\n\nLooking again, the first symbol is 't8', so the first NT must generate 't8'. Let me check NT22.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nSo NT22 can expand into NT87 and NT98. Then, NT87 can lead to further productions. Let's see:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nAnd NT53 \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, so NT87 \u2192 ... \u2192 't6'.

{"custom_id":"request-475","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided with all the production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since all the production rules here seem to fit that, I can proceed. \n\nThe string I have is `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t7 t2 t3 t1 t0 t7 t5 t1 t8 t8 t3 t6 t9 t7 t1 t0 t2 t6 t0 t7 t6`. Breaking this down, it's 27 tokens long. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step adds either one or two symbols. To reach a string of this length, the number of steps in the derivation would be either equal to the length or one more. Let me check: the string has 27 symbols. The start symbol is S, which by the first rule is NT91 NT22. So the first expansion would produce two symbols, and each subsequent expansion could add one or two each time. However, tracking this directly might be complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is a dynamic programming method for parsing context-free grammars. The CYK algorithm can determine if a string is in the language by checking if the entire string can be derived using the grammar's rules.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by constructing a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the table with each cell containing the non-terminals that can produce the corresponding single character.\n2. For each possible substring length, fill the table by checking if any combination of two non-terminals from the previous step can produce the current substring.\n3. If the start symbol (S) is found in the final cell, the string is in the language.\n\nBut considering the complexity of the grammar, manually applying the CYK algorithm would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to look for possible derivations or check if any of the rules produce the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that NT6 is a rule that can produce 't5', 't2', or 't6' depending on other rules. Wait, no, looking at the rules, some NTs have 't' as a terminal. For example, NT68 -> NT6 NT41, and NT6 -> 't5' and 't8'. So NT6 can derive both 't5' and 't8'.\n\nAnother approach: the string is 27 tokens, and since it's a derivation starting from S, which produces two symbols, the number of steps must be 26 to reach 27 symbols, which is correct because each step except the first can produce one or two symbols.\n\nBut without constructing the entire parse tree, it's difficult to be certain. Maybe I can look for any possible derivations that could lead to this string. \n\nFor example, looking at the start rule S -> NT91 NT22. NT91 and NT22 each need to be expanded into sequences of terminals. \n\nNT91: Looking at the rules, NT91 -> NT8 t91? Wait, no, checking the rules again.

The grammar is provided with all the production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of t tokens in a specific order.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal symbol.\n\nThe string given is: `t8 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t1 t0 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3 t6 t1 t0 t3 t6 t9 t3 t3 t2 t6`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. \n\nI remember that in CNF, the derivation from the start symbol will consist of a series of steps where each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, and eventually, non-terminals are replaced by terminals. Since the input is a sequence of terminals, the derivation must completely reduce all non-terminals to terminals in the correct order.\n\nThe grammar has a start symbol S that produces NT91 NT22. So the first step should be S \u2192 NT91 NT22. This means the entire string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t8 and t7. Let me see what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nFrom the productions:\n- NT91: Looking at the grammar, NT91 should produce a terminal because in the productions, NT91 \u2192 't8'. So NT91 \u2192 t8.\n- NT22: Similarly, looking at the productions, NT22 \u2192 't7'. So NT22 \u2192 t7.\n\nSo the combined output would be 't8 t7', which is the beginning of our string. Good start.\n\nNow, the next step is that the entire string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT91 and NT22. So after the first two symbols, the remaining should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT91 and NT22.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each production of NT91 and NT22 can have their own productions. So let's break it down step by step.\n\nLet me outline the process:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n2. Now, each of NT91 and NT22 can be expanded. Let's look at NT91's productions.\n\nLooking at NT91 \u2192 't8', which is a terminal. So NT91 is directly replaced by t8.\n\nNow, looking at NT22 \u2192 't7', so NT22 is directly replaced by t7.\n\nSo the entire string should be 't8 t7'. But the input string is much longer, so I must have missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. Maybe the string is split into different parts because of the non-terminals that expand into multiple terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string using the grammar. Let me think about how to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is more involved. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces the number of symbols by one (since each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal with one terminal). So the number of symbols in the string should correspond to 2^k, where k is the number of productions applied.\n\nBut the string here has 27 symbols, which is an odd number. Hmm, since each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of symbols in the derived string grows exponentially. Starting from one symbol (S), after one step, we have two symbols (NT91 NT22). After another step, each non-terminal may split, so it could be two symbols again or if both split, four symbols. Etc.\n\nWait, each non-terminal in CNF can either split into two or remain as a terminal. Each split increases the number of symbols by one. So for example:\n\nLevel 0: S \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 2 symbols\nLevel 1: Each of NT91 and NT22 could split or not. But in this case, NT91 \u2192 t8 and NT22 \u2192 t7, so both split into terminals immediately. So the string is 2 symbols, t8 t7.\n\nBut the string we have is 27 symbols, which is much longer. Therefore, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Each production is in the form of A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, any string derived from S must have a number of symbols that is a sum of the number of expansions from each path. But that might not directly translate into the length being a certain number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire string as a concatenation of the expansions of NT91 and NT22. So after the initial step, S\u2192NT91 NT22, then NT91 must produce a string (could be multiple symbols) and NT22 produces another string, and the concatenation of these must equal the given string.\n\nBut from NT91's productions:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8' directly. So NT91 produces just 't8'.\n\nFor NT22 \u2192 't7' directly.\n\nSo the derived string should be just 't8 t7', but the given string is longer, so perhaps I've missed something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which non-terminals are being expanded. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nWait, so NT22 can expand into two non-terminals, NT87 and NT98, each of which can expand further. So initially, I thought NT22 directly goes to 't7', but looking again, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nHmm, that complicates things because I thought NT22 \u2192 't7', but no, it's actually NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So NT22 will be replaced by two non-terminals, which each may expand further.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the initial step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 NT91 [NT87 NT98] \u2192 so the string after first step is NT91 NT87 NT98.\n\nWait, but that's three non-terminals, which can't directly become terminals. So perhaps the string would have more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the given string using the grammar. Let me see.\n\nThe given string is 't8 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t1 t0 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3 t6 t1 t0 t3 t6 t9 t3 t3 t2 t6'.\n\nThat's 27 tokens.\n\nI need to check if this sequence can be constructed by starting with S and applying productions in CNF until only terminals remain, forming this string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using dynamic programming to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the entire string must consist of the concatenation of the strings generated by NT91 and NT22, each of which starts with the respective non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT91 \u2192 't8' directly, so the first token should be 't8', which it is. So the first token is t8, and then we move to NT22.\n\nNow, NT22's production is NT87 NT98, so NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nTherefore, the string after S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is 't8' followed by the string generated by NT22.\n\nNow, NT22 is replaced by NT87 and NT98. These can each be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT87 \u2192 't95' NT53, or maybe NT87 has another production?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53\n\nSo NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nSo let's see what happens step by step.\n\nStarting with NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nSo, let's write the derivation:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 NT91 (NT87 NT98)\n\nThen, expand NT87 and NT98:\n\nSo, S \u2192 t8 (NT95 NT53 NT90 NT87)\n\nNow, we can continue expanding each non-terminal that isn't a terminal.\n\nNT95 \u2192 't1' \u2192 terminal.\n\nNT53 \u2192 't6'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. In Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So all the given rules should fit into that. Let me verify a few.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT91 NT22. That's like A \u2192 BC, where A is S, B is NT91, and C is NT22. Okay, that fits. Next, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, which is also A \u2192 BC. Good. Now, moving down, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26; still BC. NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41; BC as well. I think the rest are either BC or terminals. NT1 \u2192 NT7 NT41, etc. Yeah, looks consistent with Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t5 t0 t6 t5 t3 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t3 t1 t2 t3 t3 t7 t2 t5 t4 t3 t6 t5.\n\nWait, that's 30 tokens. Each token is between spaces. So the length is 30. I wonder how the derivation works here. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either adds one or two symbols, but usually, it's one. But wait, in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or the combination of two non-terminals. So every application of a rule either breaks down non-terminals into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSo, the initial symbol is S. The start symbol is S, which will generate two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22. So the string must be built by expanding these non-terminals step by step until all non-terminals are expanded to terminals.\n\nFirst, let's see S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string will start with whatever NT91 generates and be followed by NT22. So the entire string should be the concatenation of what NT91 expands to and what NT22 expands to.\n\nGiven the string starts with t8, so maybe NT91 starts with t8. Let's see NT91's productions. Looking through the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT13 NT1. Wait, that's a production. But NT1 \u2192 NT7 NT41, and NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96, NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51, etc. This could get complicated quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the entire string and seeing if it can be split into a sequence of productions from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can construct the parse tree bottom-up or top-down, but that might take a while. Let me think of the structure.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string is a leftmost derivation. Starting with S and applying productions step by step, each time choosing the leftmost non-terminal and replacing it with its right-hand side.\n\nWait, let me try a step-by-step analysis.\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t5 t0 t6 t5 t3 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t3 t1 t2 t3 t3 t7 t2 t5 t4 t3 t6 t5.\n\nThat's 30 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (expanding one) or with one terminal. But in CNF, a production is either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC. So each application either introduces two non-terminals or replaces one with a terminal.\n\nSo the process should look like a binary tree where each internal node represents a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal.\n\nWait, but with the start symbol S, the first expansion is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string is the concatenation of what NT91 generates and NT22 generates. So maybe the string can be split into two parts at some point where NT91 ends and NT22 starts.\n\nLooking at the string: t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t5 t0 t6 t5 t3 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t3 t1 t2 t3 t3 t7 t2 t5 t4 t3 t6 t5.\n\nLet me check where t8 occurs. It's the first token, so perhaps NT91 starts with t8. Let's see NT91's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT13 NT1. Oh, but NT13 only has two rules: NT13 \u2192 NT51 NT51 and NT13 \u2192 't0'. Wait, no, NT13 \u2192 NT51 NT51 or 't0'. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT13's production is: NT13 -> NT51 NT51 | 't0'. So NT13 can either produce two NT51's or a terminal 't0'. Wait, actually, looking back:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT13 -> NT51 NT51 | 't0'.\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT13 can be 't0' or NT51 NT51.\n\nWait, and NT51's rules are: NT51 -> NT5 NT6 and NT56 -> NT5 NT69? Wait no, let me check NT51.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT5 NT6 and NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95, wait no: the user provided the grammar, so let me look for NT51's productions.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT51: NT51 -> NT5 NT6.

{"custom_id":"request-492","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except maybe the start symbol producing terminals or something like that. But more importantly, this specific grammar has each production rule starting with S and expanding through a chain of non-terminals until we reach terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string I'm supposed to evaluate is a sequence of 't' tokens: t8 t0 t7 t1 t6 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t6 t9 t7 t9 t7 t2 t6 t9 t1 t9 t7 t6 t2 t1 t0 t2 t6. That's quite a long string, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar and see how the rules expand. The start symbol is S, which produces NT91 NT22. So, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Each of these NTs will produce more rules until they hit a terminal.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT89 NT51\nWait, no, checking the grammar again. Actually, from the given rules, I see NT91 appears in other productions. Let me check the provided grammar properly.\n\nWait, the grammar provided is a list, but I'm a bit confused because some lines look like they might be duplicated or unclear. Let me parse it correctly:\n\nThe grammar is listed as:\nS -> NT91 NT22\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't2'\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'  Wait, that can't be right. NT6 can't produce two different terminals because that would be conflicting. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that some lines have the same NT on both sides, which might mean that it's a typo. For example, NT68 -> NT6 NT41 but also NT6 -> 't5' and 't8' which is conflicting. That suggests that either I'm misreading the grammar or there's a mistake in the production.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is structured such that each production is split into two parts. Let me try to parse it correctly. The grammar lines are split into pairs, perhaps each line has two productions.\n\nWait, looking back at the given grammar, it's unclear how the lines are structured. The user wrote it as a list without proper separation. For example, the line starts with NT22 and then says NT87, which might mean NT22-> NT87 NT98 and NT22 might also produce something else. But without proper formatting, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is a production for a specific NT. So, S -> NT91 NT22, which means S expands into NT91 and NT22. Then NT22 appears in other productions, like NT76 -> NT69 NT26, which is another rule. So, the NTs are all non-terminals, and each of them eventually expands into a terminal.\n\nI notice that some NTs produce terminals directly. For example, NT95 -> 't7', so that's a way to produce 't7'.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating starts with t8, then t0, t7, etc. So, I need to see if this string can be formed by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to trace the string's structure and see if I can match it to the grammar.\n\nFirst, the entire string has 25 't's, so I think the production chain needs to generate exactly 25 tokens. Let's see how the grammar can do that.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, the string is two parts from NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91 in the grammar: I see NT91 \u2192 NT89 NT51, but wait, in the given grammar, does NT91 have such a rule? Wait, in the initial rules, I might have missed. Let me recheck the provided grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar steps, I don't see NT91 having any production. Let me scan through all the NTs:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7', NT6 \u2192 't5' or 't8', depending on some other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list the NTs and their productions to find the possible expansion steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the possible steps.\n\nEach NT should expand into two NTs until they reach a terminal. Let's see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some NT.\n\nLet me look for each 't' in the string and see if it's present in the grammar as a direct expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9.\n\nEach of these is a terminal for some NT.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5' or 't8' (Wait, in the grammar, I see multiple entries for NT6. Let me see:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nI see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78 (line: NT56 -> NT55 NT78)\n\nThen NT55 in line: NT55 -> NT50 NT56, and that goes to ... etc., but wait, no terminal here. But wait, looking again, at lines like:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50, which are non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps some NTs are part of multiple rules. For example, NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69. So, NT50 expands to NT2 and NT69.\n\nLooking at NT2: NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38, which in turn must produce NT73 and NT38.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT69 NT76. So NT73 \u2192 NT69 and NT76, which expand further.\n\nContinuing down, perhaps this chain can eventually produce a terminal. For example, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. Then, NT26 \u2192 NT45 NT50, which then is non-terminal. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to approach this as follows: each step in the grammar expansion is a push of two NTs onto the stack, which then each expand until they reach a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string must have exactly 2^k tokens, where k is the number of split steps from S. Since S produces two NTs, each of those may produce two NTs, and so on.\n\nThe string length is 25, which is not a power of 2 (since 2^4=16, 2^5=32), but 25 is in between. That suggests that perhaps during the leftmost derivation, some branches produce more terms than others. Alternatively, perhaps the string was generated via a certain derivation path.\n\nWait, let's see: To get a string of length 25, the number of NT splits would have to be such that some branches produce more tokens than others, but context-free grammars require all splits to be exactly two. So each production step must produce exactly two NTs, leading to the number of tokens being a power of 2. So 25 is not a power of 2, which suggests that the grammar cannot generate a string of length 25.\n\nWait, but the number of tokens is the number of split steps, because each split doubles the number of symbols on the stack. Starting with one symbol (S), each step doubles, so the number of tokens after k steps is 2^k.\n\nIn the given string, the number of tokens is 25, which is not a power of two. 2^4=16, 2^5=32. So 25 is not possible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me count the tokens again: t8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-514","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t1 t7 t6 t5 t1 t8 t8 t7 t0 t7 t5 t7 t1 t0 t2 t6`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is. The grammar consists of a series of productions, each of the form NT -> NT NT, except for the terminals which are at the base. The terminals are things like t7, t8, t5, etc., which I assume correspond to terminal symbols. The grammar is already in CNF because each production is a single non-terminal generating two non-terminals, except the last ones which seem to produce a single terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production must produce exactly two non-terminals, except the base cases which can produce terminals. So in this case, the base cases are when, for example, NT96 -> 't7', meaning when a non-terminal 96 is expanded, it can produce a terminal 't7'.\n\nSo the goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step.\n\nThe string is composed of 28 tokens: t8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t7, t6, t0, t0, t1, t3, t3, t5, t1, t7, t6, t5, t1, t8, t8, t7, t0, t7, t5, t7, t1, t0, t2, t6. Hmm, that's a lot. So each of these must be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation must split a non-terminal into two non-terminals. Since the start symbol is S, the first step would be S -> NT91 NT22, producing two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. Then each of those can be expanded further, and so on, until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nThe string has 28 tokens, so the derivation must result in exactly 28 leaves when fully expanded. Since each production splits a non-terminal into two, the number of symbols doubles each time until terminals are reached. The number of symbols in the derivation tree at each level is 2^k, where k is the number of splits. So starting from S (1 symbol), after 1 split, we have 2 symbols, after 2 splits, 4, and so on. The number of symbols at level m is 2^m. To get 28 symbols, we need to find m such that 2^m >= 28. Hmm, but actually, the number of symbols increases exponentially, so it's possible that the derivation could reach 28, but it's more about how the non-terminals expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model the string as a parse tree and see if the leftmost derivation can produce this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production only has two non-terminals, except for the base cases. So each step, a node in the parse tree splits into two children.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps I can parse the string from left to right, trying to match the productions. Starting with S, which splits into NT91 and NT22. Then each of those must match the next part of the string.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t1 t7 t6 t5 t1 t8 t8 t7 t0 t7 t5 t7 t1 t0 t2 t6.\n\nWait, no, actually, the string is a sequence of t's and numbers, but in the grammar, each NT can expand into other NTs or terminals. So perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nSo to parse, we can think in terms of a pushdown automaton or a recursive descent parser, but given the length, maybe a more methodical approach would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backwards. Start from the end of the string and see if each terminal can be matched by the grammar's base productions, moving towards the start symbol S.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicated. Maybe a better approach is to simulate the parsing.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens:\n\nThe string is a sequence of 28 tokens: t8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t7, t6, t0, t0, t1, t3, t3, t5, t1, t7, t6, t5, t1, t8, t8, t7, t0, t7, t5, t7, t1, t0, t2, t6.\n\nWait, no, the last token is t6, so that's 28 tokens. Wait, let me count again:\n\n1. t8\n2. t0\n3. t1\n4. t3\n5. t3\n6. t7\n7. t6\n8. t0\n9. t0\n10. t1\n11. t3\n12. t3\n13. t5\n14. t1\n15. t7\n16. t6\n17. t5\n18. t1\n19. t8\n20. t8\n21. t7\n22. t0\n23. t7\n24. t5\n25. t7\n26. t1\n27. t0\n28. t2\n29. t6\n\nWait, that's 29 tokens. Did I miscount? Let me check: The user wrote the string as `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t1 t7 t6 t5 t1 t8 t8 t7 t0 t7 t5 t7 t1 t0 t2 t6`.\n\nCounting each part: t8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t7, t6, t0, t0, t1, t3, t3, t5, t1, t7, t6, t5, t1, t8, t8, t7, t0, t7, t5, t7, t1, t0, t2, t6. So that's 28 tokens.\n\nTo parse this, we can think of it as starting from S and splitting according to the grammar. Let's outline the steps.\n\n1. Start with S: NT91 NT22. So the string starts with NT91's expansion and NT22's expansion.\n\nNT91 and NT22 each must expand into sequences of terminals that match their production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT91's production: NT91 -> NT56 NT91. Hmm, that's a recursive production. Because NT91 can produce NT56 and itself. Wait, but NT91 is on both sides, which suggests that this is a left-recursive production, which is not allowed in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) in some implementations, but in Chomsky Normal Form, productions are either A->BC or A->a, but left recursion can be converted into right recursion or handled using other methods. Wait, no, the grammar as given seems to have left recursion because NT91 is on both sides of the production. Wait, looking back: no, actually, the productions listed for NT91 are:\n\nIn the grammar, it says: NT91 -> NT56 NT91. So that's left recursive. That's problematic because most parsing algorithms don't handle left recursion well. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in CNF, left recursion is not allowed unless it's terminated by a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, left recursion (where a non-terminal produces the same non-terminal followed by other symbols) isn't allowed. So perhaps this grammar isn't strictly in CNF because it has left recursion. Wait, no, wait: the productions are given as S->NT91 NT22, and NT91->NT56 NT91, etc. So that's a left recursive production because NT91 appears on both sides of the production. So that's problematic because, in CNF, each production must be binary and without left recursion. Wait, but perhaps the user made a mistake and the production NT91->NT56 NT91 is intended to be right recursive, like NT91->NT56 NT91, but that's still left recursion. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be right recursive, like NT91->NT91 NT56, but that doesn't make sense because it would produce two NT91s. Hmm, perhaps not.

{"custom_id":"request-520","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which looks like `t8 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t6 t6 t3 t7 t9 t0 t7 t6 t6 t3 t0 t9 t8 t8 t1 t0 t2 t7 t6`.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, which produces NT91 and NT22. \n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t8, t7, t6, etc. So I need to see if these tokens can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S -> NT91 NT22, I need to check if I can derive the string step by step. Each step in the derivation should generate the tokens in order.\n\nLet's break down the tokens. The first few tokens are t8, t7, t6. Let's see if these can be matched by the productions.\n\nLooking at NT91, according to the grammar, NT91 -> NT13 NT1. So NT91 is followed by NT13 and NT1.\n\nBut ND13 has a rule NT13 -> NT0 and NT08, but wait, looking back: NT13 -> NT0, which then produces NT90, and NT90 is a terminal 't9'. Wait, no, let's check the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nWait, the given rules:\n\nNT91 -> NT13 NT1\n\nNT13 -> NT0 NT76\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\n\nNT90 -> 't9'\n\nNT79 -> 't3'\n\nSo NT13 is NT0 and NT76. NT0 is NT90 and NT79, which produce 't9' and 't3', so NT13 becomes t9 and t3.\n\nThen NT1: looking up NT1, it has the rule NT1 -> NT12 NT26.\n\nSo NT12 -> NT8 NT12, which is a recursion. Let's see:\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12, so this will generate NT8 followed by whatever NT12 produces. But that's a loop, so we need to see how it's resolved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's try a different approach.\n\nThe string starts with t8 t7 t6. Looking at the first part, perhaps S is S -> NT91 NT22. So the first token is from NT91, which is NT13 and NT1.\n\nSo after NT13 and NT1, we get tokens starting with t9, t3, etc. But the string starts with t8, so maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other branches.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the order of the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the right-hand sides are all two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation splits the non-terminal into two, each of which must also be split until terminals are reached.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t8. So which non-terminals can produce 't8'? Looking at the rules:\n\nNT53 -> NT53 NT53?\n\nWait, no, looking for terminal symbols. For example, NT8 is not directly a rule, but looking at the rules:\n\nWait, no, in the rules, symbols like t7, t8, t9 are terminals, as they are written as 'tX'.\n\nSo the key is to see if each token can be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t8. Which non-terminal can produce 't8'? Looking through the rules, there's NT56 that goes to NT55 and NT78, which might produce 't5' and 't7'. Hmm, not directly. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces 't8'.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nBut those are non-terminals. So where do the 't's come from?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the bottom of the rules, many non-terminals are connected to 't's. For example:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nSo NT6 can produce 't5' or 't8'. Similarly, NT26 -> 't1' or 't9' or 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down by looking for the occurrences where a non-terminal produces a sequence of 't's.\n\nLet me consider the string:\n\nt8 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t6 t6 t3 t7 t9 t0 t7 t6 t6 t3 t0 t9 t8 t8 t1 t0 t2 t7 t6\n\nLooking at the end, the last token is 't6'. So perhaps it's generated by NT6 or NT26, etc. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, possibly using the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 -> NT13 NT1.\n\nNT13 -> NT0 and NT76.\n\nNT0 -> NT90 and NT79.\n\nNT90 is a terminal 't9'.\n\nNT79 is a terminal 't3'.\n\nSo NT13 becomes 't9' followed by NT76.\n\nWhat's NT76? NT76 -> NT69 NT26.\n\nNT69 is a terminal 't3' (from the rule: NT69 -> 't3').\n\nNT26 can produce 't1', 't9', or 't6'. So the first part of NT76 would be 't3' followed by one of those.\n\nSo after NT13, we get 't9' 't3' and then NT26.\n\nThen NT1: NT1 -> NT12 and NT26.\n\nNT12 -> NT8 and NT12 (recursion). NT8 can be broken down into NT56 and NT56 (Wait, NT8's production is not given directly. Wait, looking for rules that have NT8.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, I don't see a production for NT8. Oh wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT56 -> NT55 and NT78.\n\nWait, not NT8. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check for NT8 in the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT8 as a non-terminal that's split into terminals. So maybe NT8 is being split through NT95 or NT76, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the given rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps NT8 is derived from NT56. Wait, NT56 can produce NT55 and NT78.\n\nThen NT55 is from NT50 and NT56, which can lead to more non-terminals.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be derived by starting from S and expanding according to the rules, ensuring that each non-terminal splits into two parts until all are terminals.\n\nGiven the length of the string (35 tokens), the number of steps required would be significant, but let's try.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the first two symbols are NT91 and NT22. But in the string, the first symbol is t8, not a non-terminal. So S must start with t8, which would require NT91 -> t8 or NT22 -> t8.\n\nBut looking at the rules, where does t8 come from? NT87 and NT56 can produce t8 when they split into terminals. Alternatively, perhaps NT6 can split into t8.\n\nLooking back, NT6 -> t8.\n\nSo if NT91 is NT6, then it can produce t8.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT91 -> NT13 NT1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up here. Let's see:\n\nIf S is NT91 and NT22, and the first symbol is t8, then maybe NT91 is the one that produces t8.\n\nLooking at NT91's production: NT91 -> NT13 NT1.\n\nThen, NT13 -> NT0 NT76.\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79.\n\nNT90 -> t9.\n\nNT79 -> t3.\n\nSo NT13 becomes t9 t3.\n\nThen, NT1: NT1 -> NT12 NT26.\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12.\n\nSo NT12 would produce t8 followed by another NT12, which would produce another t8, etc. But since the string has only one t8 early on, perhaps this is not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT22 is the one that produces t7.\n\nSo S -> NT91 t7 NT22.\n\nWait, no, the structure is S->NT91 NT22, so each of NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-533","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is pretty complicated with a bunch of productions, and the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. But sometimes, terminals can also be single characters, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems all the productions are indeed in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which is two non-terminals on the right, and then each of those might break down further into more non-terminals or eventually terminals. So that's good.\n\nThe string I have to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t6 t9 t3 t5 t0 t6 t2 t3 t0 t2 t3 t4 t3 t5 t1 t6 t9 t2 t6 t0 t0 t1 t7 t6`.\n\nHmm, I notice that it's a sequence of t's with numbers, which I assume are the terminal symbols. Each production eventually leads to a terminal symbol, so I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of these productions.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, the standard way to approach this is to use either the top-down parsing (like with a CYK algorithm) or bottom-up parsing (like with a stack). But given the complexity, maybe a top-down approach with a recursive descent would be manageable, but I might get lost in the recursion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a parse tree and see if it can be built using the given productions. Starting from S, which breaks down into NT91 and NT22. So the first step would be to have two parts in the string: the first part from NT91 and the second from NT22.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t8. So maybe NT91 produces something that leads to t8. Wait, let me check the productions for NT91: according to the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT96 NT91. That's recursive, but let me check the production for NT96. NT96 can go to NT56 or t6. If it goes to t6, then in one step, it would produce t6. But in our string, the first token is t8, so perhaps that's not the path.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to break it down differently. Maybe I should start from the string and try to match the longer symbols. The string is quite long, so it's going to take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the structure of the grammar. Let's see: S is NT91 followed by NT22. Each of these will generate a sequence of terminals. So the entire string should be the concatenation of what NT91 produces and what NT22 produces.\n\nLet me first look at NT22. Its production is NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So the string after NT22 would be NT87 followed by NT98. So the parts would be:\n\nFirst part: NT91\nSecond part: NT87 NT98\n\nBut then, wait, NT91 \u2192 NT96 NT91. So that's recursive. Maybe that's a way to get t8 at some point? Let me check the productions for NT96.\n\nLooking at NT96: it can go to NT56 or t6. If it goes to t6, that's just one token. But if it goes to NT56, which then can go to NT55 or t7, then t7 can go multiple ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t8, so let's see where t8 can come from. Looking at all the productions, I see NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, which don't directly produce t8. Wait, perhaps I'm looking for a production where a terminal is on the right. Let me list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t5 (appears in two places)\n- NT6 \u2192 t8\n- NT26 \u2192 t7\n- NT38 \u2192 t6\n- NT41 \u2192 t0 (appearing multiple times)\n- NT51 \u2192 t3 (multiple times)\n- NT56 \u2192 t7 (multiple times)\n- NT68 \u2192 t7\n- NT76 \u2192 t3\n- NT79 \u2192 t3\n- NT8 \u2192 t5, t4, t5, etc. (wait, let's check)\nWait, wait, some NT's produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t5 (two instances)\n- NT6 \u2192 t8\n- NT26 \u2192 t7\n- NT38 \u2192 t6\n- NT41 \u2192 t0 (two instances)\n- NT51 \u2192 t3 (three instances)\n- NT56 \u2192 t7 (three instances)\n- NT68 \u2192 t7\n- NT76 \u2192 t3\n- NT79 \u2192 t3\n- NT8 \u2192 t5?

{"custom_id":"request-538","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if a specific string is generated by this grammar. The string is `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t5 t3 t2 t6 t5 t1 t5 t3 t8 t8 t7 t2 t7 t5 t3 t3 t8 t1 t3 t0 t2 t1 t6 t5`. Wow, that's a long string. I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'll try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars such that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems mostly follows this structure, but I need to verify that every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nLet me scan through the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT91 NT22: This is a production with two non-terminals, which is fine in CNF.\n- NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98: Again, two non-terminals. Good.\n- NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26: Same here.\n- NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41: Two non-terminals, that's fine.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96: Also two non-terminals.\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12: Wait, this is interesting. It's a production where one side is a non-terminal that appears on both sides. So it's NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12. This seems problematic because in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Here, it's A \u2192 B A, which means it doesn't fit because it's producing two non-terminals where one is the same as the left side. This could lead to infinite recursion unless another production stops it. So I need to note that NT12 might have issues, but I'll keep going to see if this is valid.\n\nLet me check the rest of the productions. Most of them are either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12, it's of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. Wait, actually, since both are non-terminals, it's allowed. So perhaps it's fine. I just need to track how this affects the reduction.\n\nMoving on, the NT productions all seem to follow the CNF structure except for NT12, which as we saw is fine but might need careful handling. Now, considering the string, I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying productions step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, so it's a series of terminals. The grammar will generate a string by systematically expanding non-terminals into terminals and non-terminals, eventually producing a sequence of terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the given string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using a top-down or bottom-up approach. Since we have CNF, the standard way is to try to do a recursive descent parsing.\n\nBut manually doing this might be time-consuming, especially for such a long string. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be split in a way that matches the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note which terminals appear in the productions and see if the string only contains those. Looking at the terminal productions, the grammar defines the following terminals as sequences of 't' followed by a number:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't3'\n- NT56 \u2192 't7'\n- NT6 \u2192 't5', 't6', 't8', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't4'\n- NT13 \u2192 't0'\n- NT73 \u2192 't6' or 't7'\n- NT77 \u2192 't1' (Wait, no, NT7's production leads to t1. Let me check the list again. Oh, NT7 \u2192 't1'. Similarly, NT73 \u2192 't6' or 't7'.\n- NT96 \u2192 't6' or 't5'\n- NT68 \u2192 't7'\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n- NT87 \u2192 't5'\n- NT78 \u2192 't8'\n- NT53 \u2192 't6'\n- NT95 \u2192 't1'\n- NT79 \u2192 't3', 't7', 't9'?\n- NT69 \u2192 't3'\n- NT26 \u2192 't6' or 't9' or 't5'?\nWait, looking back, NT26 has: NT26 \u2192 NT45 NT50, NT56 NT85, or something else? Wait, actually, looking at the list, NT26 is mentioned several times with different productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n- NT26 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n- NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT...\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's list all NT26 productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT69 NT50\n- NT26 \u2192 NT79 NT56\n- NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT26\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT26: several lines.\n\n1. NT26 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n2. NT26 \u2192 NT56 NT95\n3. NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT26\n\nSo, NT26 has three productions: two non-terminals, one non-terminal and itself, and another that loops back. That's again similar to NT12, where a non-terminal can produce another non-terminal followed by itself. So, NT26 could be leading to recursive expansions.\n\nBut perhaps instead of going step by step, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into parts where each part corresponds to a production. For example, the start symbol S produces NT91 and NT22. Let's see what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nLooking up the productions:\n\n- NT91: From the given list, NT91 \u2192 't8' (I think. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT91 \u2192 't8'. Yep, so NT91 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 is in the list: NT22 \u2192 't8'.\n\nWait, that can't be right because NT22 is a single terminal in the string? But in the string, after t8 comes t0. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, in the string, it's t8 t0 t1... So if S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and both are terminals, then the string after S would be 't8 t0', but in the given string, it's 't8 t0 t1 t3...'. So that suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect because NT91 and NT22 produce single terminals. So S \u2192 't8' 't0' would produce 't8 t0', but in the given string, it continues beyond that. Therefore, perhaps S doesn't produce two terminals but needs to go through other productions.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT91 NT22, and if NT91 and NT22 both produce single terminals, then the entire string from S would be 't8 t0', but the given string is much longer. So that might indicate a problem. Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT91 and NT22 in the productions.\n\nYes, looking at the list:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't8'\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo S \u2192 NT91 NT22 would produce 't8 t8'. But in the given string, after 't8 t0' comes 't1 t3 ...', which doesn't match. Therefore, this suggests that either I'm missing a production or making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the NT91 and NT22 productions. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT91: The line is NT91 \u2192 't8' (I think). SoNT91 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 't8'.\n\nSo that would mean S \u2192 't8 t8', but the given string starts with 't8 t0', which doesn't match. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps NT91 and NT22 are followed by more productions. Maybe they produce other non-terminals, leading to longer strings.\n\nWait, let me recheck: NT91 and NT22. Looking at the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, each line has a non-terminal on the left and some sequence on the right.\n\nLooking for NT91, I see:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't8'\n\nYes, so NT91 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT22:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo NT22 is a terminal.\n\nTherefore, S \u2192 NT91 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which probably means that every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar to see the structure. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S -> NT91 NT22. So the string must start with NT91 followed by NT22.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t8 t0...\", so I need to see if the start symbols can expand into this.\n\nStarting from NT91 and NT22:\n\nLet me break down the grammar step by step.\n\nNT91 -> NT78 NT76 (from the grammar) or checking the provided rules:\nWait, in the provided grammar, the production for NT91 is given as NT91 -> NT8 NT78.

From the grammar:\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT78\n\nSo NT91 will require that the first symbol is NT8, which then expands. NT8 is a terminal? Wait no, checking the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I don't see NT8 directly. Let me check for each symbol to see if they are terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are listed, so I can check each production. If a non-terminal can produce a terminal, that's a terminal. So looking through all the productions, any line that is X -> 't...', where t is a number, is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> 't7': yes, that's a terminal.\nNT87 -> 't5'\nNT56 -> 't7'\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8' (duplicate, maybe a typo, but 't8' is terminal)\nNT26 -> 't7'\nNT999... all the way to NT26, NT79, etc. Wait, in the list provided:\n\nLooking through the NT38 -> 't6', NT6 -> 't5', etc. So I can make a list.\n\nTerminals are: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9.\n\nNon-terminals are all uppercase NT followed by numbers, except where they directly point to a terminal.\n\nSo in the grammar, the non-terminals are: S, NT91, NT22, NT76, NT68, etc., as long as they don't directly produce a terminal.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals: t8, t0, t5, etc.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I need to see if starting from S, we can derive the string through a series of expansions where each non-terminal is replaced by other symbols, leading to the terminals in the order given.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can approach it using the Earley or CYK algorithm, or just try to parse the string manually.\n\nAlternative approach: The string must be a leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to note that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning each production is:\n\nA -> BC or A -> a (terminal).\n\nSo, for each step in the derivation, we can have a set of symbols, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until the leaves are terminals.\n\nAnother thing is that each non-terminal has a limited number of productions. So, perhaps I can look for which non-terminals can produce certain sequences.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be about checking whether each terminal in the string is present as a production of a certain non-terminal.\n\nBut maybe that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know the grammar's alphabet, and for each step, for each position, find which non-terminals can generate that substring.\n\nBut this might take a lot of time considering the string is 30 tokens long.\n\nAlternatively, I can start by trying to see whether the first few symbols can be explained by the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t8, which is the first symbol. In the grammar, which non-terminals produce t8?\n\nLooking at the productions, any non-terminal that has a production to t8.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT78: NT8 is a terminal. Wait, does NT8 directly produce t8? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I don't see any NT8 production except in NT91: NT91 -> NT8 NT78.\n\nSo NT8 is a terminal. So NT91's first production is to NT8 and NT78.\n\nBut in NT91's production, it's NT8, which is a terminal, so in the string, the first symbol t8 can be produced by NT91.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol is t0, which is NT0. So maybe S starts with NT91 NT22, which is the left-hand side, and after some expansions, the non-terminals should resolve to these symbols.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so the entire string must result from the leftmost derivation.\n\nGiven that S -> NT91 NT22, the string must be the result of expanding NT91 and NT22 into terminals. So perhaps each of these non-terminals can generate sequences that match their corresponding terminals.\n\nSo let's consider NT91. It's used to generate the first symbol. Since NT91 -> NT8 NT78, and NT8 is 't8', the next part is NT78. So after t8, we need to derive the rest of the string starting from NT78.\n\nThen, the second symbol is t0, which is part of NT0. So perhaps the NT22 produces the string starting with t0 after some expansions.\n\nHmm, this might get complex. Maybe it's better to approach by trying to see if each position in the string can be covered by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal is associated with a certain terminal. Let me list for each non-terminal the possible terminal strings they can produce.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that each non-terminal can only produce a specific terminal or a combination of terminals. So maybe some non-terminals don't have the capacity to produce the symbols in the string.\n\nFor example, looking at the production NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So NT22 is a non-terminal, and when it's expanded, it produces two non-terminals: NT87 and NT98. Each of those can further be expanded.\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT95 -> 't7' as per the rule NT95 -> 't7'. So NT95 produces t7.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 -> 't6'.\n\nSo NT87 -> t7 t6.\n\nSimilarly, NT98 -> NT90 NT87.\n\nNT90 -> 't0' (from NT90 -> 't0').\n\nSo NT98 becomes t0 followed by whatever NT87 produces, which is t7 t6.\n\nSo NT98 would expand to t0 t7 t6.\n\nPutting it all together, NT22 -> NT87 NT98 -> t7 t6 t0 t7 t6.\n\nSo the expansion for NT22 is t7 t6 t0 t7 t6.\n\nNow, looking back at the string, the first symbol is t8 (from NT91), which is correct because NT91 starts with NT8 (t8). Then the next part is t0, which starts the expansion of NT78.\n\nWait, let me break down the string:\n\nt8 (from NT91) followed by t0, t5, t5, etc.\n\nWait, so after the initial t8, the next is t0, which would be part of the expansion from NT78 (since NT91 -> NT8 NT78). So NT78 is the next non-terminal to expand.\n\nLooking at NT78's production. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through all production rules for NT78. Wait, looking at the provided grammar rules, I don't see NT78 directly.

{"custom_id":"request-556","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the string is `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t2 t6 t2 t7 t6 t2 t8 t1 t3 t1 t3 t3 t3 t8 t0 t7 t3 t0 t2 t4 t3 t6 t9 t7 t6` and the grammar has a bunch of productions. \n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. CNF requires each production to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar given seems to fit that because all productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. \n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The string starts with t8 and ends with t6. So, I'll try to parse it step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT91 NT22. So the first part of the parse would be checking if t8 and t0 can be derived from NT91 and NT22, respectively, since the string starts with t8 t0.\n\nWait, no. The first two symbols are t8 t0, but S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So to get t8, we'd need NT91 to produce t8, and NT22 to produce t0. Or vice versa? No, because S is nt91 followed by nt22, so the first production is NT91 NT22. So maybe I need to see what NT91 produces and what NT22 produces.\n\nLooking at NT91, I see in the grammar: NT91 \u2192 NT79 NT31. So NT91 breaks down into NT79 and NT31. Then NT79 is handled by the production NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76. NT51 is a terminal 't3' and NT76 is NT69 NT26. Wait, NT69 is 't1' and NT26 is either 't6' or 't9'. Wait, but in the initial string, we have t8, then t0, so I think maybe I'm confusing the order here.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of trying to parse from S, perhaps it's easier to use a bottom-up approach, checking each symbol from left to right to see if they can be matched by the grammar's terminals.\n\nThe string is t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t2 t6 t2 t7 t6 t2 t8 t1 t3 t1 t3 t3 t3 t8 t0 t7 t3 t0 t2 t4 t3 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nFirst, the initial step: the start symbol S can only produce NT91 NT22, so the first two symbols must come from NT91 and NT22. Wait, but S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the first symbol would come from NT91 and the second from NT22? Or does the order matter? Let me clarify: Each production replaces a single symbol, so when we start parsing, the entire string starts with S, so the first step is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Therefore, the first two symbols in the string must come from NT91 and NT22. But the string starts with t8, which is a terminal, so we need to see if NT91 can produce t8 and NT22 can produce t0, in that order, or the other way around.\n\nWait, no. Because S is replaced by NT91 and NT22, which are non-terminals. So their productions will generate the string between them. So the entire string is generated by NT91 followed by NT22. So that means the string must be a concatenation of the symbols generated by NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo the first step is NT91 \u2192 NT79 NT31, then NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76, and so on. So let me try to model this as a parsing problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm tries to fill a table with possible non-terminals that can derive each substring of the string.\n\nBut given the time constraints, maybe I can try a top-down approach step by step.\n\nAnother idea: The string starts with t8. Let's see if any of the non-terminals can directly produce t8. Looking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT79 NT31\nNT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68\nNT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\nNT6 \u2192 several options, 't5', 't8', etc.\n\nWait, looking for terminals in the grammar: several NT... have edges that produce terminals like 't8', 't0', etc.\n\nSo, looking at the grammar rules:\n- NT51 \u2192 't3' (from NT56 \u2192 't0'?), wait no. Let's check:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31, which produces t2 via NT55 \u2192 t8, etc. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list all possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal token, starting from the left.\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t2 t6 t2 t7 t6 t2 t8 t1 t3 t1 t3 t3 t3 t8 t0 t7 t3 t0 t2 t4 t3 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nLet's process it step by step, trying to see if each token can be matched in sequence.\n\nStarting with t8: which NT can produce t8?\n\nLooking through all productions for each NT:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68 or 't3'\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31\n- NT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50\n- NT45 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n- NT50 \u2192 NT50 NT56 or 't5'?

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, Chomsky normal form, right. That means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Let's see if the provided grammar fits that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production seems to follow that structure. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is splitting into two non-terminals, which is good. Same with NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, all the way down to the terminals like 't7' and 't8'. So I guess the grammar is in CNF, which is good because it makes parsing easier.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of 't's and numbers: `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t7 t8 t3 t3 t7 t7 t7 t6 t5 t3 t9 t7 t1 t5 t9 t3 t2 t5 t1 t6`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to simulate a bottom-up or top-down parser, but that might be time-consuming manually. Alternatively, I can try to see if each step of the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation must split into two parts until we reach the terminals. Let's see the start symbol is S, which first expands into NT91 and NT22. So the string must start with the concatenation of the expansions of NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t8 t0. Let's check the productions that start with NT91 and NT22. Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see the exact production rules for NT91 and NT22, but in Chomsky normal form, each non-terminal should have exactly two children.\n\nWait, the grammar provided seems to have some non-terminals listed as producing other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87, and NT90 \u2192 't9', NT87 \u2192 't8'. So NT98 would directly produce 't9 t8'.\n\nWait, but the first token is t8. Let's backtrack. Wait, the string starts with t8, but looking at the grammar, NT98 produces 't9' and 't8'. So maybe the string starts with a production of NT98, which splits into 't9' and 't8'. That would give us t9 t8 as the first two tokens, but the string starts with t8 t0. That doesn't match. So perhaps it's a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the start symbol S is generating NT91 and NT22. Let's look at what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nNT91: Looking through the productions, I don't see NT91 explicitly listed. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nNo, looking through, I don't see NT91 as a product of any non-terminal. Hmm, that's odd. Let me check again. All the non-terminals listed are NT95, NT51, NT98, etc. Wait, the start symbol is S, which is split into NT91 and NT22. Wait, where is NT91 defined? Because if NT91 is not defined anywhere, that can't produce any symbols.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the grammar.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it consists of several non-terminals (like NT7, NT22, etc.) that eventually expand into terminals (letters like 't5', 't7', etc.). The string provided consists of terminal symbols, so our goal is to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which directly expands into NT91 NT22. So the first step is to check if S can be split into two parts that each produce the corresponding sequences. The string is quite long, but I can approach this step by step, breaking down each part.\n\nLet's split the string into two halves that correspond to the two parts of S's production: NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the string: `t8 t0 t7 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t4 t3 t6 t5 t3 t8 t8 t7 t7 t2 t5 t1 t6 t9 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t0 t6`\n\nI notice that the string is 34 tokens long. So if we split it in the middle, the first 17 tokens and the last 17 tokens might correspond to NT91 and NT22, respectively. Let me check what these would be.\n\nWait, NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals that each expand into a series of terminals. I need to see if the first part of the string can be derived from NT91 and the second part from NT22.\n\nLet's look at the first part: `t8 t0 t7 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t4 t3 t6 t5 t3 t8`\n\nAnd the second part: `t8 t7 t7 t2 t5 t1 t6 t9 t2 t5 t3 t3 t3 t0 t6`.\n\nWait, actually, the split might not necessarily be exactly in the middle. It could be that NT91 produces a certain sequence and NT22 another. Let's see the productions:\n\nNT91 -> NT87 NT53 (from the given grammar). Hmm, so NT91 expands into NT87 and NT53.\n\nSimilarly, NT22's production is given as NT87 NT98.\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar again. The grammar shows that several non-terminals expand into two other non-terminals. For example:\n\n- S -> NT91 NT22\n- NT91 -> NT87 NT53\n- NT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nWait, that's the expansion for NT91 and NT22. So, to get from S down to terminals, we need to look recursively.\n\nWait, but the problem is that both NT91 and NT22 expand into NT87 and another NT, so the string would have to be generated from these paths.\n\nBut let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t8. Let me see what the possible non-terminals could produce 't8'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT78 -> NT31 NT8 (wait, let me check). Looking through the production rules, I can find which non-terminals can derive into a 't8'.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n- NT53 -> 't6'\n\nWait, some of the productions are rules where a non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals. For example, NT53 -> 't6', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the grammar is given as a series of rules. Let me parse them correctly:\n\nEach line starts with a non-terminal (e.g., NT51 -> NT51 NT68), but some have rules ending with a terminal (e.g., NT91 -> 't8').\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me list all production rules and check which non-terminals can produce 't8's.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT56 -> NT55 NT78\n- NT53 -> 't6' (wait, is there a rule where NT53 expands to 't6'? Or maybe I missed it.)\n\nNo, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly expands to 't8' except perhaps NT53 -> 't6' or others. Wait, I might have misread.\n\nLet me go through each production again:\n\n- NT76 -> NT69 NT26\n- NT68 -> NT6 NT41\n- NT7 -> NT69 NT96\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT12\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87\n- NT0 -> NT90 NT79\n- NT56 -> NT55 NT78\n- NT2 -> NT73 NT38\n- NT95 -> NT13 NT1\n- NT50 -> NT2 NT69\n- NT25 -> NT45 NT50\n- NT31 -> NT54 NT31\n- NT79 -> NT51 NT76\n- NT56 -> NT56 NT95\n- NT1 -> NT97 NT41\n- NT54 -> NT50 NT56\n- NT68 -> NT25 NT31\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT26\n- NT41 -> NT9 NT51\n- NT54 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT95 -> 't7' \u2192 Wait, 't7' is a terminal here.

{"custom_id":"request-596","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the form, making it easier to analyze, but it's still a bit complex with 48 production rules. The string I have is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, which suggests that these might be terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar is producing. The start symbol is S, which according to the first production rule, goes to NT91 and NT22. So S -> NT91 NT22. Both of these are non-terminals, meaning they need to be expanded further until we reach terminals.\n\nLooking at NT91, from the production rules, it goes to NT7 and NT8 in one step (NT91 -> NT7 NT8). Similarly, NT22 goes to NT8 and NT7 (NT22 -> NT8 NT7). Wait, that seems a bit off because both NT91 and NT22 produce similar structures. So the initial string would be NT7 NT8 NT8 NT7 if I follow this. \n\nWait, but in the string provided, it starts with t8, then t0, t1, t4, etc. So perhaps I need to track how the non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nLet me try to break down the process step by step. Starting from S, which becomes NT91 NT22. Each of these NTs then need to be expanded. Let's see:\n\n1. NT91 -> NT7 NT8\n2. NT22 -> NT8 NT7\n\nSo combining these, S becomes NT7 NT8 NT8 NT7. Now, each of these NTs (NT7, NT8, etc.) needs to be expanded further into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT7: from the rules, NT7 -> NT69 NT96. These are both non-terminals, so they must be expanded. NT69 -> NT6 NT8 (I think, looking at the rules: NT69 is produced by NT6? Wait, let me check. The grammar has:\n\nNT69 -> NT56 NT31\nWait, but also NT69 -> 't6' and NT69 -> 't3'. So NT69 can produce a terminal 't6' or 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 -> 't6' and 't5'? Wait, looking at the rules, NT96 appears in several productions, like NT96 -> 't7', but in other cases, like NT96 -> 't0' and so on. Wait, actually, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT96 -> 't7' and NT68 -> 't5'. Let me make sure I'm looking correctly.\n\nWait, the rule for NT6 is NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8\". Oh, the grammar has:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nSo NT6 can produce either 't5' or 't8'. But looking at NT56, it's NT56 -> NT55 NT78. Then NT55 is in another production, like NT55 -> NT50 NT56, and so on. This seems like a recursive chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to see which NTs eventually produce terminals. For example, NT69 can produce 't6' or 't3', and NT56 can produce 't5' or 't0'. Similarly, NT55 can produce 't8' or other things.\n\nBut since the string I'm given starts with t8, which is one of the terminals. Let me see how the string might be derived.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t8, so in the initial expansion of S, one of the non-terminals must produce a t8. Let's see how t8 is generated.\n\nIn the rules, NT76 -> NT69 NT26, and NT98 -> NT90 NT87, etc. So, looking for where t8 appears as a terminal, I see:\n\n- NT79 -> 't7'? Or wait, no, checking the rules again:\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1, which eventually might produce 't1'. NT98 -> NT90 NT87, which are 't9' and 't5'. NT79 -> NT51 NT76, NT51 is 't3' or 't5'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I notice that some of them directly produce terminal strings:\n\nLooking for NT rules that go to terminals:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5' or 't8' (from NT6 -> 't5' and NT6 -> 't8')\n- NT9 -> 't4'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT79 -> 't7'? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT79 -> NT51 NT76, which are non-terminals. Similarly, NT69 can produce 't6' or 't3'. NT56 can produce 't5' or 't0'.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions I can find in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT69 -> 't6' and 't3'\n- NT79 -> 't7'? Wait, no. Let me check the rule for NT79: it's NT79 -> NT51 NT76. No direct terminal, so it must expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT95 -> NT13 NT1 (non-terminals)\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87 (non-terminals)\n- NT0 -> NT90 NT79 (non-terminals)\n- NT56 -> NT55 NT78 (non-terminals)\n- NT96 -> NT7 (non-terminal)\n- NT96 also appears in other rules, like NT95 -> NT56 NT95? Wait, no, looking at NT95 -> NT56 NT95, which is recursive.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some where NTs directly produce terminals. Wait, looking again at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT69 -> 't6' or 't3' (from NT69's definitions)\n- NT6 -> 't5' or 't8'\n- Similarly, NT56 -> 't5' or 't0' (I think NT56 -> NT55 NT78, and maybe NT55 produces something? Or wait, from NT55, I see NT55 -> NT50 NT56, which again is non-terminal.\n\nHmm, maybe I should list all the terminal productions:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\/'t8'\nNT9 -> 't4'\nNT79 -> I'm not sure, because it's defined as NT79 -> NT51 NT76, which are NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps NT12 -> NT8 NT12, which can produce an infinite loop, so it must produce terminals somehow. Wait, looking at the rules for NT12: NT12 -> NT8 NT12, which is recursive. But does NT8 go to a terminal? Yes, NT8 -> 't5'. So when NT12 expands, it's NT8 followed by NT12. Wait, but NT12 can't produce a terminal directly; it's a recursive rule. Wait, perhaps in another production, NT12 is expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking deeper, NT12 is used in some productions. For example, NT73 -> NT73 NT6 (from the rules, I think NT73 -> NT69 NT73). Wait, no, let me check the provided rules again:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT73 -> NT69 NT73 and NT73 -> NT77 NT6 (wait, perhaps from another line). Hmm, perhaps NT73 is part of a chain that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a way to parse the string backward to see if it matches the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by the grammar's terminals. The string starts with t8, which is present in NT6 -> t8, and also in other places. Since S starts with NT91 and NT22, which expand into NT7 and NT8, the initial part could be NT7 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the string, the first t8 could come from NT7's expansion, which is NT69 NT96. From NT69, we can get t6 or t3, and from NT96, we can get t7 or others? Wait, let me look at the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT69 and NT6. Let me clarify:\n\nNT69: in the rules, we have NT69 -> NT56 NT31, which are non-terminals. But also, does any rule for NT69 directly produce a terminal?

The string is: t8 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t8 t1 t6 t1 t0 t3 t0 t0 t5 t3 t7 t1 t5 t0 t7 t5 t3 t7 t9 t8 t8 t9 t0 t2 t6.\n\nLooking at the grammar structure, each non-terminal on the left expands into two non-terminals or a terminal and something else. Wait, wait, some non-terminals expand into two terminals, which is fine. For example, NT95 -> 't7'. But perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree.\n\nLet me list out the string tokens in order: [t8, t7, t6, t0, t0, t1, t3, t3, t8, t1, t6, t1, t0, t3, t0, t0, t5, t3, t7, t1, t5, t0, t7, t5, t3, t7, t9, t8, t8, t9, t0, t2, t6].\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which expands to NT91 NT22. So S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91: According to the grammar, NT91 -> 't8'. So in the string, the first token is t8. That matches NT91 -> t8. So S can produce t8 followed by something. But then we need to look for what after that.\n\nWait, S is NT91 followed by NT22. So after t8 (from NT91), the next expansion should come from NT22.\n\nSo S -> NT91 NT22, which would be t8 (from NT91) followed by t7 (from NT22), because NT22 -> 't7'. So the string starts with t8 t7, which matches the first two tokens. Good so far.\n\nNow, after that, the string continues with t6. Let me think about what comes after NT22. NT22 -> 't7', so it's a terminal, meaning that after the initial t8 t7, there are no more symbols from NT22. Wait, no, because S is NT91 NT22, so each non-terminal is expanded into their respective right-hand sides. So after t8, we expand NT22, which is 't7'. So the entire S would generate t8 t7. But the string is longer, so that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, because in the grammar, each production is such that the left-hand side expands into two things (non-terminals) or one terminal and a non-terminal? Or maybe each production can be a single terminal in some cases? Or perhaps the grammar allows for some mix.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each production has exactly two symbols on the right, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals. Wait, no, actually, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. Or, in cases where the grammar allows terminals as part of the productions, perhaps in this case, some productions have a terminal followed by a non-terminal or vice versa, but each right-hand side consists of exactly two symbols, one of which could be a terminal.\n\nWait, let's see some examples:\n\nLooking at NT95 -> 't7' \u2014 that's a terminal followed by nothing? Or maybe it's a single terminal on the right. But in Chomsky normal form, do we allow that? Typically, it's two symbols, but perhaps this grammar allows for a terminal as an atomic symbol. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is slightly different, allowing for productions of length one.\n\nBut regardless, in order to parse the string, I need to see if the string can be built by expanding the starting symbol S.\n\nSo the string is t8 t7 t6 t0... So after t8 from NT91 and t7 from NT22, we've consumed t8 and t7. So the third token is t6. But after the initial t8 and t7 from S, what comes next?\n\nWait, maybe the expansion of S is more involved. S is NT91 NT22. So after t8 and t7, perhaps each of those non-terminals can have more expansions. Wait, no, because NT91 -> 't8' is a terminal, and NT22 -> 't7' is a terminal. So S expands to t8 t7, which should be the shortest possible string it can produce, right? But the string given is longer than that. So that's a problem because the initial S expansion would only produce t8 t7, and our string is longer. That suggests that maybe my understanding is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps S is allowed to expand into more symbols, so maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, S -> NT91 NT22. Then NT91 -> 't8'. So NT91 is a terminal. Similarly, NT22 -> 't7'. So S produces t8 t7, which would be the entire string. But our input string is much longer than that. So that can't be right. That must mean that I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar is actually S -> NT91 NT22, which would expand into NT91's right-hand side and NT22's right-hand side. But since both are terminals, S can only produce the sequence t8 followed by t7. But the string given is longer, which implies that this grammar can produce longer strings. So perhaps my initial analysis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can't be the starting point, or perhaps there's a way to unpack S further, but looking at the grammar, S only expands to two non-terminals. So unless those non-terminals can themselves expand into more symbols, S would generate two symbols. But since NT91 and NT22 produce terminals, that's it. So maybe I'm missing how the parsing works.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals can expand in a way that allows the entire string to be longer. For example, perhaps some of the non-terminals have multiple productions, and choosing the right one can allow the string to be longer.\n\nLooking more carefully, NT91 -> 't8' seems to be the only production for that non-terminal. Similarly, NT22 -> 't7'. So S would generate t8 t7, but the string is way longer than that. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I should re-examine the grammar structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me check.\n\nLooking at S -> NT91 NT22. Then NT91 is a terminal 't8', right? So when S is expanded, it results in 't8' followed by 't7' because NT22 is 't7', so the derived string is 't8 t7', which doesn't match the input string we are given.\n\nBut the input string is much longer, which suggests that the starting point must be a deeper expansion. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and S is not the starting symbol? Or perhaps there's a way to have more non-terminals on the left side.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the context-free grammar. Or perhaps the grammar uses multiple layers of expansion. For example, perhaps there are other non-terminals that are deeper in the hierarchy and can generate more symbols.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: perhaps the given grammar is a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, but with some non-terminals that are expanded in such a way to generate longer strings. But according to the grammar, S -> NT91 NT22, which are both terminals, so S generates 't8 t7', which is only two symbols. That's inconsistent with the string provided, which is much longer.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the grammar is written differently, with NT91 and NT22 possibly having other productions beyond the ones I thought.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, here are some more entries:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8' \u2014 only that.\n\nNT22 \u2192 't7' \u2014 only that.\n\nOther entries include, for example, NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26. So some non-terminals have two non-terminals as their expansion. So perhaps S can expand into multiple layers, generating more symbols."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, the string is terminals, so NT95 must be a terminal as per the rules. So if NT95 \u2192 't7', then wherever NT95 appears, it contributes 't7'.\n\nWait, I think I got confused before. The rules where an NT symbol is followed by a terminal with \u2192 is a production that ends the expansion for that non-terminal. So for example, NT95 \u2192 't7' means that when NT95 is encountered in the string, it's replaced by 't7'. Similarly, NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78, which isn't a terminal, so it continues to be broken down.\n\nSo the key is to see if each sequence of non-terminals can resolve into the given string. Maybe a better approach is to simulate the parsing process.\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t1 t9 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t8 t3 t3 t6 t9 t2 t7 t7 t6 t9 t5 t1 t8 t8 t0 t9 t7 t2 t5 t0 t6 t2 t7 t6.\n\nLet me note that the string is 35 symbols. Since S \u2192 NT91 NT22, each of these must expand into 17 and 18 symbols respectively, but wait, in the grammar, each production has two non-terminals, which could each expand into multiple symbols. However, since each production is two parts, the total number of symbols should be an odd number because each step combines two symbols into one, so starting from two, each step reduces the number by one. So for a string of length 35, the parse tree would have 34 \/ 2 + 1 = 18 symbols? Hmm, perhaps that's not the right way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the grammar and see possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate a reduction process starting with S and seeing if the given string can be matched.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, let's see the first few steps.\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nSo the string must start with NT91's expansion, followed by NT22's expansion, which produces the second part.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts.

The problem is, how to split them.\n\nWait, perhaps not necessarily at the very first split, because the expansions may have more symbols. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is the concatenation of two parts derived from NT91 and NT22. So, the first part is generated by NT91, and the second part by NT22, but their concatenation must form the entire string.\n\nTherefore, I can try to split the given string into two parts, where the first part is a result of NT91's expansion, and the second part is a result of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is a series of 't' tokens with some numbers. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except the base cases which produce terminal symbols. The terminals in the grammar are various 't's followed by numbers, like 't8', 't7', etc. So the string to evaluate consists of these terminal tokens.\n\nThe string to check is: `t8 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t7 t0 t7 t7 t7 t1 t0 t2 t6 t6 t2 t3 t7 t2 t1 t0 t0 t1 t1 t2 t3 t4 t3 t6`.\n\nI notice that the string has multiple terminals after each other. In a CFG, production rules build up the string through a series of steps, each time replacing a non-terminal with two others until we reach terminals only.\n\nLet me look at the production rules. The only rule that starts with 'S' is S -> NT91 NT22. So S produces two non-terminals, NT91 and NT22, which in turn will produce more non-terminals, and eventually terminals.\n\nI need to see if each symbol in the string can be generated by the grammar. Perhaps I can approach this by building the parse tree starting from S and see if it can produce this string.\n\nAlternatively, since all the rules are in CNF, the parse tree will consist of a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children. So the string length should be 2^n, but the given string has 35 tokens, which isn't a power of two. That suggests perhaps it's not possible, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the grammar allows for some overlap or longer production steps.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe each production appends a certain number of 't's and digits, so the string length isn't a problem because the grammar's non-terminals can produce sequences that may not strictly follow a binary tree structure in terms of string length. Hmm, but in CNF, each step splits into two, so the derivation length would be such that the number of symbols is a binary tree. Hmm, not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for the base symbols in the grammar. The base symbols are the ones that produce terminals. For example, NT98 -> 't9', so 't9' is a terminal. So any occurrence of 't9' in the string must come from NT98. Similarly, NT56 -> 't7', etc.\n\nLet me scan the string for terminals that are not generated by any rule.

{"custom_id":"request-640","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals, and the string to check is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like \"t8 t0 ... t9 t7...\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. So, each step either replaces a symbol with two others or stops if it's a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly translate to 't' followed by a digit, which represents terminal symbols. For example, NT91 translates to 't8'. So, the string is a sequence of these terminals. My goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of replacements according to the grammar rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from right to left using a method similar to recursive descent parsing, since CNF grammars are well-suited for this. Alternatively, I can look for substitution rules that match parts of the string and see if they can be reduced to non-terminals that can further substitute.\n\nLet me outline the steps I should take:\n\n1. **Understand the String**: The string is a sequence of 39 tokens (since each 't' followed by a number is a token). So, I should count them and ensure each is a production step.\n\n2. **Identify Productions for Each Token**: For each token, determine if there's a production that directly results in it. For example, if I see 't8', check which non-terminal in the grammar translates to 't8'. Looking at the grammar, NT91->t8, so 't8' comes from NT91.\n\n3. **Substitute from Right to Left**: Starting from the end of the string, try to find matching productions and substitute the corresponding non-terminals. Each substitution reduces the string length, moving towards the start symbol S.\n\n4. **Check Consistency**: Ensure that at each step, the substitutions follow the grammar rules without conflicts.\n\nLet's start breaking down the string:\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t7 t6 t3 t0 t9 t7 t1 t5 t9 t3 t3 t0 t9 t3 t3 t5 t9 t0 t3 t0 t0 t7 t9 t7 t2 t8 t1 t6 t5\n\nI'll go from the end towards the beginning.\n\n1. **Last Token: t5**  \n   Looking for productions that produce 't5'. From the grammar, NT6 and NT24 might produce 't5', but looking at the provided rules, NT6 -> 't5' and NT26 -> 't9', etc. Wait, in the given rules, NT6 appears twice: NT6->'t5' and NT6->'t2', but let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, several NT rules result in 't5', 't2', 't3', etc. Let me list them:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT26 -> 't7'? Wait, in the given grammar, NT6->t5 and NT26 is defined as NT69 and NT26. Hmm, no, in the provided rules, looking for NT26:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5' (line: NT6 -> 't5')\n- NT6 -> 't2' (another line: NT6-> 't2')\n\nWait, that can't be right in CNF. Wait, let me check the provided grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nNT6 -> 't5' and NT6->'t2'? But in CNF, each rule has two non-terminals on the left, except for terminals. So, I must have misread.\n\nWait, checking the grammar again:\n\nLooking through, yes, there are two lines for NT6:\n\n- NT68 -> NT6 NT41\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Wait, let me list all NT rules and their productions:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT91 -> NT89 NT51? No, wait, let me go line by line.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to categorize each NT rule by whether the right-hand side (RHS) is two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT91 is defined as NT89 NT51. Wait, but I don't see NT89 appearing in the provided rules. Wait, maybe I need to list all the NTs and their productions correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list of all NT productions, noting whether each is a CNF production or not (i.e., producing two non-terminals or a terminal).\n\nHere's a list of NT productions:\n\n- NT91 -> NT89 NT51 \u2192 Not CNF (assuming NT89 is a non-terminal)\nWait, no, wait the question says the grammar is in CNF, so each rule must have either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, let me parse each line correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT91 NT22 \u2192 CNF (two NTs)\nLine 2: NT22 -> NT87 NT98 \u2192 CNF\n... (I'll go through each rule line by line)\n\nWait, perhaps it's time-consuming, but I need to categorize each production as CNF or not.\n\nBut since the question states the grammar is in CNF, so every production must have exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal.\n\nWait, but looking closely:\n\nWait, no, in CNF, productions can be of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where B and C are non-terminals.\n\nSo, any production with RHS as two non-terminals is allowed, but not just two 'a's (terminals). So, in the provided grammar, all RHS must be two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at some lines:\n\nFor example, line 1: S -> NT91 NT22 \u2192 two non-terminals, so CNF.\n\nLine 2: NT22 -> NT87 NT98 \u2192 two non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the lines, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or with a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT6 -> 't5' and NT6->'t2' \u2192 which can't both be true because NT6 is a single non-terminal and can't be split into two rules. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Each non-terminal is replaced by a single rule.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parsing.\n\nWait, maybe some lines have two non-terminals, others have a terminal. For example:\n\nLooking at lines:\n\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87 \u2192 two non-terminals.\n\nBut in the provided rules, some seem to have two non-terminals, others have a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT7->NT69 NT96 \u2192 two non-terminals.\n\nBut some NTs have productions to terminals, such as NT91->t8, NT6->t5, etc.\n\nSo, in the grammar, each rule is either:\n\nA \u2192 BC or A\u2192a.\n\nWait, but to process the given string, I need to see if it can be broken down into substitutions following the grammar's rules.\n\nSo, starting with the string, which is a list of 't's and digits, I need to see if it can be built by the CFG.\n\nTo do this, perhaps I can work backward, starting from the end, trying to replace each terminal step by step.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Identify the rightmost production in the string and see if it corresponds to a rule that ends with that token.\n\n2. For each step, if a token can be replaced by a non-terminal according to a grammar rule, replace it and proceed.\n\n3. Continue until we reach the start symbol S, which is the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, if any path leads to a mismatch, the string is invalid.\n\nLet's attempt this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, the given string is:\n\nt8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t7 t6 t3 t0 t9 t7 t1 t5 t9 t3 t3 t0 t9 t3 t3 t5 t9 t0 t3 t0 t0 t7 t9 t7 t2 t8 t1 t6 t5\n\nLet me write it as a list of tokens for easier handling.\n\ntokens = [\"t8\", \"t0\", \"t1\", \"t3\", \"t3\", \"t7\", \"t7\", \"t6\", \"t3\", \"t0\", \"t9\", \"t7\", \"t1\", \"t5\", \"t9\", \"t3\", \"t3\", \"t0\", \"t9\", \"t3\", \"t3\", \"t5\", \"t9\", \"t0\", \"t3\", \"t0\", \"t0\", \"t7\", \"t9\", \"t7\", \"t2\", \"t8\", \""}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-638","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of t's with numbers, and the grammar has various productions that eventually derive into terminals (tX where X is a number). \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form consists of productions where each rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with two terminals on the right. The given grammar seems to follow this structure, except for some cases where a non-terminal might be on the left with two other non-terminals. Wait, looking closer, all the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So it's in CNF.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions. The string is a bit long, so I should probably look for patterns or specific paths that the grammar can take to produce such a string.\n\nLooking at the string: \nt8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t7 t8 t1 t5 t1 t6 t9 t0 t0 t1 t1 t1 t0 t3 t2 t7 t7 t7 t6 t5 t3 t7 t2 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nI can see that each t is followed by a number, like t8, t0, etc. The grammar has several non-terminals that derive into combinations of two other non-terminals, and some directly into t's. My approach should be to see if the string can be split into segments that match the grammar's rules.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into parts and trying to see if there are multiple ways this could happen. Alternatively, maybe I can find a specific path through the grammar that constructs the string.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol S, it's S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the string must start with whatever NT91 and NT22 produce. Let's look at NT91 and NT22's productions.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT56 NT5. So NT91 splits into two non-terminals, which themselves can go further. NT56 has a production that can lead to a terminal. Let me check NT56. Looking at the grammar, NT56 can be NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78 or NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95 or NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95 again. Wait, I see that NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95 is a recursive production, which might loop. Alternatively, NT56 also has NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78.\n\nWait, let me check NT56 more carefully. Also, looking elsewhere, like NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78 and NT78 can be NT78 \u2192 NT76 NT31. Hmm, but NT76 is also present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the beginning of the string: the first part is t8 t0 t1. So S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which would need to produce t8 t0 t1 as part of their derivation.\n\nWait, wait. The first part of the string is t8, but the S production splits into NT91 and NT22, each of which must generate a part of the string. So the entire string is split between what NT91 and NT22 generate.\n\nLet me look at NT91 first. The production is NT91 \u2192 NT56 NT5. So NT91 is broken into NT56 and NT5. NT5 is a terminal symbol (as per the given grammar entries: NT56 \u2192 't5', etc.). So NT5 is 't5'. Now, NT56 has multiple productions. Let me check all productions for NT56:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\nNT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\nNT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78\nWait, I think I might have duplicates here. Let me list the relevant ones:\n\nNT56 can go to NT55 NT78, NT56 NT95, etc. So, for example, to get the start, we might have NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78, then NT55 \u2192 something, and NT78 \u2192 something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see what NT91 and NT22 produce. Let's also check NT22. NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, according to the grammar.\n\nSo, the start symbol S produces NT91 and NT22. The string starts with t8, so perhaps the first part is from NT22, which involves NT87 and NT98.\n\nLooking at NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. Then NT95 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT95, it's NT13 NT1. So NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1, which are both non-terminals. NT13 can be NT0, according to the grammar. So NT13 \u2192 NT0. Then NT0 has productions like NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79 or NT56 \u2192 't0' (wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: NT0 has productions like NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79, NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95, etc. Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the grammar structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list each non-terminal and their possible productions, as well as their terminal outputs.\n\nLet me try to categorize the non-terminals and their possible outputs:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT56 (which can produce t5) and NT5 (which is 't5' from NT56 \u2192 't5'; wait, looking back, yes, NT56 has a production to 't5').\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't5' (as per NT56 \u2192 't5') as well as NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, NT56 is:\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nWait, that's unclear.

So S produces two parts: one from NT91 and one from NT22.\n\nLet me see what NT91 and NT22 produce in terms of terminals.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT56 NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me try to understand what I need to do here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. The start symbol is S, and it has the production S -> NT91 NT22. So the string we're given must be a sequence of terminals derived from this grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t9 t0 t2 t6 t9 t7 t2 t1 t7 t3 t0 t0 t3 t9 t8 t8 t7 t2 t7 t6 t5 t1 t8 t8 t9 t7 t2 t6 t5.\n\nWow, that's a lot of tokens. Let me see if I can find a way to parse this or at least verify the structure.\n\nI remember that in CNF, the derivation tree is such that each node has exactly two children (if it's a non-terminal) down to the leaves, which are terminals. So the string should correspond to a parse tree where each internal node has exactly two non-terminals as children, and each of those eventually terminals.\n\nFirst, let's count the terminal symbols in the string. Since every rule produces two non-terminals except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So any production that directly results in a terminal is a leaf.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I need to check which non-terminals produce terminals. Let me go through the rules:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't2'\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT26 -> 't7'\nNT90 -> 't9'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT79 -> 't7'\nNT51 -> 't3'\nNT50 -> 't9'\nNT97 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT38 -> 't6'\nWait, actually, I need to correct this. The rules that end with a terminal are:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't2'\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT26 -> 't7'\nNT90 -> 't9'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT79 -> 't7'\nNT51 -> 't3'\nNT50 -> 't9'\nNT97 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT38 -> 't6'\nWait, but wait, some non-terminals might have multiple production rules leading to terminals. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7'\n- NT38 -> 't2'\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't7'\n- NT90 -> 't9'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT79 -> 't7'\n- NT51 -> 't3'\n- NT50 -> 't9'\n- NT97 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT38 -> 't6' (Wait, same as before)\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT41 -> 't0'\n- NT91 -> 't8'\n- NT78 -> 't8'\n- NT53 -> 't6'\n- NT13 -> 't0'\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT73 -> 't7'\n- NT69 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT51 -> 't3'\n- NT50 -> 't9'\n- NT96 -> 't6'\n- Wait, I think I missed some.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through each non-terminal and see which produce terminals:\n\nNT95: 't7'\nNT38: 't2' (but is there another rule for NT38? Yes, NT38 -> 't6')? Wait, no, looking back, in the given grammar, the rules are listed as separate lines. So I need to check each line:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\nNT38 -> 't2'\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT26 -> 't7'\nNT90 -> 't9'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT79 -> 't7'\nNT51 -> 't3'\nNT50 -> 't9'\nNT97 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT12 -> 't1'\nNT38 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT41 -> 't0'\nNT91 -> 't8'\nNT78 -> 't8'\nNT53 -> 't6'\nNT13 -> 't0'\nNT73 -> 't6'\nNT73 -> 't7'\nNT69 -> 't3'\nNT22 -> 't8'\nNT98 -> 't5'\nNT51 -> 't3'\nNT50 -> 't9'\nNT96 -> 't6'\nWait, some non-terminals like NT2 might have multiple rules, but I think each non-terminal has a single production. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, actually, each non-terminal can only have one production because it's in CNF and each entry in the list is a separate production for a non-terminal. So looking at each non-terminal:\n\nNT95: 't7' \u2192 terminal\nNT38: 't2' \u2192 terminal\nNT6: 't5' \u2192 both rules are same, but since it's in CNF, probably a single rule\nWait, no, let's recount:\n\nNT6 appears twice in the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, that's conflicting. In Chomsky Normal Form, non-terminals should have productions of the form A->BC or A->a, but they can't have multiple rules leading to the same non-terminal without another non-terminal in between. So perhaps this is an error, but for now, I'll assume that each non-terminal has only one production. But in the given grammar, NT6 appears twice, which is impossible in CNF. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two rules for NT6 are for different aspects, but in reality, in CNF, each non-terminal has one production. So perhaps this is a typo, and it's either NT6 -> 't5' or NT6 -> 't8', but not both. However, since the user provided it, I have to consider both, which complicates things.\n\nSimilarly, NT38 appears twice: NT38 -> 't2' and NT38 -> 't6'. That's also impossible for CNF, unless it's a mistake. So perhaps each rule is a separate production, meaning that each non-terminal may produce certain things.\n\nWait, perhaps each line represents a production for a non-terminal. So if a non-terminal appears multiple times, it would have multiple productions. So NT6 is defined as both 't5' and 't8', which is allowed in the grammar as a context-free grammar, even if it's not strictly in CNF. Hmm, maybe the user made a typo in the grammar, but for now, I'll proceed as is.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on the string and see how it can be parsed. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the idea is to see if we can find a parse tree that starts from S and generates exactly this string.\n\nBut parsing a string with over 30 tokens could be time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to see the structure of the grammar and derive the possible sentences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the derivation process. Let's think about the structure of the grammar.\n\nS starts with NT91 and NT22. So in the first step, we derive S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Then each of those non-terminals must be further expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nSo the string's length is 30 token. Since each application of a rule splits a non-terminal into two, the number of symbols in the string should be of the form 2^n + ... So maybe n steps, but the total number of tokens would be 2^n.\n\nWait, S is a non-terminal. Each rule A \u2192 BC is two non-terminals. So the initial step after S is two non-terminals. Each subsequent step replaces a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into terminals.\n\nBut if it's a parse tree where each internal node has two children, the total number of tokens generated would be one more than the height of the tree, since each internal node adds one token (if it's a terminal) or doesn't change the count.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is a non-terminal generating two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLet me look at the grammar structure. It seems that the start symbol is S, which produces NT91 and NT22. I need to see how each of these can break down.\n\nStarting with NT91: From the rules, NT91 can produce NT56 and NT95. NT95 is a terminal 't5', so that's one part. Then, NT56 can produce NT55 and NT78. NT55 is NT50 and NT56, and NT56 can produce NT56 and NT95 again. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky because of the recursive possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe I should map out the production steps. Let me try to see what each part of the string corresponds to.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t8, t0, t1, etc. Let me see: NT76 -> NT69 NT26, and NT69 appears in some productions. For example, NT69 -> NT13 NT68, and NT13 is 't0'. Also, NT68 can produce NT6 and NT41, both of which are terminals 't6' and 't1' respectively. So t6 t1 would correspond to NT68.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can build a parse tree for the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT91 NT22. So the string starts with NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 -> NT56 NT95. NT95 is 't5' so that's the first part, t5. So the first part is t5. But the string starts with t8. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake because NT91 is supposed to produce NT56 and NT95, but in the string, the first token is t8. That doesn't match. Maybe I got the start wrong.\n\nWait, or perhaps I have to consider that the entire string is the concatenation of all the symbols, so maybe the first part is a combination of NT91 and NT22. So maybe the string is a sequence of all the symbols generated by both NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91: it's NT56 NT95. NT95 is t5. Then NT56 is NT55 and NT78. NT55 is NT50 and NT56, and NT78 is NT76 and NT31.\n\nWait, NT76 is NT69 NT26. Let's see: NT69 is NT13 and NT68, NT13 is t0, NT68 is NT6 and NT41, which are t6 and t1. So NT76 would produce t0 t6 t1.\n\nSo far, NT56 is NT55 NT78, which is NT50 NT56 NT76 NT31. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to see which parts of the string can be connected.\n\nAnother approach is to split the string into possible chunks that correspond to the non-terminals. Let's look at the start: t8.\n\nLooking through the grammar, what non-terminals produce t8? Let's see:\n\n- NT95 can produce t5, t7, etc., but does it produce t8? Wait, in the rules, NT95 -> 't7' or NT13 NT1, which are t0 and t1, or NT73 NT76, which are more complex. Hmm, does any rule produce t8?\n\nWait, looking through the production rules:\n\nNT91: produces t5 and another part.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me search the productions for 't8' to see which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLooking through all productions, the only place 't8' appears is in NT12 -> NT8 NT12, but that's a cycle. Wait, not helpful.\n\nWait, in NT45 -> 't6' and NT53 -> 't6', but that's for terminals. Or does any non-terminal produce t8? Let me check each production:\n\nLooking for symbols where a production starts with T, maybe I misread earlier.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals like NT91 produce other non-terminals; but the only terminals seem to be letters like t0, t1, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should map which non-terminals directly produce terminals, and see if the string can be divided accordingly.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT91 -> NT56 NT95\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78 or NT50 NT56\nNT78 -> NT76 NT31\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26\nNT69 -> NT13 NT68\nNT13 -> 't0'\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41 ('t6' and 't1')\nNT56 can also produce NT56 NT95, which is 't5' again.\n\nHmm. So for NT91: NT56 (which might be t6 t1) and NT95 (t5). So that would produce t6 t1 t5.\n\nBut the string starts with t8, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the first non-terminal is NT76: NT69 NT26. NT69 is t0, NT26 has production options. NT26 can produce NT25 and NT31. NT25 is NT45 NT50, which are 't6' and NT50. NT50 can be NT2 NT69, which would be t2 and t0, or NT56. Hmm, this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol S produces NT91 and NT22. So S produces t5 (from NT95), then NT56, which is t5 from the other path. Wait, maybe S's production is split into two parts. For example, NT91 (t5) and NT22 (t8). Then the entire string would have to consist of these two parts concatenated. So the string would have to start with t5 from NT91 and t8 from NT22, but the string starts with t8 first.\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps the way the grammar is structured, the first part is t8 and then something else. Wait, but the start symbol S is NT91 NT22, producing two sequences. So S would generate two separate sequences, and the final string is the concatenation of those two. So the entire string is the combination of all the tokens generated by NT91 and then by NT22, in that order.\n\nSo, let's see: the string is a list of tokens, so maybe the first half (or some split) is generated by NT91 and the rest by NT22.\n\nBut wait, NT91's production is NT56 NT95, which is t5. But the string starts with t8, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the initial split is different. Maybe the first part is generated by NT76 and the second by something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string doesn't fit into the grammar, because some parts can't be parsed.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's possible that some non-terminals only produce specific terminals, but the string has t8 which might not appear in any production of the start non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's check if any non-terminals in the start produce t8. The start symbols are S -> NT91 NT22. So does NT91 or NT22 have any production that includes t8?\n\nLooking at NT91: NT91 -> NT56 NT95.\n\nNT56 can produce multiple things. Let's see:\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78 or NT50 NT56.\n\nNT55 is NT50 NT56. So that leads to NT22 possibly, but I don't see t8 in there.\n\nSimilarly, NT78 is NT76 NT31. NT76 is NT69 NT26, and NT69 is NT13 NT68, which is t0 t6 t1. So no t8.\n\nLooking at NT22: It can produce NT98 or NT91. Wait, in the grammar, NT22-> NT98 and NT91.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let me start by understanding the structure and the productions.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT91 and NT22. So, the string must start with t91 or t22, but looking at the initial string, it starts with t8, which isn't t91 or t22. Wait, that might be a problem. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I misread. The string is a space-separated sequence of tokens, right? So the first token is t8. Looking back at the grammar, do any non-terminals expand to t8? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules: I see NT76 -> NT69 NT26. But wait, in the list, I see NT76 -> NT69 NT26, which doesn't immediately produce t9 or other terminals. Wait, maybe I need to look deeper. Wait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals directly produce t's.\n\nLooking through the rules: NT91, NT95, NT12, etc. Some non-terminals directly produce terminals, others produce combinations. I need to see which non-terminals produce t's and how.\n\nWait, let's list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87 (but wait, do 90 or 87 produce t's? Let's check 90: NT90 -> t9. So NT98 expands into t9, t87.\n\nSimilarly, NT51 -> t3 because NT51 -> t3. Wait, wait the rules I have are sometimes long. Let me make a note.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for all terminals in the rules. Let's go through each production and see which produce terminals:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8' \u2192 so NT91 produces t8.\n- NT76 -> NT69 NT26\n- NT68 -> NT6 NT41\n- NT7 -> NT69 NT96\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT12\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87 \u2192 NT90 is 't9', NT87 we'll need to expand.\n- NT0 -> NT90 NT79 \u2192 both are non-terminals except perhaps NT90 is 't9' and NT79.\nWait, no, NT90 is a non-terminal that expands to 't9' directly, as per a rule NT90 -> 't9'.\nWait, let me check all the rules to find which non-terminals directly produce t's.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT91 -> t8\n- NT98 -> t9 (from NT90) and ?\nWait, wait NT98 -> NT90 NT87. NT90 is 't9' and NT87 is... Let's see. NT87 -> NT95 NT53. Are either of these terminals? Looking through the rules, NT53 doesn't seem to produce directly, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this recursively. Let's think about the string: each token must come from the grammar, so each token must be expandable from the start symbol via some sequence of productions.\n\nBut this might take a while, as the string is 40 tokens long. Instead, maybe I can parse the string using the grammar, trying to see if it can be constructed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a lot of t7 and t2, etc., so maybe it's a long string. Let me see.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is NT91 NT22. So the first production is NT91 and NT22. So the first part must be the expansion of NT91 and then NT22.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t8. Let's see if NT91 can produce t8. From the rules, NT91 -> 't8'. So yes, that works. So the first token is handled by NT91.\n\nNext, after t8, the string continues with t0. So the next token is t0. But in NT22, let's see what NT22 expands into. The rule for NT22 is NOT given; let me check again. Oh wait, in the rules I have, NT22 -> 't2', wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I have:\n\nNT22 -> 't8' (from NT22's production?\n\nWait, no, the rules are the non-terminals, so NT22 itself must be rewritten via a rule.\n\nWait, no. The given rules are all the non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which is NT91 NT22, so S is NT91 and NT22. So each of those must be expanded.\n\nSo for NT91, we have a rule: NT91 -> t8. So that's the t8 we see first. Then, NT22 must be expanded into something that can give the remaining tokens.\n\nSo after the initial t8, we have t0. So let's look for how NT22 can produce t0. Looking through the rules for NT22: I don't see a direct production for NT22 in the list. Wait, the rules list includes 'NT22 -> NT something? Let me check.\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nFirst line: S->NT91 NT22\n\nSecond: NT22->NT87 NT98\n\nAh, yes! So NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So now we have to expand both NT87 and NT98.\n\nSo after the first t8, the next part is t0, which must come from NT87 and NT98.\n\nWait, no, because NT22 is NT87 NT98. So the expansion is [NT87 symbols] followed by [NT98 symbols], but each is a non-terminal that needs to produce the next part.\n\nSo, the first token after t8 (which is t0) would come from the expansion of NT87 and NT98. Wait, no: Wait, NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So the expansion would be the concatenation of what NT87 can produce and what NT98 can produce. So the production is (from NT22) A B where A is NT87's expansion and B is NT98's expansion.\n\nSo after t8, the next token is t0, which must come from either A or B, but actually each is a sequence. So the expansion of NT22 is a sequence of tokens from A followed by B. So after t8, t0 must be the first token in A's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that the entire string must be a single expansion, starting with all symbols, but maybe it's getting too complicated. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nBreaking down the string into tokens:\n\nt8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t7, t2, t4, t3, t7, t2, t3, t3, t6, t5, t3, t9, t7, t2, t7, t7, t6, t9, t0, t9, t8, t8, t1, t5, t0, t3, t9, t7, t2, t7, t6, t5.\n\nWait, 40 tokens. That's a lot. I need to see if there's a way to parse this as a leftmost derivation, perhaps.\n\nStarting with S: NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, S expands into NT91 (which is t8) and NT22.\n\nThen, the second part is NT22, which is NT87 NT98.\n\nSo now, the string begins with t8 followed by whatever NT87 and NT98 can produce.\n\nBut the second token is t0. So after t8, the next token is t0. So the NT87 and NT98 must produce something starting with t0.\n\nWait, perhaps NT87 produces something, and then NT98 produces other parts. Let's look at NT87.\n\nFrom the rules, NT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nSo NT87 is NT95 and NT53.\n\nEach of these needs to expand. NT95 is another rule: NT95 -> NT13 NT1.\n\nNT13 is NT69 NT65? Wait, no. Let me find NT13:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT13 -> t0.\n\nAh, yes! NT13 -> 't0'.\n\nSo, expanding NT87, which is NT95 NT53:\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\nNT13 -> t0\nNT1 -> ?\n\nWait, NT1 is another rule: NT1 -> t2.\n\nWait, let me look through the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-700","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, we've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string we need to check whether it's generated by this grammar. The string is given as a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like \"t8 t0 t7 t6...\" and so on. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because each rule on the left (like S, NT22, etc.) is replaced by the right-hand side which has either two non-terminals or sometimes a terminal. For example, S -> NT91 NT22, but wait, S is only replaced by two non-terminals, so that's fine.\n\nNow, the problem is to determine if the string \"t8 t0 t7 t6 t6 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t3 t4 t3 t6 t5 t3 t5 t3 t0 t3 t5 t0 t3 t6 t0 t3 t7 t2 t6 t6\" is generated by this grammar. \n\nI think the approach here is to work backwards from the string, trying to parse it by matching it to the grammar. Parsing can be done using methods like recursive descent or Pratt parsing, but given the complexity of the grammar, perhaps a better way is to look for the possible production rules that can generate such a string.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the string. It's a series of tokens separated by spaces, so each token is a terminal symbol. The tokens are: \n\nt8, t0, t7, t6, t6, t0, t0, t1, t4, t3, t3, t4, t3, t6, t5, t3, t5, t3, t0, t3, t5, t0, t3, t6, t0, t3, t7, t2, t6, t6.\n\nSo, 27 tokens in total. \n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts the derivation. S -> NT91 NT22. So, S generates two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. So, the first step is to see if the string can be divided into two parts, each part starting with the symbols generated by NT91 and NT22, respectively.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8. Let's see what the first symbol can be. Looking at the right-hand sides of the grammar rules, many start with NT91, NT22, etc. So, perhaps the first part of the string is generated by NT91, and the second by NT22.\n\nBut let's see what NT91 can produce. Checking the grammar, I see:\n\nNT91 -> 't8' \u2192 because in the rules, I see NT91 -> 't8'? Wait, looking back, yes, in the grammar, NT91 -> 't8' is present. So NT91 can produce 't8' directly. That would mean the first symbol in the string, t8, comes from NT91. Good.\n\nNow, the next step is to determine what NT22 can produce. Because after NT91, the string continues with t0, t7, t6, etc. So, NT22 must be the next part.\n\nLooking at NT22's production: NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So, NT22 expands into NT87 and NT98. So, the string after t8 would be handled by these two non-terminals.\n\nSo, our string is t8, followed by the production of NT87 and NT98. Let's look at both.\n\nFirst, NT87. Checking the grammar, NT87 -> 't9' (from NT87 rules). Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT87 -> 't9' is present. So, NT87 can produce 't9'. That's good because the next symbol after t8 is t0, which doesn't match 't9'. Hmm, wait a minute, did I get that right?\n\nWait, the string after t8 is t0, t7, etc. But wait, if NT22 -> NT87 NT98, then after the initial t8, the string continues as t0, t7, t6, etc. Which would suggest that NT87 and NT98 have to produce these symbols. But if NT87 is fixed to 't9', that's a problem because the next token is t0, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT87 has production rules: NT87 -> 't95' and other possibilities, but looking deeper, I see:\n\nWait, under NT87: \"NT87 -> NT95 NT53\" and \"NT87 -> 't9'\". So, actually, if NT87 can produce 't9' as a terminal, that would only match a single 't9' token. But in our string, after 't8', the next token is 't0'. So that would not match.\n\nHmm, so perhaps NT87 isn't the right choice, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT22 has another production? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I only see NT22 -> NT87 NT98. So, perhaps that's the only production for NT22. So, both NT87 and NT98 must produce certain symbols.\n\nBut then, if NT87's production is 't9', but the next token is 't0', that's a mismatch. That suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps I need to look elsewhere.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the string isn't being split correctly at S. Let me think again: S -> NT91 NT22. So, the entire string should be divided into two parts, one generated by NT91 and the other by NT22.\n\nBut the first token is t8, which matches NT91's production, so that's good. Now, the rest of the string (from t0 onwards) is supposed to be generated by NT22. But let's check NT22's production: NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nSo, we have NT87 producing some symbols and NT98 producing others. But NT87 can produce either NT95 NT53 or 't9'. Let's see.\n\nThe string after 't8' starts with 't0'. If NT98 produces a 't0' as a terminal, that's a possible route. Looking at NT98's rules: NT98 -> 't0' (from \"NT98 -> 't9'\")\u2014wait, in the rules, I see \"NT98 -> NT90 NT87\" but also \"NT98 -> 't7'\". Wait, no, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT98 has \"NT98 -> 't7'\" (from \"NT98 -> 't7'\"), and also \"NT98 -> NT87 NT6\" from elsewhere, but not as a terminal. So, wait, for NT98, there's \"NT98 -> 't7'\", so that's a terminal 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me parse the grammar rules correctly.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT51 -> 't3', 't1', etc.\n- NT56 -> 't7' (from \"NT56 -> 't7'\"), so production.\n- NT9 -> 't4', etc.\n- NT41 -> 't0'.\n- NT50 -> 't9'.\n- NT7 -> 't1'.\n- NT12 -> 't12' but in the rules, it's written as NT12 -> NT8 NT12, but there are terminals in other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Because, in the given rules, for example:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8' is a terminal production.\n\n- NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\n- NT87 -> 't9' and NT95 NT53.\n\n- NT98 -> 't7'.\n\nSo, for N-terminal, each production is either two N-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, getting back: our string after 't8' is 't0 t7 t6 t6 ...' which must be generated by NT22 being NT87 NT98.\n\nSo, after the 't8', the string is 't0 t7 t6 t6 t0 t0 t1 t4...'.\n\nSo, we have NT87 producing the first part and NT98 producing the second part.\n\nBut let's see: NT87 can produce 't9' or NT95 NT53. So, if we have 't0' as the next symbol, that doesn't match 't9' or 't7' (from NT98 is 't7'). So perhaps there's another approach.\n\nWait, let me"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-692","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t1 t6 t0 t9 t7 t5 t3 t8 t8 t1 t0 t2 t6 t6 t6 t1 t9 t7 t2 t6 t9 t2 t6 t7 t6 t1 t2 t6 t9 t7 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have certain characteristics. Each production is either a single symbol or two non-terminals, and the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. Looking at the provided grammar, it starts with S -> NT91 NT22, which fits CNF because it's two non-terminals. Most of the productions are of the form NTXYZ -> NTAB NTCD, which also fits because they split into two parts.\n\nNow, the approach to parse the string is typically top-down, using something like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. But the string is given in a flat list of terminals, so I need to consider how the grammar could generate this sequence.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be derived by the grammar step by step. Since the grammar is given, maybe I can reconstruct the parse tree. Alternatively, I can think about the possible sequences that the grammar can generate by following the productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, each non-terminal eventually breaks down into sequences of 't's and other non-terminals. The terminals 't' and numbers suggest that each production eventually terminates into these symbols. So the bottom-up approach might be easier here.\n\nWait, the CYK algorithm is the gold standard for parsing context-free languages. It's used for CNF grammars, so let's see if I can apply it mentally here. The idea is to create a table where each cell [i,j] contains the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j.\n\nBut doing CYK for such a long string manually would be tedious, so maybe I can look for patterns or specific rules that could generate parts of the string.\n\nThe string is quite long: t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t9 t1 t6 t0 t9 t7 t5 t3 t8 t8 t1 t0 t2 t6 t6 t6 t1 t9 t7 t2 t6 t9 t2 t6 t7 t6 t1 t2 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nI notice that 't8' is a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can check if any production leads directly to 't8'.

Let me confirm:\n\nYes, looking at the user's grammar: \"NT12 -> NT8 NT12\".\n\nHmm, this is a bit problematic because it creates an infinite chain unless it leads to a terminal. So if NT12 is used, it could keep duplicating itself indefinitely, which would mean that the grammar might not be well-formed unless it eventually terminates.\n\nBut back to the problem: I'm trying to find any production that can lead to a 't'. Looking through each non-terminal's RHS, for example, NT73's RHS is NT77 NT68. So unless NT77 or NT68 produce a terminal, it's not helpful.\n\nWait, looking at NT13->t0, NT69->t3, etc.\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t8, t0, t1, t3, t3, t6, etc.\n\nFirst, let me check if t8 can be directly derived from any NT. Looking through all the RHS:\n\nOnly NT73->NT77 NT68, which doesn't produce t8. Wait, no, looking for any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t8.\n\nScanning through all the rules, I don't see any where a non-terminal directly expands into 't8'. Wait, perhaps an intermediate non-terminal does produce t8.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96: 69\u2192t3, 96\u2192t6. So NT7 \u2192 t3 t6. Not t8.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12: NT8 \u2192 t5. So NT12 \u2192 t5 followed by more NT12, which in turn produce more things. Unless this somehow leads to another t elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t8, which could potentially come from NT12 if NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12, which would mean that the first t8 is from NT8, and then the NT12 would produce more, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another production is NT98->NT90 NT87: 90 \u2192 t0, 87\u2192t t?

{"custom_id":"request-715","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar to understand the production rules. The start symbol is S, and it produces NT91 NT22. So, each production splits a non-terminal into two parts, either another non-terminal or a terminal. \n\nI'll start by noting that the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: 't8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t6 t2 t1 t8 t8 t9 t0 t9 t0 t3 t6 t0 t2 t5 t0 t6 t7 t2 t1 t9 t0 t6 t2 t3 t8 t8 t2 t3 t1 t6 t9 t7 t6'.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which implies that the string can be decomposed into a tree where each node corresponds to a non-terminal and has exactly two children (terminals or non-terminals). \n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, using a top-down or recursive approach. However, given the complexity, maybe a better way is to simulate the process of generating the string using the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree step by step. Let me first see how the string is structured. The first token is 't8', which is a terminal, so I need to see which production can lead to 't8' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'll scan all the productions to see which production has 't8' as its terminal. \n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT56 -> 't7' \u2192 no\n- NT91 -> 't8' \u2192 yes\n- NT38 -> 't6' \u2192 no\n- NT98 -> 't5' \u2192 no\n- NT28? Wait, looking back at the rules: \n\nWait, the rules provided are:\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0\nNT95 -> 't7'  (line above)\nNT38 -> 't2'  (another line)\nNT6 -> 't5'  (multiple lines but same terminal)\nWait, looking through all rules, I see that NT95 has two productions: one to NT13 NT1 and another to 't7'. Similarly, NT38 has one to 't2', and NT6 has multiple to 't5' (seems redundant but okay).\n\nSo the first production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91, does it have any productions that result in 't8'? Looking through NT91's productions:\n\nLooking at the rules, the only production under NT91 is NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68. Wait, no, looking again. Wait, the rules are organized as:\n\nThe user provided multiple rules, each line is a production. So let me list all NT91 productions, but I don't see any. Wait, no. Looking through the rules given, I see NT95->'t7', NT38->'t2', etc. So NT91 must be a non-terminal that can produce certain things. Wait, looking again: \n\nWait, perhaps NT91 isn't directly listed as having a production except through some other rules. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the rules line by line:\n\nThe first rule is S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nThen NT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nNT76 -> NT69 NT26.\n\nNT68 -> NT6 NT41.\n\nNT7 -> NT69 NT96.\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12.\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68.\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87.\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79.\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78.\n\nNT2 -> NT73 NT38.\n\nNT95 -> NT13 NT1.\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69.\n\nNT25 -> NT45 NT50.\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31.\n\nNT79 -> NT51 NT76.\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95.\n\nNT1 -> NT97 NT41.\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56.\n\nNT68 -> NT25 NT31.\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT26.\n\nNT41 -> NT9 NT51.\n\nNT54 -> NT7 NT0.\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nNT38 -> 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, I see: 'NT6' has two productions: one to 't5' and another to 't8'. So NT6 can produce 't5' or 't8'. So the first symbol in the string is 't8'. That could come from NT6, but wait, looking back at S: S is NT91 NT22. So the first step is NT91 -> something, and NT22->something. \n\nWait, I think I might be getting confused here. Let me approach this differently. Since I'm to determine if the string can be generated, I'll try to build a parse tree.\n\nThe string starts with 't8', which has to come from some production. Let's look at the grammar for the possible sources of 't8' terminals.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\n- NT51: I don't see a terminal 't8' here, as NT51->NT51 NT68.\n- NT6: There's a rule NT6->'t8' (among others).\n- NT1: 't1' as a terminal?\nWait, let's re-examine all the NT rules for terminals:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNT95 ->'t7'\n\nNT38 ->'t2'\n\nNT6->'t5' \nNT6->'t8'\n\nNT26->'t7'\nNT26->'t9'\nNT0->'t0'\nNT56->'t0'\nNT90->'t0'\nNT79->'t3'\nNT31->'t2'\nNT55->'t8' (I think, wait: the rule is NT55->'t8'? Let me check: yes, in the rules provided, NT55 is:\n\nNT55 -> 't8'\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nYes, in the rules: NT55->'t8' (line: NT55 -> 't8').\n\nSo, NT55 can produce 't8'. \n\nNow, looking back to the string: the first symbol is 't8'. So, to get 't8', one possibility is that it's produced by NT55, which is a non-terminal, but we need to see if that's accessible in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, S starts as NT91 NT22, and NT91 is a non-terminal. So, can NT91 produce NT55?\n\nLooking through the rules for NT91: \n\nLooking through all the rules for NT91, I don't see any. Let me check again. The rules provided are for NT95, NT38, NT6, etc. So perhaps NT91 is a non-terminal that ultimately leads to other non-terminals which can produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some rules. Let me list all rules that have NT91:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nLooking for NT91: I don't see any rule with NT91 on the left side. The first rule is S->NT91 NT22, which means that the start symbol is using NT91 and NT22 to produce S. So, to get something out of S, we need to expand NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo, let's see what NT91 can produce. Since it's a non-terminal, it must have a production. But in the given rules, I don't see any production for NT91.

{"custom_id":"request-718","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is long, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific rules, so let me recall them. Each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see it's in CNF because all the rules have two non-terminals on the left and either a terminal or two non-terminals on the right, except for those ending with a terminal. For example, S -> NT91 NT22. So, each production is either non-terminal to two non-terminals or a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nThe string given is `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t5 t4 t3 t6 t9 t2 t3 t3 t3 t7 t5 t4 t3 t3 t4 t3 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t3 t6 t0 t1 t0 t7 t2 t5 t0 t6`. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of a string will consist of a series of productions where each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, the entire derivation must eliminate all non-terminals by the end. \n\nTo check if the string is generated, I can try to construct a parse tree or use a parsing algorithm. However, since the grammar is quite complex, it might be easier to use a bottom-up approach, such as the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I remember it correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can look for the structure that builds up the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each 't' in the string matches directly with a rule that ends with that terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their productions ending in terminals:\n\n- NT91 -> 't8' (from rule S -> NT91 NT22)\n- NT1 -> 't1' (from rule NT1 -> NT97 NT41, and NT97 -> 't1', NT41 -> 't0')\n- NT12 -> 't1' (from NT12 -> NT8 NT12, NT8 -> 't5', NT12 also has NT8 -> 't4')\nWait, no, NT12's rules include NT12 -> NT8 NT12 and NT12 -> NT98, but wait, looking back, actually, the given grammar has NT12 -> NT8 NT12 and NT12 -> NT26. Then, looking for terminals in these rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT95 -> 't1', and NT7 -> 't1', etc. Wait, perhaps I should list all the rules that produce a terminal.\n\nLet me go through each production rule and note which ones produce terminals:\n\n- S -> NT91 NT22 : NT22 -> NT87 NT98. NT91 is in the left side somewhere else, perhaps it's not terminal. Wait, but NT91 is a non-terminal, so S's production doesn't produce a terminal yet.\n\nWait, I think I need to see if any rules produce terminals. Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n1. S -> NT91 NT22\n2. NT22 -> NT87 NT98\n3. NT76 -> NT69 NT26\n4. NT68 -> NT6 NT41\n5. NT7 -> NT69 NT96\n6. NT12 -> NT8 NT12\n7.

That must be a typo. Let me check the list again.)\n\nWait, looking back at the user provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n\nThat can't be right because a non-terminal can't produce two different terminals. So maybe there's a typo, but perhaps it's intended. But for now, let me proceed, possibly considering that as an error but moving forward.\n\nLooking for rules where the right side is a terminal, or a combination. But in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps, the rules that directly produce a single terminal are the ones where a production results in that terminal with another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a. So, for a production to produce a terminal, it must be directly a terminal symbol. So I need to look for rules where the right side is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT26 -> NT79? No, wait, looking at the list, NT26 is transformed into other things, but looking into nt6:\n\nHmm, actually, perhaps I need to look through each rule:\n\n- NT26: NT69 NT26? Or other combinations. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, each production is either a non-terminal or a terminal. So, if I can find the terminals in the productions, that will be the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nLet me list the rules where the RHS is a single terminal. But since CNF requires that, except for the bottom rule, the rest are two non-terminals. So perhaps the grammar actually has some rules that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT26 -> NT69 NT26: this isn't terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule's RHS:\n\n1. S -> NT91 NT22: both non-terminals.\n\n2. NT22 -> NT87 NT98: non-terminals.\n\n3. NT76 -> NT69 NT26: non-terminals.\n\n4. NT68 -> NT6 NT41: both non-terminals (wait, NT6 is a terminal, NT41 is a terminal? Because looking in the rules, NT6 is either 't5' or 't8', and NT41 is NT9, which perhaps is a terminal?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find all the rules that end with a terminal. For example:\n\nRule 26: NT95 -> 't7' \u2192 this directly produces 't7'.\n\nRule 25: NT38 -> 't2' \u2192 't2'.\n\nRule 7: NT6 -> 't5'\n\nRule 6: NT6 -> 't8'\n\nHmm, but as I said before, NT6 can't have two production rules with different terminals. That must be a typo or a mistake. Perhaps it's supposed to be a single production, but the user might have made an error. Alternatively, perhaps I misread it. Let me check the user's grammar list again:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT6 -> 't5'\n\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. A non-terminal cannot have two different production rules for terminals. So perhaps this is a mistake, and one of them is correct and the other is redundant or mistakenly duplicated. For the sake of proceeding, let's assume it's either 't5' or 't8', but not both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to write a single production, but due to an error, it's listed twice. In that case, maybe the intended rule is to produce 't5' and not 't8'. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the second 't8' is correct, but I'll proceed with both.\n\nBut this could cause confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the correct rule is 't5' because NT6 is defined earlier in rule 7 as NT6 -> 't5'.

The string is a series of \"t\" tokens followed by numbers, and the grammar consists of various production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The string is: `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t2 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t7 t6 t1 t0 t5 t3 t0 t9 t7 t9 t8 t8 t9 t0 t9 t0 t2 t7 t2 t4 t3 t8 t0 t6 t0 t0 t9 t9 t6`.

For example, S produces NT91 NT22, but NT12 produces NT8 NT12, which can be rewritten as NT8 followed by NT12. So if NT12 can produce more, this could be recursive and potentially produce longer strings.\n\nBut the given string is quite long and consists of a sequence of t followed by a number. The numbers range from 0-9. So perhaps the strings are being built from these non-terminals that eventually produce a symbol that's 't' followed by a digit, like 't7' or 't5'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, many non-terminals have rules that end in t followed by a digit. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7', NT38 \u2192 't2', NT6 \u2192 't5' (appears twice), etc.\n\nSo perhaps the idea is to start from S and apply the productions step by step to see if we can derive the string.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens: it's 55 tokens total. Let me list them:\n\n1. t8\n\n2. t0\n\n3. t1\n\n4. t3\n\n5. t3\n\n6. t2\n\n7. t3\n\n8. t3\n\n9. t5\n\n10. t3\n\n11. t3\n\n12. t7\n\n13. t6\n\n14. t1\n\n15. t0\n\n16. t5\n\n17. t3\n\n18. t0\n\n19. t9\n\n20. t7\n\n21. t9\n\n22. t8\n\n23. t8\n\n24. t9\n\n25. t0\n\n26. t9\n\n27. t0\n\n28. t2\n\n29. t7\n\n30. t2\n\n31. t4\n\n32. t3\n\n33. t8\n\n34. t0\n\n35. t6\n\n36. t0\n\n37. t0\n\n38. t9\n\n39. t9\n\n40. t6\n\nSo, trying to see if starting from S (NT91 NT22), the first step is to replace both NT91 and NT22 with their expansions. Looking at NT91: NT91 \u2192 't8', as per the production rule. NT22 \u2192 't8', because in the rules, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, but wait, looking back, actually NT22 is in the rules as NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the rules:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT22 is replaced by NT87 NT98.\n\nThen, each of those needs to be expanded. Let's see: NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, and NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nWait, this could get recursive. Let's try to see:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 't8' (from NT91) followed by NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nSo S \u2192 t8 NT87 NT98.\n\nNow, NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, and NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nSo substituting those:\n\nt8 (NT95 NT53) (NT90 NT87).\n\nThen, continue expanding each non-terminal until you reach terminals.\n\nBut this seems complicated because of the depth. Maybe I should look for a way to systematically approach this, perhaps using the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser, but I'm more comfortable doing this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the string that can be matched by the grammar. Since the string is quite long, I might consider using a parse tree approach or seeing if each t can be matched step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string corresponds to a leftmost derivation. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the first token we get is 't8' from NT91, as per NT91 \u2192 't8'. \n\nSo the current derivation is 't8' followed by NT22, which is NT87 NT98.\n\nNow, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, so we need to expand both NT87 and NT98.\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nSo now, the string starts with 't8', followed by NT95 NT53 NT90 NT87.\n\nExpanding each of these:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT53 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT90 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nSo now, the string becomes: 't8 t7 t6 t9 ...' and continues.\n\nBut wait, this seems tedious. Let me note that each step would produce a certain number of tokens"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-737","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see all the productions are either splitting a non-terminal into two others or directly into a terminal. So that's good\u2014it's CNF.\n\nThe string to check is `t8 t0 t4 t1 t9 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t2 t8 t0 t8 t4 t3 t7 t5 t4 t3 t2 t1 t6 t9 t9 t7 t3 t6 t0 t2 t7 t3 t0 t6 t2 t5 t1 t6`.\n\nNow, to determine if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if it can derive from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length should be 2^(n-1), where n is the number of productions, but maybe that's not the best way here. Instead, I'll approach this by building the parse tree or using the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I'll try to reverse-engineer the derivation steps.\n\nStarting with the input string, it begins with t8. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which non-terminals can produce t8. Scanning the productions:\n\n- NT53 -> t6\n- NT73 -> t6\n- NT69 -> t1\n- NT96 -> t6\n- NT6 -> t5\n- NT79 -> t3\n- NT38 -> t6\n- NT26 -> t5, t6, t9\n- NT90 -> t0\n- NT56 -> t0\n- NT25 -> t6\n- NT76 -> t5\n- NT95 -> t1\n- NT1 -> t1\n- NT26 -> t6, t9\n- NT87 -> t5\n- NT98 -> t5\n- NT77 -> Wait, I don't see NT77. Maybe I missed something. Hmm, perhaps NT96 is involved.\n\nWait, looking back, NT96 has two productions: NT96 -> t6 and NT96 -> t5. So when I see t8 in the string, I need to find if any production can produce t8. Scanning the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t8? Let's check each rule's terminal parts:\n\nLooking through, I don't see any production that directly produces t8. For example, NT91 produces t8: NT91 -> t8. So if a non-terminal has a rule that includes NT91, that might be where t8 comes from.\n\nWait, wait. NT91 is a non-terminal, so does any non-terminal produce NT91? Looking back:\n\nYes, the start symbol S -> NT91 NT22. So S can produce NT91 and NT22. So S directly starts with NT91, which then can produce t8.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nNow, NT91 produces t8, and NT22 produces t8 according to the string. Let's see:\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nLooking at NT87 and NT98, do they produce t8? Let's check:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1.\n\nNT13 \u2192 t0.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41.\n\nNT97 \u2192 t1.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51.\n\nNT9 \u2192 t4.\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68.\n\nWait, that's a recursion. So NT51 is producing itself and NT68, which might lead to more t's.\n\nBut perhaps focusing on the initial steps:\n\nSince the string starts with t8, and NT91 \u2192 t8, so the first part is S \u2192 NT91 t8 ... . Then NT22 needs to produce the rest, which starts with t0.\n\nWait, that might complicate things, but let me try to think in terms of how the string can be split.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t's and digits. Each non-terminal must produce a certain sub-sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string must start with whatever NT91 produces, followed by whatever NT22 produces. Since the string starts with t8, let's see.\n\nNT91 \u2192 t8, so the first token is t8.\n\nThen, the rest of the string starts with t0. But the next token is t0, so the NT22 part must produce that t0.\n\nWait, NT22 can be split as NT87 NT98. So let's look at NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, and NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list the grammar rules again:\n\nLooking at NT91: it's only in the start rule. So NT91 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT91 NT22, which produces t8 followed by whatever NT22 produces.\n\nNow, the string after t8 is t0 t4 t1 t9 t6 t9 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t2 t8 t0 t8 t4 t3 t7 t5 t4 t3 t2 t1 t6 t9 t9 t7 t3 t6 t0 t2 t7 t3 t0 t6 t2 t5 t1 t6.\n\nSo after t8, the next non-terminals should be t0. Let's see how NT22 can produce this.\n\nLooking at NT22: it's NT87 NT98.\n\nSo NT22 can produce a sequence starting with NT87 and NT98. Let's look at NT87 and NT98's productions:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nSo, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98 \u2192 (NT95 NT53)(NT90 NT87). So the order is NT95 NT53 NT90 NT87.\n\nSo, NT22 produces a string starting with NT95, NT53, etc. But wait, NT87 is followed by NT98, which in turn is NT90 and NT87 again. Hmm, this seems recursive. But in the string after t8, the next token is t0. So perhaps I need to check if NT22 can produce t0 as its next symbol.\n\nWait, wait. NT22 is NT87 NT98. Let me see what each of these produces.\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT53's productions: no, wait, NT53 is a terminal t6 (from the list: NT53 -> t6). So NT53 \u2192 t6.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1.\n\nNT13 \u2192 t0.\n\nSo putting that together, NT95 \u2192 t0. So NT87 \u2192 NT95 (t0) NT53 (t6) \u2192 t0 t6.\n\nThen, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. NT90 \u2192 t9 (from N90: NT90 -> t9). NT87 is t0 t6 again.\n\nSo NT98 \u2192 t9 t0 t6.\n\nPutting it together, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98 \u2192 (t0 t6) followed by (t9 t0 t6) \u2192 t0 t6 t9 t0 t6.\n\nBut in the string after t8, the next token is t0. So the first part after t8 would be t0 t6 t9 t0 t6. But the actual string after t8 is t0 t4... So that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial split of S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is not the right way. Wait, the grammar's start rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So the first non-terminal is NT91, which produces t8, and the second is NT22, which needs to produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut the rest of the string starts with t0, so let's see if NT22 can produce t0 as the next symbol. Let's check NT22's first symbol.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So NT87's production is NT95 NT53. NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1, and NT13 \u2192 t0. So the first symbol after t8 would be t0, which matches the second token in the string.\n\nSo after t8, the next symbols would be from NT87 NT98, which is (t0 from NT13) followed by (other stuff).

{"custom_id":"request-758","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar follows this structure, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t1 t0 t0 t5 t3 t7 t9 t8 t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t6 t7 t6 t3 t1 t0 t7 t2 t5 t1 t0 t7 t5 t1 t7 t7 t7 t7 t2 t6 t5`.\nThat's a lot of tokens, but I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands to NT91 NT22. So the first two symbols must be derived from NT91 and NT22 respectively.\n\nLet me examine the productions for NT91 and NT22:\n- NT91 \u2192 NT59 NT10. Wait, actually, looking back, I see that NT91 is defined as NT95 NT1. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me check:\nOh, no, in the given grammar, NT95 -> 't7', but I'm trying to see where t9 comes from. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the NT symbols.\n\nWait, let me correct that. In the grammar, NT95 is a non-terminal, which has a production NT95 \u2192 't7'. Similarly, NT96 \u2192 't6' and NT96 \u2192 't5'\u2014but that might be a typo because a non-terminal can't have two productions. Wait, let me double-check:\n\nLooking again, under NT96, it's:\nNT96 -> NT96 NT5, and also ... No, actually, in the given grammar, I don't see NT96 having multiple options. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me scan through the productions again:\n\nWait, I notice that for NT79, NT73, NT69, etc., they all have productions like NT69 -> NT91 NT5 or similar. So the terminals come from specific non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t8, t0, t1. Let's think about how the start symbol S expands. S = NT91 NT22.\n\nLet's look at NT91: In the grammar, NT91 -> NT59 NT10? No, looking back, actually, in the given grammar, NT95 -> 't7' and NT78 -> 't8', etc. Wait, perhaps I need to find where each 't' comes from.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Since the string starts with t8, I need to see if any non-terminal expands directly to 't8'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't5' (multiple times)\n- NT68 \u2192 't5' etc.\n- NT87 \u2192 't5'\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT78 \u2192 't8' (wait, looking back, the productions show:\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87\nNT98 is derived from NT90 and NT87, but NT87 is an NT, not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some NTs that expand to terminals. Let me check through each NT production:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7'\n- NT96 -> 't6' (multiple times)\n- NT68 \u2192 't5'\n- NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87 (not a terminal)\n- NT78 \u2192 't8' (yes, I see under NT78: NT78 -> 't8'\nWait, no, actually, looking at the given grammar:\nNT78 -> 't8' (I see that NT78 is in the list? Or is it NT73?\n\nWait, let me search the entire grammar list for any NT that directly produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through each NT:\n- NT95 -> 't7' (yes)\n- NT96 -> 't6' (yes)\n- NT78 -> 't8' (yes)\n- NT68 -> 't5'\nWait, no, looking again, I see:\nUnder NT78, it's written as NT78 -> 't8'\nSimilarly, under NT68: NT68 -> NT6 NT41, but perhaps NT6 leads to 't6' or similar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT6 has multiple productions:\nNT6 -> 't5', NT6 -> 't8' (multiple entries). Wait, no, in the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT6, the productions are:\nNT6 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't8'\n\nSo NT6 directly can produce 't5' or 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, NT38 -> 't2' and NT12 -> 't1' and 't2', etc.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can work from the end, perhaps using a method like CYK, but since the string is quite long, that might not be feasible manually. Alternatively, I can try to see if each terminal can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t8. So, the first symbol is t8. That could come from NT78, which has NT78 -> 't8'.\n\nSo, the first part is NT78 \u2192 't8'.\n\nSo, the next symbol is T0. So, T0 comes next. Let's see if any NT produces T0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any NTs go directly to 't0'? Hmm, looking through, I don't see any NT directly producing 't0'. Wait, NT90 produces 't0' (NT90 -> 't0')? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through NT90: NT90 -> 't0'. Yes, so NT90 produces 't0'.\n\nWait, but the second symbol is 't0', so perhaps the second NT is NT90.\n\nSo after NT78, we have NT90, which produces 't0'.\n\nThen the third symbol is 't1'. So, after NT90, we have an NT that produces 't1'. Looking through the grammar, do any NTs produce 't1'?\n\nYes, for example, NT12 -> 't1' and 't2', etc.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking through NTs, do any directly produce 't1'?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT13 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT12 -> 't1' and 't2'\n\nYes, NT12 has productions NT12 -> 't1' and 't2' as well as a recursive rule NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12.\n\nSo, the third symbol is 't1', which could come from NT12 \u2192 't1' or from NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12.\n\nBut let me map this step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree, but since the string is long, maybe I can look for the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each production is binary and try to find a sequence of productions that can generate the string.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible parse:\n\nStart with S = NT91 NT22.\n\nFirst, derive NT91 to a terminal. Let's see how NT91 can be derived.\n\nLooking at NT91's productions:\nNT91 \u2192 NT59 NT10 (I think, but from the given grammar, maybe I misread.

NT7 is derived into NT69 and NT96. Oh, wait, but in the grammar, NT56->... has two entries, maybe that's a typo. Anyway, I'll move on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t2 t2 t0 t6 t9 t7 t1 t0 t7 t2 t3 t8 t8 t2 t6 t3 t6 t0 t3 t7 t2 t1 t8 t8 t2 t6 t9 t2 t6 t9 t0 t7 t7 t6`.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the derivation steps. The string is split into tokens, so each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and others are non-terminals where applicable. Wait, looking at the grammar, most non-terminals produce terminals or other non-terminals, so the string will be a sequence of terminals that result from expanding the non-terminals.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step. Since the string is long, perhaps I can find a pattern or look for the top-down approach using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at S, it -> NT91 NT22. So the first two symbols in the derived string must be the results of NT91 and NT22. Let's check the string. It starts with t8, so perhaps NT91 produces 't8', and NT22 produces the rest of the string up to the next symbol.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT91 appears in NT91->..., but I don't see NT91 productions. Wait, checking the grammar: actually, the grammar doesn't have an explicit production for NT91, so perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, there's a production NT95 -> 't7', and NT91 isn't listed. So perhaps that's a mistake, and NT91 isn't a terminal. Hmm, maybe I misread it. Wait, the user presented the grammar starting with S->NT91 NT22. So, is NT91 a non-terminal or terminal? From the given grammar, NT91 doesn't have a production, so perhaps it's a terminal. Wait, but in the provided grammar, for example, NT6->'t5' and so on. So perhaps NT91 is not listed as a production, which would suggest it's a terminal. But in the user's provided grammar, NT95 is a production that outputs 't7', but NT91 is not present, so maybe NT91 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but if NT91 is a terminal, then S-> NT91 NT22 would produce two terminals. So, looking at the string, the first token is 't8'. So, if NT91 is a terminal, maybe it's 't8'. But then, in the grammar, I don't see NT91 having any production, so perhaps the user made a typo, and they meant to write something else. Alternatively, perhaps NT91 is an error, and it should be another non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe the grammar in the user's message has some typos.\n\nWait, looking again, the user's grammar includes lines like NT95 -> 't7', but I don't see NT91 in the productions, so perhaps NT91 is a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps it should be another non-terminal. Let's double-check.\n\nIf S -> NT91 NT22, and in the string the first token is 't8', then the NT91 must produce 't8'. However, in the grammar provided, I don't see any production for NT91. Unless I'm misunderstanding the structure, perhaps I need to check if there's an incorrect line or perhaps a missing NT91 production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and actually meant NT71 or something else. But given the information, I have to proceed with the assumption that NT91 is a non-terminal that produces 't8' (but since it's not in the grammar, perhaps it's a terminal). Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar. But for now, assuming that NT91 is a terminal symbol and produces 't8', then NT22 would need to start after that.\n\nBut let me check the provided grammar again. In the provided grammar for the user, I see NT95 -> 't7', but no NT91 production. So perhaps NT91 is a terminal that outputs 't8', as the first token in the string is 't8'. So that would mean: NT91 is a terminal 't8', and NT22 starts with the next token.\n\nWait, but if S is expanding to NT91 and NT22, and the first token is 't8', which would be NT91's output, then the next symbols should be the expansion of NT22. So after 't8', the next tokens would be t0, t1, etc., so the first part would be NT22 deriving 't0 t1 ...' and so on.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT22's production is NT87 NT98. So let's see, NT22->NT87 NT98. So in the string, the next tokens after 't8' are t0, t1, t4, etc. So I need to see how NT87 and NT98 derive these tokens.\n\nLooking at NT87, the production is NT95 NT53. So NT87 -> NT95 NT53. Looking at the grammar, NT95 -> 't7' and NT53 perhaps is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT53 isn't listed as a production, so perhaps it's a terminal. But in the string, after 't8', the next token is 't0', but NT95 produces 't7', so perhaps that's a problem. Alternatively, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT53: NT53 isn't a production, so perhaps it's a terminal. But in the string, after 't8', the next token is 't0', so perhaps that's from NT87's first component. Wait, but NT87->NT95 NT53.

{"custom_id":"request-775","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Alright, let's break this down. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or one terminal. That should make parsing easier, but I might still need to do it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the starting symbol, which is S. The production for S is NT91 NT22. So whatever comes from S is two parts: NT91 and NT22. My string starts with t8, t7, etc., so I need to see if these can be derived from NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at NT91: The production is NT73 NT78. So NT91 must derive into two parts. Let's look at each component. NT73 and NT78.\n\nNT73: Its production is NT73 NT7. That seems recursive. So NT73 can produce two NT73's or a NT7. Since it's recursive, it's probably going to produce a chain of t's or something else. Hmm, let's check NT7. NT7's production is NT69 NT96. From there, NT69 is 't3' and NT96 is 't6'. Wait, wait, no. Looking at the bottom of the grammar, NT96 -> 't6', right? So NT7 becomes NT69 NT96. But what are those? NT69 is 't3' and NT96 is 't6'. So NT7 becomes 't3' 't6' = t3 t6.\n\nBut wait, NT73's production is NT73 NT7. So if we derive NT73, each step can either replace with NT73 NT7 or stop if the right context allows. Wait, no, that production is recursive, so it would produce a string like NT73 NT73 ... until maybe it hits another production. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should try to find the expansion paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by looking for the terminals in the grammar and see if I can break down the string.\n\nThe string is: t8 t7 t6 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t0 t0 t1 t1 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t1 t6 t2 t0 t9 t6 t7 t1 t0 t1 t9 t3 t1 t5 t1 t0 t6 t2 t3 t8 t8 t2 t6.\n\nThat's a long string with 38 tokens. Let me see if I can find a way to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from S: NT91 NT22.\n\nLet's see what each of these produces.\n\nNT91 -> NT73 NT78.\n\nNT73 is NT73 NT7. So that's two NT73's. Each NT73 can be NT73 NT7, so this could go on forever. Wait, perhaps there's a way to expand it into a chain of t's.\n\nWait, but let me check: Each NT73 produces either another NT73 or NT7. So if it's NT73 NT7, each can expand. Let's consider that NT73 can expand into a sequence of t's. Let's see:\n\nNT73 -> NT73 NT7. So this can be expanded to NT73 NT7, which is then NT73 NT7. Each of these can further expand.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of NT73 as being a chain that eventually terminates. But looking at the rules, after a few steps, maybe it stops. Let's see.\n\nWait, let me check NT78. NT78's production is 't8'. So that's a terminal. So NT78 becomes 't8'.\n\nSo, going back:\n\nNT91 -> NT73 NT78.\n\nNT78 is 't8'.\n\nSo the expansion starts with NT73, which may generate some t's, and then 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, NT22's production is 't2'. Wait, no. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT22, its production is 't8'. So NT22 becomes 't8'.\n\nWait, no: Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see NT22 -> NT98. Oh, no! I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, let's get the rules right. The initial S is NT91 NT22.\n\nBut let me find the production for NT22. Scanning the rules, I see:\n\nNT22 -> NT98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought NT22 -> 't8', but that's incorrect. It's NT98. So that's a mistake on my part.\n\nSo S -> NT91 NT22, and NT22 -> NT98. Then NT98's production is NT90 NT87.\n\nSo now, S expands to NT91 NT98, which is NT91 NT90 NT87.\n\nNow, NT91 is NT73 NT78. NT78 is 't8'. So NT91 gives 't7's or something?\n\nWait, no, NT73 is NT73 NT7. Wait, no, earlier I misread NT73. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT73's production is NT73 NT7. So that's a recursive production. So each NT73 can produce another NT73 or NT7.\n\nBut NT7's production is NT69 NT96.\n\nNT69's production is 't3'.\n\nNT96's production is 't6'.\n\nSo NT7 becomes 't3' 't6' = t3 t6.\n\nSo if we have NT73, which is NT73 NT7, that would start a chain: NT73 can produce either NT73 NT7 or NT7.\n\nBut each NT73 needs to eventually expand into something. So let's think about how it could expand into a series of t's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a possible chain.\n\nEach NT73 production is either NT73 NT7 or NT7.\n\nBut if we have NT73 -> NT73 NT7, that can be replaced again, leading to NT73 NT73 NT7. This could go on indefinitely, but maybe in the string, it stops at a certain point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT7 can produce a t3 t6, and each NT73 is a way to get more t's.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as:\n\nNT73 can produce a sequence of t3 and t6, depending on how NT73 is expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the string is built. Let's take the string and try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t8 t7 t6 t0... Looking at S: S -> NT91 NT22. So the first part is NT91, which is NT73 NT78.\n\nNT73 is either NT73 NT7 or NT7. NT78 is 't8'.\n\nSo the initial part is NT91 -> NT73 NT78 = (something) 't8'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't8', which matches NT78. So the first part is 't8'. Now, what about the next part, which is 't7'?\n\nWait, no, the string starts with 't8 t7 t6 ...'. Wait, that's S's initial NT22 -> NT98, which is NT90 NT87.\n\nSo S -> NT91 NT22 -> NT91 NT98. So the string starts with NT91's expansion followed by NT98's expansion.\n\nSo the first part is NT91, which is NT73 NT78.\n\nNT78 is 't8'. Then the next part is NT98, which is NT90 NT87. So after 't8' (from NT78), we have NT98 -> NT90 NT87.\n\nSo after the 't8', the next token is 't7', which could be from NT87.\n\nSo let's see: S starts as NT91 NT22.\n\nNT91 expands to NT73 NT78, which is (something) 't8'.\n\nNT22 expands to NT98, which is NT90 NT87, which is 't9' 't8'.\n\nWait, but looking at the production rules: NT87 -> NT95 NT53, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me check NT87. Looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nWait, I see NT87's production is NT95 NT53. So NT87 becomes NT95 and NT53.\n\nLooking at NT95's production: NT13 NT1. So NT95 becomes NT13 NT1.\n\nNT13 is 't0'. NT1 is 't1'.\n\nSo NT95 becomes 't0' 't1', which is 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-774","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's part of the language defined by this grammar. The string is: t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t5 t4 t3 t6 t1 t0 t2 t6 t2 t6 t3 t5 t9 t3 t9 t7 t3 t6 t0 t3 t9 t8 t8 t2 t6 t9 t9 t8 t8 t9 t7 t7 t2 t6 t2 t6 t5.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to consist of a series of non-terminals breaking down into more non-terminals until some point where they turn into terminals.\n\nThe string is composed entirely of terminals: t0, t1, up to t9, each separated by spaces. So, the problem is to see if this sequence can be derived by expanding the start symbol S step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which initially expands into NT91 NT22. Let's break that down. \n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nThen, NT91 and NT22 each need to be expanded. Let's look at NT91 and NT22:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT87 NT98 (from the productions, I see that NT98 is 't5', as per the terminal assignments: NT98 \u2192 't9', NT56 \u2192 't7', etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals have specific terminals. For instance, NT98 \u2192 't9', but I need to check each production carefully.\n\nWait, I think I should create a reference for terminal assignments. From the grammar, the non-terminals that directly produce terminals are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't4' (looking back, no, actually, let me scan the productions again.)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the given grammar:\n\nNT95 -> 't7',\n\nNT38 -> 't2',\n\nNT6 -> 't5',\n\nNT6 -> 't8',\n\nNT26 -> 't7',\n\nNT90 -> 't9',\n\nNT8 -> 't5',\n\nNT56 -> 't7',\n\nNT1 -> 't1',\n\nNT54 -> 't0',\n\nNT95 -> 't1',\n\nNT50 -> 't9',\n\nNT90 -> 't0',\n\nNT79 -> 't3',\n\nNT31 -> 't2',\n\nNT55 -> 't8',\n\nNT9 -> 't3',\n\nNT76 -> 't3',\n\nNT96 -> 't0',\n\nNT68 -> 't7',\n\nNT10 -> 't0'? Wait, the string has t0, but let me check each NT that produce t's.\n\nWait, looking through each production for terminals:\n\nNT95: 't7',\n\nNT38: 't2',\n\nNT6: 't5',\n\nNT6: 't8',\n\nNT26: 't7',\n\nNT90: 't9',\n\nNT8: 't5',\n\nNT56: 't7',\n\nNT1: 't1',\n\nNT54: 't0', (two NT54's produce t0),\n\nNT95: 't1',\n\nNT50: 't9',\n\nNT79: 't3',\n\nNT31: 't2',\n\nNT55: 't8',\n\nNT9: 't3',\n\nNT76: 't3',\n\nNT96: 't0',\n\nNT68: 't7',\n\nSo each NT has specific terminals it can produce. Now, to parse the string, we need to build a derivation tree step by step.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production (except for those producing terminals) splits into exactly two non-terminals. So, the process is recursive.\n\nThe string is length 60, so the derivation would be 60 steps. But doing that manually is time-consuming. Perhaps I can look for patterns or key elements.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t8. So, the first symbol is 't8', so that suggests the first step is to derive a production that starts with t8. Looking at the NTs that produce t8:\n\nNT38 \u2192 t2,\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the NT that produce t8 is NT56 because in the grammar:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78,\n\nBut looking at the productions, NT56 is split into NT55 and NT78. Wait, no, NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to map the NTs to their terminal productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7',\n\nNT38 \u2192 't2',\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5',\n\nNT6 (another occurrence) \u2192 't8',\n\nNT26 \u2192 't7',\n\nNT90 \u2192 't9',\n\nNT8 \u2192 't5',\n\nNT56 \u2192 't7',\n\nNT1 \u2192 't1',\n\nNT54 \u2192 't0',\n\nNT95 \u2192 't1',\n\nNT50 \u2192 't9',\n\nNT79 \u2192 't3',\n\nNT31 \u2192 't2',\n\nNT55 \u2192 't8',\n\nNT9 \u2192 't3',\n\nNT76 \u2192 't3',\n\nNT96 \u2192 't0',\n\nNT68 \u2192 't7',\n\nSo, looking for where a NT can lead to t8:\n\nNT55 \u2192 't8',\n\nYes, so the first symbol t8 could come from NT55 \u2192 't8'. So in the derivation, S \u2192 NT91 NT22. But to get a t8, maybe the NT55 is derived elsewhere.\n\nWait, but the string is:\n\nt8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t5 t4 t3 t6 t1 t0 t2 t6 t2 t6 t3 t5 t9 t3 t9 t7 t3 t6 t0 t3 t9 t8 t8 t2 t6 t9 t9 t8 t8 t9 t7 t7 t2 t6 t2 t6 t5.\n\nLet's note that each non-terminal needs to split further. Let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t8, which must come from NT55 \u2192 't8'.\n\nBut NT55 is derived from NT50 and NT56? Wait, looking at the grammar, the productions for NT50 and NT56:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69,\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78.\n\nWait, the user-provided grammar has:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78,\n\nYes, so to get t8, let's say NT55 \u2192 't8', so NT55 is a leaf.\n\nBut then, where does NT55 come from? Let's see, looking at the production rules, any NT that can produce NT55?\n\nChecking the grammar, I don't see a production where NT55 is a left-hand side. So NT55 must be a terminal. But wait, looking at the terminal assignments, we have NT55 \u2192 't8'. So NT55 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. That complicates things because if NT55 is a terminal, then it can't be further expanded. That would mean that 't8' can only come from NT55, which can't be broken down further.\n\nBut in the string, the 't8's occur at several points. So perhaps, the initial expansion of S \u2192 NT91 NT22 leads to t8 being part of NT91 or NT22.\n\nLet me try to figure out where 't8' comes from in the grammar.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nWait, looking for non-terminals that can produce 't8' directly, or perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, the only NT that directly produces 't8' is NT55. So unless a non-terminal can derive into NT55, 't8's can only come from that specific path.\n\nBut in the given grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce NT55. So if NT55 is a terminal (since it has a terminal production), then it's possible to have a 't8' in the string if a non-terminal can derive into NT55 and then produce 't8'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. NT55 \u2192 't8'. So if a production leads to NT55, that would produce 't8'. But if another production leads to NT55, that's the same as 't8'. So, for 't8' to appear, we need a path where some NT eventually leads to NT55, which outputs 't8'. But looking through the productions, there's no non-terminal that produces NT55.\n\nHmm. So if NT55 is a terminal, the only way to get 't8's is through NT55.

{"custom_id":"request-794","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by understanding what I have here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with a bunch of production rules. Each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and has two non-terminals on the right except for a few cases where it's a terminal. For example, the rule S -> NT91 NT22 starts with S, which is the start symbol. Then, each NT has its own production, like NT91 -> NT87 NT53. I think each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t8 t0 t1 etc. So, my goal is to see if the grammar can produce this sequence starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the first step is to see if each 't' in the string corresponds correctly to a production rule. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nI should look for non-terminals that produce terminal symbols. For example, NT91 -> 't8'. So if I see 't8', it comes from NT91. Let me list some of these terminal productions:\n\n- NT91 -> t8\n- NT7 -> t7 (or wait, some rules have multiple terminals, like NT96 -> t7 or NT96 -> t5. Wait, looking back, I see NT96 has two rules: NT96 -> t7 and NT96 -> t5. So NT96 can lead to 't7' or 't5'. That's important.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see that NT96 has two productions: one to 't7' and another to 't5'. So, depending on which rule is used, 't7' or 't5' can come.\n\nLet me try to parse the string: the first symbol is t8. So looking at the grammar, NT91 produces 't8'. So that's the first part. Then we have t0. Looking for a non-terminal that leads to 't0'. Scanning through, I see NT51 -> t3, but that's not it. Wait, NT50 -> t9, and NT56 -> t0. Oh yes, NT56 can produce 't0'. So maybe t0 comes from NT56. Let me check the grammar:\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78 and NT56 -> NT56 NT95 and NT56 -> NT56 NT2. Wait, no, looking at the list, I think I might have to correct that. Let me recheck:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\nNT56 -> NT56 NT2\n\nWait no, actually, the user provided a long list, so perhaps I should go through each production carefully.\n\nLooking for NT producing 't0':\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69\nWait, no. Let me check more carefully. The provided rules are:\n\nLooking for any NT whose production includes 't0'. For example:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT0 -> NT90 NT79 \u2192 but NT0 isn't terminals.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nIn the given rules:\n\nNT51 -> NT51 NT68\nNT50 -> NT2 NT69 \u2192 still non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me search through all the production rules for where the right-hand side is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see several cases where non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT91->t8\n\nNT9->t4\n\nNT79->t3\n\nNT76->t5\n\nNT50->t0? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, the user input included:\n\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nBut then looking through all the NTs:\n\nNT56 also has \u2192 NT56 NT2 \u2192 but NT2 itself is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps NT51 -> t3.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT with RHS containing a terminal 'tX':\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT91 -> t8\n- NT7 -> t7\n- NT12 -> t1 (wait, does it? Let me check: NT12 -> NT8 NT12? No, NT12 has two rules: NT12-> NT812 (wait, no, looking again: the user input list includes 'NT12 -> NT8 NT12' and 'NT12 -> NT9 NT6'. Wait, perhaps I need to focus on the rules that produce terminals. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to model this as a parse tree. Since each production is two symbols, the string must be reducible to S through leftmost derivations, with each step replacing a non-terminal with two others until only terminals remain.\n\nBut let's approach it step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t2 t0 t5 t3 t3 t3 t3 t3 t6 t9 t3 t6 t0 t1 t0 t1 t0 t9 t7 t7 t6 t3 t8 t8 t3 t6 t0 t3 t6 t2 t3 t2 t5 t3 t3 t6 t5.\n\nThat's a long string. So the first thing is that the entire string must be derived from S.\n\nLet me see the first symbol is t8. So, looking for a non-terminal that can produce t8. From the grammar, NT91 -> t8. So that must be the starting point. So the first production is NT91.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT91 NT22 (since S's production is NT91 NT22) \u2192 t8 NT22. Now, the next symbol is t0. So after the first t8, we have NT22. So what does NT22 produce?\n\nLooking for a rule where NT22's production starts with 't0'. Looking through the production rules, I see NT22 -> t8 t8. So wait, that's NT22 -> t8?\n\nWait, that's not the case. Let me check the given production rules:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT22 isn't a terminal. So for NT22, let's see its production. In the list, I see NT22 is defined as NT22 -> NT87 NT98. Wait, that's two non-terminals. So NT22 doesn't produce a terminal. Hmm. So after S \u2192 NT91 NT22, the next symbols would be processed as NT91 (which is t8) and then NT22, which is a non-terminal. So how does NT22 get reduced?\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Let me consider the structure.\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nNT91 \u2192 t8, so we have t8 and then NT22.\n\nBut how does NT22 produce 't0' as the next symbol?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the Chomsky Normal Form. In CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo in the string, after S which is a non-terminal, it's replaced by two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. Then, each of these can be replaced, but since NT91 and NT22 are both non-terminals, this can get complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT91 NT22 \u2192 t8 [then NT22 to be processed]\n\nWait, but after the first step, we have t8 followed by NT22. But NT22 is another non-terminal, so we need to process it.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8. After t8, the next token is t0. So perhaps, after NT91 (which is t8), the NT22 must produce t0 as the next symbol. So, let's see what NT22 can produce.\n\nLooking for NT22's production. The user provided several rules:\n\nLet me recount the production rules:\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98 (from: line 2)\nNT98 -> NT0 (line 3)\nNT00 -> NT90 NT79 (line 4)\nWait, actually, the user lists each rule on a separate line, so let's go through each production.\n\nWait, to clarify, let me list all the production rules for each non-terminal. Here's what I have:\n\nNT22:\n- NT22 -> NT87 NT98\n\nNT87:\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n\nNT53:\n- NT53 -> t6\n\nSo for NT53, it can produce t6.\n\nSimilarly, NT98:\n\n- NT98 -> NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, each token being something like 't8', 't0', etc.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar here seems to follow CNF, as all the non-terminals on the left of the arrows have exactly two non-terminals on the right, or some have terminals.\n\nThe string is: `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t6 t2 t1 t2 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t2 t0 t7 t7 t6 t9 t7 t6 t3 t0 t0 t1 t0 t0 t1 t1 t0 t1 t1 t7 t5 t1 t0 t0 t9 t9 t2 t6`\n\nI think the approach here is to start from the start symbol, which is S, and try to derive the string step by step. But that might be complicated because the string is quite long.\n\nAlternatively, I can parse the string from the bottom up.

For example, NT56 has two productions: one with NT55 and NT78, and another with NT56 and NT95. That might be a bit tricky.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see that NT95 appears in two places: one where it's NT13 and NT1, and another where it's also NT13 and NT1. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, I see NT95: in the beginning, the production is NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1. But later, in the list, under NT95, it's NT13 NT1 again. So that's the same production. That might be a typo, but perhaps it's intended. So, moving on.\n\nThe other non-terminals:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69\nNT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50\nNT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31\nNT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76\nNT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95\nNT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41\nNT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0\nNT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26\nNT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51\nNT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\nNT38 \u2192 NT6 NT12\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12\nBTW, I think I misread NT38 earlier.\n\nWait, the list had NT38 \u2192 NT6 NT12. So, in the initial grammar, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the start symbol S, which produces NT91 NT22. Let's see what NT91 and NT22 produce.\n\nFrom the list, NT91 \u2192 't8', which is a terminal. So NT91 becomes 't8'.\n\nThen NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. Let's see what NT87 and NT98 produce.\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. So NT87 is the combination of NT95 and NT53.\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. So NT98 is NT90 and NT87.\n\nNow, tracing further:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1 (both are non-terminals), then NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41. So let's break that down.\n\nThis can get quite involved, but perhaps we can write a top-down approach or look for the production chains that could generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, considering the string is a sequence of terminals, perhaps we can parse it using the grammar rules, starting from the right.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to look for possible derivations.\n\nWait, the first token is 't8'. Looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT91 NT22. NT91 is 't8', so S can generate a substring starting with 't8' followed by what NT22 generates.\n\nWhat does NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, so next we have NT87 and NT98.

So, if we can match a token sequence starting with 't95' and 't53', but wait, our string starts with 't8 t0', so in the first step, we generate 't8', and then we need to generate the rest starting with NT22's tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the string as a list of tokens and try to match them according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me write out the string as individual tokens:\n\n['t8', 't0', 't1', 't3', 't3', 't6', 't6', 't2', 't1', 't2', 't6', 't9', 't0', 't1', 't4', 't3', 't2', 't0', 't7', 't7', 't6', 't9', 't7', 't6', 't3', 't0', 't0', 't1', 't0', 't0', 't1', 't1', 't0', 't1', 't1', 't7', 't5', '1', '0', '0', '9', '9', '2', '6']\n\nWait, the end of the given string might have been cut off.

{"custom_id":"request-821","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t6 t6 t1 t7 t5 t1 t8 t8 t0 t7 t7 t2 t6 t5 t1 t9 t7 t0 t5 t1 t6 t0 t1 t0 t1 t0 t2 t5 t1 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t5 t0 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammar has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 aB, or A \u2192 Ba, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that every production is in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is a production with two non-terminals on the RHS. Other productions like NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68, NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38, and so on, all fit the CNF structure.\n\nNow, the string is a series of terminals. My task is to check if this string can be derived by the grammar. My initial thought is to use the CYK algorithm, which is commonly used for parsing context-free grammars. The CYK algorithm efficiently determines whether a string is in the language generated by a given CFG and, if so, constructs a parse tree. \n\nHowever, I'm limited in that I don't have the exact non-terminal productions, just the structure provided. To apply CYK or something similar, I'd need to know all the non-terminals and their productions. But since the problem provides the grammar, I can reconstruct all the non-terminals and their possible derivations.\n\nWait, actually, maybe a better approach is to construct the entire parse table for the grammar and then see if the given string can be matched. But that might be time-consuming, especially since there are 35 terminals in the string. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or property I can look for in the grammar that relates to the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals have various productions, and each production leads to other non-terminals until terminals are reached. The terminal symbols are 't0', 't1', 't2', up to 't9'. It might be helpful to see if each production for non-terminals ends up generating a specific terminal or a combination that forms a part of the string.\n\nAnother approach is to trace possible transitions through the grammar. Each terminal in the string must be the result of a production that directly or indirectly expands to that terminal. For example, NT9 \u2192 't4' would mean that whenever NT9 is used, it's replaced by a terminal 't4'. However, looking at the given grammar, I don't immediately see any production that directly produces a single terminal. Most of the productions have non-terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait a minute, some productions do have terminals on the RHS, like NT55 \u2192 NT9 NT5, but in this case, I see that some NT entries have direct terminal outputs. For example, NT51 \u2192 't9', which means that NT51 can produce the terminal 't9'. Similarly, NT55 \u2192 't8'? Wait, let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the given productions, I see for example NT56 \u2192 't7', but wait, in the grammar provided, NT56 has a production: NT56 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 NT95 NT50? Wait, perhaps I need to list all the NT productions and their direct terminals.\n\nWait, wait, let me re-examine the given grammar:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't4' (is that a direct production? Let me check: scanning the given productions... looking for any NT X \u2192 'tY'. Actually, I think I missed that earlier. For example, NT51 \u2192 't9', which is a direct terminal production. Similarly, NT12 \u2192 't9' and 't7' and 't1'. There are multiple NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nSo, for instance, NT51 can be replaced directly by 't9'. That's helpful because any part of the string that is 't9' can be derived from NT51.\n\nSimilarly, let's list out all direct terminal productions in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't9'\n- NT41 \u2192 't0'\n- NT25 \u2192 't6'\n- NT76 \u2192 't5'\n- NT96 \u2192 't6'\n- NT96 \u2192 't5' (Hmm, same NT96, two productions with two different terminals, which seems odd)\n- Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me re-check:\nLooking at NT96:\n- NT96 \u2192 't7'\n- NT96 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, that's two different productions for NT96. But that's impossible in a CFG; each production is unique. So perhaps I made a mistake in transcribing or reading the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's grammar, it says:\n\nNT96 -> 't7'\n\nAND\n\nNT96 -> 't5'\n\nThat's conflicting because each production must be unique. Maybe I read it wrong. Let me look again:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT96 -> 't7'\nNT96 -> 't5'\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. Because a non-terminal can't have two different terminals as productions. That must be a mistake. Or maybe a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's a split production or an error. Since in a CFG, each production must be unique, so this suggests that either one of the productions is incorrect, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be one of them, and the other is a typo. Maybe one of them is 'tq' or something else, but in the given problem, it's written as 't7' and 't5'.\n\nWait, wait, it's probably an error in the problem statement. It's more likely that one of them is a typo, but as the problem is given, I'll proceed under the assumption that perhaps there's a mistake, but maybe it's a split in the production as 't7' and 't5', but that can't be. Therefore, perhaps it should be NT96 \u2192 't7' and another production elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the second NT96 \u2192 't5' is a typo, and perhaps one of them is incorrect.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving this, perhaps I should proceed, but it's a problem because a CFG cannot have two different productions for the same non-terminal leading to different terminals. So, this suggests that either the grammar is incorrect, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the original problem, it's possible that one of the productions is meant to be something else, like 't5' and 't6', which would make sense, but since the problem states it as 't7' and 't5', perhaps I need to find a way to handle it.\n\nBut for the sake of moving forward, perhaps it's better to proceed and maybe in the simulation, consider only one of them as active.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that NT96 can produce either 't7' or 't5', but that's conflicting. Since each production can only be applied once, perhaps one of the options is to be considered. Hmm, but this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and both are supposed to be 't7' or 't5', but perhaps it's supposed to be a single production, like NT96 \u2192 't7' and another non-terminal, but this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the productions after NT96 are part of other non-terminals, but looking back at the original problem statement, I think I need to clarify this.\n\nBut perhaps to proceed, I'll note that NT96 is supposed to produce 't7' and another production, but given the conflict, perhaps the intended meaning is that NT96 \u2192 't7' or 't5', but in the problem, perhaps one of them is a typo, but without knowing which, it might complicate the parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should ignore this conflicting part and proceed with the assumption that it's a typo, or perhaps that it's a mistake, and only consider one NT96 production.

{"custom_id":"request-841","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I have to check if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should remind myself what a CFG in CNF looks like. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a single non-terminal (like S -> NT or whatever). Each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or a terminal can appear directly as a production, which would terminate the derivation.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems all the productions are of the form NT followed by another NT or a terminal. For example, S -> NT91 NT22, and some of these NT rules break down further, like NT91 -> NT78 NT82. This suggests that every step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals, until we hit the terminals, which are the t-something parts.\n\nThe string given is quite long, so breaking it down manually might be tedious. But since each production step in the grammar produces two symbols, the string should ideally have a structure that allows for such a binary expansion. \n\nWait, but Chomsky Normal Form requires that the right-hand side of each production is two non-terminals. So, each step in the parse would take one non-terminal and replace it with two more. Therefore, the derived strings should have an exponential growth in length relative to the number of steps, which is characteristic of a CFG with left or right context-free structures.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t7 t6 t6 t2 t3 t1 t0 t3 t3 t1 ...' etc. Each 't' followed by a number. I think each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So to determine if the string is in the language, I need to see if the sequence can be derived by applying the productions step by step, starting from S.\n\nBut manually doing this is impractical because the string is too long. So perhaps I can look for key indicators in the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals are connected directly to terminals. For example, NT95 -> 't7', which means in the derivation, at some point, we'll produce a 't7' from NT95.\n\nSimilarly, NT56 can produce both NT55 and NT78, but wait, looking at the grammar, NT56 has two productions: NT56 -> NT55 NT78 and NT56 -> NT56 NT95. Wait, that's not correct because the way it's written is NT56 -> NT55 NT78 and NT56 -> NT56 NT95. Hmm, no, actually, looking again, the grammar is written with lines like:\n\nNT56 -> NT55 NT78\nNT56 -> NT56 NT95\n\nWait, but that's odd because the second production would produce two NT56 symbols, and one of them would continue to produce more. That could lead to infinite loops but perhaps in the context of the larger grammar, it's manageable.\n\nBut back to the string. The string is a sequence of tokens, each being 't' followed by a number. Since each production step splits a non-terminal into two, the entire string is built up by these splits.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the string as a parse tree where each node corresponds to a non-terminal and has two children, which could be either NTs or terminals. Each time, two symbols (either NTs or terminals) are combined.\n\nBut again, the string is too long to process manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the first symbol 't8' can originate from a non-terminal that can produce 't8'. Let's look through the grammar for any NT->t8.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT78 -> 't8'\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n- NT79 -> 't3'\n- NT87 -> 't9'\n- NT85 -> ... wait, not seeing any NT directly producing 't8'.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't8', so the first symbol must come from a production of a non-terminal into 't8'. But looking through the grammar, is there any NT that produces 't8'?\n\nLooking through all the production rules... Hmm, I don't immediately see an NT that directly gives 't8'. So is it possible that the string doesn't start with a 't8' that comes from an NT rule? Or perhaps my scan was missing something.\n\nWait, let me go through all the rules again. Maybe I missed an NT that directly produces 't8'.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53 \u2192 no 't8'\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87 \u2192 no\n- NT10 \u2192 but no NT10. Let me check if I misspelled something.\n\nWait, looking for 't8' in the rules:\n\nLooking at the production NT78: NT78 -> NT69 NT26. So NT78 produces NT69 and NT26.\n\nWait, but are any of these NTs producing 't8'?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT22 -> 't8' \u2192 so NT22 is 't8'.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is 't8', which must be the result of some non-terminal NT22. Therefore, in the parse tree, the root S would eventually produce NT22 in one of its expansion steps.\n\nSo S -> NT91 NT22.\n\nSo the first step is S splitting into NT91 and NT22. Now, for the string to start with 't8', that 't8' must come from the NT22 expansion.\n\nSo let's check how NT22 is derived. Looking at the grammar, the production for NT22 is:\n\nNT22 -> NT87 NT98.\n\nSo NT22 is replaced by NT87 and NT98.\n\nNow, both of these are non-terminals. So each of these will split again.\n\nNT87 -> NT95 NT53.\n\nNT98 -> NT90 NT87.\n\nSo, after this second level, we have NT95, NT53, NT90, and NT87.\n\nThese, in turn, will split further.\n\nNT95 -> 't7'\n\nWait, so NT95 directly produces 't7', which is a terminal. So one of the symbols in the string would be 't7' from NT95.\n\nBut in the string, the very next symbol after 't8' is 't0'. So 't0' would have to come from the next expansion.\n\nWait, let's lay this out step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t7 t6 t6 t2 t3 t1 t0 t3 t3 t1 t5 t0 t2 t6 t5 t1 t5 t3 t0 t0 t9 t7 t7 t1 t0 t6 t6 t1 t8 t8 t0 t1 t1 t1 t9 t7 t2 t6 t5.\n\nSo, position 0: 't8' \u2192 NT22.\n\nPosition 1: 't0' \u2192 comes from which non-terminal? Let's see where 't0' is produced.\n\nLooking through thegrammar, any NT that directly gives 't0'?\n\nI don't see any NT with a production rule that directly gives 't0'. So perhaps 't0' comes from a chain of splits where the non-terminals eventually give 't0'.\n\nLooking further down the grammar rules, I see NT50 -> 't9', but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps 't0' comes from a terminal symbol somewhere, but perhaps a longer derivation.\n\nWait, let's look for the production of 't0's in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions: NT50 -> 't9', NT26 -> 't7', NT73 -> 't6', NT26 -> 't9' (no, NT26 has two productions: one to 't7' and another to NT56). Wait, looking at the last part of the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT26:\n\nNT26 -> NT45 NT50\nNT26 -> NT26 NT31\nNT12 -> NT8 NT12\n\nAnd earlier:\n\nNT73 -> NT73 NT76\nNT73 -> NT76\nNT69 -> NT6 (but that's NT6 producing 't5' in some rules).\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should represent the possible terminals that come from each non-terminal.\n\nBut let's think about the expansion after NT22. NT22 is replaced by NT87 and NT98.\n\nNT87 is replaced by NT95 and NT53. So the symbols from this are:\n\n- NT95: which could eventually produce 't7' (if it"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar looks like that, so that's good. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t1 t0 t0 t2 t7 t7 t5 t4 t3 t8 t1 t6 t2 t5 t1 t5 t3 t3 t7 t6 t7 t2 t3 t5 t3 t0 t2 t5 t4 t3 t7 t7 t8 t1 t7 t6 t2 t6 t5`. That's a long string, but I'll break it down.\n\nI think the process involves working backwards from the string, trying to parse it into the grammar's productions. Since it's CNF, we can use a bottom-up approach, like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do it manually here.\n\nLet's start by looking at the start symbol in the grammar, which is S.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can generate specific structures, often involving nested or sequential elements. The grammar provided is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Wait, no, actually Chomsky normal form requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal, with the latter only allowed in the start symbol. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT91 NT22. Both NT91 and NT22 are non-terminals. So S produces two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will presumably produce more elements until terminals are reached.\n\nGiven that, the string consists of a series of 't' followed by a number, like t8, t0, etc. The grammar seems to have non-terminals that eventually resolve to these terminals. My task is to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the parse tree method, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can expand non-terminals to match the string. Alternatively, since the string is long, maybe I can parse it top-down or bottom-up.\n\nWait, another approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to see if each 't' part corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Let's check the grammar for terminals. Scanning through the production rules, I see rules like NT98 -> 't5', NT6 -> 't2', NT95 -> 't1'... Hmm, so each production either splits into two non-terminals or terminates with a terminal like 'tX'.\n\nThe string given is quite long, so directly building a parse tree might be tedious. Maybe I can calculate the length of the string and see how many symbols the grammar can produce. S -> NT91 NT22, each of those non-terminals will produce something. Let's see the possible structure.\n\nLooking into NT91: It has a production NT91 -> NT8 NT91. Wait, that's an epsilon production? No, wait, NT91 is defined as NT8 NT91, which is recursive. That seems like a problem\u2014recursive rules can lead to infinite loops unless there's a base case. Wait, checking the NT91 production again: NT91 -> NT8 NT91. So it's repeating the same structure indefinitely, meaning it doesn't terminate unless there's a way for NT8 to resolve. But looking at NT8: from the grammar, I don't see any production for NT8 except for one in the middle: Wait, let me check. Scanning through, I see NT12 -> NT8 NT12, which might be similar. So maybe NT8 isn't a terminal? Let me search the grammar for NT8.\n\nLooking again, I see NT87 -> NT95 NT53. NT53 -> NT6 NT41, which seems to go into more non-terminals. Wait, another path leads to NT87: it's not a terminal. So perhaps this is an issue. The string has a lot of t8s, so let's see.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the only terminal is covered by rules like NT6 -> 't2', NT95 -> 't1', etc. But I don't see any production for NT8 as a terminal. So that could be a problem because the string has 't8's which would need to come from some terminal rule. Looking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT6 -> 't2'\n- NT6 -> 't8' (Wait, actually, I see NT68 -> NT6 NT41, and also NT6 -> 't3' and 't8'. Hmm, yes. So NT6 has two productions: one to 't3' and another to 't8'. So NT6 can produce 't3' or 't8'.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar as presented:\n\n- NT6 -> 't3'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n\nSo that's a problem because 't6' would require a production that only goes to these. So for 't8's in the string, it's covered by NT6 -> 't8', which is a valid terminal production.\n\nBut another thing: in the string, I see several 't8's. So that would come from NT6. Now, looking at the production S -> NT91 NT22. So each of these non-terminals would have to be expanded into a sequence of terminals, but given the recursive nature, maybe that's feasible.\n\nBut let's also analyze NT91: NT91 -> NT8 NT91. So this is a recursive rule, which means it would require another expansion that eventually terminates. Let's see what NT8 does.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT8: I don't see an explicit production for NT8 except for maybe in some rules. Wait, the first line is S -> NT91 NT22. Looking further, NT8 is used in NT68 -> NT6 NT41 and NT98 -> NT90 NT87. So NT8 is used in other productions. Looking for NT8 in the rules: I don't see a production for NT8 except perhaps in NT41->NT9 NT51.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules carefully:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- S -> NT91 NT22\n- NT22 -> NT87 NT98\n- NT76 -> NT69 NT26\n- NT68 -> NT6 NT41\n- NT7 -> NT69 NT96\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT12\n- NT87 -> NT95 NT53\n- NT51 -> NT51 NT68\n- NT98 -> NT90 NT87\n- NT0 -> NT90 NT79\n- NT56 -> NT55 NT78\n- NT2 -> NT73 NT38\n- NT95 -> NT13 NT1\n- NT50 -> NT2 NT69\n- NT25 -> NT45 NT50\n- NT31 -> NT54 NT31\n- NT79 -> NT51 NT76\n- NT56 -> NT56 NT95\n- NT1 -> NT97 NT41\n- NT54 -> NT50 NT56\n- NT68 -> NT25 NT31\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT26\n- NT41 -> NT9 NT51\n- NT54 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT95 -> 't7'\n- NT38 -> 't2'\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't7'\n- NT90 -> 't9'\n- NT8 -> 't4'\n- NT79 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't4'\n- NT45 -> 't6'\n- NT91 -> 't8'\n- NT78 -> 't8'\n- NT53 -> 't6'\n- NT13 -> 't0'\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT73 -> 't7'\n- NT69 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't8'\n- NT98 -> 't5'\n- NT51 -> 't3'\n- NT50 -> 't9'\n- NT97 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT38 -> 't6'\n- NT12 -> 't9'\n- NT26 -> 't1'\n- NT69 -> 't1'\n- NT26 -> 't9'\n- NT12 -> 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't3'\n- NT26 -> 't6'\n- NT26 -> 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't0'\n- NT56 -> 't0'\n- NT90 -> 't0'\n- NT79 -> 't3'\n- NT31 -> 't2'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT76 -> 't3'\n- NT96 -> 't0'\n- NT68 -> 't7'\n\nWait, I think I missed NT8's production.

The grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails.

I think I should list out all the options for each non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar's productions. Since each step of the grammar splits a non-terminal into two parts, the string can be represented as a tree where each node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal.\n\nThe string is quite long, with 48 tokens. Let's see how the non-terminals can expand. Starting with the start symbol S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string must start with NT91 producing a sequence that starts with t8 and ends with t6.\n\nLooking at NT91's production:NT91 \u2192 NT90 NT79 \u2192 NT90 is t9 and NT79 is t7, but wait, no. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT91 \u2192 according to the given list, NT91 is either NT76 NT78 or NT95 NT0? Wait, let me check. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the given rules don't include NT91 directly; instead, NT95 is present. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking back, the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nNT91 \u2192 Is there a production for NT91? Maybe I missed it. Wait, looking through the provided grammar, I don't see a production for NT91, except in the string where it appears as part of NT76 \u2192 't3' in NT73's production? Wait no, the productions have nt73: NT73 \u2192 NT73 NT7, but also includes NT73 \u2192 NT69 NT7, which when NT69 is 't3' and NT7 is 't1', so NT73 produces t3 t1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals explicitly, since some might be mistakes in parsing.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by backtracking. The given string is a sequence of t's and numbers. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two letters or a terminal. So the string should break down into a parse tree where each node corresponds to a production.\n\nLet me start by seeing where the non-terminals can split. For example, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the entire string should be produced by NT91 and NT22.\n\nBut how does NT91 and NT22 produce the string. Let's look at the string:\n\nt8 t0 t1 t1 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t9 t2 t6 t6 t6 t3 t1 t0 t3 t5 t9 t7 t9 t0 t7 t0 t1 t4 t3 t9 t7 t5 t1 t8 t8 t0 t5 t7 t6 t7 t1 t6 t0 t2 t6.\n\nThis is the string of 48 tokens. Since each production is two symbols, except for terminals, but the grammar uses CNF which means each rule splits into two non-terminals or terminals. Wait, but the output's string has 48 symbols, which is even, which makes sense if each step splits into two. But let's see.\n\nWait, wait. Let me correct this: The string is a sequence of symbol applications, each symbol being a single terminal or non-terminal. Since in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So when you're parsing, you would start with the start symbol S, which is a non-terminal. It needs to produce the string, so you would split into two parts, which themselves must be a non-terminal or terminal. Since only S \u2192 NT91 NT22 is the top-level split, the entire string must be split into two parts, each of which is the output of NT91 and NT22 respectively.\n\nSo, the first part will correspond to NT91, and the second to NT22. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nSo first, for NT91: Looking through the grammar, I need to find a production for NT91. But looking back, the provided grammar does not list NT91; instead, according to the grammar, NT95 \u2192 't7', but I don't think that's NT91. So perhaps NT91 \u2192 NT76 NT78 or similar.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules:\n\nLooking for NT91: After checking, I don't see a rule for NT91. The given grammar list only defines NT91 as having a production of NT95 NT0. Wait, no, wait the grammar list for NT91 seems to be 't9' and 't1' perhaps? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the grammar in the problem seems to have a lot of rules but perhaps some are not defined for NT91.

{"custom_id":"request-876","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a problem where I need to determine if a particular string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has specific rules that I can take advantage of. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This simplifies the parsing process because I can approach it using methods like the CYK algorithm or the recursive descent parsing, but since I'm doing this manually, I think I'll try a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol and seeing if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, and the production rules are given. Let me look at them more carefully. The first rule is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, to start, every derivation must produce two non-terminals: NT91 and NT22. Then, each of those must expand further.\n\nLooking at the other rules, I can see that NT91 expands to NT87 NT98, and NT22 to NT87 NT98 as well. Wait, both NT91 and NT22 go to the same non-terminals. So combining these, the string after S would involve NT87 and NT98 from both.\n\nEach of these, NT87 and NT98, have their own productions. NT87 expands to NT95 NT53, and NT98 to NT90 NT87. Let's follow that. So, breaking down NT87, we get NT95 and NT53. Similarly, NT98 becomes NT90 and NT87, which loops back to NT87. So this part is recursive and will keep expanding until non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nNT95 is a terminal, as there's a production NT95 \u2192 't7'. So that's good because it can be replaced directly. NT53 also is 't6' based on NT53 \u2192 't6'.\n\nNow, looking at the string provided: It starts with 't8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t6 t6 t1 t7 ...'. Let me see if this aligns with the expected terminals from the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT91 NT22. Let's see what terminals come from NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So, let me expand those.\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53. NT95 \u2192 't7', NT53 \u2192 't6'. So, from NT87, we get 't7' and 't6'.\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87. So, NT90 \u2192 't9', and then NT87 again, which as established, is 't7' and 't6'.\n\nPutting this together, NT91 would expand to 't7' 't6' 't9' 't7' 't6'. So the expansion from NT91 would be a sequence of t7, t6, t9, t7, t6.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So, from NT22, it's 't7' 't6' 't9' 't7' 't6'. Wait, both NT91 and NT22 expand to the same sequence of terminals. So, after the initial S production, the string starts with t7 t6 t9 t7 t6 t7 t6 t9 t7 t6?\n\nWait, no, because each NT production could have multiple steps. Let me think again. Wait, no, each NT91 and NT22 would expand into their respective sub-productions, so the overall sequence from S is (NT91)(NT22), each expanding into their own terminal sequences. But looking at how the NTs expand, it's more complex because of nesting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to parse the string by working backwards from the terminals, seeing if each part can be matched by a production rule.\n\nAnother approach is to represent each non-terminal as needing to generate a sequence of terminals. Since it's a context-free grammar, each side of the production must generate the required terminals.\n\nLet me list the initial string: \n\nt8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t6 t6 t1 t7 t7 t6 t1 t7 t6 t2 t1 t8 t8 t1 t0 t6 t2 t1 t8 t8 t0 t4 t9 t6 t0 t1 t7 t5 t3 t8 t8 t9 t0 t0 t1 t0 t1 t0 t2 t6 t5.\n\nThat's 42 tokens. The first thing I notice is that the first non-terminal is NT95, which is 't7'. Looking at the string, the first token is 't8', which doesn't match 't7'. Hmm, maybe I should start by considering that S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string must be a combination of what NT91 produces and what NT22 produces.\n\nWait, but each NT91 and NT22 expand into multiple non-terminals, so perhaps the first steps involve expanding each of these into their own components, and then seeing how the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the string in the expansion tree. Let me try to sketch the possible expansion.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT91 NT22.\n\nEach NT91 and NT22 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT91 produces. From the rules:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT87 NT98.\n\nNow, NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'.\n\nNT53 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo, NT87 gives 't7' 't6'.\n\nThen, NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87.\n\nNT90 \u2192 't9'.\n\nNT87 \u2192 't7' 't6'.\n\nSo, NT98 gives 't9' 't7' 't6'.\n\nPutting that together, NT91 \u2192 't7' 't6' 't9' 't7' 't6'.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, which is also 't7' 't6' 't9' 't7' 't6'.\n\nSo, combined, S produces 't7' 't6' 't9' 't7' 't6' 't7' 't6' 't9' 't7' 't6' as the initial expansion.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is 't8', which doesn't match 't7' from NT91 or NT87. So that suggests that perhaps this approach isn't matching the string, meaning either the string is not generated by the grammar or I'm making a mistake in my expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some possibilities. Let me consider other productions. For example, some non-terminals can produce more than two non-terminals or terminals. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a non-terminal going to two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, some NTs might have more branches due to recursion.\n\nWait, looking at NT6: It has two rules, NT6 \u2192 't5' and NT6 \u2192 't8'. Wait no, looking back, when I looked at the rules, I thought maybe some non-terminals produce multiple terminals, but no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires each body to be two non-terminals. Wait, perhaps some of these rules include \u03b5 productions, but I don't think so here. The grammar provided doesn't have \u03b5, so every production is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, hold on. Looking at the NT6 rules again:\n\nWait, the rules provided have multiple lines for some NTs. Let me check if some have more possibilities.\n\nWait, for instance, NT6 has two rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't8'\n\nWait, no, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires each production for a non-terminal to be of the form NT \u2192 NT1 NT2. So perhaps I misinterpreted some of the entries. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking again, under NT6: \"NT6 -> 't5'\" and \"NT6 -> 't8'\". Wait, that can't be right because that would mean NT6 is producing either a terminal or another production. That would imply that the grammar is not in proper Chomsky Normal Form. Or perhaps I'm misreading the rules. Maybe the entries have multiple options, but each rule's body must consist of two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the given grammar, perhaps some NTs can produce multiple terminals in a single step. For example, NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53, both of which are non-terminals, so that's correct. But looking at NT6, it has two rules: NT6 \u2192 't5' and NT6 \u2192 't8'. But I thought Chomsky Normal Form only allows each rule to be either a terminal or two non-terminals.

I should check for any possible errors here, but assuming the grammar is correctly given, I'll proceed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t1 t6 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t7 t2 t1 t8 t0 t8 t4 t3 t5 t0 t6 t9 t1 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t3 t7 t7 t5 t3 t3 t6 t5 t3 t9 t8 t8 t2 t7 t5 t1 t6`.\n\nFirst, I'll split the string into individual tokens for easier processing. Each token is either a terminal (like 't8', 't0') or non-terminal (like NT91, which must be derived to terminals).\n\nSince the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because we can use a recursive descent parser or a top-down approach to derive the string.\n\nThe top-level production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, to generate the string, the entire string must be derived from NT91 and NT22, each of which must be expanded into a sequence of terminals matching the string.\n\nLet me plan the approach step by step.\n\n1. Verify that the string starts with the start symbol S. But S is a non-terminal; actually, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string should be the combination of what NT91 and NT22 derive into.\n\n2. Each NT production leads to other non-terminals, eventually terminating with terminals. Each NT in the string must be replaced by a sequence that eventually expands to the given tokens.\n\nBut this might be complex, so perhaps I can try to parse the string using the given grammar. Alternatively, check if each portion of the string corresponds to possible branches.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, maybe 45 tokens, manually expanding each step would be impractical. Alternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be mapped to a production of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string from the given non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe top-level is NT91 NT22.\n\nSo, the string must be the concatenation of what NT91 and NT22 derive.\n\nThe given string is: t8 t0 t1 t6 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t7 t7 t2 t1 t8 t0 t8 t4 t3 t5 t0 t6 t9 t1 t0 t2 t2 t0 t2 t4 t3 t7 t7 t5 t3 t3 t6 t5 t3 t9 t8 t8 t2 t7 t5 t1 t6.\n\nLet's check if the first two tokens are 't8' and 't0', which could be part of NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 \u2192 't8' (from production) because looking at the rules, NT91 \u2192 't8' (from NT91 \u2192 't8'). So, if NT91 is 't8', that fits the first token.\n\nThen, the next token should be from NT22. But wait, the first token is 't8' (from NT91), then the second token is 't0'. Let me confirm NT91's expansion.\n\nLooking back, NT91 appears in several rules; in particular, one production is NT91 \u2192 't8'. So NT91 can directly produce 't8', which is the first token. Therefore, the first token matches NT91.\n\nThen, the second token is 't0', which should come from the next part. Let's see NT22's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98. So, NT22 must derive a string starting with NT87 and then NT98. Both of these are non-terminals that must be expanded.\n\nSo, the second token is 't0', which comes from NT22. Wait, no, the second token is the second element in the string after NT91. So the string is S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so the string's first element is NT91 \u2192 't8', and the second is NT22's expansion. So the second token after 't8' is 't0', which is part of NT22. So, we need to see whether NT22 can produce a string that starts with 't0'.\n\nLooking at the production of NT22: it goes to NT87 NT98. So, to get a 't0', we need NT87 and NT98 to expand to such that one of their combined expansions starts with 't0'.\n\nWait, NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98, and each of these are non-terminals. Let's see what NT87 and NT98 expand to.\n\nLooking for NT87: one production is NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53.

{"custom_id":"request-896","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to decide whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all production rules in the given grammar should follow this structure, which they do based on the provided rules. \n\nThe grammar has a start symbol S, and from S, the first production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. That means each string derived from S will consist of two parts: one generated by NT91 and another by NT22. So, the string I need to evaluate should start by breaking down into these two parts.\n\nLooking at the string: t8 t0 t1 t4 t3 t7 t2 t3 t3 t6 t3 t0 t9 t7 t9 t0 t0 t9 t7 t0 t1 t4 t3 t1 t5 t0 t1 t0 t0 t2 t6 t9 t6 t2 t3 t0 t5 t3 t0 t2 t3 t0 t6 t2 t6 t9 t7 t6.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like 't8', 't0', etc. Each of these could either be terminal symbols or part of a non-terminal expansion. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. That means when generating a string, it's a series of expansions where each non-terminal is replaced by two others (or a terminal). The final string will consist of terminals, and each non-terminal path must reduce to terminals.\n\nSo, to check if the string is valid, I can try to parse it from the start of the string, applying the grammar rules step by step to see if I can reach the end of the string with all expansions done.\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT91 NT22\n\nSo, the string must start with NT91 expanding into a sequence of terminals, followed by NT22 expanding into another sequence, in that order.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t8, which might be part of NT91's expansion, followed by t0, t1, etc. Let me list the string as tokens:\n\nt8, t0, t1, t4, t3, t7, t2, t3, t3, t6, t3, t0, t9, t7, t9, t0, t0, t9, t7, t0, t1, t4, t3, t1, t5, t0, t1, t0, t0, t2, t6, t9, t6, t2, t3, t0, t5, t3, t0, t2, t3, t0, t6, t2, t6, t9, t7, t6.\n\nSo, 45 tokens in total. Now, each production rule either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the total number of productions should be such that when expanded, the number of terminals is 45.\n\nBut in a derivation, each step doubles the number of symbols, but in a leftmost derivation, it's more about the path. However, given the string length is 45, which is odd, this might be a problem because each step either introduces two non-terminals or one terminal, so starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, the number of symbols after each expansion should multiply by 2 each time. But the number of terminals in the final string should be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which for a binary grammar, should satisfy some formula.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string manually using the grammar rules, starting from the left.\n\nSo, the initial production is S \u2192 NT91 NT22. So, we start with T: NT91 NT22.\n\nWe need to process the string from the start, which is t8, t0, t1, etc., until the end.\n\nLet me attempt to parse step by step.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t8. So, t8 must be part of the expansion of NT91 or NT22. Since NT91 is the first part, it's more likely part of NT91.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT91 has a production: NT91 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT96. So, NT91 expands into NT7, which then expands into NT96. NT96 can then expand into 't6' or a terminal or maybe a non-terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT96 has productions: NT96 \u2192 't7' and NT96 \u2192 NT51.\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar correctly. Let me list the productions for NT96: Based on the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the list, yes: NT96 \u2192 't7' and also another production NT96 \u2192 NT51. So, when expanding NT96, it can either become 't7' or NT51, which would further expand.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for NT96, it's possible to have multiple productions, but in CNF, each production is a single rule, so perhaps I've misread the grammar structure.\n\nWait, no, actually, the grammar is provided in a list, so each line is a separate production. So, NT96 has two productions:\n\nNT96 -> 't7'\nNT96 -> NT51\n\nBut in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, so each non-terminal only has one production. Therefore, in the provided grammar, I see that some non-terminals might have multiple productions, which would not conform to CNF, but wait, looking at the grammar provided, it's possible that some lines are actually the same non-terminal being defined in multiple ways, which is allowed in general grammars but not in CNF. So, perhaps the user meant that the grammar is in CNF but with multiple productions for some non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each non-terminal can have multiple productions, it's just that each production is a single non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nSo, for example, NT96 has two productions:\n\nNT96 \u2192 't7' (a terminal)\nNT96 \u2192 NT51 (a non-terminal)\n\nSo, when expanding NT96, you can choose either to replace it with 't7' or with NT51.\n\nSimilarly, NT91's productions start at NT91 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT96, but wait, actually, in the provided rules, NT91 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT96, but that's not a direct production. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the productions are:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT96\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tripped up by the formatting.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It's structured in a way where each non-terminal symbol on the left side of the arrow is replaced by two other non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals eventually produce terminal symbols, which here are represented by 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT95 -> 't7' and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t7 t2 t1 t0 t1 t0 t5 t1 t8 t8 t6 t2 t1 t8 t8 t2 t2 t1 t6 t3 t6 t9 t3 t9 t8 t8 t9 t7 t3 t5 t9 t3 t1 t9 t7 t2 t8 t1 t6`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string. It seems like a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. My task is to determine if this can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal), I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string.

But given the size, that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for sequences that match the right-hand sides of the productions. Let me jot down some of the productions and their terminal outputs:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT95 -> 't7'\n- NT68 -> NT6 NT41, and from the terminals, I see NT6 -> 't5' and NT41 -> 't0', so NT68 can produce 't5 t0' (so 't50' as a string).\n- NT76 -> 't5' (NT69 -> 't3', but that's inconsistent with NT76's production...

So if S is T8 T8, the string would start with T8 T8, but here it's T8 T7, which doesn't match. So perhaps S is not part of the root.\n\nWait, but the root symbol is S. So the entire string must be derived from S, meaning the entire string must be in the language of S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived from a longer process. But given that the string starts with t8 t7, which is not what S produces (since S is NT91 NT22, which is 't8 t8'), then the string given cannot be derived from this grammar. Hence, the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Because, could it be that S can be applied multiple times, and the string is longer than the immediate S production? But in this case, the string starts with t8 t7, which doesn't match any possible two immediate productions from S.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's see:\n\nThe initial S is NT91 NT22. If NT91 produces 't8', and NT22 produces 't8', then the production is 't8 t8' for S.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't8 t7', which would require that either NT91 or NT22 produce a 't7' somewhere, but looking at the productions, both NT91 and NT22 have 't8' as their terminal output.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-918","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the CFG provided. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal. In this case, the start symbol is S, and the production rules are all two-symbol on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t8 t7 t6 t9 t0 t1 t4 t3 t6 t5 t3 t9 t0 t6 t6 t1 t0 t1 t6 t0 t5 t1 t8 t8 t1 t0 t0 t1 t6 t0 t1 t0 t1 t0 t7 t7 t6 t1 t0 t9 t8 t8 t2 t7 t3 t0 t3 t0 t6`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do that, I can use a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string step by step. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach can also be used, expanding the string from the terminals up to the start symbol.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it might be easier to use the top-down method, but sometimes it's more prone to mistakes because of the multiple levels. Maybe I'll try a mix or see if I can find any production rules that exactly match the string's segments.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the start symbol S is defined as S -> NT91 NT22. So the first two symbols in any string generated by S must be the results of NT91 and NT22. I'll check if the first two tokens in the string are these.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t8. Let me check what NT91 generates. From the rules, NT91 -> NT78 NT90. Then each of those needs to be broken down further.\n\nNT78 -> NT55 NT78. Hmm, that's a recursive rule because it depends on itself. So NT78 can be rewritten as NT55 NT78, which can continue indefinitely. But in reality, this would imply that NT78 can generate any number of NT55 followed by more NT78. Wait, no, since NT78 appears on both sides. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT78 is defined as NT55 NT78. So this is a recursive rule, which can lead to infinite derivation unless it terminates. The only way for this to terminate is if one of the symbols depends on a terminal. Let me check the rules for NT55 and NT78.\n\nWait, according to the list, NT55 is -> NT50 NT56. And NT50 is -> NT2 NT69. NT2 is -> NT73 NT38. NT73 is a terminal because it's a rule that leads to 't6' (as per the list: NT73 -> 't6'). Similarly, NT38 is a terminal: NT38 -> 't6'. So NT73 can produce 't6', and NT38 can produce 't6'.\n\nWait, but NT78 is part of a recursive rule, so it's NT55 NT78. Let me try to see what NT55 produces. NT55 is NT50 NT56. NT50 is NT2 NT69, which is 't7' (from NT2 -> 't5' and NT69 -> 't1'? Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, the rules for each NT symbol are a bit dense, so I'll list out the rules that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT79 -> 't3'\n- NT69 -> 't1'\n- NT26 -> 't9'\n- NT78 -> 't8' (Wait, let me check. The rule for NT78 is: NT78 -> NT55 NT78. Oh no, that's the same as before. So I'm getting confused here. Wait, no, let me look again.)\n\nWait, in the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT78 -> NT55 NT78 (recursive)\n- NT55 -> NT50 NT56\n- NT50 -> NT2 NT69\n- NT2 -> NT73 NT38\n- NT73 -> 't6' (as per: NT73 -> 't6')\n- NT38 -> 't6'\n\nSo, starting from NT78, we get NT55 and NT78. NT55 is NT50 NT56, and NT50 is NT2 NT69.\n\nNT2 is NT73 NT38, which produce 't6' each, so NT2 -> 't6' 't6'? Wait, no, NT2 is a non-terminal that can only lead to 't5', wait no: looking back, I think I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. Let's parse each rule correctly.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT26 -> 't9' (so NT26 is a terminal, but in the rules, there's NT26 -> NT45 NT50. Wait, no, that's incorrect because NT26 is also defined as a terminal. Let me check all rules to see which NT symbols produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT26 -> 't7'\n- NT90 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't7'\n- NT79 -> 't3'\n- NT51 -> 't3'\n- NT95 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT12 -> 't1'\n- NT41 -> 't0'\n- NT54 -> 't0'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT76 -> 't5'\n- NT96 -> 't6'\n- NT96 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't2'\n- NT79 -> 't7'\n- NT79 -> 't3'\n- NT9 -> 't4'\n- NT45 -> 't6'\n- NT91 -> 't8'\n- NT78 -> 't8'\n- Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, no, 't8' is actually a terminal, but how does the grammar produce 't8'? Because I'm looking for rules where NT symbols produce 't8'.\n\nWait, in the given CFG, the terminal symbols are all things that appear on the RHS, right? So any rule that ends with a terminal, like NT91 -> NT78 NT90, and if either NT78 or NT90 can produce 't8', that's a point where 't8' would be part of the string.\n\nWait, let me find all the NT symbols that can produce a 't8' terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT91: Not a terminal, goes to NT78 NT90.\n- NT71: Not present, perhaps irrelevant.\n- NT78: Goes to NT55 NT78. So if it eventually produces 't8', but how? Unless one of its dependencies is 't8'.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\n- Wait, the rules list:\n\n- NT38 -> 't6' (so it's a terminal)\n- NT78 is defined as NT55 NT78. So if NT55 can produce a 't8', then NT78 could lead to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not finding an NT that leads to 't8' directly. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT91 -> NT78 NT90\n- NT78 -> NT55 NT78\n- NT55 -> NT50 NT56\n- NT50 -> NT2 NT69\n- NT2 -> NT73 NT38\n- NT73 -> 't6'\n- NT38 -> 't6'\n\nSo, in this path, the NT2 leads to NT73 and NT38, both of which produce 't6'. So the string is 't6' 't6'. But in the given string, there are plenty of 't8's. So maybe this path isn't the right one. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way the start symbol S can produce 't8'.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S is S -> NT91 NT22, so let's look into NT91 and NT22.\n\nNT91 -> NT78 NT90. NT78 is recursive, as above, and NT90 is -> 't9'. So NT91 produces something that ends with 't9'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is 't8'. So if S is generating 't8', that would require either NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-913","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and I have a string to test. The process for solving this involves a few steps, and I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem. The grammar is given with non-terminals like S, NT22, NT76, etc., and each production rule is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, except for some cases where a terminal appears, like 't7'. The string to evaluate is a series of these terminal symbols separated by spaces.\n\nThe string is: `t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t0 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t1 t0 t9 t3 t7 t6 t3 t0 t5 t1 t0 t5 t3 t7 t2 t6 t9 t6 t6 t3 t0 t2 t3 t4 t3 t7 t7 t6 t7 t2 t1 t5 t1 t7 t7 t2 t6`.\n\nSo, the string has 57 tokens, each being either 't' followed by a digit or a standalone 't's like t7, t8, etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either S \u2192 AT where A and T are non-terminals, or a terminal. Wait, no\u2014CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So all the rules have two non-terminals on the right, except for maybe the base cases which produce terminals, but in our case, looking at the grammar, most of them are non-terminals ending up to produce 't' followed by numbers, but specifically, most of the rules seem to produce two non-terminals except a few that produce a single terminal. Wait, no, looking again. For example, NT95 \u2192 't7'\u2014that's a terminal, so that's a single-terminal production. Similarly, others like NT76 \u2192 't5', NT22 \u2192 't8', etc. So the grammar includes some productions that directly produce a single terminal.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammar provided seems to fit that because all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, I remember that in CNF, the only allowed productions are of the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a. So each production in the grammar should conform to that. Let me briefly check a few:\n\n- S \u2192 NT91 NT22: That's two non-terminals, so okay.\n- NT22 \u2192 NT87 NT98: Also two non-terminals, okay.\n- NT76 \u2192 NT69 NT26: Two non-terminals.\n- NT68 \u2192 NT6 NT41: Two non-terminals.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT69 NT96: Two non-terminals.\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT12: Wait, that's two non-terminals, but NT12 appears on both sides. Hmm, but since it's a CFG, that's allowed, though it might lead to recursion. So that seems okay for CNF.\n- NT87 \u2192 NT95 NT53: Two non-terminals.\n- NT51 \u2192 NT51 NT68: Again, two non-terminals.\n- NT98 \u2192 NT90 NT87: Two non-terminals.\n- NT0 \u2192 NT90 NT79: Two non-terminals.\n- NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT78: Two non-terminals.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT73 NT38: Two non-terminals.\n- NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT1: Two non-terminals.\n- NT50 \u2192 NT2 NT69: Two non-terminals.\n- NT25 \u2192 NT45 NT50: Two non-terminals.\n- NT31 \u2192 NT54 NT31: Two non-terminals.\n- NT79 \u2192 NT51 NT76: Two non-terminals.\n- NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT95: Two non-terminals.\n- NT1 \u2192 NT97 NT41: Two non-terminals.\n- NT54 \u2192 NT50 NT56: Two non-terminals.\n- NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT31: Two non-terminals.\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT26: Two non-terminals.\n- NT41 \u2192 NT9 NT51: Two non-terminals.\n- NT54 \u2192 NT7 NT0: Two non-terminals.\n- NT95 \u2192 't7': Oh, wait, this is a production that produces a terminal. So that's okay because in CNF, you can have A \u2192 a.\n- Similarly, others like NT38 \u2192 't6', NT6 \u2192 't5', etc., each produce a single terminal.\n\nSo, the grammar seems to be in proper CNF, with all right-hand sides being either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of these terminals. To determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if I can derive it starting from S, expanding non-terminals until I get all terminals, and the result matches the given string.\n\nThe approach for this is to simulate the derivation process. However, given that the string is quite long, manually expanding it step by step would be tedious. Instead, I can think in terms of the structure enforced by the grammar.\n\nEach production in CNF only combines two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string must be constructed by combining these elements. The key is to see if each step in the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about the possible sequences of terminals and non-terminals that could generate the string. Maybe looking for a pattern or a way to decompose the string into parts that fit the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, considering the given grammar has a lot of rules, each producing a specific terminal. Perhaps the non-terminals are designed to generate specific sequences of terminals. So, for example, NT95 \u2192 't7', NT56 \u2192 't7', etc.\n\nI notice that many of the non-terminals produce single terminals, so the string must be built by combining these terminals through the production rules.\n\nLet me list out the terminals and which non-terminals produce them:\n\n- 't8' is produced by NT91, NT1, NT22, etc. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT73 \u2192 't6' or 't7'?\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar list:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, let me list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't7'\n- NT76 \u2192 't5'\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n- NT87 \u2192 't5'\n- NT98 \u2192 't9'\n- NT0 \u2192 't0'\n- NT56 \u2192 't5'\n- NT79 \u2192 't3'\n- NT13 \u2192 't0'\n- NT73 \u2192 't6'\n- NT73 \u2192 't7' (same as above?

Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, in the user's message, the grammar has multiple entries.

{"custom_id":"request-941","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is in the language defined by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single terminal. Let me start by understanding the structure of both the grammar and the string.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, each of which seems to be a single character like 't8', 't0', etc. The grammar has rules that break down these tokens into sequences of non-terminals until they reach terminals (since some rules map directly to terminals, indicated by lines like NT95 -> 't7').\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It's a bit complex with many non-terminal rules. Each rule on the left, like S->NT91 NT22, takes a non-terminal and produces two other non-terminals. So the starting symbol here is S, which must be expanded step by step until it all reduces to terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, I need a systematic way to break it down. The grammar likely forms a parse tree for the string, and if such a tree exists, the string is in the language.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. I'll see if I can find sequences that match the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S, it goes to NT91 and NT22. So I need to see if either 't8' (from NT95 -> 't7'), but wait, S is the root, so I should look for NT91 and NT22 in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with 't8 t0 ...'. Wait, but NT91 is the key here. From the grammar, NT91 is used in S. Let me check where 't8' might come from in NT91.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules: NT98 -> NT90 NT87, NT87 -> NT95 NT53, NT95 -> NT13 NT1, NT13 -> t0, NT1 -> NT97 NT41, which eventually resolves to t1.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should map out which terminals correspond to which non-terminals. For example, NT79 -> t3, NT76 -> t5, NT98 -> t5, etc. Each of these could represent specific transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it would be easier to see if the tree can be built incrementally. Let's see:\n\nThe entire string is: t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t5 t3 t2 t6 t2 t3 t4 t3 t6 t9 t9 t8 t8 t3 t0 t0 t9 t0 t0 t1 t4 t3 t5 t0 t7 t0 t4 t7 t5 t3 t6 t0 t7 t9 t0 t1 t0 t2 t7 t7 t6 t0 t7 t6.\n\nIt's 43 tokens long. The grammar's rules have a certain structure. Let me see if I can find matching sequences from the top-down.\n\nThe string starts with t8. Let's see which NTs produce t8. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT78 -> NT76 NT31\nSo to get t7 and t6 from NT76 and NT31. Wait, NT76 is in the grammar and sometimes maps to t5. So NT76 can be t5, and NT31 can be t6.\n\nWait, let me check the NT76 rule: NT76 -> NT69 NT26. Both NT69 and NT26 have their own expansions. NT69 maps to t1, and NT26 maps to t9 or t1 depending on the rule. Wait, looking at NT26's rules:\n\nNT26 -> NT69 NT26\nNT26 also can be mapped to t9 or t1. Hmm, that's a recursive rule. Wait, looking back, in the given grammar:\n\nNT26 has multiple rules: NT26 -> NT69 NT26, which would be recursive. That's problematic. If I have NT26 -> NT69 NT26, then it can generate an infinite loop. But since our string is finite, I need to find a path where this recursion terminates. So perhaps there's a way for NT26 to produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT26:\n\nWait, in the initial rules, I see NT26 -> NT69 NT26. Let me check deeper. NT69 -> t1, as per the rule NT69 -> 't3'? Wait no:\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, let me list each rule with their mappings.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT26 -> NT76 NT90\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me make a list:\n\nI think it's easier if I list each non-terminal and its production rules along with the corresponding terminals where applicable. Let me go through the grammar and note each non-terminal, its production rules, and the terminals they can produce.\n\nStarting with S -> NT91 NT22. So to produce S, I need NT91 and NT22 each leading to a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT91's rules: from the given, I don't see NT91 as a left-hand side of any production except perhaps in the start symbol. Wait, no, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT91 NT22. Wait, perhaps I missed some rules, but let's check:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, the non-terminals are:\n\nS, NT22, NT76, NT68, NT7, NT12, NT87, NT51, NT98, NT0, NT56, NT2, NT95, NT50, NT25, NT31, NT79, NT56 (wait, multiple NT56?), NT1, NT54, NT68, NT1, NT41, NT54, NT95, NT38, NT6, NT6, NT26, NT90, NT8, NT56, NT2, NT41, NT54, NT95, etc.\n\nWait, some of these are duplicates, which might be typos, but I'll proceed.\n\nFor example, NT31 has two production rules:\n\nNT31 -> NT54 NT31\nand NT31 -> NT55 NT68\n\nSo NT31 can be NT54 NT31 or NT55 NT68.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 -> ... Let me check: Looking through the provided grammar:\n\nNT55 isn't directly listed, but I see NT54's rules:\n\nNT54 -> NT50 NT56\nand NT54 -> NT7 NT0\n\nSo NT54 can be either NT50 NT56 or NT7 NT0.\n\nI think I might be getting stuck, so perhaps a better approach is to try building the parse tree starting from S and see if each part matches the string.\n\nS is split into NT91 and NT22.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be covered by NT91 and NT22.\n\nLooking at the string: The first three tokens are t8 t0 t1. Wait, no, S expands into two non-terminals. So the string must be the concatenation of whatever NT91 generates and NT22 generates. So in the string, the first part after S starts at t8, then t0, t1, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not accounting correctly because the string is a linear sequence, so I need to split it into tokens that match each subtree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this using dynamic programming or memoization, but since I have to do this manually, I'll try to find a way step by step.\n\nFirst, the string's tokens:\n\n1. t8\n2. t0\n3. t1\n4. t3\n5. t3\n6. t6\n7. t5\n8. t3\n9. t2\n10. t6\n11. t2\n12. t3\n13. t4\n14. t3\n15. t6\n16. t9\n17. t9\n18. t8\n19. t8\n20. t3\n21. t0\n22. t0\n23. t9\n24. t0\n25. t0\n26. t1\n27. t4\n28. t3\n29. t5\n30. t0\n31. t7\n32. t0\n33. t4\n34. t7\n35. t5\n36. t3\n37. t6\n38. t0\n39. t7\n40. t9\n41. t0\n42. t1\n43. t0\n44. t2\n45. t7\n46. t7\n47. t6\n48. t0\n49. t7\n50. t6\n\nThat's 50"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the starting symbol which can sometimes produce a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that each rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal symbol (indicated by the 't' followed by a number, I think). So, the grammar seems to be in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces: t8 t0 t1 t3 t3 t6 t7 t2 t3 t1 t9 t3 t7 t7 t6 t2 t6 t9 t1 t6 t0 t2 t6 t9 t2 t3 t9 t0 t1 t0 t7 t6 t3 t7 t2 t5 t0 t7 t6.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar's right-hand sides consist of either two non-terminals or a terminal.

NT31 \u2192 't2'\n59. NT55 \u2192 't8'\n60. NT99 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, looking at rule 25 again: NT95 \u2192 't7'. So when we see 't7', that corresponds to NT95.\n\nLet me start by looking at the given string. The first symbol is 't8', so let me see which non-terminals produce 't8'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't7' (rule 32)\nNT6 \u2192 't5' (rules 27 and 39)\nNT6 \u2192 't8' (rule 28)\nSo NT6 can produce 't5' or 't8'.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is 't8', so let's say it's from NT6. Then, the next step is to look at how NT6 is generated. Looking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 't8' (rule 28) or 't5' (rule 27). Wait, rule 28 is NT6 \u2192 't8' for the first occurrence. Oh wait, looking back:\n\nIn the rules I've numbered them, rule 27 is NT6 \u2192 't5', and rule 28 is NT6 \u2192 't8', right? So in the given string, after 't8', the next is 't0', so perhaps the expansion is something like S \u2192 NT91 NT22, then each NT91 and NT22 must produce 't8' and 't0' respectively, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT91 NT22, so each production is two non-terminals. So, S produces two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, it's a sequence of 37 symbols. Each production step adds one non-terminal, but in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of steps. 37 is not one less than a power of two. 2^6 -1=63, 2^5-1=31, 2^6-1=63. So 37 is not a valid length. Wait, wait, is that correct? Let me double-check: for a derivation starting from S, each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the length increases by one each time. Starting with 1 symbol (S), each step adds one, so the total number of symbols after k steps is 1 + k. Wait no, that can't be right because each replacement adds one symbol (since two non-terminals replaced one, but they're still non-terminals, which can be further expanded). Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either a symbol or replaced by two symbols. So the length after m steps is 1 + m steps, but the number of leaves in the parse tree would be 2^m, starting from 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. The number of symbols in the derived string is equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is 2^n, where n is the depth of the tree. Since the start symbol is the root, the number of symbols would be 2^k, where k is the number of productions applied.\n\nBut our string has 37 symbols. 37 is not a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 32 < 37 < 64. So that's a problem. That suggests that either the string is invalid because it can't be broken down into a tree with a depth where the number of leaves is 37. Alternatively, maybe my initial reasoning is wrong because for each non-terminal, it can be replaced by two others, but the order of replacement could lead to a different number of symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each non-terminal expansion increases the number of symbols by one, since you replace one non-terminal with two. So starting with 1 symbol (S), after one expansion, you have 2 symbols. After another expansion of one of those, you have 3. After another, 4, and so on. So after n expansions, you have n+1 symbols. So the string length is equal to the number of expansions plus one.
