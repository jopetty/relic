The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly one non-terminal or terminal on the right. I'll start by looking at the production rules for terminals and work my way upwards to see if there's a derivation path that leads to \"t64\".\n\nFirst, I notice that \"t64\" is a terminal symbol, so I should look for any non-terminals that directly produce \"t64\".

Scanning the rules again, I find NT36 -> 't62' and NT36 -> 't22'. Wait, no, the production for NT36 in the rules is actually NT36 -> 't63' and NT36 -> 't22'. But in my initial scan, I thought NT36 had 't64', but looking again, I see that NT36 isn't producing 't64' directly; perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recheck the rules.

Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss a rule. Let me go through all the NT productions:\n\nLooking at the NT rules from the user:\n\n- Not seeing any NT with 't64'. So, unless I\u2019m missing something, \"t64\" isn't a terminal in any rule.\n\nWait, perhaps \"t64\" is part of a larger production.

{"custom_id":"request-7","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t8\" is generated by a given context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammar has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is either a\u2192b or a\u2192bc where a, b, c are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or vice versa. So, that's good; the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to test is \"t8\". Wait, actually, let me check the string again. The user wrote the string as `t8.`, so it's just \"t8\". That's a two-character string. \n\nI know that in CNF, the only way to derive a terminal string is through a series of steps where at each step, we replace non-terminals until all that's left are terminals. Each step must generate a string of two terminals or a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but ultimately, for the entire string, we need to reduce it to all terminals.\n\nLet's look at the grammar's production rules. I notice that some non-terminals directly produce \"t\" followed by something else, like NT7 -> 't58'. Wait, no, let me check the provided rules. Looking through them, I see rules where NT7 is replaced by 't58', which is terminal. Similarly, NT8 -> 't35', and so on.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t8\". That's a single 't' followed by an '8'. So, I need to see if 't8' can be derived from S.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S, which goes to NT41 NT46... Wait, looking at the S rules: S -> NT41 NT23 or S -> NT41 NT58. So S is the start symbol, and it's producing two non-terminals.\n\nLet me think about how the string can be generated. Since \"t8\" is a two-terminal string, it must be produced directly by some rule, but looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce just two terminals like 't8'. Instead, all the rules produce two non-terminals or a mix.\n\nWait, perhaps we can break down the string into its components. The string is 't' followed by '8'. So, can we find non-terminals that produce 't' and '8'? Or perhaps a two-step process where the first non-terminal produces 't' and the second produces '8', or something similar.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any non-terminals that directly produce 't8' as a single production. Let me scan the rules for that. Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any NT -> 't8' or anything that directly produces 't8' in a single step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through a combination. For example, one NT producing 't' and another producing '8', but looking at the rules, it's not clear if such a possibility exists.\n\nWait, let's consider the structure. Since S is producing two NTs, say A and B, each of A and B must be able to derive into 't' and '8' respectively, but since each production in CNF can only replace one non-terminal at a time, we'd have to derive each to the terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can't be generated because the grammar's rules don't allow both 't' and '8' to appear in a way that fits \"t8\". For instance, looking at the start symbol S, which produces two non-terminals. Suppose the first produces 't' and the second produces '8', but are there any rules that allow that?\n\nWait, looking at the rules for NTs, I don't see any that directly produce 't8'. Let me check. For example, NT41 produces 't13', NT7 produces 't58', NT8 produces 't35', etc. So, none of these seem to produce 't' followed by a digit that directly leads to '8'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chain of productions where one NT produces 't' and another produces '8' through a series of steps. Let's see.\n\nFor example, if NTx produces 't', then NTy must produce '8' in the same production sequence. But with S being a combination of two NTs, it's unclear how both parts would combine to form 't8'.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider all possible immediate derivations from S. S can become NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let's look at both options.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNow, each of these NTs will need to derive into terminals. Let's see what each of them can produce. NT41 has two rules: NT41->NT34 NT49 and NT41->NT13. So, if one of them is NT13, does that produce 't13'? Looking at the terminal rules, yes, I think NT13 is a terminal. Wait, in the provided rules, I see 'NT41 -> 't13''. So, NT41 can produce 't13', and NT34 and NT49 as well.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules where some NTs are terminals, like NT7 -> 't58', NT8 -> 't35', etc. So, is NT13 a terminal? Looking through, I don't see any NT13 rule. Wait, the provided rules are a bit lengthy. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT41 -> 't13'\n\nYes, that's one rule. So, NT41 can produce 't13'. So, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT41 can produce 't13', and NT23 can produce 't83' (from the rule NT23 -> 't83').\n\nSo, putting that together, S \u2192 't13' 't83'. But that would be 't13t83', which is not 't8'. So, that path doesn't give us 't8'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the same S \u2192 NT41 NT23, if NT41 produces 't13' and NT23 produces 't83', that's 't13t83', not 't8'.\n\nWait, what if NT23 can produce 't8'? Let me check the rules for NT23. Oh, yes, NT23 \u2192 't83' is one rule, but is there another production for NT23? Yes, looking at the user's list:\n\nNT23 -> 't83' is present. Also, looking elsewhere, in the rules, there are entries like:\n\nNT23 -> 't83',\n\nand others like:\n\nNT41 -> 't13',\n\nNT7 -> 't58',\n\nNT8 -> 't35',\n\nand so on.\n\nWait, but in this case, S would produce NT41 and NT23. So, if NT41 produces 't13' and NT23 produces 't83', that's two terminals, but not matching 't8'.\n\nWait, unless there's a chain where one of the NTs can produce something that, when combined with another, gives 't8'. But with S being two NTs, each needs to produce a terminal or a combination. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second option for S is better. S can also produce NT41 NT58.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Now, let's see what those can produce.\n\nNT41 can produce 't13' as before, and NT58 can produce 't17' (from NT58 -> 't17').\n\nSo, that gives 't13' 't17', which is 't13t17'\u2014nope, not 't8'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT58 can produce something else. Let me check: NT58 \u2192 't17' (and other rules). So no, that path doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at different production paths. Let's take S \u2192 NT58 NT49, but wait, S can go to NT41 NT23 and NT41 NT58, but not NT58 NT49; that's another NT, perhaps further down the line.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach: maybe the string \"t8\" cannot be formed because the grammar doesn't have a production that produces exactly 't8' from any point. Alternatively, maybe through more steps, it's possible by combining two non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't8' is derived by an NT that somehow connects both parts. Looking through the rules, let me see if any NT can produce both 't' and '8' in a way that combines to 't8'.\n\nWait, looking through the given rules, I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-16","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the string \"t62 t62\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals or a terminal \u2192 terminal. \n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and its productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo the string must start with either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.

Oh, here's NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7, but that's not NT49. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps NT49 is one of the deeper rules. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking, I see NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. Also, NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. Hmm, maybe this is leading to deeper productions. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nWait, let's consider each terminal. The string is \"t62 t62\", so each part is a single terminal. So each \"t62\" must come from a non-terminal that directly expands to \"t62\". Looking at the rules, I see NT43 \u2192 t62. Also, NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, and so on. So \"t62\" can be derived from NT43.\n\nWait, so in the production of NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, both NT34 and NT49 might need to expand further. Let me see:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49, and NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, NT59 \u2192 NT19. Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should see if \"t62\" can be a terminal in a production.\n\nLooking at the rules, \"t62\" is directly generated by NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7, but that doesn't give t62. Wait, wait. Wait, I see several rules where some non-terminals correspond to terminals:\n\nLooking at the list, for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\nNT43 \u2192 't62'\nNT33 \u2192 't63'\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\nNT37 \u2192 't84'\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\nNT36 \u2192 't63'\nNT42 \u2192 't11'\nNT24 \u2192 't33'\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\nNT41 \u2192 't13'\nNT30 \u2192 't24'\nNT36 \u2192 't54'\nNT23 \u2192 't19'\nNT8 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo some non-terminals directly produce \"t62\":\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't62'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT37 \u2192 't84' doesn't give \"t62\"\n\nWait, so both NT43 and NT35 can produce \"t62\". So how can our string be \"t62 t62\"?\n\nWait, the start symbol S can only produce either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So each production from S starts with NT41. Let me check NT41's production: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So S \u2192 NT41 NT23 would expand to NT34 NT49 NT23.\n\nWait, but NT23 \u2192 't83', so that's a terminal. Now, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49, and NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, etc. This seems to build up into a chain, perhaps leading to a terminal \"t62\". Similarly, NT49 might be another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each part of the string. The string is \"t62 t62\", which is two terminals. So for the string to be generated, each \"t62\" must come from a single non-terminal in the grammar that directly expands to \"t62\".\n\nLooking at the grammar, \"t62\" is generated by NT43 and NT35. So we need both NT43 and NT35 to appear somewhere in the derivation.\n\nBut the start symbol S can only produce NT41 and either NT23 or NT58. So the initial step is NT41, which leads to NT34 NT49. Both NT34 and NT49 might eventually reach a terminal, but perhaps the only way to get \"t62\" from S is through NT43 and NT35?\n\nWait, let's think about S \u2192 NT41 NT23. NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. NT23 \u2192 't83'. So in the first expansion, we might get something like NT34 NT49 't83'.\n\nBut NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. So that becomes NT26 NT49 NT49 't83'. Then NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, so NT15 NT59 NT49 NT49 't83'. NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. So NT31 NT3 NT59 NT49 NT49 't83'. NT31 \u2192 't38', I think. Let me check: NT31 \u2192 't38'? Wait, no, let me find NT31's production. Looking through the rules:\n\nWait, NT31 \u2192 't38' isn't listed. Let me check: Looking at the rules, NT31 is not directly a terminal. Wait, here's NT31 \u2192 NT16 NT55, perhaps. Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong one. Let me recheck: Looking through the rules, I don't see NT31 being a terminal. So perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the grammar is CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get \"t62 t62\", which is two terminals, the derivation must go through two steps where each terminal is produced by their respective non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string has two \"t62\"s, each derived from their own non-terminals, which in turn must be reachable from NT41 and possibly other rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see if there's a derivation path where each \"t62\" comes from either NT43 or NT35.\n\nLooking at NT35 \u2192 't62'.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' Strings with numbers, like 't66', 't14', etc.\n\nFirst, the target string is just two terminals: `t66` and `t14`. So I need to see if these terminals can be the result of some sequence of productions, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let's check the right-hand sides of these productions.\n\nFor S -> NT41 NT23, the right-hand side is NT41 and NT23. Then, each of these non-terminals must derive into strings of terminals. Similarly for S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me analyze the productions for NT41 and NT23 that end up producing 't66' or 't14'.\n\nLooking at NT41:\n- NT41 can produce NT34 NT49, according to the rules. So NT41 -> NT34 NT49. Wait, but looking back, there's also NT41 -> NT34 NT49, which is an option. So let me check what NT34 and NT49 produce.\n\nNT34 -> NT26 NT2. So NT34 breaks down into NT26 and NT2.\n\nNow, NT26 can produce NT15 and NT59. Looking at NT15: NT15 -> NT31 NT3.\n\nWait, but NT26's productions are either NT15 NT59 or, looking back, actually in the given rules:\n\nLooking at the production list, I see:\n\nNT26:\n- NT26 -> NT15 NT59\n\nSo NT26 produces NT15 and NT59.\n\nAnd NT59: NT59 -> NT19, according to the rules.\n\nWait, no, the given rules for NT59: I see NT30 -> NT37, NT32 -> 't24', and so on. Wait, looking at NT59's productions, do they exist? Let me check the list.\n\nIn the production list:\n\nNT59 is not listed except as NT30 -> NT37, etc.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, I don't see NT59 as a non-terminal with any productions. So perhaps NT59 is a terminal. But looking at the list, the terminal rules are where the non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. Let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking for NT59: it seems that NT32 -> 't24' and other terminals are listed. But I don't see any production for NT59, which suggests that NT59 is a terminal. So NT59 -> 't59'.\n\nWait, no, because in the production rules, NT55 -> NT22 NT27, etc. But NT59, in the rules, I think there's no rule where NT59 is the left-hand side; instead, NT26 -> NT15 NT59 and NT24 -> NT33 NT26.\n\nBut looking at the rules, I don't see any production for NT59 except perhaps for NT36 and others. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the production list, NT59 is not listed as a left-hand side of any production. So perhaps NT59 is a terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking at the terminal rules:\n\nThe terminal rules are when the non-terminal directly produces a 't' string. So for example, NT43 -> 't43'. So if a non-terminal isn't present as a left-hand side of any production, it's a terminal.\n\nWait, no: Wait, in the production rules, if a non-terminal is on the left-hand side, it can be further broken down. If it's not, it's a terminal. So I need to check if NT59 is on the left-hand side. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT59 being a non-terminal; the only production with NT59 is as the result of NT26. So NT26 -> NT15 NT59, meaning that NT59 is a terminal, producing 't59'.\n\nWait, but in the list, do any terminals produce 't59'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given terminal productions:\n\nNT36 -> 't36' and others like 't63', 't66', 't13', etc. But I don't see any terminal that produces 't59'. So perhaps NT59 is a terminal that's not part of the production, which might mean it's a typo, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps I need to treat NT59 as a terminal if it's not further broken down.\n\nBut wait, I'm looking at the rules again. Wait, let me look for any rules where NT59 is a left-hand side:\n\nNo, I don't see any. So that would mean NT59 is a terminal. But since there's no rule where NT59 produces a terminal, perhaps it's a problem. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that NT59 is a terminal which produces 't59', but since it's not present in the terminal part, perhaps it's a terminal that can produce nothing, which isn't possible. Hmm, this might be a red herring, perhaps I need to check if NT59 is needed elsewhere.\n\nBut let's backtrack: The path we're considering is S -> NT41 NT23. Let's see what NT41 and NT23 derive into.\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nNT34 -> NT26 NT2.\n\nNT26 -> NT15 NT59.\n\nNT15 -> NT31 NT3.\n\nNT31 -> NT38 NT36.\n\nNT38 -> NT28 NT32.\n\nNT28 -> NT18 NT2.\n\nSo wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a path where the terminal strings could be `t66` and `t14`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S could produce S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me check S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nNT58 -> NT15 NT24.\n\nNT15 -> NT31 NT3.\n\nNT31 -> NT38 NT36.\n\nNT38 -> NT28 NT32.\n\nAnd so on; this also seems to go into more complex steps, but perhaps it's producing non-terminals that can lead to 't66' and 't14'.\n\nWait, another approach: the target string is `t66 t14`. Let's see what productions can directly give us these terminals without non-terminals in between.\n\nLooking at the production rules for terminals, we have NT22 -> 't22', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT23 -> 't23', and NT24 -> 't24', etc., but does any non-terminal directly produce 't66' or 't14'?\n\nLooking through the production list:\n\nLet me scan for any NT that directly produce 't66' or 't14':\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT43 -> 't43'\nNT36 -> 't36'\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT16 -> 't58'\nNT24 -> 't33', etc.\n\nHmm, no NT directly produces 't66' or 't14', except in their possible breakdowns through non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps 't66' is produced by a non-terminal that eventually breaks down into 't66', but the only way would be if a non-terminal directly produces 't66', which doesn't seem to exist in the rules.\n\nWait, but no NT directly produces 't66', unless a non-terminal downstream of some productions ultimately results in 't66'. Let's look deeper.\n\nWait, the string is `t66 t14`. So perhaps the two non-terminals NT66 and NT14 produce 't66' and 't14' respectively. But since they don't appear as non-terminals in the grammar, they must be terminals, but they aren't present as terminals; their production rules don't exist.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding: in the given production list, the only non-terminals are those that are on the left-hand side. All others are terminals, and each non-terminal on the left has a production that splits into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given production list, there are no entries for NT66 or NT14, so perhaps they are terminals. So, if the grammar includes NT66 -> 't66' and NT14 -> 't14', but since they are not present in the production list, perhaps they are not part of the grammar at all. Alternatively, perhaps the productions for NT66 and NT14 don't exist; instead, perhaps the initial analysis is flawed.\n\nWait no, let's look again: the given grammar's left"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-37","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t14 t13 t10` is generated by a given context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has either a single non-terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That might help in parsing or in building a derivation tree. Also, all the leaves of the parse tree should be terminal symbols, which in this case are the `t` followed by numbers.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of NT (non-terminal) symbols that eventually expand into 't' followed by numbers. For example, I see rules like `NT12 -> NT32 NT16`, and eventually, `NT16 -> 't81'`. So each NT seems to break down into smaller parts until it becomes a terminal.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is `t14 t13 t10`. Each of these `t` digits is a terminal symbol, so each must correspond to the result of an NT production ending in that specific terminal. Let me note down each part:\n\n- `t14`: So I need an NT that can derive into `t14`.\n- `t13`: Another NT that can produce `t13`.\n- `t10`: And one that can make `t10`.\n\nI'll check each component one by one.\n\nStarting with `t14`. Looking through the rules, I see `NT3 -> 't64'`, `NT30 -> 't37'`, `NT32 -> 't24'`, `NT55 -> 't65'`, `NT24 -> 't33'`, `NT2 -> 't33'`, `NT15 -> 't71'`, and so on. Wait, none of these directly give me `t14`. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe I missed it. Let me scan again through the rules.\n\nLooking at `NT36 -> 't9'`, `NT28 -> 't26'`, `NT36 -> 't22'`, `NT24 -> 't49'`, `NT58 -> 't74'`, `NT3 -> 't64'`, `NT30 -> 't37'`, `NT32 -> 't24'`, `NT55 -> 't65'`, `NT24 -> 't27'`, `NT7 -> 't58'`, `NT41 -> 't13'`. Oh, wait, `NT41` can produce `t13`. But in the string, we have `t13` as the second element, so that's good. Now, what about `t14`? I'm not seeing an NT that directly produces `t14` at the top level. Wait, maybe I need to look deeper. Let's see if any NTs can produce `t14` through multiple steps.\n\nLooking again, I don't see an NT that directly transforms into `t14`. Let me list all the NTs and see which ones have a path to `t14`. From the given rules:\n\n- Looking through all the NTs, I don't see any that expand into `t14`. All seem to expand into other NTs or specific txx terminals. Wait, maybe the `t14` isn't present in the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nI see that `NT8 -> 't35'`, `NT10 -> 't28'`, `NT12 -> 't8'`, `NT15 -> 't71'`, etc. Hmm, no, I don't see any NT that can eventually derive `t14`. That might mean that the string `t14 t13 t10` has a t14 which isn't present in the grammar, so the string can't be generated. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I overlooked something. I'll scan each NT rule again to see if any of them can produce a `t14`.\n\nLooking at `NT58 -> 't17'`, so when NT58 is expanded, it becomes `t17`. Similarly, NT17 doesn't exist in the rules except for that. So that can't give me `t14`. NT27 -> NT35 NT15, but does any NT55 or NT35 produce `t14`? Looking for that. \n\nWait, maybe I should approach this from the start. Let's see if the first terminal `t14` can be produced from the start symbol. The start symbol is S, which has two options: NT41 NT41 (but that would produce 't13' twice, but our string starts with 't14'), or NT41 NT41 is S's first option, but wait, no: looking at the first part, the Grammar is given as a set of production rules. Let me list the initial rules of S.\n\nWait, the first two options for S are:\n\nS -> NT41 NT41\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo if the string starts with `t14`, let's see which NTs could lead to that. NT41 could be the one, but does NT41 produce `t14`? Looking at NT41's productions:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nLooking at NT34 and NT49. NT34 -> NT26 NT49, and NT34 can go further. Let's see: NT34 produces NT26 and NT49, which then can produce more NTs. So maybe NT41 can't directly produce `t14`.\n\nWait, perhaps none of the rules in the grammar produce `t14`, meaning that the string `t14 t13 t10` includes a terminal that's not possible according to the grammar. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nHowever, I should make sure I didn't miss any NTs that could produce `t14`. Let me check each NT rule again:\n\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT58 -> 't17'\n- NT33 -> ... 't36' or 't33', etc.\n- Let's look at NT24 -> 't33' and 't27' and others.\nWait, looking at NT24:\n- NT24 -> NT23 NT28\nBut NT23 is 't83' and NT28 is 't26'. So NT24 would eventually produce 't83' and 't26', but that doesn't give 't14'. \n\nAnother NT, NT36 -> 't9' and 't22', so no 't14' there.\nNT38 -> 't32' and 't31'.\nLooking for NTs that can produce 't14' by combining two terminals or NTs. So, for example, an NT that can derive into NTa NTb where NTa -> 't??' and NTb -> 't??' to combine into 't14' when the NTa and NTb are combined. But looking at all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly (through rules) can produce 't14'. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path I'm missing. Let's consider NT7 -> 't58', NT41 -> NT34 NT49, and then NT34-> NT26 NT49, which could go on, but I don't see any of these leading to 't14'.\n\nAlso, looking through all the NTs, none have a production rule that includes 't14' in their terminal expansion. All have either txx where xx is even (14 is even, so maybe in the given rules it's present) but I don't see it. For example:\n\nLooking through all NTs, I can make a list of where the terminals are:\n\n- NT3 -> 't64'\n- NT30 -> 't37'\n- NT32 -> 't24'\n- NT55 -> 't65'\n- NT24 -> 't33' or 't27'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT34 -> 't26' or NT26\n- NT35 -> 't62'\n- NT36 -> 't9' or 't22'\n- NT42 -> 't11' or various others\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT37 -> 't58' or 't41' or 't38' or 't37' multiple options\n- NT28 -> 't26' and 't2' (wait, NT28-> NT38 NT31 and NT38->...

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol, but here S seems to split into two non-terminals as well.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string: `t24 t74 t17`. I remember that in this notation, each token like 't24' represents a terminal symbol, so I need to find a derivation path from the start symbol S to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nI need to check if any of these can produce the string. Let's start with the first option.\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23. So, this splits into NT41 and NT23. Now, I need to see what each of these non-terminals can derive into.\n\nLooking at NT41, the production rules are:\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT41 \u2192 NT35 NT27\n\nSo, NT41 can go to NT34 and NT49, or NT35 and NT27. Let's explore both paths.\n\nFirst, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nNow, NT34 is a non-terminal; looking up its rules:\n- NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT2\n- So NT34 can produce NT26 and NT2.\n\nSimilarly, NT49:\n- NT49 \u2192 NT26 NT49 (this seems recursive)\n- Additionally, looking for NT49, I see other rules like NT42 \u2192 NT8 NT52, but that might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, let's check NT26. NT26's rule is:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\nAnd NT59:\n- NT59 \u2192 NT19 NT31\n\nSo NT26 can go to NT15 and NT59, which then can expand further.\n\nMeanwhile, NT49 has a rule:\n- NT49 \u2192 NT26 NT49, which is recursive, so that might not help directly. Or is there another production?\n\nWait, looking through, I see NT49 also produces via NT23's production, but that leads to NT42. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the other option for S is better.\n\nWait, maybe let's try the second option for S: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo NT41 and NT58. Let's see their productions.\n\nNT41 again, as before, produces either NT34 NT49 or NT35 NT27.\n\nAnd NT58 has rules:\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n- Also, another rule: NT58 \u2192 NT17 via another path? Wait, no, looking at the rules, the terminal 't17' is from NT58 directly: NT58 \u2192 't17'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar, for NT58:\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n- Also, NT58 appears in other rules, like NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27, etc. But in this case, looking directly, I see that NT58 has a production that is a terminal: 't17'. Wait, actually, the rule is:\n\nWait, looking through, one of the rules is:\n\n`NT58 -> 't17'`? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT58, I see:\n\n`NT58 -> NT15 NT24` and `NT58 -> 't74'`. Because elsewhere, I see NT58 \u2192 't17', but wait, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, here's the list:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n- Also, in the given grammar, looking for '58' as the left-hand side, I see:\n\nLooking back, I think I might have misread. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules are:\n\nFor NT58: \n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n- Another production for NT58 is not mentioned until I scan through the list.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, under NT58, I don't see a direct production to 't74' that I can confirm. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT58:\n\nNo, actually, I think I made a mistake. Let me recheck the given grammar.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar and the string. Let me read the grammar provided step by step.\n\nThe grammar starts with S and then lists all non-terminals and their rules in a long format. So, to be precise, looking for NT58:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n\nThen, looking further:\n\nAfter NT55, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking for '58' as a left-hand side. Let me check all rules where the left side is NT58.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT37 etc., nothing on NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps I was incorrect in my initial thought. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, at the very beginning, the grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT41 NT41\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nHmm, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me see: the rule NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 is present, but there's no production for NT58 \u2192 't74' or 't17' directly. Instead, some terminals are reachable through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have 't74' as the second token. Let's check which non-terminals produce 't74'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't58'? Wait, no, wait: looking again.\n\nWait, in the given rules, under NT58, do they have a terminal production?\n\nWait, here's the full list:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n- NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT37\n- NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n- NT59 \u2192 NT19 NT31\n- NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT36\n- NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n- NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n- NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT2\n- NT35 \u2192 NT62\n- NT36 \u2192 NT63\n- DT37 \u2192 't84'\n- NT37 \u2192 other things, etc.\n- And other rules.\n\nWait, I don't see any rule where NT58 directly produces a terminal except in one line where NT58 was miswritten. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24.\n\nBut that's it. So, NT58 doesn't directly produce a terminal. That would mean that 't74' must come from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second token is 't74'. So, perhaps this is produced by NT49, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because earlier I thought NT58 \u2192 't17', but upon reevaluating, that might not be the case.\n\nLet me check again: in the given rules, is there any non-terminal that produces 't74'?\n\nLooking through all rules for terminals:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT37\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n- NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT36\n- NT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5\n- NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT49\n- NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT36\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26\n- NT37 appears with multiple rules, including NT37 \u2192 't62'\n- NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n- NT42 \u2192 NT8 NT52\n- NT42 \u2192 NT31 NT55\n- NT37 \u2192 't64'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by looking at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it standardizes the structure.\n\nThe top-level rule in the grammar is `S -> NT41 NT23` or `S -> NT41 NT58`. So both options start with NT41, followed by either NT23 or NT58. Wait, but the string I'm checking starts with `t26`, which corresponds to NT26. Hmm, let me check the production rules for NT26.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT26 -> NT15 NT59 and NT26 -> NT15 NT59. So NT26 must derive to two symbols. Let me trace back the string `t26 t49 t17 t9`.\n\nStarting from the first token, `t26`. From the grammar, NT26 can produce NT15 and NT59. Let's look at those. NT15 -> NT31 NT3, and NT59 -> NT30 NT49.\n\nWait, let's see. So starting with NT26, which is `t26`. Then NT26 branches into NT15 and NT59.

I see rules like NT24 -> t49, but does NT59 have a production that includes t49? Hmm, looking through the provided rules, I see NT23 -> t19, NT30 -> t37, etc. Maybe I need to re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the user-provided grammar has lines like NT58 -> t15 t24, NT24 -> t49, etc. Maybe I need to re-express how each NT symbol maps to the t symbols because the string contains t tokens like t26, t49, t17, etc.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has many rules where certain NT's produce t symbols. For example, NT24 -> t49, which would mean that NT24 produces t49. Similarly, NT58 -> t15 t24, NT41 -> t13, etc. So the key is to see how each non-terminal in the string can be derived.\n\nThe string is t26 t49 t17 t9. Let's map each t to NT symbols:\n\nt26 corresponds to NT26.\nt49 corresponds to NT24 (since NT24 -> t49).\nt17 corresponds to NT58 (since NT58 -> t17).\nt9 corresponds to NT23, because NT23 -> t9.\n\nWait, but in the string, t9 is the last token, so that would come from NT23.\n\nNow, the top-level rule S can produce either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nSo, let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: S -> NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41 is generated by NT41, which can produce t13 and t58. Wait: looking at the production rules, NT41 -> t13 (because in the provided rules, NT41 -> t13). But wait, in the string, the first token is t26, which doesn't come from NT41. Wait, this doesn't seem to align.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nEach production in the grammar is written as NT... -> NT... NT... or NT... -> terminal. So for example, NT41 can be NT34 NT49 or some other combination, but in the given rules, I see NT41 -> t13 and NT24 -> t49. Wait, no, the rules are more detailed.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT24 -> t49 is present.\n- NT26 is not directly terminal but seems to derive to NT15 and NT59.\n- NT58 -> t15 t24 is a rule.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to figure out how each t in the string can be generated.\n\nWait, let's consider each t token and see which NT rules produce it.\n\nt26: Looking for a production where the left-hand side NT leads to t26. From the given rules, I don't see a production for NT26 that directly ends in t26, but looking deeper, NT26 -> NT15 NT59. So NT26 can't produce t26 directly\u2014it must go through NT15 and NT59.\n\nWait, that's contradictory because in the string, the first token is t26, which would mean that NT26 must be derived from S or via other NTs, but according to the provided rules, NT26's production leads to other NTs, not terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT26 has a rule NT26 -> NT15 NT59.\n\nSo NT26 only goes further, not producing t26 as a terminal. Then, how does t26 come into the string? That seems impossible because NT26 doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If NT26 -> NT15 NT59, then t26 would have to come from NT15 or NT59, but in the string, it's the first token. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the derivation works.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating because the string starts with t26, but according to the grammar, NT26 can only produce NT15 and NT59, not t26. So t26 can't come directly from NT26, suggesting that the string isn't in the language. But let's not give up yet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me re-express the derivation steps.\n\nThe string is t26 t49 t17 t9. So the sequence of t's comes from some NTs. Let's map each t to the possible NT:\n\nt26: Could it be coming from NT26? Because according to the rules, NT26 -> NT15 NT59. But that would imply t26 is produced by NT15 or NT59, not NT26.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial rule S -> NT41 NT23 is the starting point. Let's see:\n\nS can split into NT41 and NT23. NT41 can produce, for example, t13 or other terms, and NT23 can produce t9.\n\nIn the string, the last t is t9, which comes from NT23. So the structure could be NT41 (t41 derivation) and NT23 (t9), but then how to get t26 and t49 in between?\n\nWait, maybe there's a more complex structure. Let me try to find the path.\n\nt26 is the first symbol. So it must be the terminal result of some NT derivation. Let me check which NT rules have t26 as a terminal. From the given rules, I don't see any directly producing t26. So perhaps it's not possible, meaning the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe it's possible through multiple steps. Let's see. Let's try to find if any of the NT rules can produce a t26.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any that directly produce t26. For example, NT26 -> NT15 NT59, which don't produce t26 but other NTs. Then, to get t26, the NTs leading to it would have to be further expanded, but none of them directly produce t26.\n\nWait, but perhaps the entire derivation requires that t26 is produced by some path. But I can't find any NT rule that ends in t26.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is being built step by step, and t26 could be part of a larger NT production. But I need to think through the entire parsing tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial symbols can combine in a way that the string is structured as a concatenation of multiple t's, but I'm not seeing how. Maybe t26 is somewhere in the derivation that isn't the root symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from another option of S. S can also be NT41 NT58. So let's see:\n\nS can be NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 can produce, for example, t13 or other terms, and NT58 can produce t15 t24, which would be more tokens.\n\nBut in this string, after t26, we have t49, then t17, then t9. So perhaps it's a longer chain.\n\nI'm getting confused.

The non-terminals include things like S, NT27, NT38, etc., and the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers like 't74', 't38', etc. My string is composed of these terminals, which means each token in the string must correspond to a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see the terminal productions. From the grammar provided:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n- A bunch of others, but I'll focus on the terminals.\n\nLooking through, I see that NT41 \u2192 t13 and NT58 \u2192 t74. So, the string starts with 't74', which would have to come from the rule NT58 \u2192 t74. Similarly, looking for the other terminals:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- Wait, T38 is not directly a terminal. Hmm. Or maybe another rule: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31. Let me check NT28 and NT31.\n\nLooking at NT28: It has a production NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, which isn't terminal. But wait, maybe there's another way. Let's see if NT28 can produce something else. I see NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, but also NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2. So that could lead to NT18 producing something else. Let me check NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37 and NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31.\n\nThis is getting a bit circular. Maybe I need to look for a way to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t74 t38 t27 t62`.\n\nLet me try to see how this breaks down. Starting with the first token, 't74'. From the grammar, 't74' comes from NT58 \u2192 t74. So that's the start. So the first part of the derivation would be NT58.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So S can generate a string starting with NT41 followed by NT58. Alternatively, other rules may start with different non-terminals, but the string starts with t74, which comes from NT58, so the string must come from S \u2192 NT41 NT58, right? Or is there another S rule that starts with NT58? Looking at the rules, S's rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nWait, no, I think it's only the first one. Let me double-check. The user provided two rules for S:\n\nS -> NT41 NT58\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nNo, that seems like a typo, it's the same rule twice. So S can only produce NT41 NT58. Therefore, the entire string must be a derivation starting from S, which then breaks into NT41 and NT58. So the string is `t74 t38 t27 t62`, which is 4 tokens. But NT41 NT58 would generate two tokens, right? Wait, no, because each NT production can lead to multiple terminals.\n\nWait, no. Each NT is a non-terminal, so when you have NT41 \u2192 t13, which is a single terminal, and NT58 \u2192 t74. So if I follow S \u2192 NT41 NT58, the entire string would have two terminals, but we have four here. So that's a problem. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the NT productions can generate more than one terminal each. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT41 NT58 is the production. Then, each NT41 and NT58 can produce sequences of terminals. So if S \u2192 NT41 NT58, and NT41 can generate a string, let's say a1 a2 ... and NT58 can generate b1 b2 ..., then the entire string is a1 a2 ... b1 b2 ... So the length of the string is additive.\n\nIn the given string, we have four tokens: t74, t38, t27, t62. So, if S \u2192 NT41 NT58, then NT41 must generate two tokens, and NT58 must generate two tokens. Because 2+2=4.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nFirst, NT41's production:\n\nLooking at NT41's rules:\nNT41 \u2192 t13\nWait, from the grammar, the production NT41 has two rules:\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT41 \u2192 t13\n\nSo NT41 can either produce t13 directly or produce NT34 and NT49. If it produces t13 directly, that would be one token. But we need it to generate two tokens to match part of the string. Therefore, NT41 must be using the production NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nNow, NT34 \u2192 t26 and NT49 \u2192 t57.\n\nWait, but NT49 is in the grammar. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT49: The productions are:\nNT49 \u2192 NT23 NT3\nBut also, from elsewhere, I see NT3 \u2192 't63' and NT23 \u2192 't83'.\n\nWait, but NT49 \u2192 NT23 NT3:\nNT23 \u2192 t83, NT3 \u2192 t63, so NT49 would produce 't83' 't63' which is two tokens.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me clarify: NT3 \u2192 't63' which is a terminal, and if NT49 \u2192 NT23 NT3, then NT49 can produce 't83 t63'. Alternatively, does it have another production? Looking back, do I see any more NT49 rules?\n\nNo, I think only NT49 \u2192 NT23 NT3 is the rule. So NT49 can produce 't83 t63' as two tokens.\n\nBut let's go back. So, if S \u2192 NT41 NT58, and NT41 produces NT34 NT49, which in turn produce 't26 t83' (from NT34\u2192t26 and NT49\u2192t83 t63?), wait, that would be three tokens, which doesn't fit because the string has four tokens from S.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the string is `t74 t38 t27 t62`.\n\nSo the entire string must be generated from S, which is NT41 NT58. So the total tokens from NT41 and NT58 must sum up to four.\n\nBut let's see NT58: NT58 can produce t74, so that's one token. So if S is NT41 NT58, and NT58 produces one token (t74), then NT41 must produce the remaining three tokens: t38, t27, t62. Because 1+3=4.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because S would have to produce t74 in the left part and then more on the right, but in reality, the left part is NT41 and the right part is NT58. Each NT can produce multiple tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet's try to parse the string `t74 t38 t27 t62`.\n\n1. The first token is t74, which must come from NT58 \u2192 t74. So the left part of S is NT41, and the right part is NT58. So S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\n2. So the string should be [NT41 production] [NT58 production], which gives a sequence of tokens. Since NT58 is t74, which is a single token, the NT41 must produce the remaining three tokens: t38, t27, t62.\n\nWait, but four tokens: t74 is from NT58. So the string is t74 followed by three tokens from NT41. Let's confirm:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n- NT58 \u2192 t74\n- NT41 \u2192 ?\n\nBut from earlier, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT23 NT3, and NT23 \u2192 t83, NT3 \u2192 t63, so NT41 would produce 't26 t83 t63' in three tokens. So that would make the string t26 t83 t63 t74, which doesn't match the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT41 can produce more tokens through different paths"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each non-terminal expands into two others or a terminal. So, I'll need to break down the string and see how these rules can reconstruct it.\n\nThe string is `t7 t7 t7 t28 t64`. Each token here is either a terminal or a non-terminal. The terminals are 't7', 't7', 't7', 't28', and 't64'. So each of these must come from a production rule when it's a terminal, or if it's a non-terminal, I need to see where it could have come from.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, I see a list like S, NT27, NT35, etc. Each of these produces two other non-terminals. I'm trying to reconstruct the string step by step.\n\nLet me start from the end. The string ends with 't64'. Looking at the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't64'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the list again. \n\nWait, I see entries like NT41 -> 't13', NT43 -> 't62', NT5 -> 't66', NT7 -> 't58', etc. Hmm, none of these directly produce 't64'. That's odd because the string ends with 't64', so perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe 't64' comes from a non-terminal. Let me check if any non-terminal's production includes 't64'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT36 -> 't63' and NT32 -> 't7'. NT35 -> 't62', and NT30 -> 't37'. NT37 is a bit ambiguous as it has multiple productions. Wait, are there any non-terminals that produce 't64'? I don't think so. That's confusing because one of the tokens is 't64', so the string must be generated somehow.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread the string. Let me check again. The string is `t7 t7 t7 t28 t64`. So 't64' is present. Since none of the non-terminals directly produce 't64', maybe it's part of a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a production that I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe 't64' comes from NT37, but looking back, I don't see a production for NT37 -> 't64'. Let me check the productions again. Hmm, in the rules, NT37 can produce 't84' or 't41' based on some rules. Perhaps 't64' is from a different non-terminal, but it's not in the list provided. \n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's see how the string could be constructed. Each 't' token is a terminal, so they must be the result of non-terminals expanding into them. Let me try to see where each 't' can come from.\n\n't7' is present three times. Looking at the production rules, 't7' is produced by NT15->'t71' and others. Wait, no, let me check specific rules. Looking through the list:\n\nNT7 -> 't58' (but we need 't7'), NT34->'t26', NT35->'t62', NT36->'t63', NT42->'t11', NT24->'t49', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a direct production. Or maybe 't7' comes from a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's think step by step. The string is five tokens long, so the parse tree should have a leftmost derivation that produces five symbols.\n\nEach step in the derivation adds two non-terminals until we reach the terminals. Since the string has five terminals, we might need starting symbols that lead to a certain structure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, the grammar has S -> NT41 NT23 and S -> NT41 NT58. So the start symbol S will always produce two non-terminals. So the string must be formed by expanding S until all are terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, it's five terminals, which might come from multiple productions. Let me try to see how this can happen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet's try to split the string into components:\n\nLooking at the string `t7 t7 t7 t28 t64`, perhaps it's built as a combination of smaller parts.\n\nOne 't7' could come from some non-terminal, like NT15->'t71' or NT36->'t63', etc. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for non-terminals that have 't7' in their productions. But looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't7'. So, 't7' must come from a non-terminal that eventually expands into it.\n\nBut then, without 't7' having a direct production, I need to see if any non-terminal can produce a string that includes 't7' because, in the given string, 't7' appears multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps the string 't7 t7 t7 t28 t64' can be built by combining certain productions. Let's think about each 't7':\n\nEach 't7' would have to be the result of a non-terminal expanding into it. Let's check for each 't7' whether any non-terminal can produce it as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT7 -> 't58' (so 't58', not 't7')\n- NT15 -> 't71' \u2192 't71' not 't7'\n- NT24->'t49' not 't7'\n- NT34->'t26' not 't7'\n- NT35->'t62' \u2192 't62' not 't7'\n- NT36->'t63' or 't64' perhaps?

Let me see: NT37 can produce 't84' and 't41', but none of those are 't7'.\n\nHmm, I'm not seeing any non-terminal that directly produce 't7'. That's a problem because the string has multiple 't7's, and without a production for 't7', I can't derive it.\n\nWait, maybe there's a non-terminal that produces a longer string that includes 't7' as a terminal. For example, maybe a non-terminal that produces NT36->'t64' but I can't see how 't7' gets there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the string is constructed in a way that some non-terminals produce sequences leading to 't7's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see how each part of the string can be generated.\n\nThe string has five tokens: t7, t7, t7, t28, t64.\n\nLet me try to see which non-terminals can produce these.\n\n't28' is produced by NT28->'t26' or NT28->'tt2... No, wait: looking through the rules, NT28 can produce 't26' as per NT24->'t26' and other rules. Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be derived as follows.\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\n\nThen NT41 -> 't13' or ... Wait, but NT41->'t13' is a production, but then 't13' is a terminal, not one of our t7's. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT41 expands to other non-terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking through NT41's production, I see NT41 can produce NT34 NT49 or NT35 NT3. But NT34 NT49 might produce 't26' and 't63'.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is to see which tokens can be directly derived.\n\nLooking at the string, 't7' appears three times, so perhaps they are produced by non-terminals that have 't7' in their chain. But from the given productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produce a 't7'.

So NT42 can produce 't11'.\n\nNext, `t63`: Checking the rules, rule 36 says NT24 -> 't63'.\n\nThen, `t57`: Rule 66 says NT27 -> 't57'.\n\nNext is `t37`: Rule 32 says NT37 -> 't84', and rule 38 says NT37 -> 't41' and 't10' as well. Wait, no, wait rule 22 is NT37 -> 't84' and rule 30? No, wait, let's look: rule 22 is NT37 -> 't84' and rule 30 is NT37 -> something? Wait no. Rule 32 says NT37 -> 't84', rule 38 says NT37 -> NT41 and NT10. So, no, 't37' isn't directly a production. That's a problem.\n\nWait, no, rule 22 is NT37 -> 't84'? Wait, no. Looking back: rule 22 is NT37 -> 't84' (line 22?), wait no. Wait in the given list, line 22: NT37 -> 't84'? Let me recount.\n\nWait, the initial list was provided with lines numbered up to 66, but when reconstructing, some rules may have been split. I think I might have made a mistake in the previous reconstruction, perhaps mixing up the line numbers.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar and the string. Let me try to list all the productions systematically.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe grammar is given with some production rules like:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\n\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nNT27 -> NT35 NT15\n\nNT38 -> NT28 NT32\n\nNT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\nNT55 -> NT22 NT27\n\nNT12 -> NT32 NT16\n\nNT8 -> NT33 NT3\n\nNT10 -> NT12 NT42\n\nNT18 -> NT38 NT37\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31\n\nNT43 -> NT16 NT7\n\nNT5 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\nNT15 -> NT31 NT3\n\nNT58 -> NT15 NT24\n\nNT18 -> NT32 NT36\n\nNT22 -> NT52 NT5\n\nNT10 -> NT41 NT5\n\nNT42 -> NT55 NT49\n\nNT24 -> NT23 NT28\n\nNT28 -> NT18 NT2\n\nNT52 -> NT12 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT15 NT59\n\nNT52 -> NT30 NT49\n\nNT37 -> NT58 NT32\n\nNT37 -> NT41 NT10\n\nNT42 -> NT8 NT52\n\nNT42 -> NT31 NT55\n\nNT16 -> 't81'\n\nNT37 -> 't84'\n\nNT23 -> 't83'\n\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nNT43 -> 't62'\n\nNT36 -> 't9'\n\nNT28 -> 't26'\n\nNT36 -> 't22'\n\nNT24 -> 't49'\n\nNT58 -> 't74'\n\nNT3 -> 't64'\n\nNT30 -> 't37'\n\nNT32 -> 't24'\n\nNT55 -> 't65'\n\nNT24 -> 't33'\n\nNT7 -> 't58'\n\nNT41 -> 't13'\n\nNT30 -> 't24'\n\nNT36 -> 't54'\n\nNT23 -> 't19'\n\nNT8 -> 't35'\n\nNT15 -> 't5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-96","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string \"t9 t9 t17 t33 t71 t38\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where each non-terminal (except the start symbol) expands into two non-terminals. The start symbol can also expand into two non-terminals or possibly terminals. So, in this case, we have a series of productions where NTs (non-terminals) break down into other NTs until they eventually produce terminal symbols.\n\nThe string consists of six tokens: t9, t9, t17, t33, t71, t38. I notice that each of these is a terminal symbol, but in some context, they might correspond to specific non-terminals. For example, seeing \"t9\" might mean that a certain non-terminal (like NT36) expands into \"t9\" because I recall from the grammar that NT36 -> 't9'. Similarly, \"t17\" might come from NT58 or NT55, etc.\n\nLet me start by listing out the productions where the terminals are the right-hand sides. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't9'\n- NT49 -> 't57'\n- NT58 -> 't17'\n- NT33 -> 't33' (Wait, that's a terminal, right? So NT33 produces 't33', but in the grammar, NT33's production starts with NT12 and NT49. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but for now, let's consider that if NT33 is produced by 't33', then it's a terminal. Wait, but in CNF, non-terminals must expand into other non-terminals except for the base case. So if NT33 is part of a production, it might have to produce a terminal like 't33'. But let me check the actual productions.\n\nWait, looking again, the productions for NT33 are:\n\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49\nBut 't33' is a terminal, so perhaps there's a production that directly produces 't33'. Or maybe NT33 is producing NT12 and NT49, which themselves produce other non-terminals, eventually ending in terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to find which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT36 -> 't9'\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n- NT24 -> 't33' (Wait, NT24's production is 't33'. But that can't be because in CNF, each production should be two non-terminals. Unless 't33' is a terminal, but in the given string, we have 't33' appearing twice. So perhaps some NT is producing 't33'. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check each production:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT24: 't33'\n- NT7: 't58'\n- NT41: 't13'\n- NT36: 't9'\n- NT58: 't17'\n- NT49: 't57'\n- NT22: 't8'\n\nWait, these are terminals. So these non-terminals directly produce these terminals. So, let's list each NT and their possible terminal productions:\n\n- NT24: 't33'\n- NT28: 't26'\n- NT27: 't9'\n- NT3: 't64'\n- NT17: Hmm, looking back, wait, NT58 produces 't17', so NT58: 't17'\n- NT43: 't62'\n- NT15: 't71' (From NT15 -> 't71')\n- NT34: 't26' (From NT34 -> 't26')\n- NT35: 't62'\n- NT42: 't11' (From NT42 -> 't11')\n- NT7: 't58' (From NT7 -> 't58')\n- NT10: 't28' (From NT10 -> 't28')\n- NT5: 't66' (From NT5 -> 't66')\n- NT12: 't8' (From NT12 -> 't8')\n- NT18: Hmm, looking at NT18: is there a production for NT18? Wait, in the grammar provided, I don't see an NT18 production. Oh, but looking back, perhaps I missed it. Wait, the grammar has:\n\nNT18 -> NT38 NT37\n\nSo NT18 doesn't produce a terminal directly; it expands into two non-terminals. So in the string, we have 't33', which should come from NT24. But in the string, it's 't9' first, so that would come from NT36. But the string starts with t9, t9, t17, t33, t71, t38.\n\nWait, the first t9: from NT36. Second t9: also from NT36. Then t17: from NT58. t33: from NT24. t71: from NT15. t38: from NT38, because looking for NT38's production, which is NT28 NT32.\n\nWait, so t38 comes from NT38, which expands into NT28 and NT32. So let's map this out:\n\nThe string is: t9, t9, t17, t33, t71, t38\n\nSo:\n\n1. t9: NT36\n2. t9: NT36\n3. t17: NT58\n4. t33: NT24\n5. t71: NT15\n6. t38: NT38\n\nSo, putting this together, the string would be derived as a sequence where each token is the result of a production. But to build the actual string, we need to see if each step correctly leads to the tokens.\n\nLet me see how the parsing tree would look. The start symbol is S, which produces NT41 and NT23. So the overall string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT41 and NT23.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Therefore, the string is the concatenation of what NT41 generates and NT23 generates.\n\nSo, let's see: NT23 is a terminal 't83'. So the second part is fixed as 't83'. Looking at the string, the last token is t38, which doesn't fit t83. Wait a minute, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the string is 't9 t9 t17 t33 t71 t38'\n\nBut if S is NT41 NT23, then the string should end with 't83' because NT23 \u2192 't83'. But the given string ends with t38, which is from NT38. So that's a contradiction. Because S starts NT41 and then NT23, so the end of the string should be 't83'.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the string isn't correct because the last part needs to be 't83', but it's 't38' instead. So that would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to see if I missed any NT production that could lead to t38 at the end.\n\nAre there any NTs other than NT38 that produce t38? From the grammar, looking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, which don\u2019t give t38.\n\nWait, NT38's production is NT28 and NT32. So if the string ends with t38, that would mean that the production is NT38 \u2192 't38', but in the grammar, NT38's production is two non-terminals. So, unless one of the production leads to a terminal, perhaps.\n\nWait, let's see: NT28 \u2192 't26' (from NT28 \u2192 't26'), and NT32 \u2192 't7'?\n\nWait, looking back, I realize that I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the terminals:\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing NTs and terminals. Wait, in the grammar, some NTs have terminals as their productions. For example:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't33'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n- NT27 \u2192 't9'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT42 \u2192 't11'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT36 \u2192 't9'\n- NT58 \u2192 't17'\n- NT49 \u2192 't5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar, I see that NT10 -> 't28', but I don't see t66 being a terminal.

So if either of the NTs in these rules produce a terminal, perhaps NT52 can produce a terminal. For example, if NT30 is a terminal (looking at the rule NT30 -> 't37'), then NT52 could produce an internal sequence or a terminal if one of the terminals is produced.\n\nWait, but in the string, the third token is t37.

{"custom_id":"request-114","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string `t71 t7 t9 t13 t22 t33 t22` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The target string consists entirely of terminals, so I need to trace the derivation from the start symbol S down to this string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, there are two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar will start with either \"NT41 NT23\" or \"NT41 NT58\". Let's break down the given string into tokens: [t71, t7, t9, t13, t22, t33, t22]. That's seven tokens, so the derivation must start with a production that results in more than one token, and each step builds up the string.\n\nI think the starting production S \u2192 NT41 NT23 might be the way to go since the string starts with t71, and looking at the productions, NT41 can derive t13 (from NT41 \u2192 t13). Let me see: NT41 can go to t13, so maybe that's part of the derivation.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for NT41. Yes, NT41 \u2192 t13. So S \u2192 NT41 NT23 would become t13 followed by whatever NT23 produces. Let's look at NT23: I don't see a direct production for NT23 in the provided rules, except for in the terminals where NT23 \u2192 t83. Yes, that's a terminal rule.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT41 NT23 \u2192 t13 t83. But our string starts with t71, not t13. Hmm, maybe I should check the other production of S: S \u2192 NT41 NT58. NT58 can go to t74 (since NT58 \u2192 t74). So S \u2192 NT41 NT58 \u2192 t13 t74. Still, the string starts with t71, so this doesn't seem to match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong way. Perhaps the string as a whole needs to be derived through multiple steps. Let me try to break down the string into parts.\n\nLooking at the string: t71 t7 t9 t13 t22 t33 t22.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, there are rules for NT7 \u2192 t58. So t7 can come from NT7, which might be a part of a larger production.\n\nLet me try starting with S \u2192 NT55 NT24, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with t71, which comes from NT41. Looking at the productions, NT41 \u2192 t13, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should trace back. Let me see which non-terminals can derive these terminals.\n\nt71 comes from NT15 \u2192 t71. How can NT15 be derived? Looking at the rules, NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. Then NT31 \u2192 t38, and NT3 \u2192 t63. Wait, but in our string, after t71, it's t7. But NT15 is producing t71, t7, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build the parse tree. Let me see.\n\nThe string is t71 t7 t9 t13 t22 t33 t22.\n\nLooking at t71: NT15 \u2192 t71. So NT15 must be expanded into t71 somewhere in the derivation.\n\nLooking at the productions that lead to t71, NT15 \u2192 t71. How does NT15 get there? From NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, which then gives t71 t...?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the beginning symbol S.\n\nS can produce either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which gives t13 followed by whatever NT23 gives. Since NT23 \u2192 t83, the start of the string would be t13 t83, but our string starts with t71, so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT41 NT58, which gives t13 t74. Still, doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong production. Or perhaps the string is built from another production. Let me look for other productions that have NSs.\n\nLooking at NT8 \u2192 t35, which might be part of a path. Or NT18 \u2192 t32, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string as a series of steps. Maybe the string is built by a series of NTs that each reduce to the appropriate terminals.\n\nLet me try to break down the string.\n\nt71: possible from NT15 \u2192 t71.\nt7: possible from NT7 \u2192 t58? Wait, NT7 \u2192 t58 or is there another production? Looking back, NT7 is defined as \u2192 t58. So t7 is not a terminal in the grammar, unless I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me check all the terminal rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't63'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT8 \u2192 't33'\n- NT10 \u2192 't28'\n- NT12 \u2192 't8'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT18 \u2192 't35'\n- NT22 \u2192 't66'\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT24 \u2192 't49'\n- NT27 \u2192 't9'\n- NT3 \u2192 't63'\n- NT30 \u2192 't37'\n- NT32 \u2192 't7'\n- NT33 \u2192 't62' (Wait, let me check: from the provided rules, NT33 has multiple productions.

The string to evaluate is `t66 t14 t14 t58 t37 t57 t58 t37 t58`, right? Wait no, wait. Let me check the string again. Oh, no, the string provided is `t66 t14 t58 t37 t57 t58 t84`. Wait, that's actually `t66 t14 t58 t37 t57 t58 t84`. Wait, how many tokens is that? Let me count: 1. t66, 2. t14, 3. t58, 4. t37, 5. t57, 6. t58,7. t84. So seven tokens.\n\nBut first, I should make sure I understand the grammar correctly. The grammar is given as a set of productions. Each production is either a single terminal, or a combination of two non-terminals. Since it's in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A,B,C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in CNF, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, which produces NT41 NT23 and other options. Then each non-terminal eventually resolves into terminals.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a sequence of terminals. To determine if the grammar can generate this string, I can either try to parse it using the grammar, or see if there's a derivation that leads to this string.\n\nGiven that the string consists of several 't' tokens followed by numbers, it's structured in a way that each 't' followed by a number might correspond to a specific non-terminal that produces that 't' and number.\n\nI should map each terminal to its possible origins. For example, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT3 -> 't64'\nNT30 -> 't37'\nNT32 -> 't7'\nNT55 -> 't65'\nNT24 -> 't49'\nNT10 -> 't28'\nNT31 -> 't38'\nNT8 -> 't10'\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, but this might take a while.

{"custom_id":"request-137","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, the string is `t54 t62 t71 t28 t59 t57 t8 t59`, and the grammar has a bunch of productions. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to walk through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar is made up of variables (non-terminals) and terminals. The given grammar has non-terminals denoted with 'NT' followed by some letters, and the terminals are strings made up of 't' followed by numbers. The string I'm supposed to check consists entirely of terminals, so I don't need to worry about the non-terminals in the string; they should all be derived from the non-terminals through the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier because each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's split into 8 tokens. Let me write them down: t54, t62, t71, t28, t59, t57, t8, t59.\n\nI need to see if these can be produced by the grammar. To do that, I can try to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S can produce two options:\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo the first step from S would lead to NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58. Let's see which path leads us closer to the target string.\n\nLet me examine the first production, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. That would mean the first two symbols in the string should come from NT41 and NT23.\n\nLooking at NT41's production, I see in the grammar: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So NT41 is two non-terminals. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 't83'.\n\nWait, NT23's production is a terminal: 't83'. So if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the first part of the string would have a 't83', and then something from NT41.\n\nBut the given string starts with t54, which is not 't83', so this production might not be the right path. Let me check the second production: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 is again 't83' via NT41 \u2192 't13' (from the string above, looking at the productions: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and the terminal 't13' is for NT41). Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think I might be getting confused. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking carefully, the productions for NT41 are:\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nAnd looking for where NT41 is a terminal: Oh, in the last line, I see NT41 \u2192 't13'. Wait, is that correct? Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the list, yes: \"NT41 -> 't13'\". Similarly, NT23 is 't83'.\n\nWait, so if S produces NT41 NT23, the string would start with 't13 t83', but our string starts with 't54 t62 ...' so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Each production from S gives two non-terminals, and then each of those can be further expanded.\n\nLet me make a table of each non-terminal's possible expansions to see which leads to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should backtrack. The given string is `t54 t62 t71 t28 t59 t57 t8 t59`. Let's list them as positions 1 to 8.\n\nI need to find a way to expand into these. Let's consider where 't54' comes from. Looking through the grammar, which non-terminals expand into 't54'?\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT33 \u2192 't63' (Wait, no, 't63' is from NT35, BTW)\n\nWait, let me go through each rule to find which ones produce a terminal:\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT30 \u2192 't37'\n- NT32 \u2192 't24'\n- NT33 \u2192 't63' (Wait, no, wait, the productions have:\n\nLooking at all NT productions for terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't64'\nNT30 -> 't37'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT33 -> 't63' (Wait, no, let me look again.)\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't17' (from line 58)\nNT28 \u2192 't7' (line 24: NT24 \u2192 't49' but wait, NT24 \u2192 't33' and 't36' and others?

Let's see: line 36: NT33 \u2192 't63' and 't62'? Wait line 36 is: NT33 -> NT12 NT49. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should list each non-terminal and its possible expansions, whether it's a terminal or continues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse-engineer, starting from the given string and seeing if I can derive it by breaking it into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t54 t62 t71 t28 t59 t57 t8 t59\n\nFirst, note that the first symbol is t54.

{"custom_id":"request-134","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string `t66 t26 t28 t71 t63 t14 t62 t71` is generated by the provided context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal, etc. But each production is in trinary, meaning the LHS has exactly two symbols on the RHS.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the productions seem to fit the CNF structure. For example, S -> NT41 NT23, which has two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals, like NT41, then is defined by other productions, either going deeper into more symbols until terminals appear.\n\nThe string given is `t66 t26 t28 t71 t63 t14 t62 t71`. I notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree should be a complete binary tree, where each internal node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are terminals. The structure must match exactly, with each production expanding as per the grammar.\n\nLet me first consider the top-level productions. The start symbol is S, which is defined as:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo S must expand into either NT41 followed by NT23 or NT41 followed by NT58. Let's examine both possibilities.\n\nLet's take S -> NT41 NT23. Then, each NT41 and NT23 must be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT41's productions:\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49, NT55 NT49, NT27 NT49, NT36 NT49, NT43 NT49, NT35 NT49, etc. Wait, no, actually, let's check the grammar properly.\n\nWait, the user provided a list, so let me recheck. Oh, for NT41, the productions are:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT41 -> NT27 NT49\nNT41 -> NT35 NT49\nNT41 -> NT36 NT49\nNT41 -> NT43 NT49\nNT41 -> NT36 NT49 (Wait, seems duplicate, but maybe different?)\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT41:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT41 -> NT27 NT49\nNT41 -> NT35 NT49\nNT41 -> NT36 NT49\nNT41 -> NT43 NT49\nNT41 -> NT36 NT49 (Is this correct? Or perhaps a typo. Let me check.)\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar provided for NT41 is: NT41 -> NT34 NT49, NT41 -> NT27 NT49, NT41 -> NT35 NT49, NT41 -> NT36 NT49, NT41 -> NT43 NT49, and then I see another line: NT41 -> NT36 NT49. Hmm, seems like a duplication, but perhaps that's a mistake. Let's proceed.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to check the grammar lines the user provided. Let me list all NT41 productions as per the user's input:\n\n- NT41 -> NT34 NT49\n- NT41 -> NT27 NT49\n- NT41 -> NT35 NT49\n- NT41 -> NT36 NT49\n- NT41 -> NT43 NT49\n- NT41 -> NT36 NT49 (This might be a typo, perhaps a different RHS, but assuming it's correct for now.)\n\nNow, considering the string starts with t66, let me check which non-terminals can derive to t66.\n\nLooking for non-terminals whose productions include t66 as a terminal. Let's check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT5 -> NT5 NT43, which might not directly relate. Let's check NT24: production NT24 -> t33. NT3-> t63, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking for terminals:\n\nEach production in the grammar (like S-> NT41 NT23) has non-terminals on the RHS until you reach terminals. Each terminal is associated with a specific production. For example, in the given grammar, under some rules:\n\nNT41: One production is NT43 -> t62.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules:\n\nNT30 -> 't37' (from rules: NT10-> NT12 NT42; so NT42 may derive to t37 or others?\n\nWait, perhaps I need a better approach. Let me create a structured plan.\n\n1. Identify the start symbol S and see what its productions are. Both S-> NT41 NT23 and S-> NT41 NT58 are available.\n2. Each production for S will break the problem into two subproblems: deriving the first NT41 to something and the second NT23 or NT58 to something.\n3. So, the string `t66 t26 t28 t71 t63 t14 t62 t71` is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree must be a complete binary tree. Each internal node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal.\n\nWait, the string is of length 8, so if it's a binary tree, the height would be log2(8) = 3, so the structure should be:\n\nS (root, level 0)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 NT41 (level 1)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ... (subtree for NT41 deriving to part of the string)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 NT23 (level 1)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 NT58 (level 1, for the other production of S?)\n\nWait, but the string length is 8, so each level would produce two children. Let's see: S (1 node) \u2192 two NT's (2 nodes) \u2192 each NT \u2192 two terminals (4 nodes) \u2192 each terminal is a terminal, so total 8 steps? Or perhaps:\n\nActually, each non-terminal on a given level must produce two terminals, so the parse tree would have a structure where each non-terminal splits into two until we reach the leaves, which are all terminals.\n\nBut in our case, since the string is 8 terminals, the parse tree would have a depth of 3: root (non-terminal) S, which splits into two Nones, each of which split into two more, each of which split into two more, so 2^3 = 8 terminals. So each split is a non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, the production S only has two options, so regardless of which path we take, we'll have two Nones splitting further.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider each production step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be generated by either S-> NT41 NT23 or S-> NT41 NT58.\n\nSo let's try each case.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT41 NT23\n\nThen, the string is divided into [t66, t26, t28, t71, t63, t14, t62, t71]\n\nWait, but NT41 and NT23 would each need to produce sequences of terminals. Let's see:\n\nEach non-terminal in the production (NT41 and NT23) must be expanded into two terminals each because the string is 8 terminals, and each NT would split into two.\n\nWait, but 8 terminals would require 4 splits from S, each producing two NTs (total 8), or maybe more levels.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a parse tree where each non-terminal node splits into two children. So the entire string would have to be formed by S, which has two children NT41 and NT23, each of which must produce four terminals each, because 4 +4 = 8.\n\nWait, 4 terminals each? Or perhaps it's possible that each NT produces two terminals, so overall, each NT would need to be expanded into a single terminal, which isn't possible because in CNF, each production is exactly two symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Wait, no, actually, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, a terminal. So that's a binary tree of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, a grammar in CNF has productions where each LHS is a single non-terminal, and RHS is either two non-terminals (for the A\u2192BC case) or a single"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string provided is `t26 t71 t83 t38 t84 t8 t83 t83 t37`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar has several production rules, some with non-terminals and terminals on the right side. I notice most rules are of the form NTsomething \u2192 NTsomething NTsomething, which fits the CNF structure except when the right-hand side includes a terminal directly.\n\nLooking at the string, all elements except possibly 't's are terminals or numbered symbols. The CFG seems to have non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals. However, I need to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol S through the given productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the grammar has two options for S: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So the string must start with either the productions of NT41 followed by NT23 or NT58. \n\nLooking at the string: the first element is t26. So I need to find a production path that starts with something that produces t26 or a chain leading to t26. \n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT24 \u2192 't49' but that's t49, not t26. Wait, let's check all productions that might lead to t26 or similar.\n\nWait, in the productions, NT24 \u2192 t49, but looking deeper, NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, and NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, and NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if the string can be derived from S.\n\nThe string is t26 t71 t83 t38 t84 t8 t83 t83 t37.\n\nI think the first step is to check if the first symbol t26 can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar. Looking at the productions, NT24 \u2192 t49, which isn't t26. Wait, did I miss any NT that produces t26? Let me check the productions again:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- NT28 \u2192 t7 (from NT37 \u2192 't84' but that's not directly relevant here)\nWait, looking back: \n\nWait, the productions listed include:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t49\nNT28 \u2192 t7\nWait, but the given string starts with t26. Looking through the productions, is there any NT that directly produces t26?\n\nLooking through the entire list, I see:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 t37\n- NT33 \u2192 t26 (since NT36 \u2192 t26 is listed, but NT36 itself is a production from NT33), and NT33 has several productions, including NT33 \u2192 t26. Wait, production: NT33 -> NT36 NT26. So, if NT33 can produce t26 directly with a single step, that would help.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t26, which could come from NT33 followed by a production that directly gives it. Wait, but that would require NT33 to produce t26, but looking at the productions, NT33 can produce NT36 NT26. So to get t26, there needs to be an NT33 followed by NT36 (which might produce more symbols) and then NT26. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first t26 is derived from NT33 \u2192 t26 NT something, but that's not a direct production. Let me check each production that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 t26\n- NT36 \u2192 t22 and t26\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- NT28 \u2192 t7\n- NT55 \u2192 t65\n- NT7 \u2192 t58\n- NT15 \u2192 t71\n- NT35 \u2192 t62\n- NT33 \u2192 t26 (Wait, is that the case?)\n\nWait, in the productions, there's NT33 -> NT36 NT26. So to get t26 from NT33, you have to have NT33 produce NT36 and NT26, meaning you'd get t26 as the second symbol. But in the string, the first symbol is t26, so that can't be the case unless NT33 is somewhere else in the chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another NT that directly produces t26. Looking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing t26 except via longer productions. So perhaps the first symbol t26 comes from a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's take the entire string and try to break it down symbol by symbol, seeing if each can be matched by the productions.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t26. To get t26, the production must be of the form A \u2192 t26, but looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t26. The closest is NT36 \u2192 t26, but NT36 only appears in the production NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26. So to get t26 as the first symbol, maybe we have something like S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me see NT41. In the productions, NT41 produces t13 and t49. Wait, no: looking at the productions, NT41: it has two options, one of which is NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and another is maybe NT41 \u2192 t13? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions: \n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- Also, NT41 \u2192 t13.\n\nSo, NT41 can produce t13 or NT34 NT49. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 t83.\n\nIf the string starts with t26, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which would produce t13 (from NT41) and t83 (from NT23), giving the first two symbols as t13 t83. But the string starts with t26, so that's not matching. Alternatively, using S \u2192 NT41 NT58. NT58 \u2192 t15 or NT15 NT24.\n\nWait, but let's see if either of these could produce t26 as the first symbol. If S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the first symbol would be from NT41. If NT41 can only produce t13 or NT34 NT49, which doesn't produce t26, then perhaps that path is not viable. Alternatively, if S \u2192 NT41 NT58, then the first symbol would be from NT41 or NT58.\n\nIf the first symbol is t26, and NT41 can't produce it, then the first symbol has to come from NT58. Looking at NT58's productions, in some cases, it produces t15 or NT15 NT24. So, NT58 can produce t15 or something else.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t15 and NT15 NT24.\n\nSo, NT58 can't produce t26 directly. Hmm, maybe the first t26 comes from a longer chain.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first t26 is produced by NT33, which is part of the production chain. Let me check NT33's productions:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT36 NT12 and NT36 \u2192 t26.\n\nWait, no: looking back, NT33's production is:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26, and also NT33 \u2192 NT28 NT32.\n\nSo, from NT33, if you produce NT36 NT26, then NT36 could produce t26. So, does that mean NT33 can produce t26 via NT36? Let me see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26.\n\nThen, NT36 can be produced by NT33? Wait, no, the production is from NT33 to NT36 NT26, not the other way around. So, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each production only goes in one direction. So, NT33 can produce NT36 NT26, but NT36 has its own productions. But this would mean that NT33 can produce t26 as one of its symbols through a two"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think is where each production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules. The string has nine tokens, all lowercase letters like t22, t35, etc.\n\nLooking at the CFG rules, I notice that many non-terminals eventually lead to terminals. For example, `NT3` becomes 't64', and `NT5` becomes 't66'. So the string consists of these terminal symbols, and I need to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and from the rules, S can go to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let me note that. So, starting from S, two possibilities:\n\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2. S -> NT41 NT58\n\nLet me look at the string. The first token is t22, but from S, after expanding, the first part is either NT41 or NT41 again, so I need to see which NT41 expands to.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT41 can go to NT34 NT49 or NT35 NT62. Wait, actually, looking again, NT41's rule is S->NT41 NT23, which is a production, but other rules like NT41 -> NT34 NT49. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the rules are given as S->NT41 NT23, so that's the direct production. Then, for NT41, from the given rules, NT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nWait, no, looking back: The rules list includes S->NT41 NT23, and then further down:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nSo, S can go to NT41 NT23, and NT41 can go to NT34 NT49, and NT23 is a terminal (from NT23 -> 't83').\n\nSo if we take S -> NT41 NT23, then NT41 would have to be expanded into NT34 NT49. Each of those would then need to be expanded further, possibly leading to more NTs or terminals.\n\nLet's outline the approach: try to parse the string from possible start symbols and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the string has multiple terminals, I can reverse-engineer it by trying to find sequences that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t22 t35 t62 t17 t62 t64 t38 t58 t59.\n\nI notice that t22 is a terminal from NT22 -> 't22'? Wait, let me check the rules. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT22 -> 't49' Hmm, no. Wait, I think the rules are a bit more detailed. Let me go through each NT and see where they point.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT22 -> NT52 NT5\n\nAnd then NT52 appears in multiple places:\n\nNT52 -> NT12 NT37\n\nAlso, NT22's production is to NT52 NT5, and NT5 is NT5 NT43.\n\nWait, perhaps it's too time-consuming to go through all of this. Another approach is to see if the string can be built by expanding from S step by step.\n\nStarting from S, we can expand to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me choose S -> NT41 NT23 first.\n\nSo, S becomes NT41 NT23.\n\nNow, NT23 is a terminal (from NT23 -> 't83'?), but wait, looking back:\n\nNT23's rule is listed as NT27 -> NT35 NT15, which isn't helpful. Wait, no, the rules are all individual NT productions. Each NT can only produce specific non-terminals or sometimes terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, when I look at NT23, the rule says NT23 -> 't83', which means it's a terminal. So in S -> NT41 NT23, the second part is fixed as t83. But the string starts with t22, not t83, so that's a problem. So maybe the S production S -> NT41 NT23 isn't the right path because the second part would produce t83, which isn't the case in the string.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to see if the string starts with t22, so maybe the other production for S is S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me check what NT58 becomes. From the rules, NT58 has two productions:\n\nNT58 -> NT15 NT24\n\nand\n\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nSo, NT58 can be a terminal (t17) or an NT that leads to more production.\n\nSimilarly, NT41 can go to NT34 NT49 or NT35 NT62.\n\nWait, but starting with S -> NT41 NT58, let's see:\n\nThe first part after S is NT41, and the second part is NT58. The string starts with t22. So, in this case, the second part is NT58, which can be a terminal t17 or go further.\n\nWait, the string starts with t22, which is a different terminal. So maybe this isn't the right path either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check all possible NT productions that lead to the given terminals.\n\nFor instance, looking at the string starting with t22, which comes from NT22 -> 't22' (from the rule list). So, somewhere in the derivation, we must have produced NT22, which leads to t22.\n\nSimilarly, t35 comes from NT35 -> 't62'? Looking back, I see that NT35 -> 't62', so that's the production. So, t35 must come from NT35, which leads to 't62'.\n\nWait, but the string has t35 as the second token. So, how would that happen? Let's see: Perhaps the S expansion goes through NT38 or something. Wait, no, S is either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58, both of which don't directly lead to a production that would result in the string starting with t22 and t35.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built through a series of non-terminals. Let me think step by step.\n\nPerhaps the string can be broken down as:\n\nt22 (NT22) t35 (NT35) t62 (NT35) t17 (NT58) t62 (NT35) t64 (NT3) t38 (NT38) t58 (NT58) t59 (something).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Another approach is to see if each token in the string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's go through each token:\n\n1. t22: From NT22 -> 't22' (yes, a production)\n\n2. t35: From NT35 -> 't62'\n\n3. t62: From NT35 or NT58 (since NT58 can go to 't17' or 't62'?)\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, let me look at all NT22, NT35, etc.:\n\n- NT22 -> 't22'\n- NT35 -> 't62'\n- NT58 -> 't17' OR NT15 NT24\n- NT15 -> NT31 NT3\n- NT31 -> NT38 NT32\n- NT3 -> 't63' (from earlier in the rules, for example)\n- NT24 -> 't28' (from NT24 rules, no, wait: looking back, some NT24 rules are terminal.

For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT8 is a terminal string 't81'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t58 t38 t59 t11 t59 t33 t71 t27 t33 t83`.\n\nI think the approach here is to use a parsing method, maybe the CYK algorithm since it's efficient for CNF grammars. But even if I don't remember the exact steps, I can try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me list the steps I might take:\n\n1. **Identify the Start Symbol and the String**: The start symbol is S. The string is a sequence of terminals, each of which corresponds to a production in the grammar. So each token in the string should correspond to a production that leads directly to that terminal.\n\n2. **Check Each Terminal in the String**: For each token, see which non-terminals produce that terminal.\n\n3. **Build the Parse Tree**: Starting from the top, try to combine these non-terminals into larger structures until we cover the entire string.\n\nBut maybe I can approach this more methodically.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string in order:\n\nt58, t38, t59, t11, t59, t33, t71, t27, t33, t83.\n\nEach of these must be a direct production from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- t58 is produced by NT58: NT58 \u2192 't58'\n- t38 is produced by NT38: NT38 \u2192 't38'\n- t59 is produced by NT59: NT59 \u2192 't59'\n- t11 is produced by NT11: NT11 \u2192 't11'\n- t59 again, same as before\n- t33 is produced by NT33: NT33 \u2192 't33'\n- t71 is produced by NT71: NT71 \u2192 't71'\n- t27 is produced by NT27: NT27 \u2192 't27'\n- t33 again\n- t83 is produced by NT83: NT83 \u2192 't83'\n\nSo each terminal in the string is directly produced by a non-terminal. That means each of these non-terminals must appear in the parse tree as leaves.\n\nNow, the string is S, which starts with NT41 NT23. So S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is the top-level production.\n\nLet me think about each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the overall structure S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the first two symbols must come from NT41 and NT23.\n\nWait, the string starts with t58, which is the result of NT58, not NT41 or NT23. Hmm. That might indicate that my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe each of these non-terminals in the string comes from a higher-level production. So S produces two non-terminals, which themselves might produce the t's in the string.\n\nSo let's break down the string.\n\nThe string is t58 t38 t59 t11 t59 t33 t71 t27 t33 t83.\n\nSince S is two non-terminals, the string must have an even number of t's, but here there are 10, which is even. Wait, 10 is even, yes, because S produces two, each of which can produce multiple.\n\nBut let's see each production. For example, NT41 could produce something. Looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then each of those would produce more.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to build up a parse tree starting from S.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the string should have a decomposition where NT41 contributes some parts and NT23 contributes others.\n\nLooking at the string, the first t58 is from NT58. Hmm, NT58 doesn't appear directly in the initial productions from S.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again: Each symbol in the string is a production that must be reachable from S.\n\nWait, how does the string align with the productions? For example, S starts by producing NT41 and NT23. Each of these must be expanded into a string of terminals.\n\nBut the string given is a sequence of terminals. So to parse it, each step would involve combining non-terminals from S's productions until only terminals are left, matching the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check each token in the string to see what production it corresponds to and see if it can fit into a larger structure.\n\nLet me list each token with its corresponding non-terminal:\n\nt58 \u2192 NT58\nt38 \u2192 NT38\nt59 \u2192 NT59\nt11 \u2192 NT11\nt59 \u2192 NT59\nt33 \u2192 NT33\nt71 \u2192 NT71\nt27 \u2192 NT27\nt33 \u2192 NT33\nt83 \u2192 NT83\n\nNow, I can try to see if these non-terminals can be connected in the grammar's parse tree.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\nNT31 \u2192 NT38 NT36\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\nWait, that's going into a loop. NT38 is NT28 NT32, and NT32 is NT18 NT2, which can go further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting into too deep here. Perhaps another approach is to see if each token in the string is an atom that can be combined according to the grammar.\n\nWait, another thought: each production in the grammar combines two non-terminals, so the string must be built by combining pairs of non-terminals according to these rules. The given string is a sequence of 10 tokens, so we need to see if it can be broken down into pairs at each level.\n\nStarting from S, which splits into two non-terminals, each of which must be able to produce a substring of the given string.\n\nFor example, the given string is t58 t38 t59 t11 t59 t33 t71 t27 t33 t83.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts, each starting with the first part produced by NT41 and the second by NT23.\n\nBut the problem is, the first part of the string starts with t58, but NT41's expansions don't directly produce t58. Wait, looking at NT41: it's NT34 NT49, so let's see NT34's production.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\nNT31 \u2192 NT38 NT36\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\nWait, NT28 is NT38 NT31, which then goes down to NT18 NT2, which can further break down.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can work through the string and see if it matches any possible combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the entire string can be generated by combining non-terminals step by step.\n\nAnother approach: The string has 10 elements, so the parse tree would have a structure where S splits into two non-terminals, each of which splits further, until we get down to the t's.\n\nLet me try to see what each non-terminal's production could look like.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't58'\n- NT38 \u2192 't38'\n- NT59 \u2192 't59'\n- NT11 \u2192 't11'\n- NT33 \u2192 't33'\n- NT71 \u2192 't71'\n- NT27 \u2192 't27'\n- NT83 \u2192 't83'\n\nSo each of these non-terminals has a direct production to a single terminal. So in the parse tree, these would be leaves.\n\nNow, looking at non-terminal NT58: it's only at the bottom, so the string must somewhere produce NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, there's a 't58' as the first symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-176","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t66 t9 t28 t14 t63 t62 t13 t24 t8 t49\", and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I'll recall that in a CNF grammar, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side (RHS), except possibly the starting symbol which can have a terminal. The grammar provided has all non-terminals on the RHS except for the terminals, which are given as specific strings like 't81', 'nt23', etc. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal (like S, NT27, NT35, etc.) produces two other symbols. Some of these eventually produce terminal strings, which are the 't' followed by numbers. The goal is to parse the given string by following the grammar rules backwards, starting from S and decomposing the string step by step.\n\nThe given string has 10 parts, each separated by spaces: [\"t66\", \"t9\", \"t28\", \"t14\", \"t63\", \"t62\", \"t13\", \"t24\", \"t8\", \"t49\"]. I'll need to see if this string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nI'll start from the beginning of the string because I assume that the start symbol S will eventually derive this string. So the first step is that S must produce the entire string. Let's look at the possible start symbols. In the grammar, S can produce \"NT41 NT23\" or \"NT41 NT58\". So the structure of the string must start with \"NT41 NT23\" or \"NT41 NT58\".\n\nLooking at the string, after S, the first two symbols are \"t66 t9\". Wait, but looking at the grammar, \"NT41\" can produce \"t13 t24\" because the rule is \"NT41 -> t13 t24\". Let me check: Yes, indeed, under the grammar, \"NT41\" has a production \"t13 t24\".\n\nHmm, but the start symbol S can only produce NT41 followed by NT23 or NT58. So the string must start with the symbols coming from NT41 and NT23 or NT58.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the string: The first symbol is \"t66\". So does any of the non-terminals produce \"t66\"? Yes, let's check: in the grammar, I see \"NT30 -> t37\" but wait, maybe that's incorrect. Let me go through the list.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT30, there's a production: \"NT30 -> t37\"? Or wait, looking again, I see \"NT30 -> t37\"? No, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that \"NT30\" has a production \"t37\"? Wait, let me scan each rule:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n- NT30 -> t37\nWait, looking at the last rules I have:\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, I'm looking at the grammar rules provided. Let me go through them line by line.\n\nAt near the end:\n- NT30 -> t37\n- NT36 -> t63\n- NT24 -> t63\n- NT27 -> t9\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT3 -> t64\n- NT30 -> t37\n- NT32 -> t7\n- NT55 -> t65\n- NT24 -> t27\n- NT7 -> t58\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT30 -> t28\n- NT36 -> t54\n- NT23 -> t19\n- NT8 -> t35\n- NT15 -> t59\n- NT28 -> t7\n- NT3 -> t63\n- NT10 -> t28\n- NT31 -> t38\n- NT8 -> t10\n- NT12 -> t8\n- NT59 -> t19\n- NT31 -> t66\n- NT5 -> t66\n- NT32 -> t7\n- NT8 -> t14\n- NT24 -> t63\n- NT27 -> t9\n- NT49 -> t57\n\nWait, so looking for \"t66\": I see \"NT31 -> t38\", \"NT5 -> t66\", and \"NT31 -> t66\". So \"t66\" can be produced by NT31 or NT5.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is \"t66\". To get that, the derivation must be something like NT31 or NT5. But in the grammar, the start symbol S can only directly produce NT41 and NT23 or NT58. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, maybe the string starts with \"t66\" which is generated by NT31 or NT5. But S can't directly produce anything that starts with t66. Therefore, perhaps the initial symbol is S, and S's production must lead to this string through multiple steps. Maybe the string starts with something else, but that can be broken down into the components from the production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and breaking it down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is: t66 t9 t28 t14 t63 t62 t13 t24 t8 t49.\n\nEach symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal or terminal. So we can think of the string as a sequence of symbols, and we need to find if it can be derived from S by successively applying productions.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with t66. The possible rules that produce t66 are:\n\n- NT31 -> t38 \u2192 No, since 38 is different. Wait, no, t38 is produced by NT38, but perhaps I'm mixing up rules. Let's correct that.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce t66:\n\n- NT31 -> t38? No, t38 is for NT38.\nWait, maybe looking for \"t66\":\nLooking through the rules provided:\n\n- NT30 -> t37\n- NT36 -> t63\n- NT24 -> t63\n- NT27 -> t9\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT3 -> t64\n- NT30 -> t37\nWait, no, I think I might have gotten confused with the rules. Let me look through each line:\n\nWait, here's the list:\n\n- NT30 has two production rules:\n   - NT30 -> t37\n   - NT30 -> t37 (Wait, that can't be right? No, looking again: the line says \"NT30 -> t37\", but maybe there's a mistake. Let me count lines accurately.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the rules with their productions:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT41 NT23\nLine 2: S -> NT41 NT58\nLine 3: NT27 -> NT35 NT15\nLine 4: NT38 -> NT28 NT32\nLine 5: NT33 -> NT12 NT49\nLine 6: NT55 -> NT22 NT27\nLine 7: NT12 -> NT32 NT16\nLine 8: NT8 -> NT33 NT3\nLine 9: NT10 -> NT12 NT42\nLine 10: NT18 -> NT38 NT37\nLine 11: NT41 -> NT34 NT49\nLine 12: NT28 -> NT38 NT31\nLine 13: NT43 -> NT16 NT7\nLine 14: NT5 -> NT5 NT43\nLine 15: NT33 -> NT36 NT26\nLine 16: NT15 -> NT31 NT3\nLine 17: NT58 -> NT15 NT24\nLine 18: NT18 -> NT32 NT36\nLine 19: NT22 -> NT52 NT5\nLine 20: NT10 -> NT41 NT5\nLine 21: NT42 -> NT55 NT49\nLine 22: NT42 -> NT8 NT52\nLine 23: NT16 -> 't81'\nLine 24: NT37 -> 't84'\nLine 25: NT23 -> 't83'\nLine 26: NT58 -> 't74'\nLine 27: NT43 -> 't62'\nLine 28: NT36 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t33 t83 t38 t27 t22 t19 t33 t9 t84 t27 t59`. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each rule has either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo, the string must expand from S. Let me see what each component of the string is.\n\nBreaking down the string:\n1. t33\n2. t83\n3. t38\n4. t27\n5. t22\n6. t19\n7. t33\n8. t9\n9. t84\n10. t27\n11. t59\n\nHmm, each of these looks like a terminal symbol. The NT symbols are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, for example:\n- NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n- NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16\n- And many others as well.\n\nThe terminals in the string are t33, t83, t38, etc. I need to check if this string can be formed by expanding from S.\n\nStarting from S, the first production is S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Let's consider that path.\n\nLooking at NT41:\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nSo expanding S \u2192 NT41 NT23 becomes NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 and NT23 \u2192 t83 (since in the grammar, NT23 is a terminal, as per the rule NT23 \u2192 't83').\n\nSo after first step: NT34 NT49 t83.\n\nNow, NT34. Checking the grammar, NT34 \u2192 NT26.\n\nWait, NT34 \u2192 NT26? Let me see. Looking at the grammar, yes, NT34 \u2192 NT26.\n\nSo now, NT34 \u2192 NT26, and NT49. Let me check NT49. Looking through the productions, NT49 \u2192 NT57.\n\nSo NT49 \u2192 NT57.\n\nSo now the string starts as NT26 NT57 t83.\n\nNext, expand NT26. NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. So now, NT15 and NT59.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT66? Wait, in the grammar, looking at NT31, does it produce something? Let me check. Wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see NT31 having a production, but I might have missed it. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, I'm looking through the grammar rules, and under NT24, there's NT24 \u2192 t49, but looking for NT31: I see in the grammar, ND31 is present in NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, but in the production list, I see NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. So NT31 is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking for NT31 productions: Wait, do any non-terminals produce NT31? Let me see through the list. I see NT31 in the production NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. I also see NT31 in NT42 \u2192 NT31 NT55. But do I have any production for NT31 itself?\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see a production where NT31 \u2192 something. So perhaps NT31 is a non-terminal that can only be expanded via its presence in other productions. So maybe it's part of a chain that leads to terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, after NT15, we have t79? No, wait, let me retrace.\n\nActually, the current string is building up from S by expanding NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, then NT34 \u2192 NT26, NT49 \u2192 NT57. So we have NT26 NT57, but NT57 is a terminal because in the production list, I don't see any more non-terminals. Wait, checking NT57: in the grammar, I don't see NT57 as a non-terminal. It must be a terminal because all productions ending with NT57 would have it as a terminal if they don't have other rules. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT58 \u2192 't17', NT43 \u2192 t62, etc. But NT57 is likely a terminal since there\u2019s no production for it.\n\nWait, actually, no, looking back: wait, I'm looking through the productions and see NT45, NT57, etc., but the only production given for NT35 is \u2192 't62'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar more carefully. Let me list out all the non-terminals and terminals.\n\nTerminals are all the 't' followed by numbers, like t33, t83, etc. Non-terminals are the NT followed by numbers, like NT41, NT23, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it contains t33, t83, t38, t27, t22, t19, t33, t9, t84, t27, t59.\n\nWait, I'm seeing t83, which comes from NT23 in the first step because S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT23 \u2192 't83'. So that's correct.\n\nNow, after expanding S \u2192 NT41 NT23 \u2192 NT34 NT49 't83'.\n\nNow, NT34 \u2192 NT26, so it becomes NT26 NT49 't83'.\n\nThen NT49 \u2192 NT57, so NT26 NT57 't83'.\n\nNow, what's NT26? Looking through the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nSo expanding NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, resulting in NT15 NT59 't83'.\n\nNow, NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3.\n\nThen, NT31 is a non-terminal. Now, looking for productions where NT31 appears:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see NT42 \u2192 NT31 NT55, but that's a production, but I don't see NT31 having a production itself. So is there a way to expand NT31?\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed something. Wait, in the grammar, I see that NT31 is present in NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, and also in NT42 \u2192 NT31 NT55. But I don't see NT31 itself being produced; perhaps it's a chain leading to terminals.\n\nSo let's see: NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. Now, NT3: in the grammar, looking for NT3. Oh, I see NT3 is a terminal, as per NT3 \u2192 't63'. So NT3 becomes 't63'.\n\nSo the next part is expanding NT31. What about NT31? Do we have any rules for it? The only rule I see is NT31 appearing in NT15's production. So perhaps we need to find a way to get NT31 to produce a terminal or a combination that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT31 being defined directly. So perhaps I need to look for the chain of NT31 in another production.\n\nWait, in the grammar, another production is NT42 \u2192 NT31 NT55. So if we have NT31, maybe it's part of that production. But without an explicit production for NT31, it's difficult to expand it further. This seems problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and the string should be built in a different way. Maybe starting with S \u2192 NT41 NT58 instead of NT41 NT23.\n\nWait, let me see: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nExpanding NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and NT58 \u2192 't17' (since in grammar, NT58 \u2192 't17'). So the string starts with NT34 NT49 't17'.\n\nThen, NT34 \u2192 NT26, NT49 \u2192 NT57, so we have NT26 NT57 't17'.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, so NT15 NT59 't17'.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. Then NT3 \u2192 't63'.\n\nSo now,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-197","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t71 t65 t81 t28 t66 t28 t57 t28 t37 t84 t19` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule has either two terminals and nothing else, or two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar provided, it has a bunch of rules. Some like S -> NT41 NT42, which are non-terminals on both sides. The right-hand side of all these rules are combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, actually, some of the rules have terminals as parts. For example, S -> NT41 NT41, but some also have terminals like 't71'. So I think the grammar has some terminals mixed into the right-hand sides, but since it's in CNF, each production should have at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or two terminals and maybe a non-terminal on the left? Or am I mixing things up.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, I might have some productions that are like A -> aB, B -> bC, etc., but in this case, it seems that many rules have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, like NT27 -> NT35 NT15, which is two non-terminals, that fits. But others like S -> NT41 NT41, which are both non-terminals, that's fine.\n\nBut looking closer, some rules do have terminals on the right-hand side. Like NT58 -> NT15 NT24, but then there's a rule NT27 -> NT58 NT27, or wait, no. Wait, NT58 leads to NT15 NT24. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Or maybe some rules have mixed terminals and non-terminals on the right. But that wouldn't fit the standard CNF, which allows only terminals and non-terminals, but in the standard definition, all productions are either replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or replacing it with a terminal.\n\nWait, the user provided some rules like S -> NT41 NT41, others like S -> NT41 NT42, but also rules that have terminals, like NT27 -> NT58 NT27, which I think is a mistake in transcription because it's repeating NT27. Maybe that's a typo, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps some rules have a mix of non-terminals and terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Each rule's right-hand side should either be two non-terminals, or a single terminal, but in this grammar, it looks like all the RHSs are either two non-terminals or a mix, but that's not possible because in CNF, the RHS must be terminals or two non-terminals. So maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nBut the important thing is, for the string given, I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar, starting from S. The string is `t71 t65 t81 t28 t66 t28 t57 t28 t37 t84 t19`. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can ignore the non-terminal rules in the production except when they directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, the right-hand sides should either have two non-terminals or a terminal. But in the given grammar, looking at the rules, some have two non-terminals, others have mixed. For example, NT58 -> NT15 NT24 is fine, but some have more than two, like NT28 -> NT18 NT2, which is two non-terminals, that's okay. Wait, let's check a few rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- S -> NT41 NT42 (two non-terminals)\n- S -> NT41 NT58 (two non-terminals)\n- NT27 -> NT35 NT15 (two)\n- NT38 -> NT28 NT32 (two)\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49 (two)\n- NT55 -> NT22 NT27 (two)\n- NT12 -> NT32 NT16 (two)\n- NT8 -> NT33 NT3 (two)\n- NT10 -> NT12 NT42 (two)\n- NT18 -> NT38 NT37 (two)\n- NT41 -> NT34 NT49 (two)\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT31 (two)\n- NT43 -> NT16 NT7 (two)\n- NT5 -> NT5 NT43 (two)\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26 (two)\n- NT15 -> NT31 NT3 (two)\n- NT58 -> NT15 NT24 (two)\n- NT18 -> NT32 NT36 (two)\n- NT22 -> NT52 NT5 (two)\n- NT10 -> NT41 NT5 (two)\n- NT42 -> NT55 NT49 (two)\n- NT24 -> NT23 NT28 (two)\n- NT28 -> NT18 NT2 (two)\n- NT52 -> NT12 NT37 (two)\n- NT26 -> NT15 NT59 (two)\n- NT52 -> NT30 NT49 (two)\n- NT37 -> NT58 NT32 (two)\n- NT37 -> NT41 NT10 (two)\n- NT42 -> NT8 NT52 (two)\n- NT42 -> NT31 NT55 (two)\n- NT16 -> 't81' (terminal)\n- NT37 -> 't84' (terminal)\n- NT23 -> 't83' (terminal)\n- NT58 -> 't17' (terminal)\n- NT43 -> 't62' (terminal)\n- NT36 -> 't9' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't26' (terminal)\n- NT36 -> 't22' (terminal)\n- NT24 -> 't49' (terminal)\n- NT58 -> 't74' (terminal)\n- NT3 -> 't64' (terminal)\n- NT30 -> 't37' (terminal)\n- NT32 -> 't24' (terminal)\n- NT55 -> 't65' (terminal)\n- NT24 -> 't33' (terminal)\n- NT2 -> 't33' (terminal)\n- NT15 -> 't71' (terminal)\n- NT34 -> 't26' (terminal)\n- NT35 -> 't62' (terminal)\n- NT36 -> 't63' (terminal)\n- NT42 -> 't11' (terminal)\n- NT24 -> 't27' (terminal)\n- NT7 -> 't58' (terminal)\n- NT41 -> 't13' (terminal)\n- NT30 -> 't24' (terminal)\n- NT36 -> 't54' (terminal)\n- NT23 -> 't19' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't35' (terminal)\n- NT15 -> 't59' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't7' (terminal)\n- NT3 -> 't63' (terminal)\n- NT10 -> 't28' (terminal)\n- NT31 -> 't38' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't14' (terminal)\n- NT24 -> 't63' (terminal)\n- NT27 -> 't9' (terminal)\n- NT49 -> 't57' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't63' (terminal)\n- NT27 -> 't9' (terminal), but already listed.\nWait, no. Looking at NT27, some rules have NT27 in the RHS, but in reality, in CNF, each production must have terminals in their RHS if any. So perhaps this grammar is such that it's possible to have terminals on either side, but I might need to track whether the RHS has any terminals beyond certain points.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string from the end backwards using a top-down approach or a recursive descent approach.\n\nSo, the string is: t71 t65 t81 t28 t66 t28 t57 t28 t37 t84 t19.\n\nI know that each terminal in the string must match a terminal production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string contains a sequence of terminal symbols, and my goal is to see if there's a way to parse them according to the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the grammar productions to get a clear picture. Each non-terminal can expand into two other non-terminals, except for those that directly turn into terminal symbols. For instance, S production is S -> NT41 NT23, which is a sequence of two non-terminals. \n\nI'll start by looking at the string and see if I can find matching productions. The string's length is 12, so it's a fairly long string to parse. Let's see what the last symbol is.

Let me approach this more systematically.\n\nI'll start by building a parsing tree from the bottom up. The string has tokens in the order: t65, t26, t11, t24, t54, t59, t22, t64, t11, t81, t19, t38.\n\nLooking at the first token, t65, I see in the grammar that NT55 -> NT22 NT27, and also NT5 -> NT5 NT43.

Actually, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals expand into terminal symbols. Let me list all the terminal productions:\n\n- S: NT41 NT23\n- NT58: t17\n- NT43: t62\n- NT36: t26, t22, t63\n- NT28: t26, t24\n- NT38: t35, t37\n- NT7: t58 (wait, that's NC)\nWait, no, the grammar has S, NT41, etc., but some of them directly go to terminals.

The grammar includes:\n\nNT55 -> NT22 NT27\n\nNT22 -> NT52 NT5\n\nNT52 appears in two places: NT24-> NT52 NT5 and NT26->t15, etc.\n\nWait, looking for t65:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice NT55 is in one place: NT55 -> NT22 NT27. But then inside that, NT22 and NT27 will be expanded further. Alternatively, is there any NT that directly maps to t65?\n\nLooking through, I don't see an NT that directly expands to t65. Wait, no\u2014the list provided doesn't have t65 except in NT55: NT55->t65. Wait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, here's what's present:\n\nNT55 -> NT22 NT27\n\nWait, but when I look through, I don't see any NTs that directly expand into 't65' except maybe NT5 because NT5->t66, but that's a cycle. Alternatively, maybe NT55 leads to t65 via some path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong in earlier steps. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT55 -> NT22 NT27\n\n- NT22 -> NT52 NT5\n\n- NT52 appears in: NT24 -> NT52 NT5, and also NT52->NT12 NT37, and another NT52->NT30 NT49.\n\nWait, but in the list provided by the user, in the grammar:\n\nLet's parse through the grammar:\n\nStart from the highest level, S: S->NT41 NT23\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nNT49 -> t57\n\nSo, S expands to NT41 NT23, which leads to NT34 NT49 (t57) and NT23 (t83). So S produces t57 t83, but wait, no: Wait, S->NT41 NT23; NT41 ->NT34 NT49; NT34->t26; NT49->t57. So NT41 expands to t26 t57; and NT23 is t83. So the production would be t26 t57 t83, but that seems off. Hmm.\n\nBut let's get back to the string. The string starts with t65, which is a terminal symbol in the grammar. Hmm, but I don't see any non-terms that directly expand into t65. Wait, wait, let me check the full list of grammar productions for terminals:\n\nLooking through all NT -> rules and checking terminal symbols:\n\n- NT58->t17\n\n- NT28->t26\n\n- NT36->t26, t22, t63\n\n- NT24->t49\n\n- NT58->t74\n\n- NT3->t64\n\n- NT30->t37\n\n- NT32->t24\n\n- NT55->t65\n\n- NT27->t7\n\n- NT8->t35\n\n- NT18->t38\n\nWait, there is an NT55: NT55->t65. That's it. So, the only non-terminal that directly expands into 't65' is NT55.\n\nSo, the first token in our string is t65. That means whatever the derivation is, it must at some point produce 't65' via NT55 -> t65. Therefore, the string must have a production that starts with NT55. But NT55 expands into two non-terminals, so in the parsing process, we'd have to split into NT55, but then we have to parse the string as two parts after that.\n\nWait, the string is `t65 t26 t11 t24 t54 t59 t22 t64 t11 t81 t19 t38`.

The grammar provided is in CNF, which simplifies the analysis.\n\nThe approach is to use a parsing strategy. Since CNF grammars can be parsed with the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose. Let me first list all the terminals and non-terminals.\n\nTerminals (leaf nodes in the grammar) are:\nt26, t14, t17, t27, t35, t9, t7, t71, t37, t84, etc. Specifically, looking at the string, the terminals present are:\n- t26\n- t14\n- t17\n- t27\n- t35\n- t9\n- t7\n- t71\n- t37\n- t84\n\nNon-terminals (internal nodes) are the NTs like NT27, NT35, etc. \n\nThe string has 12 tokens, so I'll represent it as s: [t26, t14, t17, t27, t35, t14, t9, 35, 7, 71, 37, 84]. Wait, let me check the exact order.\n\nWait, the string is `t26 t14 t17 t27 t35 t14 t9 t35 t7 t71 t37 t84`. So the order is:\n\n1. t26\n2. t14\n3. t17\n4. t27\n5. t35\n6. t14\n7. t9\n8. t35\n9. t7\n10. t71\n11. t37\n11. t37\n12. t84? Wait, wait, looking back: 12th is t84. Wait, the string has 12 tokens, so positions 1-12.\n\nNow, in the CYK algorithm, each step involves checking for possible non-terminals that can derive consecutive substrings of the string. For each possible substring, we check all productions to see if the non-terminal can produce that substring.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to first list all possible non-terminals and see if they can reduce the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that each production either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. Since the string has 12 terminals, the parse tree will have a height of at least 2. Let me try to find a possible reduction.\n\nLooking for the beginning of the string, which starts with t26. Looking at the productions, the only production that directly produces t26 is NT26. Wait, but in the given grammar, do we have any NT that produces t26? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules: \n\nLooking for 't26' in the productions:\n\nI see:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31\n\nNT24 -> NT23 NT28\n\nNT28 -> NT18 NT2\n\nNT24 -> NT38 NT31\n\nWait, I also see:\n\nNT24 -> 't49'\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me look again. The productions are listed as:\n\nLooking for 't26':\n\nI see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't49'\n\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n\nAh, there's NT28 \u2192 t26. So t26 is produced by NT28. So the first symbol must come from NT28.\n\nSimilarly, the last symbol is t84. Looking for productions that produce t84:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT5 -> t66, and some others. Wait, no. Let me look for any NT that directly produces 't84'.\n\nLooking: \n\nYes, NT37 -> t84.\n\nSo the last symbol is from NT37.\n\nSo, at the top level, the start symbol is S, which can be derived as S->NT41 NT23.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar's productions are S-> NT41 NT23 and S-> NT41 NT58.\n\nSo the string starts with t26, which comes from NT28, but S doesn't directly produce NT28. So perhaps the entire string is derived by some chain of productions starting from S.\n\nThis might get complicated, so perhaps I should construct a table for the CYK algorithm.\n\nThe CYK algorithm processes the string in a dynamic programming table, where table[i,j] represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring s[i..j].\n\nFirst, index the string from 0 to 11.\n\nLet me list the string:\n\nPositions 0: t26\n1: t14\n2: t17\n3: t27\n4: t35\n5: t14\n6: t9\n7: t35\n8: t7\n9: t71\n10: t37\n11: t84\n\nStep 1: Initialize the table for single-character substrings.\n\nFor each character at position i, if there is a production rule where a non-terminal directly produces s[i], then add that non-terminal to table[i,i].\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t26 \u2192 so table[0,0] = {NT28}\n- t14 is produced by NT8 \u2192 check if any NT8 \u2192 but looking at the productions, I don't see NT8 as a production, but wait: looking at the productions, there's a production NT8 \u2192 't35'. So no, NT8 doesn't produce t14. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals that have productions:\n\n- t26 is produced by NT28\n- t14 is produced by NT8 (NT8 \u2192 't35' \u2014 no, so perhaps an error here). Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, searching for 't14' as a terminal production.\n\nLooking through the list: \n\nI see NT5 -> t66, which is not helpful.

Checking:\n\nLooking for 't14' in productions:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't15' (so not NT58 \u2192 t14). \n\nWait, maybe I should re-examine all productions.\n\nLet me go through each production and note which ones produce terminals:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't26' \u2192 so NT28 \u2192 t26 (so t26 is derived from NT28, so NT28 is a candidate for s[0], and t26 is at 0.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t14:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't33' (from the list: 't33' is a terminal from NT8?)\n\nWait, wait, actually, in the productions, some non-terminals produce terminals. So I need to find which non-terminals directly produce any of the terminals in our string.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't26' (so produces t26)\n- NT3 \u2192 't64'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT8 \u2192 't33'\n- NT14 \u2192 t8? Let's check:\n\nWait, no, looking into each production:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see several productions like NT28 \u2192 t26, NT14 \u2192 t33, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to create a list.\n\nLet me list all the production rules that produce terminals:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-234","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is `t54 t57 t26 t14 t54 t35 t8 t83 t63 t35 t57 t9 t62`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze and sometimes perform parsing.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, all the production rules indeed fit the CNF structure. Each rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side. This might mean that the ParseTree would have a binary structure, but since some symbols are terminals, we can work backward by repeatedly applying the inverse of these productions.\n\nThe string given is composed of several terminal symbols, each in a specific order. To check if the string is in the language, I'll attempt to construct a derivation starting from the start symbol S, applying productions that match the string.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step. I'll consider each terminal symbol in the string and see if I can find corresponding non-terminal productions that can generate it.\n\nStarting from the end of the string might be helpful because some rules have terminals as their right-hand sides. Looking at the end symbols:\n\n- The last symbol is t62. Checking the grammar, I see NT43 -> t62. So, I can set up a production where a rule produces t62 as the last step.\n\nBut perhaps working from the start symbol S is a better approach. The start symbol is S, and the first production is S \u2192 NT41 NT23. That means the string must start with the first part generated by NT41 and end with NT23.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't54', which is a terminal. Let's check what NT54 can produce. Looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT54. Hmm, wait, no, in the grammar, most non-terminals produce two parts. Wait, actually, looking at the given grammar, I don't see any rule for NT54 or NT57. Wait, that can't be right because the string contains 't54' and 't57'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The grammar provided includes rules like:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\nNT3 \u2192 't64'\n...\nWait, in the full list, are there NT54 or NT57? Hmm, reviewing the grammar, I don't see any production rules for NT54 or NT57. So, that's a problem because 't54' and 't57' appear multiple times in the string. If NT54 doesn't exist, then 't54' cannot be generated by the grammar, meaning the string is not acceptable.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me check again. For NT5, it's NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43. For NT41, it's NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. For NT34, it's NT34 \u2192 t26. So NT41 can produce t26 and t49. Similarly, NT49 \u2192 t57. So, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 can potentially produce terms that include t26 and t57.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a 't54' as the first symbol. So, I need to see if any of the non-terminals can produce 't54'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT54 or NT59 or anything that leads to 't54'. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT58 produces NT15 NT24, and NT24 produces 't49' among other things, but none of them lead to 't54'.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again to see if I missed any NF for NT54 or NT57.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't22' and 't63'\n- NT37 \u2192 't58' and 't32'\n- NT41 \u2192 't26' and 't49'\n- NT26 \u2192 't15' and 't59'\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me go through the rules systematically.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't58' (t58)\n- NT37 \u2192 't32' (t32)\n- NT58 \u2192 't15' (t15) and 't24' (t24)\n- NT3 \u2192 't64'\n- NT6 \u2192 probably not in the list since NT3 is separate.\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking for NT54 production.\n\nWait, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So, NT58 is a non-terminal for 't15' (from NT58 \u2192 't15') and 't24' (from NT24 \u2192 't26', but that's for another non-terminal). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The user provided the grammar with all these rules, but I should note that some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT58 \u2192 't15' and 't24'. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't64', NT7 \u2192 't58', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note which non-terminals produce specific terminals.\n\nLet me make a list of non-terminals and their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't64'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT41 \u2192 't26' and 't49'\n- NT26 \u2192 't15' and 't59'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't22' and 't63'\n- NT37 \u2192 't58' and 't32'\n- NT42 \u2192 't11' and others. Wait, NT42 \u2192 't8' or 't35'? Looking back: NT42 \u2192 't8' is one production, but no, looking at the grammar: NT42 \u2192 't8'? Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar rules, for example:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't49'\n- NT36 \u2192 't22' and 't63'\n- NT37 \u2192 't58' and 't32'\n- NT41 \u2192 't26' and 't49'\n- NT26 \u2192 't15' and 't59'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't22' and 't63'\n- NT37 \u2192 't58' and 't32'\n- NT42 \u2192 't11' (maybe, let me check)\nWait, wait, let me check NT42's productions: NT42 \u2192 't8' or 't35'? Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't8' is one of the productions, but also NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT49.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a better approach. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step in the derivation can only replace a single non-terminal with two others or with a terminal. But since the grammar uses only binary productions, it's a bit tricky. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So any production that has two terminals would require a previous step to have a non-terminal that produces those two terminals, which is not possible because in CNF, non-terminals can only produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for example, a production like A \u2192 a is allowed, but a production like A \u2192 a b where a and b are terminals is not allowed in CNF because they would require A to produce two terminals, which would have to be handled as a single step, which is not allowed in CNF.\n\nWait, so in the given grammar, are there any rules that produce two terminals? For example, does any non-terminal produce two terminals in one step? For example, if there's a rule like NT34 \u2192 't26' 't26', that would be allowed in CNF because A \u2192 BC is allowed with B being t26 and C being t26.

{"custom_id":"request-235","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t49 t28 t38 t59 t38 t17 t24 t74 t10 t17 t27 t58 t14`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF has production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal. This structure makes it easier to analyze and sometimes perform certain parsing algorithms like CYK.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it's indeed in CNF because each rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal, except for the right-hand sides that have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, actually, in some cases, the RHS might have two non-terminals, so that's consistent with CNF.\n\nNow, the string consists of a sequence of terminals: `t49 t28 t38 t59 t38 t17 t24 t74 t10 t17 t27 t58 t14`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol in the grammar. So, my goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol 'S' by applying the productions step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can think about this as a series of productions where each non-terminal in the string can split into two smaller parts, and so on, until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the string from the beginning:\n\n1. The string starts with `t49`. Looking at the productions, which have 't49' as a result. Scanning through the rules, I see NT24 -> 't49' and also NT36->'t49'. So, 't49' can be either NT24 or NT36.\n\n2. Next is `t28`. Looking for productions where the RHS is 't28', I see NT28->'t26' and 't28'. Wait, actually, NT28's productions are `NT28 -> NT18 NT2` and `NT28 -> NT38 NT31`. So, 't28' doesn't directly appear as a terminal here. Wait, let me check again. Oh, looking at the grammar rules, I see NT28 has two productions: NT28 -> NT38 NT31 and NT28 -> NT18 NT2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, another rule: NT28 -> 't28'? No, looking again, the provided rules only have 't28' in the RHS if I look. Wait, let me check the rules again carefully.\n\nWait, looking back: For NT28's productions:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31\nNT28 -> NT18 NT2\nAlso, looking for any other NT28 productions. Wait, no, perhaps I missed something. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT31\n- NT28 -> NT18 NT2\n- Also, in another part, NT38 -> NT28 NT31. Wait, that's a production from NT38.\n\nSo, no, 't28' isn't directly a terminal from NT28. Hmm, that's confusing because the string has 't28' as the second symbol. Maybe I'm misremembering. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar rules, the only place where 't28' is directly a terminal is in NT24->'t49' and other places. Wait, no, looking more carefully, the grammar has:\n\nNT24 -> 't49'\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31\nNT28 -> NT18 NT2\nWait, another rule: NT28 -> 't28'? No, no. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT24->'t49'\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see that NT24 is defined as `NT24 -> 't49'` (line... let me count the number of rules provided). The grammar starts with S->NT41 NT23 and so on.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that 't28' is present in the RHS of NT24: line, for example, `NT24 -> 't49'`. Wait, let's find 't28' in the RHS.\n\nWait, no, according to the given grammar, 't28' is a terminal only in a specific production. Let me check all rules for where the RHS is a terminal:\n\nLooking through each line, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't58'\n- NT41 -> 't13'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT3 -> 't64'\n- NT55 -> 't65'\n- NT36 -> 't26'\n- NT24 -> 't26' (line ...)\nWait, so 't28' is in NT35's production: looking at the first set of rules, I don't see 't28' until later. Let's list the rules where RHS is a terminal:\n\nLine 19: NT18->'t35'\nLine 31: NT42->'t11' (Wait no, line 31 is NT42->'t11'? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't58'\n- NT41 -> 't13'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT3 -> 't64'\n- NT55 -> 't65'\n- NT36 -> 't26'\n- NT24 -> 't26' (line ...)\n- NT28 -> 't74' (line: NT7 -> 't58', then later lines: NT24 is at line... Maybe I'm mixing up the lines.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the terminal productions. Let me go through each rule and check if RHS is a terminal:\n\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-259","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of t-terms, and each non-terminal in the grammar can eventually resolve to one of these t-terms. The grammar is quite extensive, with many production rules, so I need a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I'm given is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string must correspond to a single non-terminal production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly map to a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So S must produce t64 and t26 because NT41 is mapped to t13 and NT23 to t26. Wait, no, the grammar has S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which would correspond to t13 t26. Similarly, S \u2192 NT41 NT58 would be t13 t74. But wait, no, let's check the mappings again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals map directly to a terminal. For example, NT41 \u2192 t13, NT23 \u2192 t26, NT35 \u2192 t62, NT58 \u2192 t74, etc. So each production in the grammar eventually terminates when a non-terminal leads to a terminal.\n\nTo check if the string `t10 t13 t38 t59 t49 t38 t71 t83 t74 t19 t26 t74 t74 t13` is generated, I can try to parse it step by step.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parse reduces the number of symbols by replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until the terminals are reached. Since this is a top-down approach, I can try to construct a parse tree where each step combines two non-terminals or matches a terminal.\n\nBut since the string is a linear sequence, another way is to look for sequences in the string that correspond to the right-hand side of some production. For example, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. But in the given string, all tokens are terminals, so each must be the result of a production that directly maps to a terminal.\n\nWait, no. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols generated by the grammar. So the entire string must be a series of terminals that result from expanding the start symbol S step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me start by considering the entire string as a sequence of terminals. Let's list them: t10, t13, t38, t59, t49, t38, t71, t83, t74, t19, t26, t74, t74, t13.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S, which is a non-terminal, and the string is made of terminals, we need to see if S can generate this string through a series of expansions.\n\nI need to consider if the string corresponds to the production of S in the grammar. Looking back at the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo let's analyze the first option, S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41 is a non-terminal that must produce a terminal. From the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t13.\n\nNT23 \u2192 t26.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the string would be t13 t26. But the first two tokens in our string are t10 t13, which don't match.\n\nAlternatively, the second production S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 \u2192 t13, NT58 \u2192 t74.\n\nSo the string would start with t13 t74, but the first token is t10, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that suggests that neither of the direct S productions start with t10. Therefore, perhaps the string is not generated by the grammar because S's first productions don't match the string's start. But maybe I'm missing something\u2014the string might be derived through more expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is generated indirectly. Let me try to see if the entire string can be a result of a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nThe string starts with t10. So perhaps one of the non-terminals, after expansions, starts with t10. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that map to t10 directly. For example, looking through the mappings, I see NT8 \u2192 t35, NT12 \u2192 t8, NT15 \u2192 t71, etc., but none of them directly map to t10. So I need to find if any non-terminal can derive to t10.\n\nWait, looking again, NT10 \u2192 t28, which is t74? No, wait, each non-terminal may map to a terminal. Let's check the mappings:\n\nLooking through the mappings, I see:\n\nNT10 \u2192 t28\n\nWait, no, let's check each line.\n\nWait, the mappings are in the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT58 \u2192 t15 NT24 \u2192 t28, etc. Wait, each line in the grammar is a production, either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nSo NT58 is either replaced by something on the left. Wait, no, actually, each line is the production for that non-terminal on the left. For example, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 and NT24 \u2192 't26' for example. Wait, no, that can't be right because a production rule can't have a mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, I must have misunderstood. Wait, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in the given grammar, each non-terminal (like S, NT41, etc.) has a production that's either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, let me try to parse this correctly. Each line is a production. So for example, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So NT58 can be replaced by NT15 and NT24. Then, each of those can be further expanded.\n\nLooking for where a non-terminal maps to a terminal: for instance, NT23 \u2192 't26', so NT23 expands to t26. Similarly, NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, but since both are non-terminals, that would require expanding further.\n\nSo, to find if the string can be generated, I need to see if the entire string can be produced by a sequence of derivations starting from S.\n\nGiven that S has two productions: NT41 NT23 and NT41 NT58, and each of those non-terminals expand further.\n\nLet's take the first production: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41 \u2192 t13, NT23 \u2192 t26. So the string must start with t13 t26, but the input string starts with t10 t13... So that doesn't match.\n\nNext, second production: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 \u2192 t13, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24.\n\nThen, NT58 would expand to NT15 and NT24, each of which are further expanded.\n\nNT15 \u2192 t71, NT24 \u2192 t26. So S \u2192 t13 t71 t26 ...? But in the string, after t13 comes t38, not t71.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me clarify the structure of the grammar. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (terminal). So in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- S has two productions: both start with NT41, leading to different non-terminals. Neither of these directly match the string's first token, t10.\n\nWait, maybe the string is part of a longer sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built by a series of non-terminals, each expanding into other non-terminals until terminals are reached. So the string is the terminal sequence resulting from such expansions.\n\nLet me try to think of each terminal in the string as being produced by a series of non-terminals. So, t10 is produced by some non-terminal A1, t13 by A2, etc.\n\nTo see if the string is in the language, each terminal must correspond to a production chain that eventually reduces to the string from S.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a linear string, perhaps we can parse it from the end, trying to see if the last token corresponds to a production that can generate it.\n\nLooking at the last token, t13. From the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t13, so t13 can be derived from NT41.\n\nSo the last token, t13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-255","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string \"t58 t58 t14 t64 t9 t35 t38 t83 t7 t64 t13 t24 t57 t38\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and I see that S has two productions: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So the string must start with either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Since the first token in the string is t58, which corresponds to NT58 \u2192 t58, that means the first part of the string must have used the second production of S, S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo the string starts with NT58, which gives t58. The next step is to see what comes after that. The grammar's NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So after t58, we should have NT15 and NT24. The next tokens in the string are t14 and t24, respectively. Wait, but t15 isn't directly a terminal. Let me check: NT15 has a production NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, and then NT31 \u2192 NT66 NT5, and NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string manually by splitting it into parts according to the grammar. Let's list the tokens again: t58, t58, t14, t64, t9, t35, t38, t83, t7, t64, t13, t24, t57, t38.\n\nWait, that's 14 tokens. Since each production (except the terminal ones) introduces two non-terminals, the number of tokens should be 2^n where n is the number of splits. Let's see: The string has 14 tokens, which is not a power of two. Hmm, that's suspicious because typically a binary tree in a CNF grammar would result in 2^n tokens. Maybe that indicates it's not possible, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the count: t58, t58, t14, t64, t9, t35, t38, t83, t7, t64, t13, t24, t57, t38. Yep, 14 tokens, which is not a power of two, so perhaps it's not possible. Wait, no\u2014actually, the grammar might have overlapping or different structures, so maybe it's not just a straightforward binary tree. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible if some rules produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, let's consider what each rule produces. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Then each NT has rules that eventually produce terminals. So the string must be a combination of these rules, possibly with some non-terminals. But the string is entirely consisting of terminals, which suggests that every non-terminal must have been resolved into a terminal before.\n\nBut the count issue: If the string is supposed to be fully parsed, it should have a length that's one more than a power of two, perhaps. Let me think in terms of the number of productions. Each S production splits into two NTs. Each NT can split further into two more NTs, continuing until we reach leaves that are terminals. So the total number of tokens should be 2^k -1 for some k, but 14 isn't like that. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows multiple splits and merges, but in this case, it's a context-free grammar, so it's a tree structure, not allowing for multiple parents.\n\nWait, perhaps when you parse the string using the grammar, you'll end up with a parse tree where each non-terminal leads to two terminals, except for the last non-terminal. But in this case, the string has an even number of tokens, which might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look at the string again: \"t58 t58 t14 t64 t9 t35 t38 t83 t7 t64 t13 t24 t57 t38\". The first t58 comes from NT58. Now, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So after t58, the next tokens would be derived from NT15 and NT24.\n\nLooking at NT15: it's NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, then NT31 \u2192 NT66 NT5, and NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7. Wait, NT16 \u2192 't81', and NT7 \u2192 't58'. So from NT5, we have t58, and then NT43 would be 't16' (t16) and 't7' (t58), so the string after t58 would be t58, t16, t58.\n\nWait, but the given string has after the first t58: t58, t14, t64,... Hmm, that doesn't align. Maybe I'm getting lost in the parse tree. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows certain sequences to be built, and the string is possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to match the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t58 t58 t14 t64 t9 t35 t38 t83 t7 t64 t13 t24 t57 t38\n\nThe first two tokens are t58 and t58. From S \u2192 NT58 (since the first token is t58), which is NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24.\n\nNow, the next tokens should be the expansion of NT15 and NT24. Let's look at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, then NT31 \u2192 NT66 NT5, and NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7. So NT5 would first produce two more non-terminals, but then NT43 would split into NT16 and NT7, which are terminals (t16 and t58). Hmm, not directly matching the second t58.\n\nWait, the second t58 after the first would be t58, then the next token t14, then t64. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I should consider if each non-terminal in the string can be derived by the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, the grammar has S \u2192 NT58 (as the first production for S). So the first token must be NT58, which is t58. The next is t58 again, so that's the second symbol. Now, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So after t58, there must come NT15 and NT24. The next two tokens should be the expansions of NT15 and NT24.\n\nLooking at the string: after t58, next are t58, t14, t64, etc. Wait, no\u2014the first token after the initial t58 is t58 again. So maybe the expansion is such that one of the non-terminals in NT15 or NT24 can produce another t58.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all possible NTs and their terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many NTs are assigned to terminals. For example:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84' and 't64'.\nNT22 \u2192 't8', 't52', etc.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't58': NT58 \u2192 t58, so that's one way.\n\nLooking for 't14': according to the grammar, NT14 is not defined, but wait, wait\u2014NT14 is produced by NT28 via NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31. Wait, but let's check each NT to see which produce which terminals.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nLooking through the grammar, many NTs resolve to terminals:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t58\n- NT7 \u2192 t58\n- NT3 \u2192 t63?\nWait, no: Looking again:\n\nIn the terminal productions:\n\nNT58 \u2192 t58\nNT7 \u2192 t58\nNT36 \u2192 t63? Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, the provided grammar is a bit complex. Let me parse it again:\n\nLooking for all NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23 | NT41 NT58\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-277","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is \"t65 t38 t54 t49 t62 t38 t66 t35 t37 t8 t17 t7 t81 t62 t74\". I'm a bit rusty on parsing algorithms, especially since it's CNF, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. This structure often makes parsers like the CYK algorithm efficient, but I'm not sure how to apply that here. Maybe I can try a top-down approach by checking which symbols can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and from the grammar, S can produce two options: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So the initial string should be derived from one of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol after each 't' is either a two-digit number or sometimes single digits like 't7' or 't8'. So the first symbol in the string is 't65', which I need to see if it can be generated by any of the productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions either produce terminals or combine two non-terminals. So for example, NT41 can produce NT34 NT49, which eventually can produce 't64' as seen in the rules. So, to break it down, the string must be generated by a series of substitutions where each step follows one of the production rules.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the first symbol. The string starts with 't65', which is the result of NT41 \u2192 't64' according to the rules. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 't62' is a production. Wait, no, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT41 \u2192 't13' and NT41 \u2192 't62'. Oh, no, actually, I think I might have misread. Wait, no, the rules for NT41 are: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then NT34 \u2192 't26', and NT49 \u2192 't57'. So 't26' and 't57' would produce a substring when combined. But when I look at the string, the first two substrings are 't65' and 't38', which don't match the first symbols of any productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the symbols in the string and see what they correspond to:\n\nThe string is: 't65', 't38', 't54', 't49', 't62', 't38', 't66', 't35', 't37', 't8', 't17', 't7', 't81', 't62', 't74'.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, each terminal is either a single character like 't' followed by a number. So I need to match the string to the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking for the first symbol 't65', checking the grammar rules. Is there any production that produces 't65'? Let me scan the rules. Yes, NT42 \u2192 't33' and 't55' based on different productions. Wait, looking for 't65'\u2014I see NT55 \u2192 't65' in the rules: NT55 \u2192 't65'. So NT55 can directly produce 't65'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar provided, under NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27. Hmm, okay, so that's a production from NT55 to two non-terminals. So how do these non-terminals expand? Let's see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT55 NT5 (from the grammar), and NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 't62' and NT36 \u2192 't9' (I think). Wait, maybe it's better to trace the derivation.\n\nBut maybe a top-down approach would be better, starting from S and seeing if I can derive the string. Let's start with S. S has two productions: S can be NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nLet's try the first option: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41's productions are NT34 NT49. Let's see what those can produce. NT34 \u2192 't26' and NT49 \u2192 't57'. So NT41 can produce 't26 t57'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't65', which doesn't match 't26' or 't57'. So that path might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S production uses another option. Wait, does S have another production? No, it only has the two I listed.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in looking up the productions. Let me check again. NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and NT34 \u2192 't26', NT49 \u2192 't57' so 't26 t57' is the result of this.\n\nWait, but our string starts with 't65', which isn't part of that. So maybe the initial S uses the other production: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 as before can produce 't26 t57', and NT58 \u2192 't15' and 'something' from NT58? Wait, no, NT58's productions are: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, because looking at the grammar, under NT58: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So NT58 then produces NT15 and NT24.\n\nLooking at NT15's productions: NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3 and NT15 \u2192 't71'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3 and NT15 \u2192 NT59.\n\nWait, let me check again. The rules for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3 and NT15 \u2192 't71'? Or perhaps other expressions. Wait, no, in the given grammar, under NT15, it says \"NT15 -> NT31 NT3\", but I think the given grammar has other rules. Wait, perhaps I need to list all the rules properly.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Maybe a better approach is to note that the string starts with 't65', which comes from NT55's production if NT55 is allowed. But earlier, I thought NT55 \u2192 't65'. Let's confirm: looking through the rules, yes, there's a rule NT55 \u2192 't65'. So if we can get from S \u2192 NT55... but wait, S's productions don't produce NT55 directly. S's productions are NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nWait, so if S can't reach NT55 directly, perhaps we need to look elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking about how S can generate the string. Let me think again.\n\nWait, S can only directly become NT41 followed by another NT. So the first two symbols in the string would have to correspond to the two symbols produced by NT41 and NT23, for example.\n\nBut the first symbol is 't65', so perhaps that's the result of NT55, but how do we get from S to NT55? Since S can be NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58, and neither of those are NT55. So maybe NT55 is produced by one of the non-terminals that NT41 or NT41's productions reach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than two symbols, so maybe I should parse it step by step.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Perhaps the entire string can be broken down into pairs of symbols that correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t65 t38 t54 t49 t62 t38 t66 t35 t37 t8 t17 t7 t81 t62 t74\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, meaning that the parse is a series of steps where each non-terminal can be replaced by a terminal or two non-terminals. Since the start is S, which can go to either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58, each of those can split further.\n\nSo let me see: the first pair would be t65 and t38. Where do these come from? Let's check for any productions that produce 't65' and 't38' as the result of a non-terminal."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. However, looking at the rules, I notice some have only one non-terminal, like S -> NT41 NT23. Wait, in CNF, every production should have exactly two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but in the given grammar, all productions except the start symbol S \u2192 NT41 NT23 are of the form A \u2192 BC. However, for S, it's S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which is two non-terminals. So the start symbol production is more than one non-terminal, but I thought all productions except start should be two non-terminals. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nIn CNF, the general form is S \u2192 a or S \u2192 A B, where A and B are non-terminals. Other non-terminals can also produce two non-terminals. So maybe the given grammar is still in CNF.\n\nNext, the string provided is `t83 t7 t26 t28 t63 t63 t81 t74 t11 t14 t81 t81 t14 t64 t38`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding according to the grammar rules.\n\nSince the string has a series of tokens starting with t, I think the non-terminals in the grammar eventually derive into these 't' tokens. So each rule chain should collapse into the 't's in the string.\n\nTo approach this, I'll try to parse the string from the beginning, looking for possible derivations. Alternatively, since it's a CNF grammar, perhaps I can use the parsing algorithm for CNF, such as the recursive descent parser or the CYK algorithm, but I might not need to implement it, just look for possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work backwards, starting from the symbols that can directly derive to 't's.\n\nLet me look at the production rules and see which non-terminals directly result in 't's.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't58' \u2192 Not relevant.\nWait, the rules for 't' tokens are:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't66' Wait, no.\n\nWait, looking at the given rules, the right-hand sides that produce 't's are:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't63'\n- NT30 \u2192 't37' Hmm, but I see other 't's like 't83', 't7', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the direct derivations of 't's from non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, for each rule:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't62' \u2192 So NT43 can derive to 't62'.\n- NT36 \u2192 't63' \u2192 So NT36 can derive to 't63'.\n- NT23 \u2192 't83' \u2192 Yes, NT23 \u2192 't83'.\n- NT58 \u2192 't74' \u2192 So NT58 \u2192 't74'.\n- NT41 \u2192 't13' \u2192 So NT41 \u2192 't13'.\n- NT35 \u2192 't62' \u2192 Hmm, but looking back, maybe I should compile a list.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each rule and see which ones terminate into 't's.\n\nLet me list all rules and their RHS:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-299","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t62 t83 t14 t8 t22 t22 t58 t37 t33 t11 t19 t37 t63 t57 t57 t71`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right. The start symbol is S, and the terminals are the tokens like 't62', 't83', etc., which are words we're looking for in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S branches into two NTs: NT41 NT23 and NT41 NT58. So whatever is generated must start with the non-terminals NT41 followed by either NT23 or NT58.\n\nLet's see what each of these expand to. NT23 is a terminal 't83', and NT58 is 't17'. The string starts with 't62', which must come from one of the NTs in the production.\n\nWait, no. The string starts with 't62', but the first productions are S -> NT41 NT23 or S -> NT41 NT58. So the first step would be to decompose S into NT41 and either NT23 (t83) or NT58 (t17). But the string starts with t62, which might come from a deeper expansion.\n\nLet me try to map how the string could be derived. Each token in the string must be either a terminal produced directly or generated by a subtree that eventually turns into that terminal.\n\nSo the string is 17 tokens long. Let's try to see if they can be matched starting from S. \n\nStarting with S, which produces NT41 followed by another NT (either NT23 or NT58). Let's say we pick NT58 first because the second part might come later.\n\nNT58 is 't17', which is not in our string, so that might not fit. Let's try the other option: NT23, which is 't83'. So the first token would be t83, but our string starts with t62. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper. Let me see if any of the non-terminals expand into t62 and also chain back into the starting symbols.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice NT41: it becomes t62. So t62 is directly generated by NT41. That means in the string, whenever there's a t62, it must come from NT41.\n\nNow, looking back at S's productions, the first part is NT41, which can be t62, and the second part could be NT23 or NT58. Since our string starts with t62, the second part of S would be NT23, which is t83. So the first two tokens in the string should be t62 followed by t83. But the string is t62 t83 t14..., which fits this part.\n\nOkay, so the first two tokens are t62 and t83. Now, let's see what comes next. After t62 and t83, we have t14, t8, t22, etc. \n\nAfter NT23 (t83), we have to follow the rules of NT23. Wait, looking at the grammar, none of the productions seem to start with NT23 as a left-hand side. Instead, each production is of the form X -> A B. Let me check: NT23. Hmm, looking through all the productions, I don't see NT23 on the left-hand side anywhere except S. So NT23 is a terminal, right? Because in Chomsky Normal Form, any terminal is a leaf, so NT23 can't be a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Actually, NT23 is a non-terminal unless it's specified as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT23 is listed as a terminal on the right-hand side (e.g., NT23 -> 't83'), but as a non-terminal, does any production expand into it?\n\nLooking through, I don't see any production where NT23 is on the left. So NT23 must be a terminal. That makes sense because it's written as 't83'. So S expands to NT41 (t62) and NT23 (t83). So the first two tokens are okay.\n\nNow, the next token after t62 and t83 is t14. But NT23 is a terminal, so after that, we need to see what NT41 can produce. Wait, S -> NT41 NT23, so after S is processed as t62 t83, then whatever comes after that would come from S's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me structure this properly.\n\n1. Start with S, which can be NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let's pick NT41 NT23 first, as it's the first option.\n\n2. NT41 becomes t62, and NT23 becomes t83, so the first two tokens are t62 t83. The string is t62 t83 t14 t8..., so now we're at t14. \n\n3. After t62 t83, what comes next? Since these are terminals, they can't be expanded further (unless they are non-terminals, but they are terminals as they are in quotes). So the expansion after t62 t83 would have to be part of a larger structure. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the expansion. Each step expands the entire S into NT41 and NT23. But in the string, after t62 and t83, it continues with t14, which might mean that there's more to the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed from multiple productions. Let me try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t62 t83 t14 t8 t22 t22 t58 t37 t33 t11 t19 t37 t63 t57 t57 t71.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- The first two tokens are t62 (NT41) and t83 (NT23), so that fits the first S production.\n\n- Now, the remaining tokens after t62 t83 are t14 t8 t22 t22 t58 t37 t33 t11 t19 t37 t63 t57 t57 t71.\n\n- After t62 t83, the next part would need to come from some rule that starts with the next non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see if the next part of the string can be generated by another expansion starting from S or from some other NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the initial t62 t83, the rest is generated from another instance of S or from the second part of S's productions.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the entire string can be generated by the grammar, but it's a bit complicated. Let's try to find the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from S, we can write down the possible expansions step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to check the number of symbols. The start symbol is S, which on expansion can generate other non-terminals, and terminals. Each expansion increases the number of symbols by one since each non-terminal becomes two symbols. Wait, actually, each non-terminal production replaces one symbol with two, so each expansion step either keeps the number of symbols the same (if a non-terminal is used) or increases it (if a terminal is used). Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is 17 symbols, and the grammar is context-free, perhaps a way to approach this is to see if the string can be split into substrings that match the productions.\n\nBut maybe I can look for certain terms that are only produced by specific non-terminals. For example, t62 is only produced by NT41.\n\nSo in the string, the t62 must come from NT41, and then whatever precedes it comes from the other part of S.\n\nWait, but in the initial expansion, S is NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So after t62 comes t83 (from NT23), and then the rest. Alternatively, perhaps the string is longer and multiple productions happen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the presence of NT41 and NT23 in the string, or other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's try to parse the string step by step, starting from S.\n\n1. S -> NT41 NT23. So t62 t83.\n\n2. Now, we need to see if the remaining tokens can be generated from the two parts of S, which are NT41 and NT23, but those are terminals now, so we're stuck"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar, I see that `NT8` can produce `t14`, and `S` can produce non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLet me write down each production rule and see where the terminals in the string come from.\n\nThe string has the following terminals: t14, t81, t63, t63, t71, t37, t38, t9, t66, t38, t10, t57, t49, t57, t8, t14.\n\nI'll try to find a derivation starting with S and see if it can produce this string.\n\nFirst, S can produce two options:\n1. NT41 NT23\n2. NT41 NT58\n\nSince the string starts with t14, let's check what NT8 can produce to get t14. Looking at the grammar, NT8 \u2192 t33 NT3. Hmm, that might not be directly helpful. Wait, no\u2014I need to find where t14 comes from. Checking further, NT8 \u2192 t14 is a direct production. Wait, actually looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t33 NT3 is not direct. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\nNT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\nNT3 \u2192 t64\nSo NT33 can be further broken down.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Let's consider the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the non-terminals of the grammar.\n\nThe string is: [t14, t81, t63, t63, t71, t37, t38, t9, t66, t38, t10, t57, t49, t57, t8, t14]\n\nI think the string is meant to be a linear sequence of symbols, so each element is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, the productions are all non-terminals producing terminals or non-terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals that must be produced by some non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nGiven that, I'll start by trying to match from the start symbol S and see if it can derive this string.\n\nS starts with NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let's try the first option: NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41 can produce t13, as per the grammar: NT41 \u2192 t13. So the first part is t13.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t14, not t13. Hmm, that's a problem. So if S starts with NT41 NT23, NT41 would produce t13, but the string starts with t14. So this can't be a valid path.\n\nTherefore, the other option for S is NT41 NT58.\n\nAgain, NT41 \u2192 t13. So again, the string starts with t14, not t13. That's a conflict. So this is confusing because both options for S produce t13 as the first terminal symbol, but our string starts with t14.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the grammar allows for longer sequences where non-terminals can be further expanded into terminals and non-terminals. Perhaps the string is generated through a sequence of non-adjacent terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check the grammar rules again carefully.\n\nLooking at NT8: NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3. Then, NT3 is 't64', so expanding NT33 could eventually lead to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to build the parse tree. Let me try to match the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: [t14, t81, t63, t63, t71, t37, t38, t9, t66, t38, t10, t57, t49, t57, t8, t14]\n\nI think each element is a token, so the string is a sequence of 16 tokens. Let's start with the first token, t14.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t14 is produced by NT8 \u2192 t14, correct? So the first step is probably NT8 \u2192 t14.\n\nWait, but if NT8 is the start? No, the start is S, which expands into NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Neither of these directly produce t14.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t14 is from a deeper expansion. Let me check all the productions to see which non-terminals can produce 't14'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t64\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT41 \u2192 t13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n- NT33 can eventually produce a terminal like t5 or t66, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see which non-terminals can produce 't14'.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any rule that produces 't14' directly except perhaps NT8, but NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3. So maybe the first t14 is from a deeper expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire string as a series of symbols that must be generated by expanding the non-terminals step by step. Let me attempt a recursive descent approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if the entire string is a possible derivation starting from S. Let's see.\n\nGiven that both expansions of S start with NT41, but NT41 produces t13, but our string starts with t14, so that's a contradiction. So according to this, it's impossible for S to generate the given string because S's first expansion leads to t13, which doesn't match the string starting with t14.\n\nWait, but maybe the initial S expansion doesn't produce t14 directly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then NT41 produces t13, and NT23 produces t83.\n\nSo the two non-terminals would produce t13 and t83. So the first two symbols would be t13 t83.\n\nBut our string starts with t14 t81 t63... So that's a problem.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT41 NT58, then NT41 produces t13, and NT58 produces t17 and NT24.\n\nWait, looking at NT58: the grammar doesn't have a rule for NT58 except for NT58 \u2192 t17, but wait no, checking again:\n\nLooking for NT58 in the rules: yes, NT58 \u2192 t15 NT24 and NT58 \u2192 t74.\n\nSo NT58 can be t15 NT24 or t74.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT41 NT58, then NT58 could produce t15 NT24 or t74.\n\nIf it's t15 NT24, then the first two symbols would be t13 (from NT41) and t15 (from NT58). Then, NT24 can produce 't26' or more non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t14, so that's still a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, if NT58 produces t74, that would give t74, which is a terminal, but the string starts with t14.\n\nThus, in both cases, S's first expansion leads to a terminal that doesn't match the string's first token.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is t14, but all possible expansions of S start with either t13 or another different terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string is longer, and the initial S expansion is via multiple steps, leading to the t14 later in the string. Let me think about this.\n\nWait, the string has 16 tokens, so it's long. Maybe the initial S expansion leads to a more complex structure that eventually produces t14.\n\nBut even if that's the case, each production step in the grammar can only generate a single terminal at a time, but given that S starts with NT41 NT23 or similar, and both NT41 and NT23 produce t13 or t83, the very first"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or terminals. So, I'll look at the grammar provided and make sure it's in CNF. Scanning through, I see things like S -> NT41 NT23, which is okay, both are non-terminals. Then I spot some productions like NT41 -> NT34 NT49. All of these seem to fit the CNF structure.\n\nNext, I need to understand each production. I'll list them out:\n\n- S breaks down into combinations of NT41 and NT23, NT41 and NT58, etc.\n- Each NT production is either a pair of NTs or sometimes a terminal. For example, NT23 -> 't83', which is a terminal, so that's an atom.\n- Others, like NT12 -> NT32 NT16, are non-terminals. So each NT corresponds to a specific string of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string I have is a series of 't' followed by numbers, each separated by spaces. The 't' probably stands for terminals, so each token is a production outcome. My goal is to see if this string can be derived step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nSo, I'll note that the grammar is for languages over the alphabet derived from 't' followed by numbers. The string has 17 tokens, which must form the end-converted form of the sentential form starting from S.\n\nLet me think about how the string starts. The first token is t28. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT28 can produce NT38 NT31 or NT28 NT31, but wait, no, more accurately, NT28 can produce NT38 NT31, NT28 NT31, etc. Wait, looking back: NT28 appears here: NT28 -> NT38 NT31 and also NT28 -> NT18 NT36, and another occurrence: NT28 -> NT18 NT2, but let me get the exact rules.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the productions for NT28 are:\n\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT31\n- NT28 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT28 -> NT18 NT2\n\nWait no, in the given grammar, let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT28's rules:\n\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT31\n- NT28 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT28 -> NT18 NT2\n\nWait, actually, looking at the entire list, I might have misread. Let me try again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT31\n- NT28 -> NT49 NT2\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see NT24 -> NT27 NT28, and other rules. Wait, perhaps I should list all NT28's rules.\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n1. NT41 -> NT34 NT49 (okay)\n2. NT28 -> NT18 NT2 (wait that can't be right because NT18 is not defined yet.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to follow CNF, with all \u2192 rules having two non-terminals or terminals on the right side.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if each of these terminals can be derived through the grammar's rules. To do this, I need to look for a way to parse the string from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nStarting with S, the grammar has two initial productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo, from S, the first step is to choose one of these or the other. Let's first explore the first option: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nLooking at NT41 and NT23, each of these must be expanded into their respective right-hand sides. The productions for NT41 and NT23 are given as:\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nWait, but 't83' is a terminal, so NT23 directly expands to 't83'. That means the first part of the string after S is 't83'. Let me check the string: the third token is 't27', so NT23 would only match the third token if the string were 't83 ...', but in our case, it's 't33 t27...'. That's a problem because the first production of S (S \u2192 NT41 NT23) would lead to 't83' as the first terminal, but our string starts with 't33'.\n\nHmm, maybe S \u2192 NT41 NT23 isn't the right path. Let's try the second option: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nNow, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 and NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So, NT41 expands to NT34 NT49, which in turn need to be further expanded. Similarly, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. Let's look at NT15 and NT24.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, and NT24 \u2192 NT38 NT35. Let's write this out step by step:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT2\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59 \u2192 NT31 NT3 NT59\nNT59 \u2192 NT19 NT7 \u2192 NT19 is 't19' and NT7 \u2192 't58'\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Maybe instead of expanding step by step, I should look for the entire string and see if it fits any possible derivation.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. To generate a string, the parser must follow the production rules such that each part is generated correctly. Since each production either continues expanding non-terminals or terminates with a terminal, I need to see if the string can be constructed by these rules.\n\nLet me list out the entire string:\n\nt33, t27, t27, t24, t64, t14, t26, t35, t10, t38, t59, t11, t17, t19, t33, t8, t65.\n\nI notice that some of the tokens are terminals that are directly produced by non-terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't64', NT7 \u2192 't58', etc. So, I need to find parts of the string that correspond to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is 't65', which comes from NT55 \u2192 't65'. So, the last part of the string must come from NT55 expanding to 't65', which is the terminal. Before that, the previous token is 't58', which comes from NT43 \u2192 't62' or wait, looking back, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the token before 't65' is 't11', which is from NT11 \u2192 't11' (but looking at the grammar rules, I don't see NT11 \u2192 't11'. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has rules ending with 't...' for various NT. For example, NT43 \u2192 't62', NT7 \u2192 't58', NT18 \u2192 't33' etc. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't36' and 't33', etc. But where is 't11' coming from? Let me check each NT:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly expanding to 't11'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for 't11', I see NT28 \u2192 't7', but that's 't28'? No, in the grammar, the rule is NT24 \u2192 't33', etc. Wait, let me check the rules carefully.\n\nLooking again, in the grammar, the rules ending with 't' are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't66'\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\nNT41 \u2192 't63'\nNT18 \u2192 't33'\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\nNT36 \u2192 't63'\nNT37 \u2192 't58' and 't10'\nNT42 \u2192 't11'\nWait, yes! NT42 \u2192 't11'. So, NT42 expands to 't11', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, 't11' must come from NT42 \u2192 't11'. Now, let's look at the part of the string before 't11': ... t59, t11, t17, t19, t33, t8, t65.\n\nWait, that's not correct. The string is in order:\n\n... t38, t59, t11, t17, t19, t33, t8, t65.\n\nSo, before 't11', we have 't59', which is from NT59 \u2192 't19', and 't59' is followed by 't11'. \n\nWait, let me re-express the string in order:\n\n1. t33\n2. t27\n3. t27\n4. t24\n5. t64\n6. t14\n7. t26\n8. t35\n9. t10\n10. t38\n11. t59\n12. t11\n13. t17\n14. t19\n15. t33\n16. t8\n17. t65\n\nSo, looking at token 12: 't59' comes from NT59 \u2192 't19' or 't59' itself is a terminal in another rule. Wait, no, NT31 \u2192 't38', NT33 \u2192 't36', etc., but looking at NT59, does it have a production to 't19'? Let me check the grammar:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, NT59 has a rule NT59 \u2192 NT31 NT55, and also NT59 \u2192 NT36 NT19 (I think I might have missed this earlier). Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, under NT31: NT31 \u2192 't38' and NT55 \u2192 't65'. Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT31 NT55?\n\nWait, checking the provided grammar lines:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't38'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't65'\n\nBut for NT59, I don't see a direct production. Wait, looking through the entire grammar list:\n\nI see:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't63'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't58' and 't10'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't9'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-343","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string provided is a sequence of symbols, with some being terminals ('t' followed by numbers) and others non-terminals. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should remember what a context-free grammar in CNF looks like. CNF requires each production rule to be either a single non-terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols on the left and right sides. Wait, no, correct, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So every production has either one terminal or two non-terminals on the left, leading to two symbols on the right. However, the given grammar seems to have some rules where a non-terminal produces another non-terminal and then a terminal, like S \u2192 NT41 NT41. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So S produces two NTs. Then each NT seems to produce other NTs or a terminal. So each production is either two symbols (both non-terminals) or one symbol (a terminal).\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, S is on the left, and it's producing two symbols (NT41 and NT23, etc.). Each NT is a non-terminal. So each production is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT (like NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15) or NT \u2192 a (like NT7 \u2192 't58'). Oh, right, so each rule is either NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 a. That fits CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t49 t58 t17 t24 t49 t27 t11 t74 t8 t58 t57 t71 t65 t27 t24 t71 t59 t17`.\n\nI see that the string starts with 't49', which is a terminal, and ends with 't59' and 't17'. Since the grammar starts with S, which splits into two NTs, each of which can only produce two NTs or terminals. So the parsing of the string should start from the root S and split into two parts, each of which must generate the corresponding part of the string.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so the string must start with NT41 and then NT23. Let me look at the string again: it starts with t49, but NT41 would produce t13 (from NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and then NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49, and NT26 is a terminal t26?), wait no, looking at the rules: looking for where NT41 is.\n\nLooking through the rules: I see NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 (from the given rules). Then NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. Then NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, but wait in the rules, NT26 is not present. Let me check: actually, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT28 NT26 (but in the given list, it's written as NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2, so maybe I'm mislooking. Wait, in the given grammar, under NT36, it says NT36 \u2192 NT28 NT26. So that would be NT36 \u2192 NT28 NT26. Then, I check the rules for NT28 and NT26.\n\nWait, actually, this could get complicated. Perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, the string is: `t49 t58 t17 t24 t49 t27 t11 t74 t8 t58 t57 t71 t65 t27 t24 t71 t59 t17`.\n\nSince S produces NT41 and NT23, the string should be split into two parts: one generated by NT41 and the other by NT23.\n\nWait no, actually, in a derivation, the start symbol S splits into the two parts, and the string should be generated by combining the first part from the left NT41 and the second part from NT23. So the entire string must be an interleaving of the expansions of NT41 and NT23.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so each step of the expansion would produce tokens starting with NT41 and then NT23. So the parsing process would be such that each non-terminal is expanded on the left or the right, but since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps the leftmost non-terminal is expanded first.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the parse tree. Let me see. The root is S, which splits into NT41 and NT23. So the string after S would be the concatenation of the expansion of NT41 and the expansion of NT23. So the string must be a sequence where the first part is generated by NT41 and the second part by NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t49. From the rules, let's see:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 (from the given rules). Then NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. Now, looking for NT26. Wait, in the given list, under NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. So NT26 \u2192 t15 t59. Let's check that.\n\nSo, starting from NT41:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n\nBut NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3 (from rules). Then NT31 is a rule: NT31 \u2192 t38 or other? Wait, the given rules for NT31: NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT32. Then NT38 and NT32: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31, which loops back. Wait, maybe we're getting into a loop here, which would not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to see if the string is a result of the productions starting from S, expanding leftmost.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the first step is to process NT41 and NT23 as the first two symbols. So in the string, the first two symbols should be the expansion of NT41 and NT23. But the string starts with t49, which would have to come from NT41, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing. Let's see.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt49, t58, t17, t24, t49, t27, t11, t74, t8, t58, t57, t71, t65, t27, t24, t71, t59, t17\n\nSince S splits into NT41 and NT23, the entire string must be generated by expanding NT41 and NT23, concatenated together.\n\nSo, the first part of the string would be the expansion of NT41, and the second part would be the expansion of NT23.\n\nSo let's start by processing NT41 and NT23 from the string.\n\nFirst, processing NT41:\n\nFrom the rules, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nSo NT41 expands into NT34 followed by NT49.\n\nThen, each of these can further expand.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49.\n\nThen NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nWait, checking the rules: NT26 isn't present. Looking back, I see that under NT26, in the given rules, it's written as NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nSo yes, NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nThen NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. But wait, NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT32. Then NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31, which would loop. Or, in the given rules, NT15 \u2192 t71, according to the given grammar.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIn the given grammar, looking for NT15: yes, NT15 \u2192 't71'.\n\nSo, that simplifies things. So starting from NT15, it produces t71 directly.\n\nSo putting it back:\n\nNT15 \u2192t71\n\nThen NT26 becomes NT15 NT59 \u2192 t71 t59.\n\nWait, but when NT26 expands, it's producing NT15 and NT59. NT15 \u2192 t71, and NT59? Let's see.\n\nIn the given grammar, looking for NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-334","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, I can see that the starting step is S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the string must start with whatever NT41 and NT23 produce.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't38 t27 t17 t74 t27 t10 t63 t81 t65 t14 t10 t28 t8 t66 t14 t65 t33 t19'. I need to parse this to see if each non-terminal can be expanded into the corresponding terminals.\n\nLet's start by splitting the string into individual tokens separated by spaces. The tokens are:\n\nt38, t27, t17, t74, t27, t10, t63, t81, t65, t14, t10, t28, t8, t66, t14, t65, t33, t19.\n\nNow, the start symbol S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the first two tokens should come from NT41 and NT23. Let's check:\n\n- First token is t38, which is the terminal from NT41's production. Let me check NT41's productions. Looking through the grammar, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So NT41 is a non-terminal that must be expanded into NT34 and NT49. The first token in the string is t38, which is not directly NT34 or NT49. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps each production chain should fully expand into terminals without non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string backward, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can try to construct a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if the entire string can be derived from S by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet's see: The entire string is quite long, so it's a combination of several steps. Maybe breaking it down into parts would help.\n\nLooking at the first part: t38 t27 t17 t74 t27 t10...\n\nI know that NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So the first token t38 should come from NT34 or NT49. But looking at the grammar, NT34 \u2192 t26 and NT49 \u2192 t57. So if NT34 is t26, that doesn't match t38. Hmm, this might be a problem because t38 is the token, and it's supposed to be the terminal from NT41's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Wait, in the grammar, there's a production NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and NT34 \u2192 t26. So to produce t38, there must be a different production for NT41 that leads to t38. But from the grammar, I don't see that. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, except for the terminals like 't81', each non-terminal appears to have productions that result in other non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16, which then might lead to 't8' or other tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I should construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me attempt that. Start with S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the string starts with the expansion of NT41 and NT23. Let's denote these as branches.\n\nSo, for NT41: It can go to NT34 NT49. Let's check NT34: NT34 \u2192 t26. So the first token in the string is t38, which is not t26. That's a conflict. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me check the NT41 production again. In the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nAnd NT34 \u2192 t26\n\nNT49 \u2192 t57.\n\nSo, if NT41's production is this, then NT41 can only produce t26 and t57 in the immediate steps. But in the string, the first token is t38, which is not t26 or t57. Therefore, this seems impossible, which would mean the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check carefully. Could there be another production for NT41 that I'm missing? Scanning through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT41, the only production is NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should be t26 and t57 in sequence, but the first token is t38, which is different.\n\nWait, unless the parser is doing something else. Let me think: Is the string \"t38 t27...\" perhaps beginning with NT27's expansion? Because NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, and NT35 \u2192 t62, NT15 \u2192 t71, for example. Hmm, but the first token is t38, so NT27 wouldn't give t38.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first tokens are part of a different expansion. Let me try to see what NT27's possible expansions can yield.\n\nWait, but NT27 is one of the non-terminals. Its productions are:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n\nSo, NT27 expands into NT35 and NT15. The tokens following are t38, t27, etc. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the string can be partitioned into segments that correspond to each production.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt38 t27 t17 t74 t27 t10 t63 t81 t65 t14 t10 t28 t8 t66 t14 t65 t33 t19.\n\nThat's 17 tokens. The grammar S \u2192 NT41 NT23 would generate two immediate tokens. Let's see if the string starts with two tokens from NT41 and NT23.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which are two non-terminals.

So the first token t38 doesn't match NT41's any terminal production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the starting symbols produce more than one token in some way. Or maybe I'm missing another production for NT41. Let me check again: looking through the provided grammar, I don't see any other production for NT41 except NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So the first token should be either NT34 or NT49, but NT34 \u2192 t26 and NT49 \u2192 t57, neither of which is t38. Therefore, the first token t38 is incompatible with NT41, meaning that S cannot start the derivation with this string. Therefore, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't38', which cannot be generated by the production of NT41 in the grammar. \n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-354","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a set of production rules starting from the start symbol S. Each non-terminal can be rewritten as a combination of two other non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals are specific strings that directly appear in the productions, like 't83', 't84', and so on. The non-terminals are NT followed by numbers, and some have further productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t83 t83 t84 t11 t57 t27 t71 t81 t81 t54 t83 t38 t74 t9 t66 t71 t66 t63 t59.\n\nMy approach is to build a parse tree from the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a), I can use a top-down or bottom-up parsing method. However, since the string is quite long, I'll try to identify segments of the string that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me break down the string into smaller segments that might correspond to the non-terminals. I'll start by looking for known terminals and see if they match any production rules.\n\n1. Looking for 't83': The production NT23 \u2192 't83' is in the grammar. So 't83' can be derived from NT23. Similarly, other 't's can be traced back to their respective non-terminals.\n\n2. Let's write down all the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals they are from:\n   - t83 comes from NT23\n   - t83 again from NT23\n   - t84 from NT27\n   - t11 from NT42\n   - t57 from NT49\n   - t27 from NT7\n   - t71 from NT15\n   - t81 from NT10 or NT32\n   - t54 from NT27\n   - t83 from NT23\n   - t38 from NT18\n   - t74 from NT58\n   - t9 from NT28\n   - t66 from NT41\n   - t71 from NT15\n   - t66 from NT31 or NT5\n   - t63 from NT42\n   - t59 from NT12\n\nNow, I'll try to construct a parse tree from the root S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can be derived from two productions:\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nLet's choose the first production: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nWe'll parse the first two parts: NT41 and NT23 each should generate a part of the string.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So the first part, NT41, can be broken down further.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49? Let me check the grammar. Yes, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. But wait, looking back, the grammar for NT34 is not exactly that. Wait, no, let's check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT34: According to the grammar provided, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49? No, let's search the grammar for NT34.\n\nAh, here's NT34: NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, no, let me check the provided grammar.\n\nWait, scrolling through, I see:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49? No, let me find:\n\nWait, in the given productions, I spot:\nNT34 -> NT26 NT49.\n\nYes, so NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, right?\n\nWait, in the grammar: NT26 -> NT15 NT59.\n\nSo, breaking it down further:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nThen NT15 can be broken down, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me try to map the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t83 t83 t84 t11 t57 t27 t71 t81 t81 t54 t83 t38 t74 t9 t66 t71 t66 t63 t59.\n\nFirst, the first t83 comes from NT23, so let's see what's around NT23.\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83', so that's the end of that part.\n\nThen the next t83 is again from NT23. So we're using NT23 twice here.\n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so after NT23, we have NT41.\n\nWait, no, starting with S, we choose S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the string starts with the expansion of NT41, followed by NT23.\n\nSo first, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nThen, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49.\n\nThen, NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nContinuing, NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3.\n\nThen, NT31 can be either 't71' directly (from NT7 \u2192 't71' or NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT36, etc., but in the string, we have t71 once after NT31. Let me check: The string after t27 is t71, which is at position 6: t71.\n\nWait, let me structure this better.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: [t83, t83, t84, t11, t57, t27, t71, t81, t81, t54, t83, t38, t74, t9, t66, t71, t66, t63, t59]\n\nI'll try to match from the start.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo, first, we'll parse t83 and the other parts. Wait, no, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which is two non-terminals. So the string must start with the expansion of NT41 followed by the expansion of NT23.\n\nBut in the string, the first two parts are both t83, which is from NT23. So S \u2192 NT41 NT23 can't be matched because the first part would require NT41 to generate something, but here we have two t83s without anything in between.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe S can be divided into either S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Let me check.\n\nYes, S can be either. So perhaps I should pick S \u2192 NT41 NT58 instead.\n\nLooking at the string, the first three symbols are t83, t83, t84. So maybe the first part is NT23 generating t83, but then the next symbols would need to be generated by NT41 and so on. Alternatively, maybe the string starts with NT58, but the first symbol is t83, which is from NT23, not NT58.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, S can be NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let me try S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo the string starts with t83 (NT23), but according to this split, after S, we have NT41 and NT58.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with the expansion of NT58.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first term is t83, which comes from NT23. But in the split S \u2192 NT41 NT58, the first part is NT41, which would come before NT58. But in the string, the first term is t83, which is from NT23, which isn't part of S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So perhaps S must be split as NT41 NT23.\n\nSo starting with NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the string should start with the expansion of NT41, followed by NT23.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSo, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nThen, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49.\n\nThen, NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nThen, NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3.\n\nBut in the string, the next is t84, which comes from NT27. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps it's better to represent the string as a series of terminals and try to see if they can be generated by the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to count the number of times each non-terminal appears.\n\nWait, the string has:\n\nt"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-357","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t37 t71 t24 t81 t26 t22 t84 t84 t62 t66 t64 t11 t62 t59 t7 t27 t66 t74 t59`.\n\nFirst, let's recall what Chomsky Normal Form is. CNF defines a CFG where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. This format makes it easier to parse and analyze the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions conform to CNF. Each non-terminal (S, NT27, NT38, etc.) produces either two other non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT37 \u2192 't84'. So each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of terminals: `t37 t71 t24 t81 t26 t22 t84 t84 t62 t66 t64 t11 t62 t59 t7 t27 t66 t74 t59`. Each word is a terminal symbol, and each step in the derivation must consume two symbols at a time, except when a production directly outputs a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, when a production is A \u2192 BC, it means that during derivation, A can be replaced by BC. So in the string, the symbols are a sequence of terminals that must be generated by the grammar. The number of symbols in the string should be of the form 2^n + k where n is the number of productions used, but it's more about how the terminals are connected through the productions.\n\nEach production that replaces a non-terminal with a terminal contributes one symbol to the string. A production that replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals would need to generate a tree that eventually resolves those non-terminals into symbols, so the string length must be a result of the branching.\n\nThe string has 19 symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree is a binary tree, and the number of terminal symbols must be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of non-terminals. Wait, no, that's the total number of leaves in the tree, but the tree's depth is n. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nLet me think about how the string is built. Each symbol in the string corresponds to either a direct production of a terminal or part of a two-step production where another non-terminal must be resolved first.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree for the given string, ensuring that each branch in the tree corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the productions and see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nWait, another approach is to simulate the parsing process. Start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string symbol by symbol.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't37'. According to the grammar, 't37' is produced by NT37 \u2192 't84'? Wait, no, looking at the productions, 't37' is actually produced by NT58 \u2192 't17' and other productions, but wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, looking at the productions: I see that 't37' is actually in NT7 \u2192 't58'? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, for NT37: I see\n\n- NT37 -> 't84'? Wait, no. Let me scan through all the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT37 has:\n\n- NT37 -> 't84', which is correct.\n\nWait, the string starts with t37, so that must come from a production that has 't37' as the RHS. Looking at NT37, it's directly producing 't84'. Wait, but the string starts with 't37', not 't84', so that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check all the productions for terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, let me list all non-terminals that produce terminals.\n\nNT58 \u2192 't17': yes.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't58'.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals and their sources:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27 \u2192 and so on. Maybe I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps a different approach: for each terminal in the string, check if it's produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each terminal in the string:\n\nt37, t71, t24, t81, t26, t22, t84, t84, t62, t66, t64, t11, t62, t59, t7, t27, t66, t74, t59.\n\nNow, let's see if each terminal has a production that can produce it:\n\nt71: Looking at the productions, is there a non-terminal that produces 't71'?

{"custom_id":"request-380","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and the grammar structure.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows me to apply algorithms like CYK or to construct a parse tree.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that all the non-terminals on the left side (like S, NT27, etc.) expand into two non-terminals on the right. Each production is either a combination of two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t57 t26 t54 t35 t28 t9 t10 t58 t24 t63 t28 t13 t71 t81 t19 t66 t33 t84 t54 t35`.\n\nI notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The non-terminals are things like S, NT27, etc.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can represent it as a set of productions where each non-terminal can produce exactly two others. My goal is to see if the string can be broken down step by step according to these rules.\n\nI should probably start by trying to parse the string from the beginning, splitting it into the required components according to the grammar.\n\nBut this might get complicated, so perhaps I can look for the top-level productions and see how they might split the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Let's see what S can produce:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo S splits into two non-terminals: NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t57, which corresponds to NT30 in the grammar because NT30 \u2192 t57. Wait, but let me check the productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the terminals are on the right side of the productions. So for example, NT30 \u2192 t57. So t57 must come from NT30. Let me look for the productions of NT30.\n\nLooking back, I see NT30 \u2192 t37 and also NT30 \u2192t30. Wait, no, let me check again:\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT30 \u2192 t37\n\nand\n\nNT30 \u2192 t24 (from NT24->t24), but that's not NT30. Wait, looking through the list:\n\nNT30: 't37', 't37' again (duplicate?), and another 't37' but I'm not seeing it. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the productions for NT30:\n\nLooking at the list, I find:\n\nNT30 \u2192 t37 and another production? No, it only has one production: NT30 \u2192 t37. So earlier I thought I might have misread, but it's only NT30 \u2192 t37.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as:\n\nS->NT41 NT23\n\nS->NT41 NT58\n\nNT27-> NT35 NT15\n\nNT38-> NT28 NT32\n\nNT33->NT12 NT49\n\nNT55->NT22 NT27\n\nNT12->NT32 NT16\n\nNT8->NT33 NT3\n\nNT10->NT12 NT42\n\nNT18->NT38 NT37\n\nNT41->NT34 NT49\n\nNT28->NT38 NT31\n\nNT43->NT16 NT7\n\nNT5 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT33->NT36 NT26\n\nNT15->NT31 NT3\n\nNT58->NT15 NT24\n\nNT18->NT32 NT36\n\nNT22->NT52 NT5\n\nNT10->NT41 NT5\n\nNT42->NT55 NT49\n\nNT24->NT23 NT28\n\nNT28->NT18 NT2\n\nNT52->NT12 NT37\n\nNT26->NT15 NT59\n\nNT52->NT30 NT49\n\nNT37->NT58 NT32\n\nNT37->NT41 NT10\n\nNT42->NT8 NT52\n\nNT42->NT31 NT55\n\nNT16->t81\n\nNT37->t64\n\nNT23->t19\n\nNT58->t74\n\nNT3->t64\n\nNT30->t37\n\nNT32->t7\n\nNT55->t65\n\nNT24->t33\n\nNT2->t33\n\nNT15->t71\n\nNT34->t26\n\nNT35->t62\n\nNT36->t63\n\nNT42->t11\n\nNT24->t27\n\nNT7->t58\n\nNT41->t13\n\nNT30->t28\n\nNT36->t54\n\nNT23->t19\n\nNT8->t35\n\nNT15->t59\n\nNT28->t7\n\nNT3->t63\n\nNT10->t28\n\nNT31->t38\n\nNT8->t10\n\nNT12->t8\n\nNT59->t19\n\nNT31->t66\n\nNT5->t66\n\nNT32->t7\n\nNT8->t14\n\nNT24->t63\n\nNT27->t9\n\nNT49->t57\n\nSo, for example, S can produce NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't57', which is the terminal of NT49. Because NT49 \u2192 t57 according to the production NT49->t57.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT49: production is NT49->t57.\n\nSo, to get 't57' as the first token, the derivation must start with NT49, which comes from S via one of the productions?\n\nWait, S can produce NT41 and something else, but NT41 is another non-terminal. So perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step-by-step.\n\nLet me start by trying to parse the string according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t57, t26, t54, t35, t28, t9, t10, t58, t24, t63, t28, t13, t71, t81, t19, t66, t33, t84, t54, t35.\n\nFirst, S can split into either:\n\n1. NT41 and NT23\n\n2. NT41 and NT58.\n\nLet me try both options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNow, for NT41's production: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So NT41 must expand into NT34 and NT49.\n\nThen, NT49 \u2192 t57. So that would be 't57' as the first token, which matches the string.\n\nWait, but NT41's expansion would produce two tokens, and then each of those would have to be split further. But let's check the string.\n\nThe first token is 't57', which is from NT49. So after starting with NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, we'd have NT34 and NT49.\n\nSo NT49 \u2192 t57 is the first token. Then, NT34's production is NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49.\n\nSo NT34 expands into NT26 and NT49. Then, each of these would produce tokens.\n\nWait, but maybe this is getting too complex. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string can be broken down into parts that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps I can start from the beginning:\n\nt57, t26, t54, t35, t28, t9, t10, t58, t24, t63, t28, t13, t71, t81, t19, t66, t33, t84, t54, t35.\n\nFirst, the first token is 't57', which is the result of NT49 \u2192 t57.\n\nSo to produce 't57' as the first token, we must have a derivation where the first non-terminal expands into NT49, which produces 't57'.\n\nLooking at the productions, let"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-375","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think makes it easier because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar to get a better look.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nOther productions connect non-terminals to each other or terminals. For example, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and some of these non-terminals eventually lead to terminals. The string we're evaluating is a series of terminals: t57 t74 t54 t65 t54 t71 t57 t66 t84 t27 t62 t24 t83 t54 t7 t9 t74 t37 t81 t17.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, we'll probably need to use a tree-based approach or a table-driven parsing method, but maybe a simpler way is to work backwards. Let's see.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. Since each production produces two parts (like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a), each part of the string must be a combination of such steps.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which can produce either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the string must start with either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t57 t74. Let me see which non-terminals produce t57.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27. And NT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5. NT52 has two productions: NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT37 and NT52 \u2192 NT30 NT49. Also, NT5 has NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43 and NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7. Wait, that seems recursive but perhaps eventually leads to a terminal. Wait, no, NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7, and NT16 \u2192 't81', and NT7 \u2192 't58'. So combining these: NT43 \u2192 t81 t58 \u2192 t81 t58, but is that a production?\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7\nNT16 \u2192 't81'\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\n\nSo combining NT43, it becomes t81 t58, which would produce the string part t81 t58. Hmm, and looking at the third token in the string is t54.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to see which NT produce t57. Let me look:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49, NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, etc. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the start symbol S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S\u2192NT41 NT58. So the string starts with either NT41 and NT23 (which would produce t57 + t74) or NT41 and NT58 (which would produce t57 and perhaps another part).\n\nWait, in the string, the first part is t57 t74. Let's see if S can produce that. So S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. If it's S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then NT41 must produce t57, and NT23 must produce t74. Is that possible?\n\nLooking at NT41's productions: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So to get t57, maybe NT34 \u2192 ... and NT49 \u2192 ... Let me follow:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. NT31 \u2192 NT66, so NT15 would produce NT66. Hmm, that's not a terminal. Wait, but perhaps NT59 \u2192 NT5 NT43, and NT54 is appearing somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT49 can produce t54. Let me check: NT49's productions are not given, but in the production chain, NT35 \u2192 NT62, etc. Wait, maybe NT36 \u2192 t62, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if NT27 \u2192 t9. Wait, looking at the productions: NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15. So if I go through NT27, it's NT35 and NT15. Then NT35 \u2192 NT62, which is producing something, and NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to build the parse tree.\n\nGiven the string: t57 t74 t54 t65 t54 t71 t57 t66 t84 t27 t62 t24 t83 t54 t7 t9 t74 t37 t81 t17.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S\u2192NT41 NT58.\n\nIf S is NT41 NT23, then maybe the first part is NT41 producing t57 t74, but wait, that's two tokens, so perhaps NT41 produces a pair, and NT23 produces another.\n\nLooking at NT41's productions: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So, for NT41, it's two non-terminals. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 't83'.\n\nWait, yes! Wait, in the productions, NT23 \u2192 't83'. So if the first part is NT23, it immediately produces t83. So the first token in the string is t57, which doesn't match. So if the string starts with t57, which comes from NT41, then perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo let's consider S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Then NT41 must produce the first part of the string, and NT23 must produce the rest. But NT23 is just 't83', which would be exactly the next token: the string is t57 t74 t54..., so t83 doesn't match t74. Therefore, this path doesn't work. So maybe S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo let's try S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Then NT41 must produce t57, and NT58 must produce t74, t54, etc.\n\nWait, so first, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. Then NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. Hmm, looking at the string, t57 is followed by t74.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly. Let me write out the string:\n\nt57, t74, t54, t65, t54, t71, t57, t66, t84, t27, t62, t24, t83, t54, t7, t9, t74, t37, t81, t17.\n\nSo, starting with NT41 from S, which produces NT34 and NT49. Then NT34 produces NT26 and NT49. Then NT26 produces NT15 and NT59.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that NT41 produces t57 and t something else. Wait, perhaps working through each step step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, let's start again. The entire string must be built from the start symbol S.\n\nS can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me assume S \u2192 NT41 NT23 first.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT66.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT55.\n\nWait, no, NT55's productions are NT22 and NT27. But NT55 is a non-terminal.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the first token t57. Which non-terminals produce t57?

{"custom_id":"request-396","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, all separated by spaces. My task is to go through the grammar and the string, figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Each production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that all the productions follow the CNF rules. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which means S can produce a combination of two non-terminals. These non-terminals, in turn, produce other symbols until they end up producing terminals like 't81', 't23', etc.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of terminal symbols: 't37 t10 t63 t14 t27 t83 t59 t63 t62 t54 t7 t17 t54 t38 t7 t11 t63 t84 t64 t71 t17'. \n\nMy approach is to parse this string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the parse tree would involve combining two symbols at a time. I'll start from the left and see if I can break down the string into the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me list the string as a list for easier handling:\n\n['t37', 't10', 't63', 't14', 't27', 't83', 't59', 't63', 't62', 't54', 't7', 't17', 't54', 't38', 't7', 't11', 't63', 't84', 't64', 't71', 't17']\n\nI'll start by looking for the longest possible parse trees. Maybe I can start from the start symbol S and see how it can produce this string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So S is two symbols: NT41 and NT23. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking up NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT57. NT23 is a terminal 't83', so that's straightforward. So if we have NT41 producing NT34 NT49, which in turn is NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT57 (which is 't57'). So, NT34 produces 't26' and 't57'. Wait, but NT34 is a non-terminal, so it's actually two symbols: NT26 and NT57. NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, and NT59 \u2192 NT19. NT19 is a terminal 't19', and NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. NT31 \u2192 NT66, which is a terminal 't66', and NT3 is 't63'. Hmm, but looking at our string, I don't see 't66', so maybe this path isn't the right one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT34 produces something else. Let me check: NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, which we've already considered. Maybe looking for parts of the string that match.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to parse the string from right to left because sometimes that can give us a starting point, but in context-free grammars, especially with leftmost or rightmost derivations, it's not necessarily directional. So, perhaps a middle approach.\n\nLet me look at the entire string and see if I can split it into parts that match the productions. Since each non-terminal production in CNF splits into two symbols, perhaps each step in the string can be divided into two parts.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't37', which is a terminal. So, somewhere in the parse tree, a non-terminal must directly produce 't37'. Looking at the grammar rules, NT37 has two productions: NT37 \u2192 't84' and NT37 \u2192 't62'. So 't37' isn't directly a production of any non-terminal. Therefore, 't37' must be produced by some NT37.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the productions, NT37 has two options: it can produce 't84' or 't62'. So, 't37' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal, which suggests that perhaps 't37' is produced by NT37, but in the grammar, NT37 doesn't produce 't37'. So, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT37 \u2192 't84' and NT37 \u2192 't62'. So indeed, 't37' isn't directly produced by any NT37. That means that 't37' must somehow be part of a larger production. Hmm, perhaps 't37' is the result of a concatenation of two symbols. Let me check where 't37' appears in the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't37 t10 t63 t14 t27 t83 t59 t63 t62 t54 t7 t17 t54 t38 t7 t11 t63 t84 t64 t71 t17'. So 't37' is the first symbol. Since it's a terminal, it must be the result of some NT37 producing another NT37 which then produces 't37'. But according to the grammar, that's not possible because NT37 only produces 't84' or 't62'. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps 't37' is part of a larger derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each NT production eventually terminates in terminals. So, starting from the top, let's see.\n\nThe string starts with 't37', which could be produced by NT37 \u2192 't62' or 't84'. But in the string, it's 't37', so maybe it's a result of a more complex path. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me try to find other terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the initial 't37' suggests that there's something produced by a non-terminal that eventually produces 't37'. But according to the grammar, NT37 can only produce 't84' or 't62'. So unless 't37' is somehow produced through multiple steps, this suggests the string might not be valid. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the productions.\n\nWait, maybe the production rules have a typo or I misread them. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, the productions include:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84' and NT37 \u2192 't62'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't37' is being produced as part of a larger term, but I don't see any NT37 \u2192 't37' production. So this suggests that the initial 't37' in the string can't be directly produced by any non-terminal according to the grammar. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the 't37' is part of a larger term that can be combined. For example, perhaps a non-terminal produces 't37' and another NT, which then proceeds further. But no, the grammar doesn't have that; 't37' isn't a production of any NT. So the conclusion is that the string can't be generated because the first symbol 't37' can't be obtained from any rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems to consist of several non-terminals (like S, NT27, NT35, etc.) and terminals (like 't62', 't8', etc.). The goal is to see if the string `t62 t8 t66 t9 t49 t49 t35 t24 t13 t49 t14 t14 t57 t7 t27 t7 t83 t74 t33 t58 t66` can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This means each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I think I need to construct a parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can derive back to the start symbol S.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens, so we'll have 20 levels of non-terminals. Let's list them out:\n\n1. t62\n2. t8\n3. t66\n4. t9\n5. t49\n6. t49\n7. t35\n8. t24\n9. t13\n10. t49\n11. t14\n12. t14\n13. t57\n14. t7\n15. t27\n16. t7\n17. t83\n18. t74\n19. t33\n20. t58\n21. t66\n\nWait, wait, I think I miscounted.

So the parse tree will have 21 leaves. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production leads to exactly two symbols, so the height of the parse tree is equal to the number of symbols minus 1.

{"custom_id":"request-415","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string that I need to check if it's part of the language generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or two terminals. Some of these non-terminals might also be terminals, which are the basic units like 't11', 't23', etc. \n\nThe given string is: `t11 t9 t59 t83 t71 t17 t33 t14 t33 t58 t58 t66 t13 t35 t19 t57 t63 t74 t8 t49 t66 t27`.\n\nI need to see if each part of this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the provided productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can approach this by trying to parse the string from the start, breaking it down into the required pieces.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the starting symbol is S, which has two main productions:\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2. S -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo, initially, the parse tree will split into either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58. Let me note that down.\n\nNext, I need to see how each part of the string can be generated from these non-terminals. Each non-terminal can be broken down further according to the productions provided. Let me try to map the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string as a sequence to parse: \n`t11 t9 t59 t83 t71 t17 t33 t14 t33 t58 t58 t66 t13 t35 t19 t57 t63 t74 t8 t49 t66 t27`\n\nSince S has two productions, both starting with NT41, let's consider the first option: S -> NT41 NT23.\n\nSo, the first part is NT41, and the second part is NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 is a terminal: `t23`. But in the string, the first token is t11. So this suggests that perhaps the first production might not be the way to go. However, maybe NT41 can derive into a sequence that starts with t11.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for NT41. Looking through, I see:\n\n- NT41 -> NT34 NT49\n- NT34 -> NT26 NT49\n- NT26 -> NT15 NT59\n- NT15 -> NT31 NT3\n- NT31 -> NT66\n- NT3 -> t64 (but in our string, we're seeing t11, which doesn't match t64. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe NT31 can derive into something else. Let me look again.\n\nActually, looking at NT31, I see:\n- NT31 -> NT66\n- NT66 -> NT36 NT26\n- NT36 -> t9 (from NT36 -> t9)\n- NT26 -> NT15 NT59\n\nBut in the string, we have t11. Let me check if there's a production for t11. Looking at the grammar, I see NT11 is a terminal: is that so? Wait, looking at the given productions, I don't see NT11 as a non-terminal. Wait, all the non-terminals end with 'NT' except perhaps some are terminals. Wait, no, NT11 is not listed as a production; instead, it's 't11', which suggests that 't11' is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT41 -> t13, NT35 -> t62, etc.\n\nWait, in the given grammar rules, some non-terminals directly go to terminals. For example:\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT36 -> t9\n- NT28 -> t26\n- etc.\n\nAlso, looking at NT11: Is there a production for NT11? Let me check the list:\n\nNo, under the grammar, there's no production for NT11. Instead, the string has t11. So, perhaps that's a problem because t11 is a terminal, so NT11 must be a terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, there's no NT11 defined as a non-terminal. So, in this case, perhaps 't11' is not a terminal but a symbol that cannot be derived, meaning the string cannot be generated. But wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any rule for NT11. So if t11 is a terminal and there's no way to derive it from a non-terminal, then the string cannot be generated. But wait, that's not necessarily true because the starting symbol is S, so the entire string must be derived from S. So, perhaps t11 is a terminal, but is there any non-terminal that can produce t11?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the productions, no non-terminal directly maps to t11. So that's a red flag. Because if t11 is a terminal, and our parser starts with S which is a non-terminal, and one of the initial productions is S -> NT41 NT23. So the first element in the string would have to be derived from NT41 or NT23.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t11, which is a terminal. So, if we're taking S->NT41 NT23, then NT41 must produce t11, but in the grammar, there's no production for NT41 to t11. The closest is NT41 -> NT34 NT49, then NT34 -> NT26 NT49, and so on, which eventually ends in terminals like 't64' but not 't11'.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I overlooked NT11. Let me check the productions again. No, in the given list, there is no production for NT11. So, that suggests that t11 cannot be derived from any non-terminal in this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the first token t11 cannot appear in the language, meaning the entire string is not part of the language defined by this grammar. Hence, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

In this case, looking at the grammar, I notice that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B\/C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string provided consists of terminal symbols only, which means each 't' followed by a number must correspond to a terminal production in the grammar. So, I'll start by constructing a parse tree for the string, ensuring that each step follows the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at each terminal in the string, I'll check where they come from in the grammar. For example, 't54' must come from some production.

Wait, no, the initial grammar has some lines like:\nNT36 -> 't9' and NT36 -> 't63'\nSimilarly, NT24 has NT24 -> 't33' but elsewhere it might be connected.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me summarize the grammar. It starts with S and has productions that expand into various non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, and several non-terminals leading up to them. Each non-terminal eventually resolves into a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but actually, looking closer, it's all terminals. Wait, no\u2014in the grammar, many non-terminals eventually produce terminals like 't33', 't58', etc. So, the string consists of terminal symbols, and we need to see if they can be generated by expanding the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to generate the string, it should be derivable through a series of productions where each step uses either left or right associativity without any other factors.\n\nLet me approach this by looking for how each terminal in the string can be derived. Starting from the end, maybe looking for the last part of the string and working backwards could help, but alternatively, I can try to build it up step by step.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string: 't33'. In the grammar, I see that NT33 has a production: NT33 -> NT36 NT26, and nt36 -> t9, nt26->t22. So that's t9 t22, but that doesn't give t33. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT33 also has other productions. Let me check. Oh, wait, looking through the grammar, some NT33 have productions. For example, NT33 -> NT33 NT54, but that seems more complex. Let me check all NT33 productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some NT33 are defined as:\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n- NT33 -> NT24 NT26\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier; actually, let me list all the NT33 productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n- NT33 -> NT24 NT26\n\nSo, each of these leads to two non-terminals. For example, NT36 -> t9 and NT26 -> t22. But wait, the first symbol is t33, which isn't a terminal. Wait, no\u2014looking back, the string is all terminals. So t33 is a terminal symbol, so in the grammar, is NT33 directly a terminal? Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production where NT33 directly becomes t33. Instead, the productions for NT33 go to combinations of other non-terminals.\n\nSo does that mean that t33 is never a terminal? Or maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again. Looking through each rule, I see that some NT33 rules end with t26, t9, etc., but none directly produce t33. So perhaps 't33' is a terminal and is derived from NT33 through some chain.\n\nWait, no. Because NT33 is a non-terminal, so it can only generate strings composed of other non-terminals or terminals. So if 't33' is a terminal symbol in the string, it must be produced by some NT33 \u2192 t33, but I don't see such a production in the given grammar.\n\nWait, let me check again. The given grammar for NT33 is:\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n- NT33 -> NT24 NT26\n\nSo none of these directly produce a terminal. Hmm, so perhaps 't33' is not present in any directly, which would imply it's not in the language. But that can't be right because the string has 't33' at the end.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. Wait, in the grammar given, under NT33, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n- NT33 -> NT24 NT26\n- Also, perhaps under NT24 or others? Wait, no, only the above.\n\nWait, so 't33' is a terminal, but NT33 doesn't produce 't33' directly. So unless there's a way to derive 't33' indirectly through other steps, which might involve NTs that eventually produce 't33'.\n\nWait, but looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't33'. So perhaps 't33' isn't part of the language, which would mean the string cannot be generated, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because the string does end with 't33 t38', meaning the last symbol is t33. So if t33 isn't a terminal, perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me check again if any NT directly leads to t33.\n\nLooking again through the grammar, NT33 is only involved in combinations:\n\n1. NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n   - NT12: NT41 NT58 (wait, no, NT12's productions involve other non-terminals. Let me check NT12:\n   NT12 -> NT32 NT16\n   So, NT12 further splits into NT32 and NT16.\n   NT32->t24\n   NT16->t81\n\nSo NT12 produces t24 t81.\n\nBut in the production NT33-> NT12 NT49, this would lead to t24 t81 followed by whatever NT49 produces.\n\nWait, no, production NT33 -> NT12 NT49, which then would lead to the combination of whatever NT12 and NT49 produce. But in this case, the terminal 't33' is present in the string, but it seems NT33 is a non-terminal that doesn't produce a 't33' terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me read the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let's look for any NT that directly produces 't33' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the NT definitions, only some of them produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT34 -> t26\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT36 -> t63, t63 again, t54, etc.\n- NT28 -> t18, etc.\n- NT27 -> t9, etc.\n- And so on.\n\nI don't see any NT that directly produces 't33'. So 't33' can't be in the language because it's never produced as a terminal. So the string has 't33' which shouldn't be there, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but that seems too simplistic. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider the productions again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a non-terminal that can derive 't33'. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the productions, perhaps some non-terminal derivation leads to 't33' as part of a chain. For example, maybe NT33 eventually can produce a string that includes t33. But given that none of the NT33 productions produce t33 directly, I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is being generated in parts, and somehow 't33' is a step in the chain, but given the grammar, I don't see how that can happen.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the string is built from the start symbol S and the productions expand step by step. But to confirm, each step must use the correct productions.\n\nBut since the string starts with 't33', and S is the start symbol, how can 't33' be the first symbol unless S has a production that starts with 't33', which I don't think it does.\n\nWait, wait, let's check the S production. The grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT41 NT58\nWait, actually, looking at the given grammar, S is defined as:\nS -> NT41 NT23\nand\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo S splits into two non-terminals, either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58.\n\nNow, looking at those, let's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-457","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t11 t11 t8 t83 t17 t9 t27 t66 t17 t11 t10 t11 t24 t83 t17 t11 t57 t13 t14 t59 t10 t27 t62 t11`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF requires that every production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal. So, all the rules given here seem to fit that, except maybe if any have more than two non-terminals, but looking through them, every rule on the left has exactly two non-terminals, so it's okay.\n\nThe next step is to parse the string. Since it's a sequence of terminals, I need to see if it can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, and the production rules for S are:\n\nS -> NT41 NT41 \u2192 Wait, no, looking again, the first two options are S -> NT41 NT23 and S -> NT41 NT58. So, S can produce two non-terminals, and then those can be further split.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with `t11 t11 t8 t83 t17 t9 t27 t66 t17 t11 t10 t11 t24 t83 t17 t11 t57 t13 t14 t59 t10 t27 t62 t11`. \n\nI notice that there are multiple instances of `t11`, `t17`, `t9`, etc. Maybe I can find production rules that generate these terminals. For example, looking at the rules, when does 't11' appear? Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT42 -> NT8 NT52\n- NT8 -> NT33 NT3\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n- NT26 -> NT15 NT59\n- NT15 -> NT31 NT3\n- NT31 -> NT38\n- NT38 -> NT28 NT32\n- NT28 -> NT18 NT2\n- NT7 -> NT58\n- NT58 -> NT15 NT24\n- NT15 -> NT31 NT3\n- NT34 -> t26\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT36 -> t63\n- NT42 -> t11\nWait, hold on, looking at the rules, I see NT42 has a production to 't11'. So, in the rules, NT42 can produce 't11'.\n\nBut let's check the rules again to make sure. \n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT42 -> NT55 NT49\n- NT24 -> t49\n- NT22 -> NT52 NT5\n- NT10 -> NT12 NT42\n- NT42 -> NT55 NT49\n- NT24 -> t33\n- NT28 -> t7\n- NT36 -> t63\n- NT12 -> t8\n- NT8 -> t35\n- NT12 -> t8\n- NT2 -> t33\n- NT15 -> t71\n- NT34 -> t26\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT36 -> t63\n- NT42 -> t11\n- NT24 -> t27\n- NT7 -> t58\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT30 -> t24\n- NT36 -> t54\n- NT23 -> t19\n- NT8 -> t14\n- NT12 -> t8\n- NT59 -> t19\n- NT31 -> t38\n- NT5 -> t66\n- NT32 -> t7\n- NT8 -> t10\n- NT24 -> t63\n- NT27 -> t9\n- NT49 -> t57\n\nWait, so in the production rules, NT42 has a production that directly gives 't11'. So, for example, if NT42 is part of the derivation, it can produce 't11'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two 't11's could be produced by NT42 via NT42 -> 't11'. Let me see how that would work.\n\nBut before that, the string has 't8', which is an element. Looking through the rules, where does 't8' come from? For example:\n\n- NT8 -> NT33 NT3\n- NT3 -> t64\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n- NT26 -> NT15 NT59\n- NT15 -> NT31 NT3\n- NT38 -> NT28 NT32\n- NT28 -> NT18 NT2\n- NT2 -> t33\n\nSo, for 't8', the production would ultimately be from NT18 -> NT32 NT36, but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, NT8 can produce 't33' if that's a terminal, but wait, in the rules, I see NT15 -> t71, but that's not t8. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking at each rule:\n\n- NT8 is broken down into NT33 NT3, both of which are non-terminals. So, NT8 is not a terminal itself. Therefore, 't8' must come from some other production.\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to find a path where a non-terminal can derive 't8'. Let's look for any non-terminal that can directly produce 't8'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT28 -> NT18 NT2, and NT2 -> t33, but NT18 is another non-terminal. Wait, let's try to find a chain that eventually leads to 't8'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't8' appears elsewhere. Looking through the rules again, I see NT58 -> 't17' and NT43 -> 't62', etc. Wait, perhaps 't8' can come from a non-terminal that eventually produces it, but it's not directly obvious.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if I can derive each token.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to map the non-terminals to their possible terminals. For example, if S starts by producing NT41 and NT23, then NT41 and NT23 would need to produce certain sequences.\n\nLooking at the first production S -> NT41 NT23, let's see what NT41 and NT23 produce.\n\nFrom the rules, NT41 can produce NT34 NT49. So NT41 -> NT34 nt49. Then, NT34 -> t26, and NT49 -> t57, at least according to the rules. So NT41 can produce t26 t57.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 can produce t19, according to the rules: NT23 -> t19.\n\nSo, S -> NT41 NT23 can produce t26 t57 t19. But in the string, the first three tokens are t11 t11 t8, which doesn't match t26 t57 t19. So perhaps S uses the other production, S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nLet's see what NT41 and NT58 produce.\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49: t26 t57 as before.\nNT58 can produce 't17' directly, according to the rules: NT58 -> t17.\n\nSo, S -> NT41 NT58 would produce t26 t57 t17. But the string starts with t11 t11, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. That suggests that maybe the initial productions from S don't lead to the string. Alternatively, perhaps the string uses multiple derivations, and perhaps the initial choice of S's production is different.\n\nWait, but in the rules, S only has two productions: S -> NT41 NT23 and S -> NT41 NT58. So, in any derivation, S will produce one of these two combinations. The first derivation step must be one of these, and from there, each non-terminal must be expanded until we reach the terminals.\n\nIn the given string, the first word is t11. Let's see if any non-terminal can directly produce t11. Looking through the rules, I see NT42 -> t11. So, if a NT42 is part of the derivation chain, it can produce 't11'.\n\nBut in the initial step, if S produces NT41 NT58, which includes NT58, which produces t17"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-461","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. \n\nFirst, let's look at the string to be evaluated: `t38 t65 t10 t14 t81 t7 t26 t59 t57 t28 t28 t8 t24 t26 t9 t26 t9 t17 t81 t7 t49 t28 t71 t66`. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the symbols (like NT27, NT35, etc.) are non-terminals, and the rest are terminals ending with 't' followed by a number. The terminals seem to represent specific strings, so the parsing tree will involve replacing non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S. Since the grammar starts with S, I should see how the string can be built by expanding S.\n\nThe possible S rules are:\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo the string must start with either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58 expanding. Looking at the string, the first token is t38. Let's see which parts could lead to t38.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check where t38 appears as a terminal. Scanning through the productions, I notice that some symbols produce 't' strings. For example, NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, but in the string, t38 is present. Wait, no, actually, looking back, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT41 \u2192 t13, NT28 \u2192 t7, etc.\n\nWait, let me cross-check. Actually, in the grammar, some symbols produce terminal strings, others produce non-terminals. But in the given string, there are many 't' as terminals, so we need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which are presumably derived from the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to parse the string as a sequence of symbols, each matching a production rule.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t38. So, we need to see if there is a production that directly produces t38. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT38 directly producing 't38'. Instead, NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. Hmm, so t38 would have to come from the expansion of NT28 or NT32 somewhere down the line.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's see the grammar again. For example, NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, and NT35 \u2192 NT62 NT32, but wait, perhaps I should see where 't38' is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n\nBut this seems circular because NT28 depends on NT38 and vice versa. So that's a problem. Let me check: NT28 can be rewritten as NT38 and NT31, but NT38 can be rewritten as NT28 and NT32. So if I have t38 in the string, it might come from NT28, but that would require NT28 \u2192 t38 or something, which it doesn't directly. Alternatively, if NT28 is part of a larger expansion, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and seeing if the string can be derived.\n\nStarting with S, the first expansions are either S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Since the first token is t38, perhaps it comes from NT23 or NT41, whichever is appropriate.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT23: NT23 \u2192 't83', so if the string starts with t83, but our string starts with t38. So if the first part is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the first symbol would be whatever NT41 produces. Similarly, if it's S \u2192 NT41 NT58, the first symbol is nt41 followed by nt58, which would produce a string starting with the expansions of NT41 and NT58.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify: in the given productions, some symbols are terminals, others are non-terminals. So the non-terminals are to be expanded into other symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, let's consider that S is the start symbol. The first expansion is either S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So the string starts with the concatenation of the symbols resulting from NT41 and NT23 or NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t38, so we have to see if either NT41 or NT23 can expand to something that includes t38.\n\nWait, let's look at NT23: NT23 \u2192 't83'. So if the first part is NT23, then the first symbol would be t83, which doesn't match the string's first token, which is t38. So that suggests that the first production is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, but then the first symbol is whatever NT41 produces.\n\nWait, NT41: in the productions, NT41 can be rewritten as NT34 NT49, and so on. Let's see if somewhere t38 can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should approach this by building the parse tree for the string. Let's try to split the string into parts that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me note that each production in the grammar has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since this is Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where 'a' is a terminal.\n\nBut in reality, it's A \u2192 BC, which is a pair, and A can also directly produce a terminal, depending on the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, it seems that some non-terminals directly produce terminal strings, like NT58 \u2192 't74', which is a terminal string, so that's how a rule can produce a terminal directly. So, when a non-terminal can produce a terminal, that is a terminal symbol, and we can directly match it in the string.\n\nSo for NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, that's a non-terminal producing another non-terminal and another. But wait, NT38 is 't28' and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for symbols that directly match a terminal in the string.\n\nFirst, let's split the string into individual tokens: 't38', 't65', 't10', 't14', 't81', 't7', 't26', 't59', 't57', 't28', 't28', 't8', 't24', 't26', 't9', 't26', 't9', 't17', 't81', 't7', 't49', 't28', 't71', 't66'.\n\nLooking through these, let's see if any of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT28 \u2192 't7' (Wait, no, in the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31. But 't8' appears somewhere? Let me check. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT32 \u2192 't26' and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because I need to look for non-terminals that can produce a terminal. For example, if NT27 can be rewritten as a terminal, but in the provided grammar, it seems that some non-terminals produce other non-terminals. Let me check each line again.\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23 (non-terminals)\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58 (non-terminals)\n- NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15 (non-terminals)\n- NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32 (non-terminals)\n- NT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49 (non-terminals)\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27 (non-terminals)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16 (non-terminals)\n- NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3 (non-terminals)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT12 NT42 (non-terminals)\n- NT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37 (non-terminals)\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 (non-terminals)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 (non-terminals)\n- NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7 (non-terminals)\n- NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check NT28. Oh, I see now. There is a rule NT28 -> 't26'. So the terminal 't26' can be generated. But earlier, I thought that 't28' was in the string, but looking back, the string is `t13 t64 t22 t38 t24 t11 t71 t27 t49 t59 t24 t62 t83 t38 t71 t59 t49 t14 t35 t63 t33 t59 t7 t71 t7`. So in the string, the last few are 't7 t71 t7', which includes 't7', which I thought the grammar doesn't produce. But wait, in the grammar, there is NT7 -> 't58', but no NT7 -> 't7'. So 't7' isn't part of the grammar, which is a problem because the string has it.\n\nWait, let me check again. The string ends with 't7 t71 t7'\u2014so three 't7's. If the grammar doesn't have any rule that produces 't7', then the string can't be generated because 't7' is a terminal that is not allowed by the grammar. Unless 't7' is a typo and should be 't58', but even then, 't58' is generated by NT58. Alternatively, maybe the initial string is wrong, but as per the given, the string does have 't7's at the end.\n\nSo that's a problem. Because the grammar cannot produce 't7' as a terminal. So if the string has 't7', unless the grammar has a production for NT7 that includes 't7', the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't58'\n\nBut no 't7'. So 't7' is not in the terminal symbols. Thus, the string can't be generated by the grammar. So the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if 't7' was supposed to come from another production. For example, in the grammar, do any other non-terminals produce 't7'? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT28 -> 't26', so 't26' is a terminal. Similarly, NT23 -> 't19', and so on. But no production that ends with 't7' except NT7, which produces 't58'.

{"custom_id":"request-479","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t27 t54 t62 t71 t11 t81 t74 t7 t35 t58 t71 t28 t84 t83 t71 t14 t10 t74 t9 t66 t65 t27 t26 t7 t27`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. CNF implies that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The starting symbol is S, and I see S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58, so S is rewritten into two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals likely have further productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S splits into NT41 and NT23, and also NT41 and NT58. So S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58. That means the string generated by S must start with \"t13\" (since NT41 \u2192 t13) followed by \"t27\" (NT23) or \"t71\" (NT58). Wait, let me check the productions.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions, NT41 \u2192 t13, so S \u2192 t13 t27 or t13 t71.\n\nBut the first token in the string is t27. That doesn't match t13. So maybe I need to trace another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see if the entire string can be built step by step, token by token, following some derivation.\n\nBut since this could take a long time, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can perform a recursive descent parser or use memoization for efficiency and parse the string accordingly.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm for CNF grammars to test if the string is in the language. However, the CYK algorithm might be tedious given the number of symbols here.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that each production either consumes a terminal or splits into two non-terminals, so the string must have a structure where each \"split\" corresponds to a production. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n where n is the number of splits.\n\nWait, the number of symbols is 25 in this case. Let me see: Starting from S, each application of a rule either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. But with multiple non-terminals, the parse tree will have a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a parse tree. Let's see the string tokens:\n\nt27 t54 t62 t71 t11 t81 t74 t7 t35 t58 t71 t28 t84 t83 t71 t14 t10 t74 t9 t66 t65 t27 t26 t7 t27\n\nThat's 25 tokens, which is an odd number, so if the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23, each step would double the count. Wait, but S \u2192 NT41 NT23 produces 2 symbols, then each NT may split further.\n\nWait, if S is the start symbol, each application of a rule increases the number of symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 gives 2 symbols. If each of NT41 and NT23 split into two non-terminals each, that makes 4 symbols. Then each of those split again, making 8, etc. So the number of symbols must be a power of 2. But 25 is not a power of 2 (since 2^4=16, 2^5=32). So if the number of symbols is not a power of 2, it can't be generated by a CNF grammar.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Each step of the grammar can only produce two symbols (either a terminal or two non-terminals). But in the case of a leftmost derivation, each non-terminal is replaced in order, so each production potentially doubles the count.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of symbols in the string must be equal to 2^k for some k, but in this case, it's 25, which is between 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). So that suggests it can't be generated because 25 is not a power of 2.\n\nIs that a valid approach? I'm trying to recall: In Chomsky Normal Form, the number of symbols in a derivation sequence grows exponentially. So, for a CNF grammar, the length of the derived string must be 2^k, because each application of rules splits each non-terminal into two.\n\nTherefore, since the string has 25 symbols, which is not a power of 2, it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule either has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. That's good because it simplifies parsing, but since I'm manually generating the string, I might need a different approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the non-terminals expand into terminal symbols, specifically those that result in letters like 't' followed by numbers. For example, S -> NT41 NT41, which then each NT41 can expand into 't13' and 't49', right? Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49, and NT34 -> 't26', NT49 -> 't49' (Wait, but in the given rules, NT49 is 't49' and NT34 is 't34'? Wait, actually, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n- NT41 -> NT34 NT49\n- NT34 -> 't26'\n- NT49 -> 't49'\n\nSo, NT41 can produce 't26' and 't49'. Therefore, S is NT41 NT41, so first NT41 can be 't26' and the second might be a different expansion? Wait, no, because NT41 can only go to 't26' and 't49' via NT34 and NT49 respectively. So S would expand into two parts. Each NT41 can become 't26' or 't49'.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some NTs expand directly into terminals, like NT5 -> NT5 NT43, but also NT5 -> 't66'? Let me see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n\nSimilarly, NT7 -> 't58', and others.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: `t84 t13 t65 t17 t63 t65 t28 t22 t37 t74 t33 t65 t24 t17 t62 t35 t17 t28 t28 t84 t65 t27 t24 t22 t8 t24`.\n\nThat's quite long, so I need to see how to break it down.\n\nI think the strategy here is to parse the string by trying to split it into segments that match the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into exactly two non-terminals (except when a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal). But in this case, most non-terminals go to a terminal or a pair.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't84'. Let me see which NT can produce 't84':\n\nLooking for NTs where the rule leads directly to 't84'. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT27 -> NT35 NT15 \u2192 leads to t62 and t3 (from NT35 and NT15?), but wait, actually, NT35 -> 't62', and NT15 -> 't71', so that doesn't produce 't84'.\n- NT37 -> 't84' is a rule: NT37 -> 't84'.\n- NT55 -> 't65' (I think), but looking at the rules, NT55 -> NT22 NT27, but I don't see 't65' as a terminal. Wait, no:\n\nLooking back, NT27 -> NT35 NT15, and NT35 -> 't62', NT15 -> 't71', so not 't84'.\n\nWait, let's check all NTs:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT33 -> 't36', which is 't36' not 84.\n\nNT10 -> 't8' which is too early.\n\nWait, is there an NT that directly \u2192 't84'? Yes, NT37 \u2192 't84'.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't84', which must come from NT37.\n\nSo the first token is derived from NT37, which is replaced by 't84'.\n\nSo my string starts with NT37, which produces 't84'.\n\nNow, the grammar S is S-> NT41 NT41, so after S, it's two non-terminals (NT41 and NT41). Alternatively, looking at the rules, the user might have written S \u2192 NT41 NT41 or NT5. Wait, the initial provided grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT41 NT41\n\nand also\n\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nWait, in the provided rules, that's correct. So when parsing the string, S must be split into two parts. So the first part is one NT, the second part is another NT.\n\nBut since the string is just a single token 't84', which is only possible if both NTs expand to 't84' in some way. But that's impossible because the first NT would have to derive 't84' as the first part, and the second as the rest.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nEach expansion in the grammar is a binary split: each non-terminal either produces a terminal or is replaced by two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string is built by replacing S with two non-terminals, each of which can be another split or a terminal.\n\nSo let's think in terms of the entire string. The entire string is one possible derivation path starting from S, which must be broken down into two parts, each starting with NT and ending with any symbols until the next split.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string by dividing it into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to start from the beginning, trying to split the string into possible segments.\n\nLet me look at the first token: 't84', which corresponds to NT37, as NT37 \u2192 't84'.\n\nSo the first NT is NT37, which produces 't84', so the remaining string is:\n\nt13 t65 t17 t63 t65 t28 t22 t37 t74 t33 t65 t24 t17 t62 t35 t17 t28 t28 t84 t65 t27 t24 t22 t8 t24\n\nNow, after the first part, since S is two NTs, the next part must also be from an NT, which could expand into a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo the second part would be the rest of the string, but let's see if the rest can be matched by the second NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT can be a split point, so perhaps I should try to see if the entire string can be broken into two parts at some position, each part being a valid non-terminal expansion.\n\nBut this seems complex. Let me think of the top-down approach: starting from S, split it into two NTs, each of which either is a terminal or splits again.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with 't84', which is NT37, so one NT is fixed. So the second part would be 't13 t65 t17 t63 t65 t28 t22 t37 t74 t33 t65 t24 t17 t62 t35 t17 t28 t28 t84 t65 t27 t24 t22 t8 t24'.\n\nWait, but that's the rest of the string after the first 't84', which seems very long. So perhaps the second NT needs to expand into that, but let's see.\n\nThe second NT could be either a terminal or two non-terminals. Given the length, it's more likely to be two or more splits. So perhaps the second NT is an NT that can produce a long string.\n\nLooking for an NT that can produce a sequence starting with 't13'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT13 -> 't13' \u2013 Wait, is there an NT13?

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on that, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has certain characteristics. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't produce any empty strings unless needed.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, all the production rules are either two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or another terminal. Wait, no, actually, some have two terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, that's two non-terminals. Then I see some rules like NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, which is two non-terminals. But wait, some have a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT24 \u2192 t49 NT33, or NT36 \u2192 t22. Oh, right, that's allowed because in CNF, it's acceptable as long as there are exactly two non-terminals in the productions, but here we have some terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, the productions can have terminals, so it's okay. So each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t33 t22 t59 t7 t37 t54 t38 t58 t59 t59 t54 t26 t24 t62 t59 t14 t71 t81 t11 t19 t13 t33 t7 t13 t64 t14 t37`.\n\nThe task is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can use the CYK algorithm or try to derive the string step by step by breaking it down.\n\nBut how to approach this? Maybe I can start from the top-down approach, trying to find the productions that can generate the string. Alternatively, I can parse the string by checking possible splits at each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for a way to break down the string into the productions step by step.\n\nLet me see the rules again and see if I can find any patterns or possible splits.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the string must start with NT41 generating the first part and NT23 generating the second part. Let's check the string: it starts with t33, which is a terminal. Looking at the rules for NT23, I see that NT23 \u2192 't83', so in the string, the last part is t13 t64 t37 t13 t33 t7 t13 t64 t14 t37. Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe that's coming from another production.\n\nWait, the first part of the string starts with t33. Let me look for rules that produce t33. Looking through the rules, I see NT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49, and also other rules like NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26, and so on. Also, in some cases, NT33 \u2192 t63. So t33 could come from NT33, which can be generated through other non-terminals or directly as 't33'.\n\nWait, another point: NT24 \u2192 t49, so that could produce 't49', which is in the string. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't58', so 't7' comes from NT7, which is 't58', which is present in the string?\n\nWait, the string has t7, but looking at the rules, I don't see any NT or rule that directly produces 't7' except maybe NT7 \u2192 't58'? Wait, let me check again. In the given grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't58', so to get t7, I have to look for NT7 \u2192 't58' which would be a production. So 't7' might not be a direct terminal in the grammar. Wait, no, because NT7 is transformed into 't58', so 't7' might not appear directly.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see t7. Let me check the rules again. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't7'; the only non-terminal that produces a terminal is NT7 \u2192 't58', but that would require using 't58' instead of 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT37 \u2192 't84' and 't49', so maybe some terminals are directly produced by some NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the possible terminals in the grammar to see if they match any part of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are as follows:\n\n- 't33' is produced by NT36 \u2192 t9? No, wait, no. Wait, in the rewrite rules, each line is something like S \u2192 NT41 NT23, but sometimes a terminal is prefixed.\n\nWait, I think I need to make a list of all the production rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. Let me go through the rules and note which ones produce terminals:\n\n1. NT33 \u2192 t63\n2. NT34 \u2192 t26\n3. NT35 \u2192 t62\n4. NT36 \u2192 t63\n5. NT37 \u2192 t84, t49\n6. NT38 \u2192 t33, t32\n7. NT41 \u2192 t13\n8. NT42 \u2192 t55, t49, t11, t42\n9. NT43 \u2192 t62, t7\n10. NT5 \u2192 t66\n11. NT58 \u2192 t17, t74\n12. NT7 \u2192 t58\n13. NT23 \u2192 't83'\n14. NT24 \u2192 t33 (Wait, in the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t49, not t33)\nWait, looking again, here's the relevant rules:\n\nLet me scan through the given production rules:\n\nLooking for any production that results in a terminal string.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n- NT33 \u2192 t63, etc.\nWait, perhaps I should list all the productions that result in a single terminal:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 t63\n- NT34 \u2192 t26\n- NT35 \u2192 t62\n- NT36 \u2192 t63\n- NT37 \u2192 t84, t49\n- NT38 \u2192 t33, t32\n- NT41 \u2192 t13\n- NT43 \u2192 t62, t7\n- NT5 \u2192 t66\n- NT58 \u2192 t17, t74\n- NT7 \u2192 t58\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n\nSo, for each of these, when these non-terminals are derived, they produce a single terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the string, I see several terminals like t33, t22, t59, etc.\n\nI can try to see which of these terminals correspond to the above productions.\n\nWait, but for example, NT22 is a non-terminal; do any of its productions result in terminals? Checking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT22's production, I see that in one rule, NT22 \u2192 t55, t49, t27, t55, etc. Hmm, no, actually, looking at the given rules, the NT22 doesn't seem to produce terminals on its own. Wait, looking through all the rules again, no NT22 production has a terminal. It produces combinations of non-terminals, except that in some rules, it's on the left side. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT22: No. The rules under NT22 don't have any terminal; they have combinations like NT52 NT12, etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5\nNot seeing any terminal, so NT22 is composed of other non-terminals. So, t22 would need to be produced by one of these non-terminals that have a rule that directly produces 't22'.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules again, I see:\n\nIs there a NT22 \u2192 t22? Let me check. I think not, at least from the initial set. The 't22' is part of the string, so perhaps that's from another NT's production.\n\nWait, looking for 't22' in the rewrite rules, I see that in some cases, NT28 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-533","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long, so I'll approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe given string is: t9 t28 t19 t71 t57 t11 t27 t74 t83 t10 t28 t62 t8 t17 t37 t8 t74 t7 t54 t64 t19 t37 t28 t81 t24 t64 t13 t26.\n\nI'll note that each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal production in the grammar. My goal is to find a sequence of productions that can generate this string step by step.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its components: t9, t28, t19, t71, etc. Each of these must be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT36 \u2192 t9 (among others). So, t9 could come from NT36. Similarly, t28 appears multiple times, which could come from NT28, but let's check the rules.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, and NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, which seems a bit recursive, but perhaps there's a way to derive t28 through other means. Wait, looking again, NT24 \u2192 t49, and NT28 \u2192 t26.\n\nHmm, wait, no. Let me check each production rule to see how each terminal is derived.\n\nWait, for example, NT28 \u2192 t26. So, t26 is directly derived from NT28. So in the string, every occurrence of t26 must come from NT28.\n\nBut let me go step by step. The first symbol is t9. Looking at the production rules, NT36 can produce t9, so that's possible.\n\nSo, t9 \u2192 NT36.\n\nNext, t28. Let me see how to get t28. Looking at the NT28 rules: NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 or NT28 \u2192 NT26? Wait, no: looking at the rules, it's NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 or NT28 \u2192 NT26. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, the rules provided are many, so let me scan for NT28. Hmm, in the given rules, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n\nand\n\nNT24 \u2192 t49.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me list all the rules again and focus on NT28.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t33\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t26\n\nAh, right. NT28 can produce t26 directly. So t28 in the string must come from NT28, which can be either NT38 NT31 or t26.\n\nBut looking at the string, after t9 comes t28, then t19, etc. So, t28 is the second symbol. So, NT36 (from t9) must produce something that starts with t28. Wait, no: t9 comes from NT36, so the production chain starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nNT34 \u2192 t26 (from NT34's rules: NT34 \u2192 t26 or NT34 \u2192 NT26)\n\nSo, t26 is t26. Wait, but in the string, after t9 comes t28, not t26. Hmm, perhaps I need to retrace.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nNT34 \u2192 t26.\n\nSo, that would produce t26 as the second symbol, but the string starts with t9, then t28. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S branches into the right non-terminals that can produce the sequence.\n\nLet me approach this differently. I'll try to parse the string backwards to see if I can reduce it to S using the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\nt9, t28, t19, t71, t57, t11, t27, t74, t83, t10, t28, t62, t8, t17, t37, t8, t74, t7, t54, t64, t19, t37, t28, t81, t24, t64, t13, t26.\n\nSince it's a CFG in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So when parsing from the end, each step would be to replace the rightmost symbol with a production.\n\nBut perhaps working forward is easier. Let's see.\n\nStart with the entire string. The first symbol is t9. Looking at NT36 \u2192 t9, so the first symbol comes from NT36. So, the first part is NT36.\n\nSo, the string can be represented as NT36 followed by the rest.\n\nNow, NT36's production: Let's see, the rules for NT36 are:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT33 NT26\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t9\n\nSo, to derive t9, NT36 must produce either t9 directly or via other non-terminals.\n\nIf it's t9, then after t9, the next symbol is t28. But how does NT36 derive t28? It can't, because t28 is a terminal, and in the production NT36 \u2192 t9 only. So that's a problem. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, NT36 might produce NT33 and NT26. Then after t9, the next part would be what's generated by NT33.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIf NT36 \u2192 NT33 NT26, then after t9 comes the symbols generated by NT33 and NT26.\n\nSo, t9, then from NT33 and NT26.\n\nBut in the string after t9 is t28, so perhaps that's part of NT33 or NT26.\n\nWait, let me try again. Maybe I should consider the entire string as a sequence of non-terminals whose productions can expand to the given string.\n\nLet me consider the first part of the string: t9 t28 t19 t71 t57 t11 t27 t74 t83 t10 t28 t62 t8 t17 t37 t8 t74 t7 t54 t64 t19 t37 t28 t81 t24 t64 t13 t26.\n\nLooking at the beginning, t9 is a terminal. So the starting part is likely from a non-terminal that can produce t9. We saw that NT36 \u2192 t9, so perhaps the string starts with NT36.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t28, which as a terminal can come from NT28 (since NT28 \u2192 t28). So, after NT36, we might have NT28.\n\nBut NT36's production is either t9 or NT33 NT26. So if it produces NT33 NT26, then the second symbol should be from NT33 or NT26.\n\nBut NT28 is another non-terminal. So maybe NT36 is producing NT28 somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nMaybe I should map out the entire string step by step.\n\nLet me think about working from left to right.\n\n1. The first symbol is t9. So possible sources: NT36 \u2192 t9. So we have t9.\n\nNow, after t9, the next symbol is t28.\n\nSince t28 is a terminal, it must come from a non-terminal that directly produces t28.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT28 \u2192 t28. So, after t9, the next symbol could be from NT28, which directly produces t28. So, t9 followed by t28 could come from NT36 producing NT28 and t28.\n\nWait, but NT36 \u2192 t9 directly, so the entire part after NT36 must produce the remaining string: t28 t19 ... t26.\n\nSo, after t9, we have t28. So, if NT36 produces t9 and the rest, then the next part must be generated from the remaining string starting with t28.\n\nSo, after t9, the next symbol is t28, which can come from NT28 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-530","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar looks a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which can produce other symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can go to NT41 NT23 and NT41 NT58. So from S, we generate two parts: NT41 and either NT23 or NT58. The string provided starts with 't37', which suggests that the first part might involve some NT derivation.\n\nWait, each production splits into two NTs except for the terminals. Let me check the first few productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the first symbol in the string is 't37', which isn't directly in S's productions. Hmm, that means we probably need to look deeper into the NT productions.\n\nLooking at the NT terminals, each NT leads to either another NT or a terminal. For example, NT23 \u2192 't83', NT28 \u2192 't26', and so on. So the string is composed of a series of t followed by numbers, which are likely the terminal symbols from the grammar.\n\nLet me map the string to the t symbols and see if they can fit into the grammar. The string is:\n\nt37 t11 t14 t14 t19 t11 t35 t38 t14 t64 t7 t19 t35 t17 t66 t7 t64 t28 t27 t65 t10 t62 t66 t11 t38 t71 t81 t17\n\nBreaking it down, each 't' number must come from a terminal production. So I need to see if each 't' can be generated by the grammar, and if the way they are connected follows the productions.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. The first symbol is 't37'. Looking at the NT37 productions:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84' or NT58 NT32.\n\nHmm, 't84' isn't in the string. Wait, no, in the string it's 't37', so maybe I should check if 't37' can be derived from NT37. Wait, but in the grammar, NT37 only goes to 't84' or other NTs. So 't37' must come from some NT that eventually terminates with 't37'. Looking back, in the grammar, the productions for NT37 are:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I see NT37 \u2192 NT58 NT32 and NT37 \u2192 't84', but where is 't37' coming from? Wait, the user provided a partial list, maybe I missed some. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT37:\n\nNT37 -> 't84'\nI see that. So 't37' is not directly a terminal. That suggests that in the string, the first 't37' must come from a longer production that eventually leads to 't37'. Let me check if any NT can produce something that leads to 't37'.\n\nLooking for 't37' in the terminals, I see that NT30 \u2192 NT37 NT32, and maybe others. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 't37' comes from NT37 directly. But in the grammar, NT37 can only produce 't84' or NT58 NT32, so 't37' isn't a terminal. Therefore, the string starts with 't37', which shouldn't be possible unless there's a typo or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me double-check. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so all non-terminals produce two NTs. The end non-terminals, like NT23, produce terminals. So the terminal symbols are all the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't37'. Is there any NT that can produce 't37'?\n\nLooking back at the productions, the only way to get 't37' is if there's a production ending with NT37 \u2192 't37'. But looking through the provided grammar, I don't see any production where NT37 goes directly to 't37'. The only terminal for NT37 is 't84' or a combination of NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the entire grammar again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT36: NT36 \u2192 't63' or other NTs. But where is 't37'?\n\nWait, perhaps 't37' is derived from a longer chain. Let's see. The way Chomsky Normal Form works is that each step is a production of two NTs, so the derivation starts from S, splits into two NTs, then each of those splits again, and so on until terminals are reached.\n\nThe string has 30 symbols, so the derivation must have 15 steps (since each step adds one token, starting from two at S, then four, etc., until 30? Wait, no: the number of symbols doubles each step. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a sequence of NTs that eventually produce the given terminals.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is 't37', which isn't a terminal in the grammar. Because in the provided grammar, all terminal symbols are 't' followed by a number, and 't37' is the only occurrence where a production ends with 't37'. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84' or NT58 NT32. So no production directly leads to 't37'. Therefore, the string cannot start with 't37' because 't37' isn't a terminal in the grammar. That would immediately mean the string is invalid, right?\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar's terminals. All 't' symbols are terminals. So if the string starts with 't37', which isn't present as a terminal in any production, does that mean the string is invalid? Because the grammar doesn't have a production that derives 't37'.\n\nSo, if the first token is 't37' and it's not a terminal in the grammar, then the string isn't generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting or missing something. Let me make sure. Let's see all the terminals in the grammar. The terminals are any 't' followed by a number, like 't37', 't11', etc. Looking through the grammar, I see terms like 't37', 't11', etc. But none of the productions lead to 't37' directly; it's only the result of a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps 't37' is a terminal in some production, but I don't see any production that directly produces 't37'. For example, NT30 produces NT37 NT32, which could derive into a string involving 't37'. So perhaps the string starts with 't37' as part of a longer derivation.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the string could still be generated. I need to see if the entire string can be built by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a part that branches into 't37', but then again, I need to consider the full derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the grammar doesn't have a production that directly produces 't37', it's impossible for the string to start with 't37'. Therefore, the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, after considering all possibilities, I conclude that the string isn't generated by the grammar because 't37' isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-546","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it a bit easier because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That usually means that derivations correspond to parse trees with a certain structure.\n\nThe string provided is:\n\nt38 t27 t38 t7 t63 t57 t8 t14 t14 t9 t37 t26 t8 t83 t38 t10 t71 t11 t54 t28 t63 t38 t11 t8 t37 t62 t10 t27 t7.\n\nFirst, I should probably parse this string into a sequence of symbols and see how they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of non-terminals and some terminals. The terminals are the strings ending with 't' and some numbers. The non-terminals are letters like S, NT27, NT35, etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, can produce NT41 NT23. So the first step is S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't38' which might correspond to one of the productions from NT41 or NT23.\n\nLooking at the productions where NT41 appears, one of the rules is NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Another is NT41 \u2192 NT43? Wait, checking the grammar: Wait, in the given grammar after NT41, there's NT41 -> NT34 NT49 and NT41 -> NT35 NT15? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait the grammar provided is a bit long. Let me list out the productions that might include NT41:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nAlso, looking further down:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT35 NT15? No, wait, let me check the grammar provided step by step. Wait, under Grammar, the section shows:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nAlso, is there another production for NT41? Wait, I see:\n\nAnother line: NT35 -> NT28 NT32\n\nNT33 -> NT12 NT49 etc.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to have multiple rules for some non-terminals, but for NT41, only one production: NT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nSo, NT41 can only go to NT34 NT49.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT23, the productions for NT23 are:\n\nNT23 -> 't83'\n\nWait, yes, in the grammar, under NT27, etc., I see:\n\nNT23 -> 't83'\n\nSo S \u2192 NT41 NT23 would mean the first part is NT41 and the second is NT23.\n\nNow, the string starts with t38, which I think is part of NT38. Let me check which non-terminals can produce 't38'. Looking at the grammar, under NT38, the production is NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31. So NT38 can go to NT28 NT31.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t38, so perhaps that t38 is derived from NT38. But how? Because in the grammar, 't38' is a terminal, so only the NT38 can produce it if there's a production NT38 \u2192 t38, but looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any production that directly produces t38. Let me go through each line to check.\n\nLooking down the list:\n\nI don't see any productions where a non-terminal directly goes to t38. For example, NT43 -> t62, NT5-> t5, etc. Wait, maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, looking carefully:\n\nThe productions under NT38: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31.\n\nUnder NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2. So that's a two-symbol rule, not a terminal.\n\nWait, so perhaps t38 is part of a longer production. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t38, which might be part of NT38, which then needs to be broken down. But looking at the grammar, perhaps t38 is a result of a production from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t38, so maybe somewhere in the grammar, there's a production that can derive t38.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, under NT38:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nWait, I see NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31.\n\nSo NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31.\n\nAnd NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2.\n\nAnd NT18 has two productions: NT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37 or NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT36.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So the parse tree should have each node either a terminal or two children (non-terminals). Wait, but the first step is that S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the string is generated by S, which is NT41 and NT23. So the string should be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT41 and NT23.\n\nSo, first, NT41 produces something that starts with t38, and NT23 directly produces t83.\n\nLet's look at NT23: from the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 't83'. So NT23 can directly produce t83, which is the last symbol in the string. That matches.\n\nSo, the string ends with t83, which is correct because NT23 produces it.\n\nNow, the first part is nt41. So we need to see what NT41 can produce.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nSo, the string starts with t38, which is the first terminal of the substring generated by NT34? Or wait, the first part of the string is t38 t27 t38 t7..., but NT41 is producing NT34 and NT49. So, NT34 and NT49 need to produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break down each non-terminal as we go. Let me try to outline a possible parse.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt38 t27 t38 t7 t63 t57 t8 t14 t14 t9 t37 t26 t8 t83 t38 t10 t71 t11 t54 t28 t63 t38 t11 t8 t37 t62 t10 t27 t7\n\nWe know that S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT23 \u2192 t83. So, after the first part, we have t83 as the last symbol.\n\nSo NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 needs to generate the first 24 symbols: t38 t27 t38 t7 t63 t57 t8 t14 t14 t9 t37 t26 t8 t83 t38 t10 t71 t11 t54 t28 t63 t38 t11 t8 t37 t62 t10 t27 t7.\n\nWait, perhaps I should separate the string into the parts generated by NT34 and NT49.\n\nWait, but first, the initial part is t38, which is likely from NT38. Let me check:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31.\n\nSo, NT38 needs to generate t38, but looking at the grammar, there's no production that directly gives t38. Instead, NT38 produces a two-symbol string: NT28 followed by NT31.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part is generated by NT38, which can produce t38 as a result of these two non-terminals. But wait, in the string, the first symbol is t38, then t27, t38, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the string as a list and try to parse it recursively.\n\nLet's try to see the structure step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t38, so we need to check if the first part can be generated by a non-terminal that starts with t38.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals that can produce t38 are?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2 \u2192 but NT18 can produce further symbols.\n\n- Wait, but t38 is a terminal, so maybe it's the root of a subtree.

{"custom_id":"request-547","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLooking at the string: `t10 t35 t63 t84 t59 t19 t11 t84 t11 t83 t62 t26 t65 t26 t58 t11 t37 t11 t26 t27 t62 t81 t37 t24 t66 t9 t13 t11 t81`.\n\nEach token here is a terminal, and I notice that 't' followed by numbers are the terminals. So each 'tX' represents a terminal symbol, and certain non-terminals correspond to these terminals. \n\nI need to check each production rule to see if the terminals in the string can be generated by the grammar. Maybe I should approach this by starting from the start symbol S and see if I can break it down into the string step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The grammar has two options for S:\n\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2. S -> NT41 NT58\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT23 directly expands to 't83', and NT41 expands to 't13'. So let's see what happens if we take S -> NT41 NT23. That would produce 't13' followed by 't83', which is 't13 t83'. But looking at the string, the first two terms are 't10 t35', so that doesn't match. Similarly, if I take S -> NT41 NT58, that would be 't13' followed by NT58. NT58 expands to 't15 NT24', right? Oh wait, NT58's production is in the grammar as NT58 -> NT15 NT24. Then NT15 expands to 't71', and NT24 -> 't26'. So S -> NT41 NT58 would expand to 't13 t71 t26'. That's three terms, but the string starts with 't10', so that doesn't match either.\n\nHmm, so neither of the initial productions from S generates the first part of the string. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back, NT41 -> 't13', right? And NT23 -> 't83'. So if I take S -> NT41 NT23, I get 't13 t83', which isn't the first two terms in the string. So unless there's a different expansion path, maybe S is supposed to be expanded in a different way.\n\nWait, but that can't be because S only has those two production rules. So if neither of them fits the string, maybe the entire string isn't generated by this grammar. But that seems too hasty. Maybe there's a way to expand further.\n\nLet me think again. The string starts with 't10 t35 t63 t84 t59 t19 t11 t84 t11 t83 t62 t26 t65 t26 t58 t11 t37 t11 t26 t27 t62 t81 t37 t24 t66 t9 t13 t11 t81'. That's 30 tokens. Since each production step adds two terminals, the total number of terminals should be 2^n where n is the number of productions. Wait, actually, since each non-terminal expands to two non-terminals, the derivation tree would have 30 leaves, so n would be log base 2 minus something. Maybe that's getting too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string step by step, breaking it down into non-terminals that can be formed by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using an approach where I try to match the entire string by working my way from the string upwards, seeing if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nLet's attempt a top-down approach. The top symbol is S, which can expand to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Both of these produce three terminals, as per their first step, but the string starts with 't10', so perhaps this is not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for another way. Perhaps the string is built by multiple expansions, and maybe some non-terminals produce a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Let's see.\n\nWait, for example, some non-terminals might expand into more non-terminals and then into terminals. Maybe I can go through each step and see if the string can be matched.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by combining multiple non-terminals. For example, maybe there's a path where a non-terminal expands into other non-terminals which eventually expand into the required terminals.\n\nBut given the time, maybe it's better to see if each 't' in the string can be represented by any non-terminal. For example, 't10' must be produced by NT10, 't35' by NT35, and so on.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only non-terminals that produce terminals are those with production rules ending in 'tX'. I can note down which non-terminals produce each terminal:\n\n- NT10 -> 't8', 't28', 't59', etc., according to the grammar. Wait, no, looking back, NT10 has production rules that sometimes produce terminals, but not just 't10'. Let me see.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT23 -> 't83' \u2192 so produces t83.\n\nNT41 -> 't13'\n\nNT58 -> 't15', 't71', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each 'tX' corresponds to a specific non-terminal. Let me see the production rules for non-terminals that produce 'tX':\n\n- NT3 -> 't64', 't63'\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't58'\n- NT8 -> 't35', 't10'\n- NT9 -> 't19', etc. (Wait, looking through the list, many non-terminals produce multiple terminals.)\n\nWait, for 't10', in the grammar, NT10 appears in production rules, like NT10 -> NT12 NT42, and also appears as NT10 -> NT41 NT5, and NT10 -> NT55 NT49. So none of these production rules directly produce 't10'; they produce non-terminals. Therefore, 't10' is not a direct production of a non-terminal. Hmm, but in the string, the first token is 't10', so that suggests that the grammar must have a non-terminal that produces 't10' directly.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to 't10'. All terminals are in the non-terminals that have rules like NT8 -> 't35' or NT41 -> 't13', etc.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the string is invalid because 't10' is not directly produced by any non-terminal. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all the non-terminals in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-560","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form along with a string that I need to check if it's generated by the grammar or not. Hmm, the grammar has rules that seem to break down into terminals (like 't' followed by numbers) and non-terminals. The string is a series of these terminals: 't74 t7 t9...', and so on. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, most of the production rules have two non-terminals on the right side, except a couple that have a terminal. Wait, no\u2014most of them are actually terminals and another non-terminal or two. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I should check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the rules, for example, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49: both non-terminals. Another one is NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27, still non-terminals. But then, some others have a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43, which is two non-terminals again. Wait, but then there's NT37 \u2192 't84'. Oh, okay, so some rules have a terminal as one of the right-hand side symbols.\n\nSo the grammar is in CNF, so each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Therefore, the parsing is leftmost derivation, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or with a terminal.\n\nNow, given the string to check, it's 't74 t7 t9...'\u2014these are all terminals, so at some point, the derivation must reach these in order. So I think I can model this as a parse tree, where each node is a non-terminal that produces the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate the parsing. Let's see. The entire string must be a leftmost derivation from the start symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So S must expand into either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t74. So perhaps NT41 or NT58 has t74 in their productions. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT41's rules: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, then NT34 \u2192 NT26, NT49 \u2192 t57. Wait, but that's two non-terminals. So from NT41, we can derive 't57' indirectly. But the string starts with t74, which would have to come from NT58 perhaps. \n\nLooking at NT58's rules: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. Then NT31 \u2192 NT10 NT63? Wait, not sure. Let me check NT58's expansion. NT58 can go to NT15 NT24. Then NT15 can go to NT31 NT3. Then, NT31 can go to NT10 NT42. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me take it step by step. Let's consider S \u2192 NT41 NT23. If the first part is t74, that must come from NT41. So, NT41's productions are NT34 NT49. Then, from NT34, perhaps NT26 (because NT34 \u2192 NT26). Then NT26 is 't74' according to the provided rules: NT26 \u2192 't74'? Wait, no. Looking at the rules:\n- NT26 \u2192 't74' is stated in the grammar.\n\nYes, so NT26 \u2192 't74', so if NT34 is replaced by NT26, which gives t74. So if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, then NT34 becomes 't74', and NT49 becomes t57. So the first three symbols would be t74, (then from NT23, ...).\n\nBut the string starts with t74, then t7. Hmm, the next token is t7. How is that generated? Let's see. \n\nLooking at other non-terminals: NT7 \u2192 't58', NT43 \u2192 't62', etc. So the next token is t7. Do any non-terminals produce t7? Let me check the rules. \n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any nonterminals directly producing 't7' as a terminal. So that's a problem because t7 isn't directly a production from any non-terminal in the grammar. All productions either go to two non-terminals or a terminal plus possibly a non-terminal, but none produce 't7' directly. \n\nWait, so if the string starts with t74 (from NT26), then the next token is t7, but there's no production that gives 't7' as a terminal. So that means the string cannot be derived from the grammar because the second symbol 't7' can't be generated by any rule. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again at the grammar rules. Is there any non-terminal that can produce 't7'? Scanning through... \n\nLooking at NT7 \u2192 't58', which is 't58', but not 't7'. Similarly, NT34 \u2192 't26' (so that's NT34 \u2192 't26'), NT35 \u2192 't62', etc. But none of these have 't7' as a terminal. So yes, since 't7' is not a terminal in any rule, the string cannot be generated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string starts with t64. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT36 -> t9 and some others. Wait, let me check all NT rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT36 can go to t63, t64, t66, t7, etc.\nSpecifically, NT36 -> t64, so that's possible. So the first part is NT36.\n\nNext, after t64 comes t54. So looking for NT that can produce t54. Scanning the rules, NT58 -> t17 but t54 is from NT32? Wait, let me check NT32. NT32 is written as 't24' in some rules. Wait, let me look:\n\nWait, looking again: I see NT32's rules include 't24' and another 't7' (from NT32 -> NT18 NT2). Also, NT55 -> t49, but that's from NT12. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, I'll try to see if the entire string can be broken down into the possible non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the entire string, perhaps I can see if it can be split into pairs that match any production rules.\n\nBut the string has 33 tokens (since each word is separated by a space). Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion produces two symbols, so for a string of n tokens, the derivation would have depth (n-1), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the length of the string.\n\nWait, the string length is 33 tokens. For a context-free grammar in CNF, the minimal number of symbols is 2^d where d is the depth. But this might not directly apply here because the grammar might allow overlapping or different structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try a recursive descent approach, breaking the string into parts according to the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me see the first token, t64. Looking at the grammar, NT36 -> t64. So that must come from NT36.\n\nNext, the second token is t54. Looking for a production that starts with NT54. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, actually, NT54 is not a rule in the given grammar. Wait, looking at the given grammar, for example: NT36 -> t63, t64, t66, etc., but I don't see NT54. So perhaps I'm looking for a production where the left-hand side is NT and the right-hand side is t54.\n\nWait, looking through all NT rules:\n\nLooking for 't54' as a production.\n\nNT36 has t54 as an option (NT36 -> t54).\n\nSo, t54 comes from NT36.\n\nSo, so far, the first two tokens come from NT36 (t64 and t54).\n\nNow, the string after t64 is t54, but that's not part of the same expansion. Wait, no\u2014the entire string is a sequence, so each two non-terminals would produce two symbols. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the entire string being built by a sequence of non-terminals that each expand into two parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps breaking the string into pairs and seeing if each pair corresponds to a production.\n\nWait, the string is 33 tokens, which is odd. Each production step in a CNF grammar doubles the number of symbols. So starting from a single symbol, each step doubles the count. So 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. Since 32 is a power of 2, maybe 33 is problematic because it's one more than 32. That suggests that perhaps the string may not be possible because the count isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. Let me think: in a context-free grammar with CNF, each production step increases the number of symbols by one step in the derivation. So for the string to be of length 32, it would require 5 production steps: S -> two symbols, then each time splitting. But 32 is 2^5, so a string of 32 symbols can be generated. However, our string has 33 symbols, which is 2^5 +1, which isn't a power of two. That suggests it's impossible because each expansion step in CNF can only produce a number of symbols that's a power of two. Because each step doubles the number of nodes in the parse tree.\n\nWait, but this might not always be the case if the grammar allows for multiple symbols to be produced at various levels. Let me clarify. In Chomsky Normal Form, each rule is either A->BC or A->a. So, starting from S, each step produces two non-terminals. Then, each of those can produce two more, and so on. So the total number of symbols in a derivation would be 2^(n) after n steps, starting from the initial S. So, for example, after 0 steps, we have 1 symbol. After 1 step, 2 symbols. After 2 steps, 4. After 3, 8, etc.\n\nBut the string we have is 33 symbols, which is 2^5=32 +1. That's not a power of two. So it's impossible for a string of 33 symbols to be generated by a CNF grammar. Because 33 is not a power of two. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misapplying this. Let me confirm: The number of symbols in the string must be 2^k for some k. So 33 is not a power of two (since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64), so it's 32+1, which is not a power. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect because the string can have some non-terminals that don't split into two until later, but I think the total number of symbols must still be a power of two.\n\nSo, if I'm correct, the string has an odd length, which is not possible for a CNF grammar, thus the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has an odd number of tokens (33), which is not possible for a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, as each expansion step produces a number of tokens that are powers of two. Therefore, it cannot be generated.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-571","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can have just one. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is: `t11 t57 t22 t14 t11 t81 t26 t33 t19 t10 t54 t8 t17 t38 t49 t35 t33 t33 t10 t83 t66 t81 t27 t57 t11 t26 t58 t71 t71 t49 t14`.\n\nThat's a long string with several t terms connected by spaces. Looking at the grammar rules provided, I see that several of these t terms correspond to the terminal symbols in the grammar. For example, NT58 -> 't17', NT55 -> 't66', and so on. So, the strategy should be to parse the string using the grammar and see if it can be derived correctly.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the first part of the string. The string begins with t11. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT11 is not directly represented because the non-terminals are labeled from S down. Wait, actually, in the grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce 't11'? Let me check the list again. Oh, I see NT42 -> 't11' and NT24 -> 't33' (Wait, but 't11' isn't directly a terminal in the given rules. Wait, no, looking back, the rules only produce 't's with numbers like 17, 14, etc. Wait, let me correct myself.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce t terms. For example, S -> NT41 NT23, but NT41 leads to 't13', NT23 to 't83', so S would produce 't13 t83'. Let me go through some t terms:\n\nLooking for where 't11' is produced. From the grammar, I see NT42 -> 't11'. That's a key point. So, 't11' must come from NT42. Similarly, 't57' appears multiple times. Let me see if any non-terminals produce 't57'. Yes, N5 -> 't57'.\n\nWait, the string starts with t11, so let's match that. The first symbol is t11, which must come from NT42. So, the derivation would involve having NT42 somewhere in the parse tree.\n\nBut how do we get t11 into the string? Let's see. The grammar uses NTs and S. The start symbol is S, which produces NT41 NT23. So, S -> NT41 NT23. Now, NT41 is a non-terminal that can split into NT34 and NT49. Let's check the rules:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nOK, so S can be broken down as NT41 NT23, which further breaks down into NT34 NT49 NT23.\n\nNow, NT34 -> NT26 NT49. So, that adds another NT49, making it NT34 NT49 NT26 NT49 NT23.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe it's better to try to parse the string from the given t terms and see if they can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t11 must come from NT42. So, we need to have a production that combines NT42 with something else. Since the grammar is in CNF, the structure would have to split as NT42 X, where X produces the rest starting from t57 (since after t11 comes t57).\n\nWait, the first two t terms are t11 and t57. Let me think: if the first symbol is t11, that's derived from NT42, so the production would have to be NT42 followed by something that produces t57. Looking at NT5, which is 't5', but the string starts with t11 t57..., so maybe I'm mixing this up.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sequence of expansions from S. Let me consider that the initial production is S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So, the string starts with whatever NT41 produces and then NT23.\n\nLooking at NT41, according to the grammar: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49, and NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, and so on. But maybe this could get too complicated, so perhaps it's better to consider the string as a sequence of symbols, each of which must correspond to a direct production of some non-terminal.\n\nWait, the string is a series of symbols separated by spaces. So, the string is \"t11\", \"t57\", \"t22\", \"t14\", etc. Each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nSo, the key is to see if the entire sequence can be generated by the grammar by expanding S into the right combinations.\n\nLet me consider that each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal of the grammar. So, for each t term, I need to check if it's produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- t17 is produced by NT58.\n- t14 is produced by NT8.\n- t11 is produced by NT42.\n- t57 is produced by NT5.\n- t22 is produced by NT22 -> 't22' directly or via other rules.\n\nWait, checking the rules, I see NT22 -> 't22' is directly produced, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, let's look for all t terms in the string and see which non-terminals they correspond to:\n\nt11 \u2192 NT42\nt57 \u2192 NT5\nt22 \u2192 NT22 (direct)\nt14 \u2192 NT8\nt11 again \u2192 NT42 again\nt81 \u2192 NT34 perhaps? Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. Then NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. NT59 \u2192 NT37 (wait, no, looking at the rules: NT59 is used? Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see a NT59 producing 't81'. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. I see that NT8 has rules: 'NT41 NT33' perhaps, but looking for t terms. Let me go through each t term and find which NT produces them.\n\n1. t11 \u2192 NT42\n2. t57 \u2192 NT5\n3. t22 \u2192 NT22\n4. t14 \u2192 NT8\n5. t11 \u2192 NT42\n6. t81 \u2192 Let's check: does any NT produce 't81'? Looking through the rules, I see NT34 \u2192 't81'? Wait no, looking again: No, in the rules, I see NT15 \u2192 't81'? Let's check:\n\nLooking for 't81' in the rules: I see 'NT15 -> 't71'', 'NT8 -> 't35'', 'NT34 -> 't26'', etc. Wait, but I don't see any NT producing 't81'. Hmm, that's a problem because in the string, the fifth symbol after initial is t81. So, is there a non-terminal that produces 't81'?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through each rule and see which terminals are produced.\n\nLet me list all the t terms in the string and see which NT can produce them:\n\nt11: appears in NT42 \u2192 't11'\n\nt57: in NT5 \u2192 't57'\n\nt22: in NT22 \u2192 't22'\n\nt14: in NT8 \u2192 't14'\n\nt81: Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't81'. Wait, but maybe we can derive it through another NT.\n\nWait, looking at the rules for NT28: NT28 \u2192 't26' and 't28' itself can be split further. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps 't81' is produced by NT34. Looking again: NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. Now, does any NT produce t26 or t49?\n\nWait, checking the rules: I see NT26 \u2192 't15' and 't59'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies parsing, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll approach it by breaking down the string into the non-terminals and seeing if I can derive it step by step.\n\nThe string given is: t8 t7 t8 t74 t59 t84 t14 t27 t17 t49 t71 t81 t65 t22 t37 t64 t54 t74 t22 t8 t35 t28 t74 t14 t11 t81 t58 t59 t62 t7 t11 t17.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these symbols are terminal productions. Let me see which are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, any symbol that doesn't have an arrow (->) pointing to more than one symbol is a terminal. So, terminals are 't' followed by a number, some are repeated but are still terminals. Non-terminals are the ones on the left side of the production rules, like S, NT27, NT38, etc.\n\nSo, I can map which symbols in the string are terminals and which could potentially be non-terminals.\n\nThe string has the following symbols:\n\n- t8, t7, t8, t74, t59, t84, t14, t27, t17, t49, t71, t81, t65, t22, t37, t64, t54, t74, t22, t8, t35, t28, t74, t14, t11, t81, t58, t59, t62, t7, t11, t17.\n\nAll of these are terminals because they don't appear on the left side of any production in the grammar. For example, looking at NT27 -> NT35 NT15, NT27 is a non-terminal, and terminals are the ones that are mapped to by specific productions.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some non-terminals like NT12, NT27, etc., have productions. The terminals are the ones that are replaced by these non-terminals.\n\nSo, to generate the string, the grammar must produce this exact sequence of terminals.

Alternatively, maybe NT33 produces t8 somewhere.\n\nWait, let me list which NT's have productions that directly lead to 't' symbols.\n\nLooking at the mappings:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71' (from NT15 -> ... )\n- NT34 -> 't26'\n- NT35 -> 't62'\n- NT36 -> 't9', 't63', etc.\nWait, let me look through all the mappings for 't' sequences:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT34 -> 't26' (so if NT34 is produced, it can emit t26)\n- NT35 -> 't62' (emit t62)\n- NT36 -> 't9', also 't63' in another production\n- NT41 -> 't13' (from NT41 -> NT34 NT49, but from NT34 it can emit t26, and NT49 to 't57'\n- Wait, need to see for each NT:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT5: NT5 -> NT5 NT43. Not a terminal.\n- NT7 -> 't58'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT6 no mappings, wait but NT6 isn't in the grammar? Or do I have to assume that it's a terminal? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, it seems like all symbols except S and the NTs are terminals. Wait, S and non-terminals are all NTs, so any symbol that's not starting as a non-terminal is a terminal.\n\nSo, the terminals in the string are all lowercase letters starting with 't'. So t8, t7, etc.\n\nSo, each of these must be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the entire string step by step, checking if each portion can be generated.\n\nLet's start:\n\nThe string starts with t8. So, perhaps the first part of the string is generated by S -> NT41 NT23, or S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 can produce certain things. Let's see:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nSo, NT41 is divided into NT34 and NT49.\n\nIf NT34 can produce a part of the string, and NT49 can produce the rest, maybe.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 -> 't83', from the mappings. So NT23 directly emits 't83'.\n\nWait, that's crucial. Let me note that.\n\nLooking at the mapping for NT23: NT23 -> 't83'. So, NT23 is a terminal.\n\nSo if the first production is S -> NT41 NT23, then the last symbol of the string must be 't83'. However, the last symbol in the string is t17, so that can't be. So the first production for S must be S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nBecause if S -> NT41 NT23, the right-hand side would generate 't83' as the last symbol, which doesn't match. So S must use the other production: S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nNow, let's look at NT58. From the grammar, NT58 -> NT15 NT24.\n\nSo, the production is NT58 producing NT15 NT24.\n\nNow, each of NT15 and NT24 can produce certain symbols.\n\nNT24 -> 't49', from the mappings. So NT24 produces 't49'.\n\nSo, NT58 -> NT15 't49'.\n\nWait, no, it's NT15 NT24. So NT58 is divided into NT15 and NT24.\n\nSo, the left part of the string after S is t8 t7 t8 t74 t59 t84 t14 t27 t17 t49 t71 t81 t65 t22 t37 t64 t54 t74 t22 t8 t35 t28 t74 t14 t11 t81 t58 t59 t62 t7 t11 t17.\n\nWe considered S as NT41 NT58, so the first part is:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'll need to see how the string can be broken down into these terms.\n\nThe input string is:\n\nt71 t74 t84 t28 t63 t35 t83 t54 t13 t38 t54 t65 t13 t59 t63 t65 t24 t64 t37 t83 t37 t63 t26 t84 t9 t84 t74 t8 t10 t59 t65 t83\n\nI notice that many of these are terminals. So, the string is a series of terminal 't's followed by numbers. Each number corresponds to a non-terminal. \n\nI think the process is to parse the string by replacing non-terminals with their possible terminals or sub-productions. Since this is a bottom-up or top-down approach, I might start from the start symbol S and see if expanding it can result in the given string.\n\nBut this seems a bit complex. Maybe I can start by looking for the possible top-down expansion starting with S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So, the top-level is either:\n\nCase 1: NT41 \u2192 ... and NT23 \u2192 t83\n\nCase 2: NT41 \u2192 ... and NT58 \u2192 t17\n\nLet me see the string. The first symbol is t71. Looking at the productions, only NT34 and NT35 and others end with 26, 22, etc., but t71 is 't71', which in the productions is NT15 \u2192 't71' (from production 15). So, 't71' corresponds to NT15, and in NT15's production (16: NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3), so replacing NT15 gives NT31 and NT3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 is 't64' (from production 36: NT3 \u2192 't64'), but wait, production 48: NT33 \u2192 't26', maybe I'm mixing up. Let's check:\n\nWait, production 36: NT3 \u2192 't64'\n\nProduction 15: NT15 \u2192 't71'\n\nWait, no, from production 15: NT15 \u2192 't71'\n\nProduction 48: NT33 \u2192 't26', maybe I misnumbered.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the productions again with their indices to avoid confusion.\n\nLooking again:\n\n1.

That simplifies parsing because I can use algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure I'm supposed to do that here. Alternatively, maybe I can try to build a parse tree manually.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\nt37 t83 t22 t49 t64 t57 t17 t24 t63 t10 t35 t62 t14 t7 t64 t10 t11 t66 t71 t14 t28 t33 t13 t59 t63 t9 t38 t57 t49 t63 t49 t11 t8\n\nLet me note that the terminals in the grammar are things like 't81', 't17', 't24', etc. But in the string, I see many 't's with different numbers, like t37, t83, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar production rules, I notice that some terminals are defined as 't81', 't17', 't24', etc. So perhaps in this string, some of these might not match because the grammar's terminals are different.\n\nWait, actually, I should check which terminals are present in the grammar. Looking through the grammar, every production ends in a non-terminal or a terminal. The terminals are things like NT27 -> NT35 NT15, but in the right-hand side, I see terminals like 't81', 't17', etc. So the terminals in the grammar are these specific 't's.\n\nSo, each terminal in the string must exactly match one of these 't' symbols defined in the grammar. Let me list all the terminals present in the string and see if they are allowed.\n\nThe string is:\nt37 t83 t22 t49 t64 t57 t17 t24 t63 t10 t35 t62 t14 t7 t64 t10 t11 t66 t71 t14 t28 t33 t13 t59 t63 t9 t38 t57 t49 t63 t49 t11 t8\n\nNow, let me list these terminals:\n\n37, 83, 22, 49, 64,57,17,24,63,10,35,62,14,7,64,10,11,66,71,14,28,33,13,59,63,9,38,57,49,63,49,11,8.\n\nI need to check if each of these numbers corresponds to a terminal present in the grammar.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the terminals are:\n\n17: 't17'\n24: 't24'\n27: 't9' wait no, looking, NT27 -> NT35 NT15, but in the grammar, the non-terminals are NT27, NT35, etc. Wait, no, actually, on checking, the terminals in the grammar are:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar productions. For example:\n\nS -> NT41 NT49\nNT27 -> NT35 NT15 (so NT27 is a non-terminal)\n...\nLooking through all the productions, the right-hand sides that are terminals have 't' symbols.\n\nFor example:\nNT5 -> NT5 NT43\n...\nThen, in the bottom of the grammar, some productions resolve terminals:\n\nNT37 -> 't84'\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT36 -> 't9'\nNT24 -> 't49'\nNT58 -> 't74'\nNT3 -> 't64'\nNT30 -> 't37'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT55 -> 't65'\nNT24 -> 't33'\nNT2 -> 't33' (Wait, this seems conflicting because earlier NT24 is 't49'. Let me check.)\n\nWait, no. Each production in the grammar is either A -> BC or A -> a. So each line where the RHS is a terminal is like A -> a, where a is a 't' followed by a number or a non-terminal.\n\nSo looking through the productions, terminals like NT58->'t74' etc., but when these are expanded, do they resolve to a single 't' terminal?\n\nWait, the list at the bottom shows each terminal as something like 't64' which is a single terminal. So each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol, meaning that when expanded, they replace to a single 't' symbol.\n\nSo in the grammar, certain non-terminals (e.g., NT27, NT33, etc.) can expand into other non-terminals, but eventually, some of them resolve to 't' terminals.\n\nTherefore, in the string, each 't' with a number must correspond to one of these terminals.\n\nSo first, I'll list all the 't's in the string and check if they are among the terminals defined in the grammar. For example, t37: is there a production rule where a non-terminal expands to t37? Looking at the grammar, I see NT37 is one of the non-terminals, but is there a production that sets NT37 to t37?\n\nIn the grammar, the bottom part shows:\n\nNT58 -> 't17'\nNT43 -> 't62'\n...\nNT37->'t84'\nNT49->'t57'\n\nWait, let me go through all of them:\n\nLooking at all the productions that translate directly to t's:\n\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nNT43 -> 't62'\n\nNT36 -> 't9'\n\nNT24 -> 't49'\n\nNT58 -> 't74'\n\nNT3 -> 't64'\n\nNT30 -> 't37'\n\nNT32 -> 't24'\n\nNT55 -> 't65'\n\nNT24 -> 't33'\n\nNT2 -> 't33' (but this can't be right because earlier NT24 is 't49')\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me parse the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, the productions that replace non-terminals to terminals are at the very end:\n\nNT27 -> 't9'\n\nWait, no, looking again, at the bottom of the given grammar, it shows:\n\nNT58 -> 't74'\nNT3 -> 't64'\nNT30 -> 't37'\nNT32 -> 't24'\nNT55 -> 't65'\nNT24 -> 't49'\nNT58 -> 't15' (Is that correct?

Since all the rules in the grammar end with terminals, the string must be a series of terminal symbols that can be derived by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-608","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. \n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left. Looking at the grammar, all the productions either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. That's good because CNF is structured in a way that makes parsing easier, but for this problem, I'm not using a parser; I need to manually see if the string can be derived.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t81 t84 t64 t74 t9 t83 t38 t14 t7 t71 t57 t8 t33 t35 t64 t49 t38 t65 t71 t58 t64 t63 t8 t26 t63 t65 t26 t26 t37 t11 t62 t11 t28`.\n\nFirst, I need to note that terminals are the t-something elements. So the string has 37 tokens, all of which are terminal symbols except for the non-terminals. But wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT stands for non-terminals, and some of them produce terminals.\n\nI think the approach is to see if the string can be generated by expanding the grammar step by step. Each step in the derivation will consume parts of the string, and I need to ensure that the entire string is consumed without remainder.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in reverse: start from the start symbol S and try to expand it until I get the string. Since the string is long, this might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can identify key production rules that can help.\n\nLet me look at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\nSo S can only be broken into NT41 and NT23. Therefore, the start of the string must be the expansion of NT41 and NT23.\n\nLooking at the string: the first few tokens are t10, t81, t84, t64, etc. So the first expansion is probably NT41 and NT23. Let's see what each of those produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT41 -> NT34 NT49 and NT41 also -> t13. Similarly, NT41 can be a terminal t13 or two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t10, not t13. So that suggests that NT41 might be expanding into something that starts with t10. Looking at the productions, NT34 is a non-terminal with a rule NT34 -> t26. Also, NT49 -> t57.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with t10, which could be from NT41 or another non-terminal. Let me look at NT31 -> t38, and NT42 has multiple rules, including NT42 -> NT8 NT52, which could eventually lead to t38.\n\nAlternatively, since S starts with NT41 and NT23, I need to see if the string starts with the expansion of NT41 and NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 -> 't83', which is the terminal t83. So the second part of S is straightforward: 't83'.\n\nNow, the first part is NT41. Let's see the possible expansions:\n\nNT41 can be either NT34 NT49 or t13. But in the string, the first token is t10, which doesn't match t13, so we must have NT41 expanding into NT34 and NT49.\n\nSo, NT41 -> NT34 NT49. Then, the next tokens would be from NT34 and NT49.\n\nNT34 -> t26. So the third token should be t26. Looking at the string: after t10, it's t81, t84, etc. So that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the entire string to see if it can be matched by a derivation.\n\nAnother approach is to split the string into the products of each non-terminal at each step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so in the derivation, each non-terminal will expand into a sequence of terminals and other non-terminals. The key is to match the string by expanding the non-terminals appropriately.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT41 NT23.\n\nNT23 is 't83', so that's the last part. The string ends with ... t28, which is the terminal. So that's correct.\n\nNow, NT41: in the grammar, NT41 has two possible productions: NT34 NT49 and t13. Since the string starts with t10, which isn't t13, we might have NT41 expanding into NT34 and NT49. So after 't83', we should have the expansion of NT41, which starts with NT34.\n\nNT34 -> t26. The next token in the string after t10 and t83 is t81. So that's not t26. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should split the string into parts that correspond to each non-terminal's expansion.\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the sequence of non-terminals and see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each part of the string corresponds to a specific production.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the derivation step by step.\n\nGiven that S -> NT41 NT23, and NT23 is 't83', so the string starts with something derived from NT41 and ends with 't83' preceded by whatever comes from NT41 and the string before that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into the two parts: the first part from NT41 and the second part from NT23. Since S is NT41 NT23, the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT41 and NT23.\n\nBut wait, the string is a linear sequence, so it's possible that NT41 expands into some part and NT23 into another, but they need to be concatenated. Since the string starts with t10, t81, etc., and ends with t83, perhaps I can check if the start of the string can be generated by NT41 and the end by NT23.\n\nBut the end is 't83', so NT23 must produce that, which it does. So the last token is correctly generated by NT23.\n\nNow, the first part must be generated by NT41, which is the part of the string before the last 't83'. But wait, the last token is t83, which is the second part of S. So the first part should be the expansion of NT41. Let me check how many tokens are before that.\n\nThe string is 37 tokens. T83 is the 37th token. So tokens 1 to 36 are the expansion of NT41. Let me see: from 1 to 36.\n\nBut this is quite long. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the production of NT41 and see if the initial part can trace through.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\nNT23 -> 't83' (terminals only) so that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, NT41 can either produce t13 or split into NT34 and NT49. The string starts with t10, not t13, so NT41 must split into NT34 and NT49.\n\nSo NT41 becomes NT34 and NT49.\n\nNow, the expansion begins with NT34 and NT49.\n\nNT34 -> 't26' (terminal). So the second token in the expansion (token 2) should be t26. However, looking at the string, the second token is t81, not t26. That's a problem. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, this is token 1: t10, token 2: t81, etc. So after token 1 (t10), the next tokens are t81, t84, etc. So maybe I'm miscounting the tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string is all interconnected, and each token is a separate element. So the first part is t10, then t81, t84, etc.\n\nSo perhaps I should model the entire string as a sequence that needs to be split into the product of NT41 and NT23, each expanded.\n\nWait, but the production is S -> NT41 NT23, so the entire string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT41 and NT23. Since NT23 is 't83', the last token of the string is t83.

{"custom_id":"request-604","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't26', 't33', etc. First, I should understand how the grammar works and how the string is constructed.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production either generates two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo S can generate either NT41 followed by NT23 or NT41 followed by NT58. That means the string will start with whatever NT41 and NT23 or NT58 produce.\n\nNow, looking at the NT productions, each NT is either a terminal or another non-terminal. Some NTs have rules that produce two other NTs, and others directly produce a terminal or a fixed string. For example, NT23 \u2192 't83'. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't35', NT28 \u2192 't7', etc.\n\nI notice that each 't' sequence is a terminal, so the entire string is built by expanding the NTs until we reach these terminals. The task is to check if the given string can be derived from S.\n\nThe string is: t26 t33 t9 t71 t74 t37 t14 t17 t54 t26 t81 t11 t27 t49 t84 t66 t57 t64 t9 t35 t83 t81 t19 t22 t64 t84 t8 t14 t33 t65 t57 t66 t59 t64.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the string into tokens for clarity:\n\nt26, t33, t9, t71, t74, t37, t14, t17, t54, t26, t81, t11, t27, t49, t84, t66, t57, t64, t9, t35, t83, t81, t19, t22, t64, t84, t8, t14, t33, t65, t57, t66, t59, t64.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either adds two symbols, so the length of the string should be 2^n - 1 where n is the number of splits, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Maybe not, as the terminals have variable lengths. Wait, no, each NT production either produces two non-terminals or one terminal. So each expansion step can potentially increase the number, but some steps may just add a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each step can result in either two symbols or one. So for the entire string, each symbol in the string corresponds to a path from the root to a leaf. Each symbol can be T, N, or another N, depending on the split.\n\nBut the given string is all 't's and numbers. Since N non-terminals produce other Ns, perhaps the string is built by expanding Ns into terminals.\n\nMaybe I should build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate this string.\n\nAlternatively, I can reverse the process and see if the string can be reduced to S using the grammar's inverse rules. That is, checking if the string can be reduced step by step by applying inverse productions.\n\nLet me think about that approach. So starting from the full string, I can try to replace the leftmost symbols using the grammar's productions, working my way to the root S.\n\nBut the grammar needs to be inverted for this. Each production rule in the forward direction can be reversed for the reduction process.\n\nSo, for every production A \u2192 BC, the inverse would allow us to replace BC with A. Similarly, if A \u2192 a, then in the inverse, 'a' is replaced by A.\n\nTherefore, to reduce the string, I'll check each possible way to split the string into parts that match a production's right-hand side, starting from the left.\n\nLet's see the possible ways to split the first few tokens.\n\nThe string starts with t26 t33 t9...\n\nLooking at the grammar, what produce t26 t33?\n\nLooking at the NT tables, let's see if any NT can produce t26 and another symbol.\n\nLet me check each NT:\n\nFrom the NT definitions:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT28 \u2192 't7' (28\u2192t7)\n- NT33 \u2192 't26' (33\u2192t26)\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking for NT rules starting with 't26', 't33', etc.\n\nWait, in the NT definitions, looking for NT rules that produce t26:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, NT26 is not present because in NT rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't19'\n- NT31 \u2192 't38'\n- NT24 \u2192 't63'\n- NT58 \u2192 't17'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT36 \u2192 't63' (twice)\n- NT28 \u2192 't7' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to create a map of which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT49 \u2192 't57'? Wait, no. Let me go line by line.\n\nLooking for each NT definition:\n\nNT24: NT28 NT2 NT33 \u2192 NT24 \u2192 't63' (twice)\nWait no, in NT24's rule: \"NT24 -> 't9'\" Wait, no:\n\nWait the grammar has:\n\nNT24 -> 't63'\n\nWait, let me re-examine:\n\nThe NT definitions:\n\n- NT24: 't9'\n\n- NT28: 't7'\n\n- NT33: 't26'\n\n- NT36: 't63' twice.\n\n- NT49: 't57'\n\nWait, I think I need a list of all NTs and their possible productions.\n\nIt's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps I can create a mapping of each NT to its productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Since each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal, perhaps I can check if the string can be generated by the grammar by building a tree.\n\nAlternatively, using the leftmost derivation approach.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so that might not be practical.\n\nAnother approach: let's see the string's components and see if they fit any paths in the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t26, t33, t9, etc.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t26: Looking through the grammar, NT34 \u2192 't26', yes. So NT34 can produce t26.\n\nSimilarly, looking at t33, which NT produces that. Looking at the rules, let's see:\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 t33.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the NT definitions again:\n\n- NT33: 't9' as per the rule \"NT33 -> 't9'\" yes. Also, looking for others.\n\nSo the first two symbols are t26 and t33. That would correspond to the NT34 producing t26, and NT33 producing t9. Wait, but the third symbol is t9, which is the third in the triplet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should figure out if the string can be formed by some combination of NTs being expanded into terminals.\n\nAnother way: consider that each production (except those that produce terminals) adds one symbol to the string.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which is a single symbol. So each step produces either two symbols or one.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production can have exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. Oh, wait, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right. So the rule for NT41 is NT34 NT49, which are both non-terminals, so each step adds two non-terminals, but when they are eventually replaced by terminals, the string can have as many as 2^n symbols, but in this case, the length is 36, which is 2^6 - 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a series of 't's and see if each 't' can be assigned to a path in the grammar.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to check each step in the string, building up from the start.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string as a leftmost derivation:\n\nThe string is: t26 t33 t9 t71 t74 t37 t14 t17 t54 t26 t81 t11 t27 t49 t8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-621","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce terminal symbols. The grammar provided has a lot of non-terminals (like S, NT27, etc.) and some production rules that replace them with either two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. The string is: `t49 t11 t63 t37 t27 t22 t62 t10 t54 t13 t19 t11 t65 t8 t22 t84 t14 t65 t37 t14 t7 t28 t58 t65 t24 t26 t19 t8 t65 t27 t66 t22 t26 t74 t66`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. Since it's in CNF, each production either expands a non-terminal to two non-terminals or to two terminals. So, the derivation starts from the start symbol S and applies these rules step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce two non-terminals: NT41 NT23 (rule 1) or NT41 NT58 (rule 2). So, the first step is choosing between these two options. Depending on which is chosen, the next steps will branch accordingly.\n\nLet me look at the string. It starts with t49, which is a terminal. I need to see if t49 can be derived from any rule. Looking through the production rules, I see that NT41 -> t13 (rule 42) and NT34 -> t26, but wait, t49 is directly a terminal. Hmm, checking the rules again, I don't see any NT directly producing t49. Wait, maybe I missed it. Looking more carefully, I see that NT49 is not in the productions; NT41 -> t13. Wait, that's not right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT43 -> NT16 NT7 (rule 7), NT36 -> t9, etc. Looking for t49, I don't see any production rule for NT49 directly producing t49. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me check all the production rules for terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> t9\n- NT28 -> t26\n- NT36 -> t22\n- NT24 -> t49 (rule 24)\n- NT24 -> t33\n- NT2 -> t33\n- NT15 -> t71\n- NT34 -> t26\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT33 -> t63 etc.\n\nWait, so NT24 has a production rule NT24 -> t49 (rule 24). So, to derive t49, we need to have NT24 somewhere in the derivation. That means the production that leads to NT24 must be used. So, for example, S could produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. If the first part is NT41, and then NT23, which leads to t65, but wait, looking at NT23: it's a terminal? Let me check.\n\nIn the rules, I see NT23 -> t83 (rule 107), yes. So, if S expands to NT41 NT23, then we'd get t83 as a terminal. But our string starts with t49, so that path can't be taken. Alternatively, S could expand to NT41 NT58. Let's see what NT58 does. NT58 -> t17? Or maybe through another rule.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT58 -> NT15 NT24 (rule 5). So, NT58 expands to NT15 and NT24. Then, NT24 can expand to t49. So, if the string starts with t49, that suggests that we go through S -> NT41 NT58, then NT58 -> NT15 NT24, NT24 -> t49.\n\nSo, the first part of the derivation would be S -> NT41 NT58. Then, NT58 -> NT15 NT24. Let's see what comes after t49 in the string: it's t11, t63, etc. So after t49, we have t11. That means after NT24, we have to get to NT15.\n\nWait, but NT15 -> t71 (rule 18). Hmm, but t11 is a terminal. Let me check if any non-terminal expands to t11. Looking through the rules, I don't see an NT directly producing t11. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking again: NT55 -> NT22 NT27, NT58 -> NT15 NT24, NT52 -> NT12 NT37, NT52 -> NT30 NT49, NT37 -> NT58 NT32, NT37 -> NT41 NT10, NT33 -> NT36 NT26, etc. Hmm, maybe t11 isn't directly produced. Wait, perhaps t11 comes from another path. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe after NT15, which is t71, but t71 isn't in our string. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine.\n\nThe string starts with t49, then t11. So, after NT24 (which is t49), the next symbol is t11. So, the next symbol must be derived from NT15, because after S -> NT41 NT58, which gives t83, that can't be. Wait, no, S -> NT41 NT58 becomes NT41 and NT58. Then, NT41 can expand to NT34 NT49. So, NT41 -> NT34 NT49. So, after S -> NT41 NT58, we have NT34 and NT49.\n\nBut the first symbol is t49, which comes from NT49. Wait, but NT49: looking at the rules, I don't see NT49 having a production, only NT24. Oh wait, no, I'm looking at the rules for NT49, but in the production rules, there's NT24 -> t49. So, perhaps I'm getting confused between NT24 and another NT. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the rules, I see NT24's production: NT24 -> t49 and NT24 -> t33. So, NT24 can produce either t49 or t33. So, for the string to start with t49, we need to have a path where NT24 is derived from a non-terminal and then expands to t49.\n\nLooking back at how S can expand: S -> NT41 NT23 or S -> NT41 NT58. If it's the second option, S -> NT41 NT58, then NT58 can expand to NT15 NT24. So, we have NT15 and NT24. NT24 can then expand to t49 or t33. But our string starts with t49, so we pick t49 from NT24. Then, the next part is t11, which is t11.\n\nAfter t49, we have t11. So, the next symbol is t11. That suggests that NT24 expands to t49, and then something else. But NT24 can't directly produce t11. Wait, unless there's a rule I'm missing. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps after NT15, which is a terminal? Let me check. No, NT15 -> t71. But t71 is not in the string. So, after NT58 -> NT15 NT24, we have t71 (from NT15) and t49 (from NT24). But our string starts with t49, so that path isn't possible. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the steps. Maybe the correct path is S -> NT41 NT58, which gives NT41 and NT58. Then, NT58 expands to NT15 and NT24. Then, after that, what happens?\n\nWait, no, because the string starts with t49, which would require NT24 to produce t49.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules. The string is a sequence of terminals: t33, t63, t54, t63, t63, t35, t27, t19, t22, t28, t83, t9, t27, t49, t65, t54, t84, t37, t49, t10, t38, t22, t84, t65, t57, t63, t35, t74, t59, t84, t35, t54, t9, t58, t24.\n\nThe grammar has a start symbol S which branches into two NT27, as per S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Wait, no\u2014the first production is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and the second is S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So S always starts by deriving NT41 and NT23 or NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t33. Let me check where t33 comes from. In the grammar, t33 is derived from NT34 \u2192 t26, NT36 \u2192 t9, or NT42 \u2192 t49. Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at the NT33 entries: It says NT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49, and also a rule where NT33 is reduced to t26 or t63 or t54. Wait, no:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT33, the productions are:\n\nNT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\nAnd some others where NT33 is replaced by t26, t54, t63.\n\nWait, actually, the entries show:\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT59\n\nWait, no, let me look again:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT59\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar provided has for NT33 several productions.

Wait, no, looking at the user's grammar:\n\nThe user provided grammar is a block, probably with each rule as a line. So, for NT33, the user has:\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT59\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me re-examine the user's grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT33, the relevant productions are:\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26 (line 25)\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT59 (line 26)\n\nAnd then:\n\nNT33 -> t9 (line 29)\n\nWait, no. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe grammar as provided includes:\n\nLine 22: NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\nLine 25: NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\nLine 26: NT33 -> NT36 NT59\n\nLine 29: NT33 -> t9\n\nLine 34: NT36 -> t15, etc.\n\nWait, no, in the user's grammar, the NT33 rules are:\n\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT59\n\n- And in another line, under NT3? Wait, let me find all NT33 rules.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the NT33 productions:\n\nNT33 appears at lines 22, 25, 26, and 34? Wait, no, line 34 is NT39.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar:\n\nNT33 -> NT12 NT49 (line 22)\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26 (line 25)\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT59 (line 26)\n\nAnd then:\n\nWait, the user's grammar under NT33 includes line 34: NT33 -> t9.\n\nWait, no, the user's grammar lists each rule as separate lines. Let me check.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT33 occurs in:\n\nLine 18: NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\nLine 25: NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\nLine 26: NT33 -> NT36 NT59\n\nLine 34: NT33 -> t9\n\nAnd another line: NT36 -> t9 (line 28?)\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Maybe I should create a list of all NT33 productions to avoid confusion.\n\nIn the user's grammar, under NT33:\n\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49 (line 18)\n\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26 (line 25)\n\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT59 (line 26)\n\n- NT33 -> t9 (line 34)\n\nSimilarly, under NT33, there's line 48? Wait, no, line 42 is under NT18.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's grammar lists all rules under each non-terminal. Let me find all NT33 rules.\n\nLooking through:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\n...\n\nFor NT33:\n\n- Line 18: NT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49\n\n- Line 25: NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26\n\n- Line 26: NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT59\n\n- Line 34: NT33 \u2192 t9\n\n- Line 45: NT33 \u2192 t63\n\nWait, line 34 is NT33 -> t9, and line 45 is NT33 -> t63.\n\nSo NT33 can be t9, t63, or it can produce NT12 NT49 or NT36 NT26 or NT36 NT59.\n\nBut looking at the string, I see a t33. Wait, no, the string has t33 as the first symbol. Wait, wait, the string provided is:\n\nt33 t63 t54 t63 t63 t35 t27 t19 t22 t28 t83 t9 t27 t49 t65 t54 t84 t37 t49 t10 t38 t22 t84 t65 t57 t63 t35 t74 t59 t84 t35 t54 t9 t58 t24.\n\nWait, the string starts with t33, but according to the grammar, I don't see a rule that derives t33. All NT33 rules are as above. There is no direct production for t33; only for t9, t63, etc.\n\nHmm, this is a problem because if the string starts with t33, but there's no production that directly yields t33, then the string can't be generated by this grammar. Because to have a terminal t33, there must be a rule where NT33 \u2192 t33, which isn't present here.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar provided by the user to see if I missed any t33 terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the lines are:\n\n- NT24 -> t49\n\n- NT28 -> t26\n\n- NT36 -> t9\n\n- NT37 -> t62\n\n- NT35 -> t62\n\n- NT36 -> t22\n\n- NT36 -> t54\n\nWait, the user's NT33 productions are:\n\n- NT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT59\n\n- NT33 -> t9\n\n- NT33 -> t63\n\nSo no, there is no rule that NT33 \u2192 t33.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t33, which cannot be derived from the grammar because there's no such production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-627","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the provided grammar. It's a big one with a lot of non-terminal rules. Each production seems to be splitting into two parts, either more non-terminals or terminals. Some of them replace non-terminals with specific terminal strings, like NT41 \u2192 't13'. I'll note that some non-terminals directly reference terminals, which might mean they can't split further\u2014those would be the leaf nodes in this grammar tree.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is quite long: `t58 t49 t28 t71 t71 t66 t37 t33 t83 t7 t24 t17 t57 t62 t7 t74 t59 t14 t26 t8 t17 t27 t49 t13 t38 t7 t59 t65 t27 t9 t57 t63 t66 t59 t8 t62`. \n\nI think the best approach is to parse this string using the given grammar and see if it's possible to derive the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's suitable for a recursive descent parser or something similar, but I might not have to write the parser, just check if the string can be constructed by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to see if I can group the string into a series of non-terminals. Each non-terminal in the grammar produces two parts, which correspond to two symbols in the string. Sometimes, a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, which would mean that part is fixed.\n\nLooking at some of the rules:\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT35 \u2192 NT62\n- So, if I start with S, I have two parts: NT41 and NT23. Each of these would then split into their own components.\n\nLet me break down the string into pairs according to the grammar. Each production rule produces two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So the string length should be a power of two multiplied by the initial production steps, but given the string is 64 symbols long, it's likely 2^6=64, so each step has divisions by 2 each time until we reach the terminals.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the string should start with NT41 and NT23.\n\nLooking at the string: The first part is t58 t49. Let's check NT41 and NT23. \n\nWait, NT41 is a non-terminal that produces 't13' directly, so the rule NT41 \u2192 't13'. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 't83'. But the first two symbols are t58 and t49. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, NT41 is part of S production as S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So after S, we get NT41 and NT23. If NT41 \u2192 t13, and NT23 \u2192 t83, then from S, the first two symbols in the string should be 't13 t83'. But the string starts with 't58 t49 t28...', which is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if S can produce the entire string by recursively applying the productions. Let's see.\n\nWait, S is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and each of these can be either a terminal or a further non-terminal.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is t58. Let's check what NT58 can produce.\n\nIn the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, which further splits. NT15\u2192 t71, NT24\u2192 t63. So NT58 would produce t71 t63. But the first symbol is t58, which should be the terminal 't58', but from the grammar, NT58 doesn't produce 't58'; instead, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, which produce t71 t63. So the first token t58 must come directly from a non-terminal that produces t58. Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see any rule that directly says NT58 \u2192 't58'... Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, looking back, let me check all the rules. I see NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, and NT24 \u2192 t63, NT15\u2192 t71. So NT58 produces t71 t63. So the first two symbols should start with a production that leads to t71 t63, but the string starts with t58. So that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let's clarify: each production in the grammar is in the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So NT58 can produce either 't... some terminal' or another non-terminal. Looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n\nSo NT58 doesn't produce t58; instead, it's a non-terminal that needs to produce two parts. The string starts with 't58', but according to the grammar, NT58 can't directly produce 't58', so the first symbol must come from a non-terminal that directly produces it.\n\nLooking through the rules, are there any non-terminals that directly produce t58? Looking at the list, I see NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, which doesn't produce t58. Similarly, NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27, and NT37 \u2192 't84' or 't64' or other terminals. Wait, looking for any non-terminal that directly produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the rules, some have 'a' at the end:\n\nNT41 \u2192 t13\nNT5 \u2192 t5 t43\nNT35 \u2192 t62\nNT27 \u2192 t9\nNT43 \u2192 t62\nNT52 \u2192 t12 (looking back: wait, earlier rules, some like NT52 \u2192 t12 t37, others like NT52 \u2192 t8 ... Hmm, perhaps I should list all the terminals:\n\nIn the rules, when a non-terminal is directly assigned a terminal string, like:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43 : No, that's a production, so it's a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the ones that end with '\u2192' then some letters:\n\nNT41 \u2192 t13\nNT5 \u2192 NT5 is part of NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43, which is a production. So NT5 is non-terminal, doesn't directly produce a terminal.\n\nNT35 \u2192 t62\nNT43 \u2192 t62\nNT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, which doesn't produce a single terminal.\n\nNT15 \u2192 t71\nNT58 \u2192 produces t15 t24? Wait, no. NT58's rules all split further.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let's look again:\n\nLooking for any non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the rules, it seems that NT35 \u2192 t62, NT41 \u2192 t13, NT58 \u2192 t15 t24, which doesn't produce a terminal. Similarly, other non-terminals split into more non-terminals or produce terminals.\n\nSo which non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nNT35 \u2192 t62\nNT41 \u2192 t13\nNT58 \u2192 t15 t24\nOther rules like NT43 \u2192 t62\nWait, NT43 \u2192 t62.\n\nSo NT43 directly produces t62. Similarly, NT35 and NT41 do as well.\n\nSo the string may start with t13 (from NT41), or t62 (from NT43), or other terminals from other non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t58. So does any non-terminal directly produce t58? From the rules provided, I don't see any NT directly producing t58. The only production that starts with NT58 is NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24.\n\nTherefore, the first token in the string must be t58, which can't be produced by any non-terminal directly or through splitting because NT58 is part of a splitting production. Therefore, the string can't start with t58 because the only way to derive t58 is through a non-terminal that directly produces it, but none do.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the rules again.

{"custom_id":"request-624","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a good structure because it simplifies parsing. CNF requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can go to a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, but I think I'm mixing it up. Let me confirm: Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to have two non-terminals, except the start symbol which can go to a terminal, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe the grammar provided isn't exactly in CNF because some terminals are on the right side. But perhaps that's okay for this problem.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, where NT is a non-terminal and x, y, z are numbers. Then, some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals, like NT8 \u2192 't33'. So, the end symbols are just single characters, like t33, t37, etc., up to t9, t17, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t37 t65 t57 t24 t35 t27 t58 t17 t71 t84 t37 t22 t74 t10 t35 t35 t71 t27 t14 t74 t26 t66 t24 t8 t64 t27 t54 t57 t19 t28 t66 t9 t8 t49 t84 t58.\n\nFirst, I need to parse this string into a sequence of tokens, each being a string like 't37', 't65', etc.\n\nNow, the approach is to use the grammar to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar has S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so the entire string must be a concatenation of the rules for NT41 and NT23.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts. Since the string starts with t37, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't81'\n- NT10 \u2192 't28'\n- NT12 \u2192 't8'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT18 \u2192 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't19'\n- NT24 \u2192 't26'\n- NT27 \u2192 't9'\n- NT33 \u2192 't36'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT37 \u2192 't84'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT43 \u2192 't62'\n- NT5 \u2192 't66'\n- NT58 \u2192 't17'\n- NT65 \u2192 Hmm, wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT65. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, some of the NTs produce single terminals, but not sure about 65. Let's check: NT37 \u2192 't84', NT23 \u2192 't19', etc. But wait, looking at the rules, is there a production for NT58? Yes, NT58 \u2192 't15' and 't24' (from some rules). Wait, in the list given: for NT58: 't15' and 't24' is part of NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. But I also see NT58 \u2192 't74' in another production. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have some rules like NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, but also NT58 \u2192 't15' and 't24'? Or am I misreading. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n- NT58 also appears in other rules, but I don't see a production where NT58 directly maps to a terminal. Wait, the rule for NT58 is: NT58 \u2192 't15' and 't24'? No, in the given list, I think all the NTs that are on the left of the production are connected to others, except for some terminals. Wait, actually, looking at the given grammar, each production seems to have two non-terminals on the right until certain points where it's a terminal. Wait, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, for example, the first rule is S \u2192 NT41 NT23.

{"custom_id":"request-640","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each step in the derivation either combines two symbols into another or replaces a non-terminal with a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the string we need to evaluate: `t64 t57 t63 t63 t57 t9 t26 t11 t7 t27 t38 t7 t35 t10 t38 t24 t37 t37 t27 t66 t65 t24 t22 t49 t7 t62 t65 t8 t19 t58 t71 t57 t37 t63 t71 t10 t59`. That's a lot of terminal symbols, so I need to see how they can be built using the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and according to the rules, S can go to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me check if the string starts with 't64' or something that could be part of NT41 or NT58. Looking at the productions, NT37 can go to 't84' or 't83', but that doesn't match the start. NT43 is 't62', and NT41 is 't13'. Wait, another production: NT30 can go to 't37' and 't66'\u2014so maybe NT30 is involved.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't64', which corresponds to NT3's production. Because in the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't64'. So does the string start with NT3? But our start symbol S can only produce combinations of two non-terminals initially. So perhaps the string starts with something that can derive from S.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be broken down step by step. Each step is a production, either replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 38 terminals. Let's count the length. Each step of a CFG derivation doubles the length (for non-terminals to terminals) or increases by one (non-terminals to non-terminals). Since the string is 38 symbols, it's an even number, which is possible.\n\nStarting from S, which can produce two non-terminals. Let's consider the first few symbols. The string starts with 't64', which is from NT3. So the first part is NT3, which can only be from NT3's production, which is 't64'. But NT3 is a non-terminal, so in the derivation, S must somehow reach NT3 as a sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start rule is S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Neither of those directly produce NT3. So perhaps we can get NT3 by combining other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at other rules: for example, NT35 \u2192 NT10 NT1, but NT1 isn't even defined. Wait, let's check all the productions. I see NT33 can go to NT12 NT49, which are further non-terminals. But none of these directly lead to NT3.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps there's no way to get NT3 from the start symbol. Because the start symbol's rules only produce NT41 and NT23 or NT58. So to get 't64', which is NT3, we need to have a way from the start symbol to get into NT3.\n\nBut NT33 is 't36' or 't33'. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLet me list some rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84' or 't83'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't36' or 't33'\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to map out the terminals and see if they can be built from the start symbol.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't64', which is NT3's production. But NT3 is a non-terminal, so in the derivation, S must somehow lead to NT3. But S's rules are S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Neither of these directly produce NT3. So to get NT3 into the string, there must be rules that generate NT3 as a combination of other non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, is there any way to get NT3 from other non-terminals? Let's check the productions.\n\nLooking at NT33: it's NT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16, and NT16 is 't8', which is a terminal. So NT16 \u2192 't8'. NT32 \u2192 't24' or 't7'. NT15 \u2192 't71'. Wait, perhaps I can find a chain.\n\nWait, this might get too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string backwards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm could help, but since I'm doing this manually, let's try to see if each symbol can be generated by some production.\n\nAnother approach: check if all the terminals in the string can be derived by the rules. If any symbol in the string cannot be derived, then the string is invalid.\n\nLet's list the symbols in the string again to check:\n\nt64, t57, t63, t63, t57, t9, t26, t11, t7, t27, t38, t7, t35, t10, t38, t24, t37, t37, t27, t66, t65, t24, t22, t49, t7, t62, t65, t8, t19, t58, t71, t57, t37, t63, t71, t10, t59.\n\nFirst, 't64' is from NT3. So somehow, in the derivation, we must have NT3 or a combination that can produce NT3. Since NT3 is a non-terminal, it must be derived from other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT3's production: S can't directly derive it, but perhaps through other rules. Let's check the production rules that can lead to NT3.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I don't see any rule that produces NT3 except NT3 \u2192 't64'. So unless we have a way to derive NT3 from other non-terminals, it won't be present.\n\nBut in the start rule, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So NT41 can produce 't13' and NT23 \u2192 't83'. So the first step of S would produce 't13' and 't83'. But the string starts with 't64'. That doesn't match. Alternatively, S can produce NT41 and NT58. NT41 \u2192 't13', NT58 \u2192 't17'. So the first step would have 't13' and 't17'. Neither is 't64' or 't57' initially. So that approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the string is a combination of derivations that branch out more. Wait, maybe it's better to try to see if each symbol can be produced. For example, each symbol in the string must correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at 't64' \u2192 NT3, which is a terminal. So in the string, wherever 't64' appears, it must have been derived from NT3.\n\nSimilarly, 't57' \u2192 NT5, which can be derived from NT55 \u2192 't65', but perhaps via further rules. Wait, actually, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for 't57' \u2014 in NT37 \u2192 't57' is a production? Wait, no. In the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84' or 't83'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't66'\n\nWait, no, I need to check each production. So let me make sure.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I don't see NT41, for example, producing 't13' as above. But perhaps other paths.\n\nWait, another approach is to build a parse tree for the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is context-free, we can attempt to parse it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, consider each symbol in the string and see if it can be produced by any non-terminal. For example, 't64' can only be produced by NT3.

{"custom_id":"request-635","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I can use.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing, but in this case, I don't need to parse; I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t64 t71 t83 t83 t9 t24 t54 t63 t8 t11 t19 t37 t19 t58 t35 t49 t19 t38 t11 t63 t27 t65 t10 t37 t71 t33 t27 t19 t62 t35 t74 t7 t7 t11 t63 t11 t11`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each rule produces exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals. This CNF structure will be useful for breaking down the string step by step.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backwards from the string. Start from the entire string and try to split it into parts that match the grammar's production rules. Each time I split a part, I'll replace it with the corresponding rule until I reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet's begin. The string starts with `t64 t71`. Looking at the grammar, the only rule that produces `t64` is NT3 \u2192 't64'. So, the first part must be NT3.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, NT3 can only be followed by NT30. The production is NT30 \u2192 NT37 NT62. Wait, no, looking back, the rule is NT30 \u2192 't37' and 't62' because the last rule for NT30 is 't37' and NT62 is 't62'. Wait, the grammar states:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't37' and 't62', right? Because looking at the rules, for example, under NT30, the production is `NT30 -> 't37' 't62'`. So, NT30 can be split into `t37 t62`.\n\nSo, the next part after `t64 t71` would be `t71`, which must be part of NT71. Let me check the grammar. There's a rule NT15 \u2192 't71'. That's under NT15's production. Also, NT30 is 't37 t62', but that's not applicable here. Wait, the NT71 must be part of another rule. Let me check all the rules for NT71.\n\nLooking through the rules: I see NT15 \u2192 't71' and NT30 \u2192 't37' 't62', not NT71. Wait, perhaps another rule I'm missing. Let me scan the entire grammar. Hmm, the rules provided aren't in order, but looking at NT15, it can produce 't71'. So, the string after `t64` is `t71`. So, the first part is NT3 (t64) followed by NT15 (t71).\n\nSo now, the string is split into NT3 followed by NT15. Let's see if these can be derived from S. Remember, the start symbol is S, which has two rules:\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo, we need to see if either of these can be broken down into NT3 and NT15. Let's check each possibility.\n\nFirst, take S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So, we need to see if NT41 can produce the first part and NT23 the second part, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT41 NT58: we'd need NT41 and NT58 to produce NT3 and NT15.\n\nLet me explore both options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- So, NT41 must produce NT3, and NT23 must produce NT15, or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT41: The rule is NT41 \u2192 't13' and 't49'. So, NT41 can't produce NT3 ('t64'), because 't13' is not related to 't64'. So, this path doesn't work.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n- Now, we need NT41 to produce NT3 and NT58 to produce NT15, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but S is generating two parts: the first part (NT41) and the second part (NT58). We need to see if NT41 can produce the first tokens and NT58 can produce the second tokens, but in terms of the split of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if the string starts with a production that starts with NT41 or NT41 followed by something else.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's look at the string and see if it can be split into two parts via the S rules.\n\nThe complete string is 39 tokens long. So, if we take S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the part generated by NT41 and NT23 should each produce a certain sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the string could be split into NT41 and NT58, each producing their respective sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by splitting the entire string into two parts: one starting with NT41 and the other with NT23, or starting with NT41 and NT58.\n\nBut since the string is long, maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nThen, I need to split the string into two parts which are the sequences produced by NT41 and NT23, respectively.\n\nBut wait, perhaps more precisely, each rule application corresponds to a split in the string. So, for example, the string can be split into two parts: the first part is whatever NT41 produces, and the second part is what NT23 produces. Alternatively, with the other S rule, it would be NT41 and NT58 producing their respective parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to work recursively. Let me see.\n\nI can represent the current string as a list of tokens and try to match the leftmost symbols to the leftmost symbols of a production rule's right-hand side.\n\nEach production rule can be thought of as a possible split. So, for example, starting with S, we can try to split into NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58, and then further split each part as needed.\n\nLet me attempt this step by step.\n\n1. The entire string is: [t64, t71, t83, t83, t9, t24, t54, t63, t8, t11, t19, t37, t19, t58, t35, t49, t19, t38, t11, t63, t27, t65, t10, t37, t71, t33, t27, t19, t62, t35, t74, t7, t7, t11, t63, t11, t11]\n\n2. Let's start with the leftmost symbols. The first symbol is t64. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t64? Checking the rules, the only T64 is NT3: NT3 \u2192 't64'. So, the first part must be NT3, which is t64. So, the rest of the string after t64 must be generated by the other part of S's production.\n\nWait, S can split into either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58. So, after producing NT3, the other part would have to be from one of these.\n\nWait, but S's production is either [NT41, NT23] or [NT41, NT58]. So, in the first case, if NT3 is produced, then perhaps NT3 is NOT one of the parts of S's production? Because NT3 only produces 't64', not another non-terminal. So, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, in the grammar, NT3 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't64', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, if we reach NT3 in the parse, it directly produces 't64'. So, in the S productions, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58, meaning S produces two non-terminals.\n\nIn our case, the first token is 't64', which is produced by NT3.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my grammar rules, but let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, every production seems to fit that structure. So that's a good start; it's properly formed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string we need to evaluate is: `t81 t13 t63 t14 t11 t54 t9 t49 t66 t28 t35 t10 t22 t35 t35 t81 t59 t49 t13 t8 t58 t83 t24 t58 t59 t35 t33 t22 t66 t63 t83 t71 t83 t9 t58 t81 t63 t14`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that several non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and each of these NT terms eventually resolve to a 't' followed by some digits. So each terminal in the string must be the result of a production that directly terminates in a single 't' symbol.\n\nSo, my first thought is to map out the possible terminal outputs from each non-terminal. Let's list them:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t13\n- NT35 \u2192 t62\n- NT33 \u2192 t26 (from NT33 \u2192 t26)\n          or t63 (from NT33 \u2192 t63)\n- NT27 \u2192 t9\n- NT38 \u2192 t31\n          or t7\n- NT33 also appears again, so it can produce either t26 or t63.\n- NT12 \u2192 t8\n- NT55 \u2192 t65\n- NT22 \u2192 t8 (from NT22 \u2192 NT24 NT55 \u2192 t49 t65 which is t49 t65, but wait, t49 is another non-terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, NT43 \u2192 t62, so t49 is maybe from NT43? Wait, no, looking back: NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7, and NT16 is 't58', NT7 is 't58'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar again:\n\nIn the provided rules, there's an NT7 \u2192 't58' and NT43 \u2192 t62. So maybe some of the terminals are derived from these.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to map all the non-terminals that directly produce 't' symbols.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT5 \u2192 t5 (from NT55 \u2192 t5)\nWait, no: looking at NT rules:\n\nLooking at the list:\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\nWait, that's a recursive production, but then under NT55, NT22, etc., I see NT58 \u2192 t17, NT43 \u2192 t62, NT7 \u2192 t58. Wait, but that's a cycle because NT7 \u2192 t58, and NT58 \u2192 t17. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 t62, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t17 (so NT58 produces t17)\n- NT43 \u2192 t62 (so NT43 produces t62)\n- NT7 \u2192 t58 (NT7 produces t58)\n- NT36 \u2192 t9 (because NT49 \u2192 t57, and another rule says NT27 \u2192 t9)\nWait, NT27 \u2192 t9 (from NT27 \u2192 t9)\n- NT33 \u2192 t26 (from NT33 \u2192 t26) or t63 (from NT33 \u2192 t63)\nWait, but does NT33 have any other productions? Let me check:\n\nYes: NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26 or NT36 NT49. Wait, but NT49 \u2192 t57, so NT36 \u2192 t9, so NT36 \u2192 t9, which comes from NT33 \u2192 t26 (if NT36 \u2192 t9 and NT26 is a terminal?) Wait, no\u2014looking at the rules, NT26 is actually a terminal: NT26 \u2192 t59?\n\nWait, no, let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at NT rules:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t9 (from NT36 \u2192 NT28 NT26 \u2192 t26? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each production as either a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, many of the non-terminals produce terminal strings directly. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43 \u2192 which may eventually resolve to a terminal, but I need to see if these are part of the string we're checking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to create a derivation tree for the given string and see if each step aligns with the grammar rules. But that could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, we can work backwards: for the given string, see if each 't' can be matched by a production in the grammar.\n\nEach token in the string is a 't' followed by numbers. For example, 't81', 't13', etc. So each of these must correspond to a production of a non-terminal that eventually produces that 't' string.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So each token must correspond to either a single 't' rule or a derived string from a non-terminal that produces two parts.\n\nWait, but perhaps each 't' followed by a numeral represents a single terminal. Wait, no, because the grammar's productions may produce sequences of terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so in the string, each NT must resolve to a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, each token is just a 't' followed by some digits, but I think the digits are just part of the terminal string. So 't81' is a single terminal symbol, perhaps. Or is it a part of a larger terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' followed by digits is a single terminal. For example, 't81' is a terminal, and 't13' is another. So each of these must be matched by a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only non-terminals that directly produce a single 't' are those with rules like NT5 \u2192 t5, but in the provided grammar, I don't see NT5 \u2192 t5. Instead, NT5 is split into NT5 NT43, which would imply that NT5 is composed of two non-terminals, so it can't produce a single terminal. Hmm, maybe that's an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the grammar works. Alternatively, maybe each 't' followed by a number is a specific non-terminal that produces that 't' as a terminal.\n\nLooking more carefully, the grammar's right-hand sides produce either a terminal (like 't81') or a combination of non-terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at the first part:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t13 (so NT41 can produce 't13')\n- NT35 \u2192 t62 (so NT35 can produce 't62')\n- NT33 \u2192 t26 or t63 (so NT33 can produce 't26' or 't63')\n- NT58 \u2192 t17\n- NT43 \u2192 t62\n- NT26 \u2192 t59 (looking at NT26's rules, if any. Wait, in the provided rules: NT26 is a non-terminal, but the rules don't directly give NT26 \u2192 t59. Instead, some non-terminals like NT7 \u2192 t58, and NT22 \u2192 t8, etc.\n\nSo perhaps each 't81', 't13', etc., are individual terminals in the language.\n\nThus, the grammar must have a production for every 't' token in the string, and each of those productions must be present in the grammar.\n\nSo for example, for the first token 't81', is there a production A \u2192 t81 in the grammar? Looking through, I don't see any rule for a non-terminal A that directly produces 't81'. The only rule I see is NT8 \u2192 t35, which is not 't81'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, perhaps a composite production might result in 't81'.

{"custom_id":"request-646","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. All terminals appear on the right side of the productions.\n\nFirst, let me recall that CNF grammars are particularly useful for parsing because they have a straightforward structure, and many parsing algorithms are designed for them. Since the grammar is given, I can simulate a bottom-up parsing approach, like the CYK algorithm, but since this is a single string, I might directly check if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t7 t58 t14 t38 t38 t33 t38 t33 t65 t38 t22 t59 t9 t38 t62 t58 t35 t37 t81 t38 t22 t17 t49 t8 t38 t64 t19 t17 t17 t11 t38 t62 t37 t26 t81 t54 t64 t62`. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions for S are:\n- S -> NT41 NT23\n- S -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo the string must start with either NT41 followed by NT23 or NT41 followed by NT58. However, looking at the string, the first token is t7. So I need to check if t7 can be derived from the left sides of the productions.\n\nWait a second, the first token is t7, and in the grammar, N terminals (like t7, t58, etc.) are directly replaceable by terminal symbols. Therefore, the string must start with a derivation that produces t7, which is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that NT41 can be t13, NT58 can be t74, among others. Specifically, the rule NT41 -> t13 is present, but the rule NT58 has a production NT58 -> t74. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t7. Is there a rule that produces t7?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't58'? Wait, no, the production for NT7 is not present in the given grammar. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't58' is in the last part. So yes, NT7 is 't58'.\n\nSimilarly, are there any other N terminals that produce t7? Wait, the rule is NT7 -> t58, meaning NT7 can be replaced by t58. So t7 is the terminal, and t58 is another terminal.\n\nWait, the first token in the string is t7. But according to the grammar, t7 is not a terminal but a non-terminal. Because in CNF, terminals are actual characters, but in this grammar, only the symbols like 't81', 't58', etc., are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up. In the grammar, terminals are written as strings in double quotes, while non-terminals are uppercase letters followed by numbers (like NT5, NT7, etc.).\n\nSo in the string, the first token is 't7', which is a terminal. So I need to see if t7 is a terminal in the grammar, which it is. Now, to see which production rules give t7.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't58'\n\nThat's the only production for NT7, so NT7 is t58. So t7 is not present as a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string's first token is t7, which is not defined in the grammar. This suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Does 't7' appear as a production or is it another symbol?\n\nLooking again at the rules, I see that NT7 is defined as 't58'. So t7 is a terminal, but it's only replaced by t58. So in the grammar, t7 is a terminal, but in the string, we have 't7' as a token, which would mean it's a terminal. But since the only non-terminal that produces t7 is NT7, and NT7 is 't58', that suggests that 't7' is not present in the string, but in the string it is.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me see: the string is given, and I need to parse it according to the grammar. So in the parse tree, the root is S, which must expand into either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the first part must be NT41 followed by NT23 or NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t7. Let me parse the possible NT41 production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT41 has the following production: NT41 -> NT34 NT49. So NT41 can't produce t7 directly. Wait, so NT41 is a non-terminal, and its production rules produce other non-terminals, not terminals. Therefore, in the derivation, the initial S can't directly produce a terminal like t7, because it starts with NT41 or NT41 again. So the first step would be to expand S into NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58, which are non-terminals, so the first token must be a non-terminal, not a terminal like t7.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t7, which is a terminal. Therefore, the string starts with a terminal, which can't be derived from the start symbol S because S produces non-terminals. Hence, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the grammar. The production S -> NT41 NT23 and S -> NT41 NT58. Both of these produce non-terminals, so after expanding S, the first token in the string should be a non-terminal, but the string starts with t7, which is a terminal. Therefore, the string starts with a terminal that cannot appear in any derivation starting from S.\n\nHence, the answer is No, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token might correspond to a rule in the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a terminal or two terminals and a non-terminal. Wait, no\u2014CNF allows productions of the form A->BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. But in this case, looking at the grammar, some rules seem to have only terminal symbols, which is a bit unusual because typically in CNF, variables produce exactly two terminals, but maybe it's a mix where some rules produce a single terminal.\n\nWait no, actually, the grammar given has rules that start with S, and each S production leads to two non-terminals, which then eventually expand to terminals. So the approach is to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S and breaking down the string into the production rules.\n\nLet me list the string again: t64 t84 t49 t24 t8 t19 t65 t81 t8 t63 t33 t27 t58 t83 t64 t9 t26 t9 t8 t54 t8 t57 t10 t74 t54 t14 t26 t13 t17 t37 t10 t37 t49 t74 t19 t83.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t64. Let me check the rules starting with NT64, but wait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see an NT64 rule. Wait, let me check.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S, and the initial rules are S -> NT41 NT23 or S-> NT41 NT58. Then there are rules for NT27, NT38, etc. I need to find possible expansions for each token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree from the string, working backward or forward. Maybe using dynamic programming for parsing, but since this is a small string, I can try to do it manually step by step.\n\nLet me think: The string starts with t64, which corresponds to NT64 -> 't64'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT36 -> 't63' and NT64 isn't in the rules as an intermediate step. Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string must correspond to a terminal derived from some non-terminal via a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals expand into terminals. For example, NT33 -> NT36 NT26, and NT36 -> 't63', NT26 -> 't26', so NT33 can derive t63 t26, which would be 't63 t26'. Similarly, NT12 -> NT32 NT16, and NT32 expands into 't24', NT16 \u2192 't81', so NT12 becomes 't24 t81'.\n\nWait, no. NT16 \u2192 't81', NT32 \u2192 't24', so NT12 becomes 't24 t81'. So the string could have a part 't24 t81' as a result of NT12.\n\nLooking at the first token: t64. Let me check if t64 is derived from any NT. Looking through the rules, I see NT36 -> 't63', NT26 -> 't26', but wait, where is 't64' coming from? Hmm, looking at the rules, I don't see a direct rule for t64. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the NT7 rule is NT7-> 't58', but that's under NT7, which isn't relevant here. Let me go through the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking for t64: In the provided rules, I'm seeing NT36: NT36 -> NT26 NT15, and another rule NT36 -> NT22 NT28; also NT36 -> NT24 NT23; and NT36 -> NT54 NT26, as well as NT36 -> NT54 NT9, etc. Wait, maybe I'm missing some rules. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules: NT36 has several productions, like NT36 -> NT26 NT15, NT36 -> NT22 NT28, etc. But I don't see a direct NT64. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps t64 is in a different rule. Wait, let me check NT64 in the rules. Looking back, I don't see an NT64 rule. Then how does t64 fit into this? That's a problem because NT36 could derive some terminals, but none of them start with t64.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at the grammar again more carefully. Perhaps the rules are written differently, such as NT41 -> 't13' or something. Let's see.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see that NT23 -> 't83', NT58 -> 't74', etc. Wait, but where is t64 derived from? Maybe I missed it. Let me check each rule:\n\n- NT36: several rules but none seem to directly expand to 't64'.\n- NT24: several rules, including NT24 -> NT33 NT28, which then can expand into t63 t26 and t28 (t28 is 't26'), forming 't63 t26 t26'.\n- NT16 -> 't81'\n- NT33 has rules that can lead to 't63 t26' among others.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t64, which is not present in any direct production. So unless there's an NT that expands directly to t64, the string can't start with t64. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and missed a rule. Let me go through each production again to see if any of them directly produce 't64'.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT36: NT36 -> NT26 NT15 (so 't26 t15'), etc.\n- NT28: NT28 is either 't7' or NT18 NT37.\n- Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if any NT directly expands to 't64'. It doesn't seem so.\n\nTherefore, the first token t64 can't be generated by any rule in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-669","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing with algorithms like CYK possible, but I'm not sure if I need to get into that.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of a bunch of production rules for non-terminals like S, NT27, NT38, etc. Each non-terminal eventually expands into terminal symbols (t followed by a number). So the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is: `t59 t8 t27 t14 t54 t9 t81 t10 t37 t65 t74 t22 t33 t17 t37 t83 t81 t14 t63 t26 t83 t59 t33 t17 t65 t66 t63 t64 t54 t59 t57 t9 t59 t11 t74 t84 t83 t24 t26 t22`.\n\nI notice that there are 49 tokens here, each separated by a space. Each token is of the form 't' followed by a two-digit number and then another two-digit number. For example, 't59' would mean the terminal symbol with value 't' followed by the number 59, right? Wait, actually, I think it might be the other way around\u2014each token is 't' followed by a single digit and another digit or a combination. Hmm, no, maybe it's just a single letter t followed by a number, like 't' concatenated with two digits. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT41 expands to 't64'. Similarly, NT27 expands to 't9'. Wait, so each production rule for a non-terminal eventually reduces to a single 't' followed by two digits. So each production step ends with a terminal symbol, meaning the entire string is a series of these terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of these terminal symbols. So to check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if there's a way to parse the string using the given rules.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step is either expanding a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal. But since all the production rules are terminals eventually, it's a straight CNF with no nullable non-terminals (since all rules produce terminals or two non-terminals, and the non-terminals themselves expand into terminals).\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of terminals, the approach would be to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, maybe an easier way is to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. The CYK algorithm can determine whether a string is generated by a CNF grammar by looking at each step's possible non-terminals that can produce the substring.\n\nBut since I might not remember all the details of CYK, perhaps I can try to find if the string matches any of the productions or can be derived by combining smaller parts.\n\nFirst, let me see what the top-level productions are. The start symbol is S, which can produce:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nor\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo S splits into two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals must expand into a string of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT41 and NT58 in the rules:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\nNT49 \u2192 NT57 (from the rule NT49 -> NT57)\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me look carefully. Actually, NT49 expands to 't57' directly, so that's a terminal. So NT49 \u2192 't57'\n\nSame for NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49, which eventually becomes a terminal 't63' for NT26, and NT49 is 't57'.\n\nWait, let me break it down step by step.\n\nLet me pick the first part of S: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. NT26 \u2192 't83' according to the rules. NT49 \u2192 't57'. So NT34 becomes 't83 t57'.\n\nThen NT49 is 't57'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT49 in the given rules is NT49 \u2192 NT57, which is 't58'? Or wait, no\u2014I need to check the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT57\n\nAnd NT57 \u2192 't66'\n\nWait, but in another part: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nBut let's not get too tangled here. Maybe it's better to list all the terminals that each non-terminal can produce. Alternatively, perhaps we can start by trying to see which non-terminals produce certain terminals.\n\nWait, let's first see if the entire string can be divided into parts matching the top-level productions.\n\nThe string is: t59 t8 t27 t14 t54 t9 t81 t10 t37 t65 t74 t22 t33 t17 t37 t83 t81 t14 t63 t26 t83 t59 t33 t17 t65 t66 t63 t64 t54 t59 t57 t9 t59 t11 t74 t84 t83 t24 t26 t22.\n\nThat's quite long, over 40 tokens. Let's try to see how the string can be divided into parts consistent with the start symbol's productions.\n\nThe start symbol S can be divided into A B, where A and B are non-terminals that must each produce a string of terminals, with A being either NT41 or NT41 again, or NT41 in the first split and NT58 in the second.\n\nWait, S can be split into two parts, A and B. Each of A and B must be non-terminals that expand into a string of terminals.\n\nLooking at S's production:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\n\nor\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo the string must be split into two parts, from the first non-terminal and the second.\n\nLet's first check the first production: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the string needs to be split into two parts such that the first part is generated by NT41 and the second by NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it can be split there. The string is 49 tokens, so the split would be after some number of tokens. Let's assume that the entire string is a concatenation of two parts generated by NT41 and NT23.\n\nAlternatively, the second production S \u2192 NT41 NT58 would mean the string is split into two parts: first by NT41 and second by NT58.\n\nSo let's first consider S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the string would be split into two substrings: the first generated by NT41, and the second by NT23.\n\nSo we need to check if the string can be split into two parts accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, for the other production S \u2192 NT41 NT58, we'd look for a split point where the first part is generated by NT41 and the second by NT58.\n\nTo find this, perhaps we can look at the terminal strings that each non-terminal can produce. Or, better, maybe start with known terminal sequences and see if they match any suffix or prefix in the given string.\n\nLet me look at the given string to see if any of the known non-terminals can produce certain terminal sequences.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first token is t59.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals that directly produce a single terminal are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't64'\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t59, which doesn't appear directly as a production. Hmm, so we might need to find a non-terminal that can produce t59 as part of a longer sequence.\n\nWait, let's check all the rules for non-terminals:\n\nLooking for any rule of the form NT \u2192 'tXY' directly.\n\nLooking at NT58 \u2192 't55'? No. Wait, let me recheck all the rules.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't64'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT17 \u2192 't54'\n- NT22 \u2192 't52'? Wait, in the rules: NT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5.\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 't54' (from the rule NT17 \u2192 't17' as per the given grammar).

Similarly, others are like 't58', 't17', etc.\n\nSo, my plan is to see if I can split the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with the first part of the string, the sequence is t71 t59 t22 t27 t58 t19 t35 t71 t81 t33 t74 t54 t63 t8 t9 t63 t54 t81 t28 t38 t19 t10 t58 t8 t65 t38 t27 t9 t35 t13 t62 t74 t22 t38 t9 t57 t7 t26 t64 t17\n\nFirst, let's see what could be the root S. S has two productions: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t71 t59 t22 t27 t58 t19 t35 t71 t81 t33 t74 t54 t63 t8 t9 t63 t54 t81 t28 t38 t19 t10 t58 t8 t65 t38 t27 t9 t35 t13 t62 t74 t22 t38 t9 t57 t7 t26 t64 t17\n\nBut S produces two non-terminals, so the entire string must be divided into two parts, each part corresponding to a production of one of the non-terminals in S's rules.\n\nWait, but S is S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So the initial S's expansion is two non-terminals. The string starts with several terminals, so the first part must evaluate to NT41, and the second part to NT23 or NT58.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts:\n\nOption 1: First part is t71 t59 t22 t27 t58 t19 t35 t71 t81 t33 t74 t54 t63 t8 t9 t63 t54 t81 t28 t38 t19 t10 t58 t8 t65 t38 t27 t9 t35 t13 t62 t74\nAnd second part: t22 t38 t9 t57 t7 t26 t64 t17\n\nAlternatively, the split could be after more tokens, but perhaps the entire string can be divided into two parts that each correspond to the first two non-terminals in S's productions.\n\nBut looking at the string length, it's 37 tokens, which is odd. Since S is a two-symbol production, each symbol should be able to parse into their own subtrees. So that would imply that the entire string should be parsed as two parts, each being a full parse tree.\n\nBut 37 is odd, but in terms of nodes, perhaps the two subtrees have different lengths.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t24 t28 t74 t10 t57 t17 t37 t54 t9 t66 t49 t22 t24 t33 t83 t28 t83 t7 t19 t65 t11 t35 t83 t35 t38 t49 t59 t11 t7 t49 t11 t17 t63 t19 t81 t33 t26 t33 t26 t9 t81.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the terminals and see if they match any productions. Since the grammar has a mix of terminals and non-terminals, I can start from the top-level non-terminal S and see if I can derive the given string step by step.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So the first two symbols should be derived from either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t24. I need to find which non-terminal can produce t24.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT24 \u2192 t49, and also NT28 \u2192 t26, NT24 \u2192 t33, etc. But wait, in the string, the first symbol is t24. Let me check the productions where the right-hand side includes a terminal t24. Looking through all the rules, I see some NT24 rules: NT24 \u2192 t49, NT28 \u2192 t26, but no NT that directly produces t24. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

So the start string is S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the next symbols should come from NT41 and NT23.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that the right-hand side can also consist of a single terminal. But wait, in standard CNF, the productions are usually two non-terminals. However, some definitions allow a single terminal or a single non-terminal on the right-hand side. I might have to be careful here.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see all the productions except for \"NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\" and others. Wait, no, most seem to be of the form two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT41, which is two non-terminals. But some others are like NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43, which is also two non-terminals. So, I think this is indeed in CNF since each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal or a single non-terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, some productions have a single terminal, like NT3 \u2192 't63', or NT15 \u2192 't71', etc. So, in CNF, it's allowed for productions to have a single terminal, which is fine.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the string provided: \n\nThe string is: `t11 t71 t11 t9 t26 t65 t65 t28 t83 t66 t64 t27 t54 t49 t49 t62 t28 t10 t17 t84 t81 t71 t7 t54 t84 t74 t26 t54 t11 t62 t19 t17 t58 t11 t22 t54 t74 t54 t59 t28 t59`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar. Since the grammar is given in CNF and the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to parse it top-down or construct derivation trees.\n\nBut parsing manually might be tedious. Instead, maybe I can look for possible substitutions step by step, ensuring that each terminal matches the right-hand side of some production.\n\nFirst, let's note down the entire string as a sequence of tX, and see if each can be matched to a non-terminal rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each non-terminal production is either to two non-terminals or to a terminal. For example, NT3 \u2192 't63', so if I have 't63', that's a terminal, so in the string, each 'tX' is a terminal. So, the string is a series of terminals, each of which must correspond to a production end.\n\nGiven that, let's check the first few tokens to see how they might be formed.\n\nThe string starts with t11, t71, t11, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can find which non-terminals produce 't11' and 't71' etc.\n\nLooking through the end productions:\n\nI see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT11 appears as the result of productions like S \u2192 NT41 NT41, but directly, I don't see NT11 in the right-hand side of any production.

{"custom_id":"request-689","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nLet me first look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the production rules for S are S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So any string generated by this grammar starts with either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58 followed by other non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t7 t66 t19 t11 t81 t58 t7 t26 t11 t63 t24 t13 t27 t27 t14 t38 t10 t10 t22 t9 t74 t37 t33 t54 t19 t57 t8 t22 t17 t74 t17 t59 t81 t62 t22 t84 t9 t65 t17 t19 t66 t83`.\n\nI need to parse this string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parsing approach or perhaps convert it to a pushdown automaton. \n\nFirst, I notice that each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So each internal node in the parse tree will have exactly two children. The leaves will be the terminal tokens.\n\nStarting from S, the string must start with either NT41 or NT43 (since NT41 is a production leading to NT34 NT49, etc., and the other production from S is NT41 NT58). Wait, no, S's productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo the first part is either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58.\n\nLet me break down the string into pairs of terminals. The string is 40 tokens long, so that would be 20 pairs. Let's pair them:\n\n1. t7 t66\n2. t19 t11\n3. t81 t58\n4. t7 t26\n5. t11 t63\n6. t24 t13\n7. t27 t27\n8. t14 t38\n9. t10 t10\n10. t22 t9\n11. t74 t74\n12. t37 t33\n13. t54 t19\n14. t57 t8\n15. t22 t22\n16. t84 t9\n17. t65 t65\n18. t17 t17\n19. t59 t81\n20. t62 t62\n21. t22 t83\n\nWait, wait. The string has 40 tokens, but when I pair them as (1,2), (3,4), etc., I get 20 pairs. But let's check:\n\nWait, the string is: t7 t66 t19 t11 t81 t58 t7 t26 t11 t63 t24 t13 t27 t27 t14 t38 t10 t10 t22 t9 t74 t74 t37 t33 t54 t19 t57 t8 t22 t17 t74 t17 t59 t81 t62 t22 t84 t9 t65 t17 t19 t66 t83\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. t7\n2. t66\n3. t19\n4. t11\n5. t81\n6. t58\n7. t7\n8. t26\n9. t11\n10. t63\n11. t24\n12. t13\n13. t27\n14. t27\n15. t14\n16. t38\n17. t10\n18. t10\n19. t22\n20. t9\n21. t74\n22. t74\n23. t37\n24. t33\n25. t54\n26. t19\n27. t57\n28. t8\n29. t22\n30. t17\n31. t74\n32. t17\n33. t59\n34. t81\n35. t62\n36. t22\n37. t84\n38. t9\n39. t65\n40. t17\n41. t19\n42. t66\n43. t83\n\nWait, no, the string is: \n\n`t7 t66 t19 t11 t81 t58 t7 t26 t11 t63 t24 t13 t27 t27 t14 t38 t10 t10 t22 t9 t74 t74 t37 t33 t54 t19 t57 t8 t22 t17 t74 t17 t59 t81 t62 t22 t84 t9 t65 t17 t19 t66 t83`\n\nThat's 43 tokens. So each production is two symbols, except the start which is S.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. But in the given grammar, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the entire string should consist of a sequence of terminals generated by these productions.\n\nBut the starting symbol S is a non-terminal which produces two non-terminals, so each expansion step adds non-terminals until the entire string is generated.\n\nWait, but to parse the string, we can think of it as starting from S and deriving the string step by step. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and so on until we get all terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each consecutive pair of terminals in the string corresponds to some production rule that directly produces them. Because if each pair in the string matches a production, then it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is of the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a. So in this case, all productions are A \u2192 a or A \u2192 B C.\n\nSo the string must be such that each pair of consecutive symbols is either directly produced by a production (i.e., the two symbols are either terminals or produced by some non-terminals that expand further).\n\nBut in the string, all symbols are terminals except for non-terminals like NT34, NT35, etc. Wait, no, in the grammar, all the symbols on the left are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, no, the symbol is always a non-terminal unless it's a terminal. But in this grammar, all the symbols are non-terminals except for the terminals which are specific tokens like 't7', 't66', etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the RHS can have both non-terminals and terminals. For example:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT34 \u2192 t26\nNT49 \u2192 t57\n\nSo NT41 can produce t26 t57, which is a string of two terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the transitions between the symbols must match the grammar's production rules. So each two symbols in the string must correspond to a production rule in the grammar.\n\nLet me check the first part of the string:\n\nt7 t66\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there a production where a non-terminal A produces t7 t66? Looking through the productions, I don't see any production that leads directly to t7 and t66. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for a production that starts with a non-terminal and has t7 and t66 as the only terminals on the RHS. Scanning all the RHS:\n\nLooking for A \u2192 t7 t66.\n\nIn the given production rules, I don't see such a production. So perhaps t7 t66 is the production of a non-terminal, say NT7? But I don't see a production for NT7 \u2192 t7 t66.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t7 is generated by NT7, but I don't see such a production.\n\nWait, let's look for a production that includes NT7.

The productions are all from non-terminals that split into two other parts, each either a non-terminal or a terminal. So to produce 't10', somewhere in the chain, a production must have 't10' as one of the terminals.\n\nLooking through the given rules, none of the NTs directly produce 't10' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has specific structures that can sometimes make parsing easier, but in this case, we're just trying to check if a particular string is a possible derivation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see the production rules. It all starts with S, which can produce NT41 NT23 or other combinations. Each symbol on the left side of the grammar is broken down into two other symbols until you reach terminal symbols, which are the 't's followed by numbers.\n\nThe string given is: t38 t11 t71 t65 t66 t35 t64 t62 t17 t83 t54 t35 t71 t14 t22 t19 t27 t71 t9 t38 t65 t17 t14 t28 t33 t37 t63 t28 t62 t65 t19 t14 t74 t59 t10 t49 t54 t84 t71 t22 t63 t84 t54.\n\nI notice that each of these is a terminal symbol, so that's good because the grammar doesn't have any other terminals except those starting with 't'. I also need to check if the string can be broken down according to the production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into exactly two symbols, which can be either other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nOne approach is to try to parse the string from the top down using the grammar, but that might get complicated with so many symbols. Alternatively, I can consider the parse tree's structure. Each non-terminal must split into exactly two nodes, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if all the non-terminals in the string have production rules that can generate the necessary substrings. Let's list out the non-terminals in the string:\n\nLooking at the string, I see tokens like t38, t11, etc., which are terminals. The non-terminals would be any sequences that aren't 't's, but actually, wait\u2014the string is just a concatenation of 't' tokens. So each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the rest are... Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, the non-terminals are all the capital letters: S, N, T, etc. But in the string, the only tokens are 't's followed by numbers, so those are the terminals. So the entire string is a series of terminals, and so it should correspond to a series of productions starting from S and breaking down each non-terminal into terminals.\n\nSince S is the starting symbol, let's see if the string can start with the production of S.\n\nLooking at the grammar for S, S can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nSo the string should start with either NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58. Wait, no, because in the string, the first part is t38, which is a terminal. Let me check the productions for NT41.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT41 can produce NT34 NT49 or NT35 NT3.\n\nWait, but NT34 produces NT26, and NT26 produces NT15 NT59. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Alternatively, perhaps I should see if the given string can be broken down into the possible trees.\n\nAnother approach is to work from the string and see if it can be split into the required non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string is a series of 't's with numbers. Let me count how many tokens there are: let's see, counting commas as separators, the string is:\n\nt38, t11, t71, t65, t66, t35, t64, t62, t17, t83, t54, t35, t71, t14, t22, t19, t27, t71, t9, t38, t65, t17, t14, t28, t33, t37, t63, t28, t62, t65, t19, t14, t74, t59, t10, t49, t54, t84, t71, t22, t63, t84, t54.\n\nThat's 38 tokens. Wait, let me recount to make sure: let's see, each comma separates, so the tokens are:\n\n1. t38\n2. t11\n3. t71\n4. t65\n5. t66\n6. t35\n7. t64\n8. t62\n9. t17\n10. t83\n11. t54\n12. t35\n13. t71\n14. t14\n15. t22\n16. t19\n17. t27\n18. t71\n19. t9\n20. t38\n21. t65\n22. t17\n23. t14\n24. t28\n25. t33\n26. t37\n27. t63\n28. t28\n29. t62\n30. t65\n31. t19\n32. t14\n33. t74\n34. t59\n35. t10\n36. t49\n37. t54\n38. t84\n39. t71\n40. t22\n41. t63\n42. t84\n43. t54.\n\nWait, I just counted 43 tokens. Hmm, maybe I miscounted before. Let me check:\n\nThe original string: t38 t11 t71 t65 t66 t35 t64 t62 t17 t83 t54 t35 t71 t14 t22 t19 t27 t71 t9 t38 t65 t17 t14 t28 t33 t37 t63 t28 t62 t65 t19 t14 t74 t59 t10 t49 t54 t84 t71 t22 t63 t84 t54.\n\nBreaking it down token by token: each word is separated, so it's 43 tokens. That's a lot.\n\nSince the grammar is Chomsky normal form, each production splits into two parts, so each step in the derivation reduces the number of symbols by one. Starting from S, which is two symbols. But since it's a context-free grammar, the parse tree's leaves are the terminals, and the string should correspond to the leaves in order.\n\nBut with 43 tokens, that would require a derivation of length 42, which is quite deep, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible sequences of non-terminals that can lead to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reverse engineer the string. For instance, looking at the production rules, the terminals correspond to certain non-terminals splitting into terminal symbols. For example, let's see which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\nNT12 -> NT32 NT16\n\nNT8 -> NT33 NT3\n\nSo NT8 can be broken down: NT8 -> NT33 NT3.\n\nWait, NT3 is 't63' (from the mapping at the end: NT3 -> 't63').\n\nSo perhaps each NT could eventually break down into a terminal, depending on the rules.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe I should consider that the string provided is quite long, and 43 tokens would require a very deep parse. Alternatively, perhaps the string is constructed in a way that it can be broken down step by step according to the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the string can be constructed by sequentially expanding S, but that would take too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think about what the grammar can generate. Since all the tokens in the string are terminals, which are specific 't's, the grammar must have production rules that can derive those 't's.\n\nBut each 't' is a specific number, so each terminal corresponds to a specific production that leads to that 't'. But wait, looking at the end of the grammar, it seems that certain non-terminals are mapped to specific 't's:\n\nNT3 -> 't63'\n\nNT5 -> 't66'\n\nNT7 -> 't58'\n\nNT8 -> 't33'\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals and their corresponding 't's.\n\nLooking at the end mappings:\n\nNT3 -> 't63'\n\nNT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-699","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar given here seems to fit that structure because all the productions have a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the productions end with terminals or, in the case of some, are directly mapped to a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which means the start symbol S can be replaced by NT41 followed by NT23. These NTs are non-terminals, so each will eventually expand into a terminal symbol through the production rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t13 t22 t37 t64 t66 t8 t71 t33 t59 t14 t14 t7 t57 t49 t63 t11 t49 t64 t59 t64 t11 t74 t65 t13 t38 t27 t65 t7 t19 t11 t11 t63 t62 t9 t27 t71 t9 t37 t8 t63 t13 t63 t64`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules. \n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I know that any derivation must consist of a series of steps where each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and a terminal, etc.). However, in this case, maybe it's easier to see if each terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule.\n\nWait, let me clarify: Each production rule can only generate exactly two symbols. So for a string to be generated by this grammar, it must have a structure that can be broken down according to the production rules. \n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals expand directly to terminals, like NT41 \u2192 t13, NT38 \u2192 t28, etc. So each of these corresponds to a single terminal. But the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which would expand into two terminals. So the entire string should have an even number of terminals if we only consider sequences from S.\n\nWait, let's count the string:\n\nThe string has 37 't's. That's an odd number, which is problematic because each production adds exactly two symbols except when a non-terminal is expanded into a terminal. But since the grammar starts with S and each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of terminals in any derived string must be either equal to the number of non-terminals in the initial state or something similar. Wait, actually, the number of terminals in the derived string should be one more than the number of steps, but this might be getting too complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing process. Let's try to break down the string into the productions.\n\nFirst, the string is: t13 t22 t37 t64 t66 t8 t71 t33 t59 t14 t14 t7 t57 t49 t63 t11 t49 t64 t59 t64 t11 t74 t65 t13 t38 t27 t65 t7 t19 t11 t11 t63 t62 t9 t27 t71 t9 t37 t8 t63 t13 t63 t64.\n\nI need to check if this can be divided into production rules. Since S \u2192 NT41 NT23, I can look for this pair in the string. Let me see if the string can be split into a first part matching NT41 and a second part matching NT23.\n\nLooking at the beginning: The string starts with t13. From the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t13. So the first symbol t13 corresponds to NT41. Now, the remaining part of the string should start with the second non-terminal, which is NT23 here. Looking at the string, after t13, the next symbols are t22, etc. Wait, no, after t13 comes t22, which is the next symbol. So I need to check if the string starting at t22 matches NT23. From the grammar, NT23 \u2192 t13? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t83 or perhaps it's another option. Wait no, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT32 NT36\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT41 NT5\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT55 NT49\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT12 NT37\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT30 NT49\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT58 NT32\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT41 NT10\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT8 NT52\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT31 NT55\n\nNT16 \u2192 't81'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nSo, looking at NT23 \u2192 't83'. So if the second part starts with t83, then NT23 is matched. But the next symbol after t13 is t22, which is part of the string. Let me check where t22 maps.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT22 is NT22 \u2192 't33' or maybe another production. Let me see: \n\nLooking at NT22's productions: It seems NT22 \u2192 't33'? Or perhaps other productions. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't33' (from NT22 -> NT52 NT5, but in the given grammar, it's written as NT22 -> 't33 NT5'? Wait, no: \n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT22: \n\nIt's stated as NT22 -> NT52 NT5. Wait, but in the given list, I see:\n\n\"NT22 -> 't33' NT5\" No, let me find exact lines:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5\n\nNo, actually, let me find the line for NT22:\n\n\"NT22 -> 't33' NT5\"\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT22 -> 't33' NT5\"\n\nYes, so NT22 \u2192 't33' NT5. Similarly, NT15 \u2192 't71' NT3.\n\nSo, for NT22 \u2192 't33' followed by NT5, which might expand further.\n\nWait, so after t13 comes t22. So the first non-terminal is t13 (NT41) and the second is 't22'? Wait no, the second part after t13 must correspond to NT23, which is t83. But wait, the second symbol in the string after t13 is t22. So that would suggest that the second part starts with t22, which is NT22. But NT23 is 't83', so the second part shouldn't be NT23, right? Unless the entire string is not derived from S. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently.

The string is composed of 't' tokens followed by numbers, like 't11', 't13', etc. I remember that in CNF, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem. I'll probably need to perform a parsing process, either by using a recursive approach or maybe the CYK algorithm, since CFG parsing can be efficient with that. However, given the structure of the grammar, it's possible that using top-down parsing or memoization could help.\n\nLooking at the string provided, it's quite long: 35 tokens. Since each production in CNF either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal, I need to see if the string can be broken down according to these rules. \n\nTo start, I notice that some of the non-terminals in the grammar expand into terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 t58, NT8 \u2192 t35, and so on. So, any occurrence of 'tX' in the string must correspond to the expansion of the corresponding non-terminal. My first step is to create a mapping from each non-terminal to its corresponding terminal(s). \n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some non-terminals expand into a single terminal. For example, NT7 \u2192 't58', so when I see 't58' in the string, it must come from NT7. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't64', so 't64' must come from NT3, and so on. \n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 \u2192 't66' (from NT43 \u2192 't66')\nWait, no.

The grammar and the string are provided, but I think I should first make sure I understand what the grammar looks like and the steps to check if the string can be derived from it.\n\nFirst, let's parse the grammar. It's given in a compact form where each production rule is written as A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals. The right-hand sides are combinations of these non-terminals until they eventually terminate into terminals. The terminals seem to be strings like 't11', 't13', etc., which are probably the leaves of the derivation.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: `t11 t13 t24 t81 t11 t58 t14 t19 t71 t7 t66 t24 t19 t54 t10 t38 t35 t64 t65 t38 t58 t7 t54 t49 t65 t65 t19 t38 t10 t35 t9 t35 t65 t22 t63 t38 t58 t8 t81 t64 t13 t26 t81 t10`.\n\nWait, but the string is split into individual tokens, so each 't' is followed by two numbers, making each a unique terminal. Each of these terminals must be produced by the grammar's rules starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, which means that the minimum number of symbols in a string that can be derived is equal to the number of non-terminals before they become terminals. For example, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, the first expansion must combine two non-terminals, leading to three symbols when all are non-terminals. But as we proceed, non-terminals become terminals.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I can try to reverse the process: parse the string by splitting it into symbols and seeing if it can be constructed by the grammar, starting from S.\n\nAnother approach is to model the parsing process, making sure that each production used leads to the correct breakdown of the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step should involve replacing a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nLet me list the production rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n3.

I'll assume it's a mistake and treat it as 't65'.

So, if the string starts with t11, it must be produced by a non-terminal that can derive to it. Wait, but each production is from a specific non-terminal. So, to get 't11', we need to have a rule where X \u2192 't11', but looking at the rules, the only way is if a non-terminal like NT24 produces 't11' via rule 51, which is NT24 \u2192 't11'.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol is t13.

{"custom_id":"request-724","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, context-free grammars are recursive, so each production rule expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or terminals. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It has several non-terminals like S, NT23, NT27, and many others. Each rule on the left side is followed by two on the right. For example, S-> NT41 NT23 or S-> NT41 NT58. The NTs are all the non-terminals except the terminals, which are the 't' strings, like t37, t59, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of these terminals separated by spaces: \"t37 t59 t9 ... t74 t65 t10 t81 t81 ...\". So my goal is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> \u03b1, where \u03b1 is a terminal string of length 1. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a single terminal. So in this grammar, the right-hand side of each rule has two parts, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, looking back: \n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, S-> NT41 NT23, which is two non-terminals. Then, some other rules like NT33 -> NT12 NT49 or NT33 -> NT36 NT26 are two non-terminals. But wait, are there any rules that produce a terminal directly? Like A -> a, where a is a terminal. Looking through the list, some right-hand sides are single terminals like NT16 -> 't81', NT27->'t9', etc.\n\nSo the grammar has a mix of productions where non-terminals can produce two non-terminals, or a non-terminal can produce a single terminal. That means the grammar allows for both terminals and non-terminals on the right-hand side, but since it's in CNF, if a non-terminal can produce a single terminal, it's only one symbol. \n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, both possibilities exist. For example, NT33 has rules producing two non-terminals, or sometimes a terminal, like NT33 -> NT36 NT26 and NT33 -> NT36 NT26 again (Wait, checking: looking back, I see NT33->NT36 NT26, and also NT33->NT33 NT26? Or perhaps that was a typo. Wait, in the given grammar, looking through, I see lines like:\n\nNT33 -> NT12 NT49\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26\n\nWait, so both of these are non-terminals. Then elsewhere, I see NT5->NT5 NT43, which is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals, but perhaps that's allowing for repetition. Then I spot lines like NT16 -> 't81', which is a terminal, so that's a terminal production.\n\nSo the parsing strategy for this would involve seeing if each terminal in the string can be traced back to a production that allows that terminal, and ensuring that all the non-terminals can be expanded appropriately.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string starting from the start symbol S, trying to break it down into smaller parts. Since each production has two symbols on the right, each step reduces the string by one symbol, because a production adds one symbol to the string. Wait, perhaps I should model this as building the string from the start, using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a series of terminals, each terminal must correspond to some production in the grammar. So each terminal in the string must match a terminal production for some non-terminal.\n\nLet me list out the terminals in the given string: \n\nt37, t59, t9, t35, t57, t63, t49, t57, t28, t28, t19, t22, t64, t13, t66, t8, t10, t59, t58, t57, t84, t7, t66, t7, t7, t17, t24, t64, t13, t27, t26, t59, t14, t81, t81, t66, t65, t10, t66, t22, t22, t10, t62, t38, t22.\n\nNow, for each terminal in the string, I need to find a production in the grammar where that terminal is the result. So, for each 'txx' in the string, does there exist a non-terminal NT such that NT-> 'txx' is a production?\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nNT16 -> 't81'\nNT27 -> 't9'\nNT35 -> 't62'?

So:\n\nt37: NT30 -> 't37' (twice) or NT37? Wait, no, checking the productions, NT37 doesn't have a production; but looking back, I see NT37:\n\nWait, in the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t37? Let me check the given rules. Scanning through, I see NT37 -> 't64' and also multiple references, but no production that directly gives 't37'. Wait, perhaps I missed that. Let me confirm.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT37-> 't64'\nSo no, there's no production for NT37 -> 't37' in the grammar. Therefore, 't37' would need to be produced by some non-terminal NT such that NT->'t37' is in the grammar. But looking through, I don't see any such NT.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, there's NT30-> 't37' in two places.

{"custom_id":"request-734","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty long with a lot of productions, so I'll need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it does seem to fit CNF since all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string to visualize it better:\n\nt59 t74 t33 t71 t59 t65 t17 t10 t33 t81 t14 t84 t35 t19 t65 t81 t8 t19 t81 t9 t13 t62 t22 t27 t19 t14 t37 t10 t10 t49 t62 t26 t22 t24 t71 t9 t35 t64 t13 t8 t7 t63 t10 t83 t64 t71.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the productions step by step. Parsing in CNF is often done with a recursive descent parser, but since I'm just a human, I'll try to simulate that.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which has two productions in the grammar:\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo, S starts by producing two non-terminals. The first symbol in the string is t59. Let me check which productions can produce t59.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see a production N31 \u2192 t38, N7 \u2192 t58, etc. Wait, let's go through all rules until I find 't59'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I find:\n- NT31 \u2192 t38, which isn't it.\n- NT52 \u2192 t49?\nWait, let's check each rule:\n\nLooking for rules where NT... \u2192 t59.

{"custom_id":"request-732","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This usually makes parsing manageable, but with the string being quite long, it's going to take some time.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string: `t64 t54 t81 t17 t14 t13 t62 t63 t8 t27 t54 t17 t64 t13 t64 t27 t35 t14 t57 t9 t66 t11 t14 t54 t10 t33 t13 t64 t26 t14 t22 t10 t65 t64 t26 t22 t54 t10 t65 t35 t10 t58 t26 t54 t28 t26`.\n\nI notice that this string consists of a bunch of terminal symbols. Each symbol is a string like 't64' or 't17', which must be matched by the grammar's productions. The grammar has a lot of non-terminals, but most of the productions are to terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nMy plan is to work backwards. Starting from the string, I can split it into parts based on the grammar's rules. Since each production in CNF is two symbols, except for the start symbol which can produce two, the entire string length should be even. Let's check: the string has 50 tokens. 50 is even, so that's a good sign.\n\nI'll start parsing from the beginning. Let's see what the start symbol S produces. Looking at the grammar, S has two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string should correspond to NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58. Looking at the string, the first three tokens are 't64', 't54', 't81'. Hmm, since S is followed by NT41, which is one of the options, perhaps I can split the string into the production S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nWait, but S is a single symbol. Once we split the string into the first two symbols, which are 't64' and 't54', but S produces two non-terminals, so maybe I have to look into the string as a whole. Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is to see what the starting symbol can produce.\n\nWait, S can produce two non-terminals, so the first part of the string should be the concatenation of those two. But since each is a non-terminal, I need to break each down further.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT41 is derived from S, and in the grammar, NT41 can produce NT34 NT49. So 't64' must be the result of NT41, which breaks down into NT34 and NT49.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 is another option for S. But wait, in the given grammar, NT23 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't83'. So looking at the string, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is the correct split, then the string should start with 't83'. But the string starts with 't64', so that doesn't align. Alternatively, if S \u2192 NT41 NT58, then NT58 produces 't17' directly. So perhaps the string starts with 't64 t54', but NT41 and NT58 might produce 't64' and 't17' respectively? But then 54 would need to be NT58, which doesn't make sense because NT58 \u2192 't17'. That doesn't match 't54'.\n\nWait, wait. Let me list out the productions for NT58: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, and NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, NT24 \u2192 NT38 NT26, etc. But in the string, the first symbol is 't64', which is a production of NT41 (since NT41 \u2192 't13')? No, wait, no. Let me check: in the grammar, NT41 \u2192 't13'. So 't64' is actually NT64, which isn't listed in the grammar. Wait, maybe I've misunderstood the non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I misread the symbols.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions end with things like 't64', 't54', etc. So the non-terminals are actually those NT symbols, and their productions end when they are replaced by a terminal. So for example, NT41 is a non-terminal, and its productions are NT34 NT49 and 't13'. Similarly, NT58 has NT15 NT24 and 't17'.\n\nWait, so in the string, each 't64' is actually the result of a non-terminal that eventually reduces to that terminal. So to parse 't64', I need to find the non-terminal that can produce it. But looking through the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't64'. Wait, maybe I'm getting something wrong.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions include 't64', 't54', etc. So each of these is a terminal. So to produce 't64', the non-terminals must reduce to it through their productions. So I need to see if 't64' is a terminal that any non-terminal can produce.\n\nBut looking at the given grammar, I see that NT30 \u2192 't37', NT36 \u2192 't63', NT66 \u2192 't11', but wait, I don't see any production for NT43, NT24, etc., directly producing 't64'. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n- 't64' is a terminal in NT64's production? Wait, no, the grammar as given has several terminals:\nLooking through the right-hand sides, I see: t81, t17, t14, t13, t62, t63, t8, t27, t54, t17, t64, t13, t64, t27, t35, t14, t57, t9, t66, t11, t14, t54, t10, t33, t13, t64, t26, t14, t22, t10, t65, t64, t26, t22, t54, t10, t65, t35, t10, t58, t26, t54, t28, t26.\n\nSo the terminals are: t81, t17, t14, t13, t62, t63, t8, t27, t54, t64, t11, t14, t57, t9, t66, t11, t14, t54, t10, t33, t13, t64, t26, t14, t22, t10, t65, t64, t26, t22, t54, t10, t65, t35, t10, t58, t26, t54, t28, t26.\n\nWait, so 't64' is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal? Because in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, S is a non-terminal with productions to non-terminals, but the given string contains 't64', which must be a terminal.\n\nBut looking back, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't64' as per the grammar. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't62' or NT24 NT28. Wait, NT35's production is to 't62' or to other non-terminals. So 't62' is a terminal, but not 't64'.\n\nSimilarly, looking through all NTs:\n\n- NT64 is not listed as a non-terminal, but perhaps 't64' is a terminal that some NT produces.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, non-terminals are all the NT X, where X is a two-digit or three-digit identifier.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the non-terminals:\n\nThe non-terminals are all the NTx symbols, like NT27, NT38, NT33, etc. So each of these is a non-terminal, and their productions are either to other non-terminals or to terminals like 't64'.\n\nSo, 't64' is a terminal string.

{"custom_id":"request-735","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is nice because it simplifies the process a bit. I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are all in CNF. For example, S can produce NT41 NT23, which are both non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals then have their own production rules, some of which are terminal symbols with specific strings attached, like NT58 \u2192 t15 NT24.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of these tX symbols. So, the string is: t38 t58 t27 t8 t13 t49 t14 t54 t66 t11 t35 t28 t11 t10 t59 t62 t22 t62 t59 t24 t14 t81 t54 t71 t63 t14 t14 t11 t63 t14 t49 t65 t13 t54 t66 t35 t58 t7 t19 t83 t37 t19 t64 t28 t65 t62 t28.\n\nI think I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step, using either the top-down method (like recursive descent) or find a way to match the string step by step using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each internal node is a production with two children.\n\nLet me note down the production rules that produce terminals. Each terminal has a specific string, for example, NT15 could be 't71' or 't31', depending on its production. Wait, some rules are like NT36 \u2192 't63' and others are non-terminals separated.\n\nFor example, looking at the string, the first part is t38. So I need to find which non-terminal leads to t38. Let's go through the production rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal has several productions.

For example, NT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37, and both NT38 and NT37 are non-terminals, so that production would lead to more non-terminals, which would require further expansion.\n\nBut for a production like NT23 \u2192 't83', this is a terminal production where NT23 directly corresponds to 't83'.\n\nSo, looking at our string, which starts with t38. To produce t38, what non-terminal can produce t38?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. Since both NT28 and NT32 are non-terminals, this production would require expanding them further.\n\nAlternatively, is there any other production that directly leads to t38? Looking through the rules, I don't see a production where NT38 is a terminal, so t38 must come from NT38's expansion.\n\nSo, the first step in parsing is NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32.\n\nNow, the string after t38 is t58. So, t58 must come from the expansion of the right-hand side of NT38.\n\nSo, let's break it down: the first symbol is NT38, which expands to NT28 and NT32.\n\nSo, the string starts with t38, which is from NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. The next two symbols must correspond to these two non-terminals.\n\nBut the next symbol after t38 is t58. So, after t38 comes t58, which is the first symbol of the right-hand side. Wait, no, sorry, the next symbol after t38 is part of the expansion of NT38.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the parse order. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen we have a production like S \u2192 A B, during parsing, we first expect the string generated by A, then by B.\n\nIn this case, for the string t38 t58..., the S's production is like a sequence of non-terminals that will generate the string t38, t58, etc.\n\nSo, the initial symbol is S. S can produce things like NT41 NT23. But in this case, the start is t38, which is a terminal, so perhaps the initial expansion is a single non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, because S is the start symbol, which in CNF produces two non-terminals. So, the initial expansion is S \u2192 something that directly starts the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the very first symbol is t38. So, to get a terminal as the first symbol, which non-terminal leads to it?\n\nLooking through the production rules, only certain non-terminals can directly produce a terminal.\n\nThe list includes NT16 \u2192 't81', NT37 \u2192 't84', NT23 \u2192 't83', NT58 \u2192 't17', NT43 \u2192 't62', NT36 \u2192 't9', NT28 \u2192 't26', NT36 \u2192 't22', NT24 \u2192 't49', etc.\n\nWait, more accurately, each production that ends in a terminal is part of a rule. Let's list all such rules:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't81'\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-738","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make things a bit easier because Chomsky normal form has specific properties.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. Each non-terminal (like S, NT27, NT38, etc.) has productions that break down into other non-terminals or terminals. A few examples are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n- NT35 \u2192 NT62 (terminal)\n\nI also notice that some non-terminals produce other non-terminals which eventually terminate with terminals. For example, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and NT34 \u2192 NT26 (terminal), NT49 \u2192 NT57 (terminal).\n\nLooking at the string I need to evaluate, it's a series of terminals: t49, t19, t11, t17, t10, t27, t84, t22, etc., ending with t54 and t26. \n\nThe approach I'll take is to start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step using the given productions.\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n   - S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n   - S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nGiven the string starts with t49, which is a terminal. To get t49, we look at the productions for non-terminals that can produce t49 directly or through other steps.\n\nChecking the grammar, NT49 appears on the right side of a production: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 and NT30 \u2192 NT24 NT37, which I don't immediately know. So, t49 must come from NT49.\n\nLooking back at NT49's productions: I don't see NT49 in the provided rules, but I do see NT30 \u2192 NT24 NT37, which doesn't help. Wait, actually, in the rules, NT49 is mentioned only once: in NT24 \u2192 t49. So, NT49 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal that only produces t49?\n\nWait, no, the rules show NT24 \u2192 t49, so NT49 is a terminal. So, in the string, the first symbol is t49, which would correspond to NT24.\n\nHold on, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nEach production for a non-terminal can lead to other non-terminals or terminals. So, for NT49, according to the rules, NT24 \u2192 t49, which means NT24 is a non-terminal that directly produces t49.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t49, which is the same as NT24. Wait, not necessarily. The string is just a sequence of terminals, but each terminal is a specific string, like t49, t19, etc.\n\nSo, each terminal in the string must be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar. For example, t49 must come from a non-terminal that can produce t49.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t49. So, the production NT24 \u2192 t49 means that whenever we have NT24, it can be replaced by t49. Therefore, in the string, any occurrence of t49 must come from NT24.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is t49. That suggests that in the derivation, somewhere, the symbol NT24 must have been used, which then becomes t49. So, looking at the grammar rules, where does NT24 appear? Checking the rules:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t26, t22?\nWait, the rules are written as NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, etc. But in the right-hand side, some productions have terminals, like NT24 \u2192 t49, NT28 \u2192 t26, and so on.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each rule for a non-terminal is either producing other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT24 has a rule: NT24 \u2192 t49, which means NT24 can be replaced by 't49'.\n\nBut in the string, after t49 comes t19, which is 't19'. So, next is t19, which would require a non-terminal that can produce 't19'. Looking for 't19' in the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t71\n- NT18 \u2192 t35\n- NT28 \u2192 t7\n- NT31 \u2192 t38\n- NT36 \u2192 t63\n- NT42 \u2192 t14\n- NT30 \u2192 t24\n- NT52 \u2192 t17\n- NT58 \u2192 t10\n- NT43 \u2192 t62\n- NT37 \u2192 t84\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n\nHmm, I don't immediately see a production for 't19'. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT36 has two productions: NT36 \u2192 t9 and NT36 \u2192 t22. Also, NT36 \u2192 t63. So, no, I don't see 't19' being produced directly. Wait, did I miss any rule?\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t8\n- NT31 \u2192 t38\n- NT8 \u2192 t35\n- NT15 \u2192 t59\n- NT28 \u2192 t7\n- NT3 \u2192 t63\n- NT30 \u2192 t37\n- NT32 \u2192 t7\n- NT55 \u2192 t65\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 t9\n- NT49 \u2192 t57\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. I must check all the rules again. Let's go through the list:\n\n1. S has two rules.\n2. NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n3. NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n4. NT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49\n5. NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n6.

So, where does t19 come from? Looking through the grammar, is there a non-terminal that can produce t19?\n\nLooking through the rules, the only way to get a terminal is via the productions given. So, for example, NT37 has two rules: NT37 \u2192 't84' and NT37 \u2192 't41'. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the rules:\n\nNT37 has two rules:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't84'\n- NT37 \u2192 't41' ?\n\nNo, looking at the full list, let's make it clearer:\n\nLooking back, the user provided a long list.

Also, the start symbol S can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT41 NT23. So the entire string should be generated from expanding S first.\n\nI'll approach this step by step by expanding S and seeing if each part can be derived to match the string.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n2. Now, NT41 must be expanded to match its production rules. Looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n3. NT34 and NT49 are both non-terminals. Let's expand them further.\n   - NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\n   - NT49 \u2192 NT17 NT49\n   Wait, that can't be right because NT17 isn't a terminal. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, NT43 \u2192 t62. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT34 \u2192 t26? No, NT34 is in the list, but I don't see it producing a terminal. Let me check the provided productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT36 \u2192 't9', NT28 \u2192 't26', NT7 \u2192 't58', etc. But NT34: Checking all NT productions:\n\nLooking at NT34: No, I see NT35 \u2192 't62', NT33 \u2192 't26', etc. Wait, NT34 seems to be present as a non-terminal, but in the provided productions, I don't see NT34 producing anything. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me list all NT productions to be sure. The NTs go from NT27 up to NT76, as per the given context, but I'm going to check each.\n\nWait, the user provided a list where NTs are defined with productions. Let me scan through each line to see if NT34 has a production.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nYes, I see NT36 \u2192 't9', NT35 \u2192 't62', NT27 \u2192 't9', NT38 \u2192 't33', etc. Wait, NT34 is not listed among the productions. So perhaps NT34 is a terminal. Looking at the string, do I see a 't34'? No, the string has t13, t35, t7, etc., but no t34. Hmm, perhaps NT34 is a terminal? But then the string doesn't have it. Alternatively, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, checking the list again:\n\nLooking for NT34: Is there a line that says NT34 \u2192 't34'? No, I don't see it. Similarly, NT33 \u2192 't26', which is a terminal. So NT34 must be a non-terminal that can't be reduced further, but then the string doesn't have a t34, which may suggest a problem.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the entire process again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree for the given string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t13 t35 t7 t38 t84 t24... so the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So NT34 and NT49 must be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT34: Since in the grammar, NT34 doesn't produce a terminal, it must have a production to another NT. Looking through the provided lines, I don't see NT34 in the production list beyond its initial definition. So perhaps NT34 is a non-terminal with no productions, meaning it's unproductive and cannot be derived. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated because it starts with t13, which comes from NT34, but NT34 can't derive t13. Wait, but S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So NT34 must derive to something, but if it's a terminal, then it's in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar.

Wait, no. Let me check again. NT34: Looking through the lines, I don't see NT34 in the production list. Hmm, maybe it's a terminal? But in the string, the only 't34's I see are t13, t35, t7, etc. I don't see t34.\n\nWait, maybe NT34 doesn't have a production, making it unable to generate any terminal except perhaps itself. But that would lead to infinite loops, which aren't helpful. So perhaps t34 isn't present, which could mean that NT34 is not part of the derivation.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t13, which comes from NT41. Let's see, what does NT41 produce?\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nSo, NT34 must become t13? But earlier, I thought NT34 is a non-terminal, but now I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking again: In the list of productions, NT34 appears nowhere except in some earlier lines? Wait, looking through the provided productions, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, let me list all NTs and their productions again carefully:\n\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2. NT27 -> NT35 NT15\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-762","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should simplify parsing. The string to evaluate is a series of terminals, so I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t83 t14 t81 t27 t28 t14 t64 t84 t71 t24 t71 t17 t27 t26 t54 t49 t9 t33 t71 t64 t84 t22 t9 t81 t24 t74 t11 t10 t84 t26 t35 t33 t33 t37 t7 t74 t62 t33 t35 t59 t26 t10 t24 t54 t65 t71 t62 t10 t17`.\n\nI'll start by looking for the start symbol S and see how it can derive the string. The grammar starts with S, which has the following productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo S can split into either NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58. Let me see how each of these could generate parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t83. In the grammar, I see that NT23 \u2192 't83', so that part is clear. So if I take the production S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the string starts with NT41 followed by t83.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, it's NT23 directly going to t83, so to have t83 as the first part, the structure would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23 \u2192 ... \u2192 t83 ...\n\nSo I'll focus on the first production S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Now, the first symbol is t83, which comes from NT23. So NT23 \u2192 t83. Then what about NT41?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT41 has production\u2192 NT34 NT49 and another \u2192 t13. So NT41 can go to either NT34 NT49 or t13. The string starts with t83, which comes from NT23, and then the next symbol is t14. So after t83, we have t14. Let's see how NT41 can generate parts. Since the first part is NT41 and then NT23, perhaps the string starts with NT41's symbols followed by NT23's t83.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure the parsing as a tree.\n\nThe string starts with t83, which is from NT23. So the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23 \u2192 ... \u2192 NT41 ... NT23 (t83)\n\nBut before that, NT41 can be expanded as either NT34 NT49 or t13. The next token after t83 is t14. So, perhaps NT41 expands to t14, and then NT23 is t83.\n\nLet me check: does NT41 have a production that starts with t14? Looking through the productions, I see NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32 and NT31 \u2192 NT66, which is a terminal, but I don't see NT41 producing t14. Wait, looking back, the productions for NT41 are:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT41 \u2192 t13\n\nSo the only terminals derived from NT41 are t13. Therefore, the first symbol after S would be t13, but in the string, the first symbol after t83 is t14. So this path is invalid. Therefore, using S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the first part can't produce t14. So maybe S is expanding differently.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Let me check NT58's productions. The production for NT58 is:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\nNT58 \u2192 t17\n\nSo NT58 can produce t17 or expand further. The string's first symbol is t83, which comes from NT23, so S \u2192 NT41 NT58 would mean NT41 and NT58, but NT23 is part of NT41's expansion (if S \u2192 NT41 NT23), not NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the derivations. Let me start over.\n\nThe string starts with t83, which is NT23 \u2192 t83. So the first part is definitely NT23. But NT23 can only be derived directly as a terminal. So in the S \u2192 NT41 NT23 production, NT23 is a terminal (t83), and NT41 would need to produce the preceding tokens.\n\nWait no, the entire string is S's expansion, so the entire string must be generated by S. Let me think of S as the root of the parse tree.\n\nSo for S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the entire string will be structured as the sequence of symbols derived from NT41 followed by those from NT23, which is t83.\n\nSo the string after S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is: t83, and the rest must come from NT41.\n\nWait, but the string also starts with t83, which is correct. Then the next symbol is t14. So in the parse tree, after t83 (from NT23), we have t14, which probably comes from the NT41 part.\n\nSo perhaps NT41's expansion is generating the t14 and the preceding symbols. But how?\n\nLooking at NT41's productions, it can only produce t13 or further non-terminals. Because NT41 can't produce t14 directly. The only way is that NT41 expands into more non-terminals, which eventually produce the necessary terminals.\n\nSo let's see. NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nThen NT34 \u2192 t26.\n\nSo NT41 can expand to t26 and NT49.\n\nBut in the string, after t83 (from NT23), comes t14. So perhaps the parsing is going wrong because NT41 cannot produce t14 as a terminal; it only produces t13 or t26 or something else.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is wrong. Let's try the other production: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nThen NT58 \u2192 t17 or NT15 NT24. But t17 is a terminal; the string starts with t83, so that doesn't fit. So this path also seems invalid because NT58 cannot produce t83. Thus, it's impossible for S to expand to NT41 NT58 and produce the string starting with t83.\n\nSo now I'm stuck. Both S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58 cannot generate the string starting with t83. Therefore, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by this grammar. But I might have missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the productions again. Maybe there's another way NT23 is derived. Let me check all NT23 productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only productions are NT23 \u2192 't83' and maybe others? Let me scan through all entries to see if NT23 is mentioned elsewhere.\n\nYes, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nNo others. So NT23 can only produce t83. Therefore, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the t83 is the last symbol in NT23, meaning before t83, the NT41 must generate all the other symbols. But in the given string, after t83 comes t14, which would have to come from NT41, but NT41 can't produce t14 as a terminal. So that path is impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is generating t83, and before that, NT41 is generating t14. But that would mean the structure is ... (something) t14 t83 ... but t14 can only come from NT38 perhaps? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT38 can produce t33 or nt28 nt32. Wait, I don't see t14 directly. Let me check all NTx productions to see if any produce t14.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\nNT18 \u2192 NT32 NT36\nNT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\nNT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 't33'\nNT8 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-759","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. Looking at the grammar provided, I see that all productions fit this structure, so that's good.\n\nNext, the problem is to check whether the given string is a possible derivation from the start symbol S using these productions. The string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers, e.g., `t58 t49 t10 ...` and so on. I need to see if this sequence can be formed by expanding S using the grammar rules.\n\nNow, the approach I think is best here is to reverse-engineer the process. That is, start from the given string and see if it can be reduced back to the start symbol S by applying the inverse of the grammar productions. This method is often called the \"top-down\" approach in parsing, but since the string is given, perhaps a bottom-up method (using a parse table or something similar) is more suitable, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can model the problem by identifying each production that might have generated each 't' segment in the string.\n\nAnother important note is that each production in CNF either produces exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, each step in the derivation takes a non-terminal and replaces it with two non-terminals or a single terminal. Since the string is a series of terminals, each of these 't' parts must correspond to the right-hand sides of these productions.\n\nLet me list all the productions that result in a terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice several end productions where non-terminals directly become a terminal:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43 \u2192 eventually becomes 't66'? Wait, but NT5 itself has a rule that ends with 't66' perhaps? Wait, no, I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, let me go through each production rule that directly ends with a terminal 't':\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43 \u2192 but also, I see other rules ending with 't':\nLooking through all the rules, the ones that end with 't' are:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't84'\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT58 \u2192 't17'\n- NT43 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't9'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n- NT36 \u2192 't22'\n- NT24 \u2192 't49'\n- NT58 \u2192 't74'\n- NT3 \u2192 't64'\n- NT55 \u2192 't65'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't63'\n- NT42 \u2192 't11'\n- NT24 \u2192 't27'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT30 \u2192 't24'\n- NT36 \u2192 't54'\n- NT23 \u2192 't19'\n- NT8 \u2192 't10'\n- NT12 \u2192 't8'\n- NT59 \u2192 't19'\n- NT31 \u2192 't38'\n- NT8 \u2192 't14'\n- NT24 \u2192 't63'\n- NT27 \u2192 't9'\n- NT49 \u2192 't57'\n\nSo, each 't' in the string must come from one of these rules. So, for each token in the string, I need to see if it corresponds to one of these productions. Let's list the entire string breakdown:\n\nThe string is: `t58 t49 t10 t35 t10 t14 t37 t54 t8 t59 t59 t83 t62 t54 t10 t74 t14 t22 t66 t58 t17 t27 t35 t9 t26 t57 t13 t13 t38 t33 t81 t74 t84 t49 t81 t49 t8 t26 t27 t66 t65 t84 t10 t59 t49 t83 t13 t19 t71`\n\nFirst, I'll split this into individual tokens. Let me count them:\n\nThere are 39 tokens. That's a bit long, so maybe I can identify some patterns or potential non-terminals that can produce these tokens.\n\nWait, but perhaps instead of trying to process each token one by one, which would take a lot of time, I should instead look for the structure of the derivation. Since CNF requires that each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, the derivation tree would consist of a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal, except the leaves which are terminals.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each must be produced by the grammar, and the structure must allow for a binary tree reduction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see this step by step. Let's consider the reverse approach. Starting from the string, try to reduce it by finding pairs of terminals that match any of the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nFor example, let's look at the string: the first token is 't58', which is the result of NT43 being 't62'\u2014wait, no, from above, NT43 \u2192 't62' directly, so 't62' is a terminal.\n\nWait, but wait, look: The first token is 't58', which must be the result of a production. From the list above, NT7 \u2192 't58' (rule 45: NT7\u2192't58').\n\nSo, the first token 't58' corresponds to NT7. So, in the reduction process, the first step would be to replace 't58' with NT7.\n\nSimilarly, the string starts with 't58', so the first part is:\n\nt58 \u2192 NT7\n\nThen, the next thing is that NT7 has a rule: NT7 \u2192 't58', or no\u2014the rule is NT7 \u2192 't58', which is a terminal. So, looking at the productions, NT7 is replaced by 't58', so in the reduction, 't58' would be replaced by NT7, but in the process, the rest of the string is after 't58'.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting the reduction wrong.\n\nWait, no: in the reverse approach, the string starts with 't58', which is the result of NT7, but maybe it's part of a production where NT7 is on the left, and 't58' is on the right.\n\nSo, in the reduction, we would replace 't58' with NT7. But since NT7's production only gives 't58', there's no further reduction\u2014meaning that the other part of that production (if any) must also be addressed.\n\nWait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's model the string as a sequence of symbols and try to build a parse tree from it.\n\nEach production in CNF can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every time we break down a string, the next step is to split it into two parts, each of which can be further reduced.\n\nLet me take the example of the string provided:\n\nThe first token is 't58', which comes from NT7 \u2192 't58' (production 45). So, in the reverse, we can represent the first part as NT7, which is followed by the rest of the string starting from 't49' onwards.\n\nBut wait, NT7 only produces 't58', so if we have 't58' at the beginning, the rest of the string after 't58' must be entirely generated by the non-terminal that NT7 is deriving, but since NT7 only produces 't58', that would mean that after NT7, there are no more symbols. But in our case, after 't58' comes 't49', so perhaps I'm misunderstanding this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the productions can be applied in any order and that the entire string must be generated by the grammar. So, perhaps we can model this as a recursive problem where each section of the string must match a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more systematic. The CYK algorithm can parse strings generated by a CFG, but I'm not sure if I can implement it here without getting too bogged down. But maybe I can use the properties of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see if the string can be generated by S.

{"custom_id":"request-769","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what I have to do here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing a bit easier because each production on the left is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string I'm given is: `t19 t35 t11 t19 t27 t37 t58 t28 t83 t17 t81 t54 t49 t14 t63 t22 t28 t37 t58 t65 t14 t13 t54 t27 t62 t71 t57 t38 t38 t57 t14 t22 t65 t14 t81 t65 t9 t28 t81 t81 t57 t33 t14 t57 t24 t17 t11 t19 t59 t13`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a list of productions. Each production is from a non-terminal on the left to two non-terminals or to a terminal. So I can model this as a binary tree where the root is S and each node is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nMy approach should be to see if the entire string can be derived from S using the given productions. Since the grammar is CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm, which checks for membership in linear time. But maybe I can do it more manually here.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar. Let's see.\n\nStarting with S. The only productions for S are:\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo S expands into two parts: either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: NT41 and NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t19. Let's see if t19 is a terminal in any NT rule.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, but how does that lead to t19? Wait, maybe t19 is a terminal in some NT production. Looking through the rules, I see NT19: Let me check the rules.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, let me see. Looking for 't19' in the list: I see that NT19 is in the productions. Hmm, no, let me check each rule.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nNT41 -> t13\nWait, no, I think I misread.\n\nWait the rules are a list like this:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\nS -> NT41 NT58\nNT27 -> NT35 NT15\n...\nLooking through all the rules, looking for where a terminal like t19 appears.\n\nWait, scanning through, I see NT7 \u2192 t58\nNT43 \u2192 t62\nNT35 \u2192 t62\nNT36 \u2192 t63\nNT42 \u2192 t11\nNT24 \u2192 t33\nNT36 \u2192 t63 (another one)\nNT22 \u2192 t55 (wait, 55 is in the middle)\nWait, looking for t19, I don't see it directly in any production. Maybe I need to find a path where a non-terminal eventually leads to t19.\n\nLooking through the rules, perhaps in the NT31: NT31 \u2192 NT58 NT32\n\nWait, let me try to find if there's a chain that leads to t19. Alternatively, perhaps the string has t19 appearing multiple times, which might come from the same NT rule.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, let's see if any NTs can produce t19. Wait, no. I don't see any NT production that ends with t19 directly. So maybe t19 comes from a combination of two non-terminals, which then resolve to t19.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's structure can be split into parts that form valid trees.\n\nBut this approach might be time-consuming. Maybe I can use the CYK algorithm steps.\n\nFirst, let's list all the tokens in the string:\n\nt19, t35, t11, t19, t27, t37, t58, t28, t83, t17, t81, t54, t49, t14, t63, t22, t28, t37, t58, t65, t14, t13, t54, t27, t62, t71, t57, t38, t38, t57, t14, t22, t65, t14, t81, t65, t9, t28, t81, t81, t57, t33, t14, t57, t24, t17, t11, t19, t59, t13.\n\nThat's 37 tokens. So the string length is 37. So the derivation tree must have a structure that breaks it into 37 leaves, each corresponding to these terminals.\n\nThe CYK algorithm initializes a table where each cell k represents the possible non-terminals that can produce the substring starting at position k and ending at k+length-1.\n\nSince the string is 37 tokens long, we'll need a 37x37 table. But that's a bit tedious, so maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be split based on the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which can generate either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me consider NT41 first.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT41 can go to NT34 NT49.\n\nLooking at NT34: NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\nWait, but NT34 can also go to NT26 NT49 or maybe another production.\n\nWait, let me check all the NT34 rules:\n\nLooking back, I think in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking through each rule again:\n\nNT34 \u2192 t26 (from NT36? Wait, I might be mixing up. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nLooking at each line starting from line 7:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT27 NT37 (wait, no, maybe that's a typo. Wait the line says:\n\nNT37 -> 't84'\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to make a mapping of each NT and its possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can proceed by looking for a pattern in the given string and seeing if I can split it into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me start by trying to find occurrences of t19, which appears multiple times in the string.\n\nThe first token is t19. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t19.\n\nLooking through the list, I see that NT42 \u2192 t11, NT24 \u2192 t33, etc. Wait, but none of the NTs seem to directly produce t19. Hmm, so maybe t19 is part of a derivation path that results in t19 at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to go step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the first part is S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Let's try to see if the first few tokens can come from NT41 and NT23.\n\nLooking at NT41's productions:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nNow, looking at NT49's productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I found NT49 \u2192 NT43 or NT57 (not sure if that's correct; perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT49: I don't see an explicit production. Maybe I should look further.\n\nLooking here: NT43 \u2192 t62\n\nWait, looking through the rules, perhaps I can't directly get to t49 unless it goes through other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe I can look for the string's structure in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t19 t35 t11 t19... Maybe the first t19 is part of a larger structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if certain combinations of tokens can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-767","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and how the string is structured.\n\nFirst, context-free grammars generate strings through a series of production rules. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The grammar has two production rules for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo, any string generated by the grammar must start with either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. That's my first clue.\n\nThe string to evaluate starts with 't49 t19 t62 t27 ...'. So the first part is 't49', which is a terminal, so I need to see how that's derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules for terminals:\n- NT41 appears in S's rules and also has a production: NT41 \u2192 t13\n- NT23 \u2192 t83\n- NT27 \u2192 t9\n- NT28 \u2192 t26\n- NT18 \u2192 t36, but wait, I think I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nWait, let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t49. Looking at the rules, which non-terminals can produce t49? Let me scan the rules. I notice:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43 (doesn't produce t)\n- NT42 \u2192 t11\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- So, either NT24 or NT42 can produce 't49' as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the NT24 rule:\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n\nYes, so t49 comes from NT24, which is a non-terminal.\n\nSo the first part is NT24 \u2192 t49. That's one part of the start symbol S.\n\nNow, after t49, the string is t19 t62 t27 ... etc. So after t49, we have t19, t62, t27, etc., but wait, that's part of the next production.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure. Since S can produce either S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58, the entire string must be built from these combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should analyze the string as a series of NTs leading to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct a parse tree starting from S.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string starts with t49, which I know comes from NT24. So, in the first step, we'll have S \u2192 NT41 NT58 or S \u2192 NT41 NT23. But wait, the first option is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which would give us two terminals after S. But in the string, the first is t49, which needs to be part of a larger structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the order of the string. Since S starts with NT41 and something else, perhaps the string must begin with the first part of S's expansion.\n\nWait, no. The string starts with t49, which is a terminal, so that would come from one of the NTs in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t49 t19 t62 t27 t64 t14 t37 t13 t19 t54 t81 t66 t7 t62 t37 t19 t59 t14 t19 t63 t64 t58 t8 t14 t27 t9 t8 t8 t9 t27 t35 t83 t8 t27 t65 t10 t26 t22 t74 t83 t7 t84 t9 t81 t54 t11 t9 t33 t35 t26.\n\nFirst token: t49. As we saw, t49 is from NT24. So, in the production, NT24 must be a non-terminal and when expanded, it becomes t49.\n\nNow, looking back at how NT24 is produced: NT24 \u2192 t49. So, in our string, that's straightforward. So the first t49 comes directly from NT24.\n\nNext, the next token is t19. So after t49: t49 t19.\n\nLooking at NT24's production: it only produces t49, so that's the end of NT24's expansion. Therefore, the next part of the string must come from something else. Wait, but NT24 isn't part of the start symbol's production. Hmm, perhaps I got mixed up.\n\nWait, no, S is either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So, the structure of the string should be S \u2192 NT... which then leads to a series of terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t49, which is from NT24, but S only directly expands to NT41 followed by another NT. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is part of a chain of derivations where each unit is a combination of NTs leading to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of this as a series of NTs each resolving to terminals, but in a specific order that builds the string.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nThen each NT in the expansion may themselves split into more NTs until all are terminals.\n\nSo, the first NT in S's production is, say, NT41, which in the first option produces NT23, but NT23 is a terminal. Or in the second option, NT41 \u2192 t13 and NT58 \u2192 t74.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t13\n- NT23 \u2192 t83\n- NT18 \u2192 t36 but I think I got that wrong.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals and which NTs produce them:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nt49 \u2192 NT24 \u2192 t49\nt19 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t19? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t35\n- NT2 \u2192 t33\n- NT15 \u2192 t71\n- NT34 \u2192 t26\n- NT35 \u2192 t62\n- NT36 \u2192 t63\n- NT42 \u2192 t11\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 t9\n- NT28 \u2192 t26, but also appears in other places.\n- NT2 \u2192 t33 (appears in NT15)\n- NT8 \u2192 t35 (appears in NT10)\n- Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for a leftmost derivation of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t49. So, perhaps that's from NT24, which is derived from NT24 \u2192 t49, but in the grammar, NT24 only produces t49, so that's a base case. But then, where does the other part come from? Because S is either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58, which are two separate NTs, each of which can produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps each of these NTs in the initial S production is part of a chain leading to a terminal. Let me think about S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So, expanding S, we get NT41 and NT58.\n\nNow, NT41 can produce t13, which is t13, but in the string, the first term is t49. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me go step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is such that each production gives a part of the string. For example:\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t49, then t19, t62, etc.\n\nLet me try to see how these terms can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT24, we have:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t49 (since NT24 \u2192 t49)\n\nSo, in the string, the first t49 would come from NT24. Then, what comes next? The next token is t19.\n\nSo, after t49, the next term is t19. So, the production after NT24 must produce t19. But looking at the rules, none of the NTs except NT8 and NT others produce t19.\n\nWait, no: looking back, the rules don't seem to have any NT producing t19.

{"custom_id":"request-12","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the string \"t13 t17\" is generated by the given grammar. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I think I can work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. So, the grammar provided seems to fit that. The goal is to see if \"t13 t17\" can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminal strings, like NT13, NT35, etc., and some produce other non-terminals. The string we're testing is \"t13 t17\", which has two parts: \"t13\" and \"t17\".\n\nLet me see which rules produce \"t13\" and \"t17\". Scanning through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT41 -> \"t13\": so NT41 can generate \"t13\".\n- NT58 -> \"t17\": so NT58 can generate \"t17\".\n\nNow, I need to find if NT41 and NT58 can be derived from the start symbol S. Let's look at how S can be expanded.\n\nThe start symbol S is in two rules:\n\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2. S -> NT41 NT58\n\nWe can see that both rules involve NT41. Since NT41 can produce \"t13\", let's check if the other non-terminals in each rule can produce \"t23\" or \"t58\".\n\nStarting with the first rule: S -> NT41 NT23.\n\nWe know NT41 -> \"t13\", so let's see what NT23 can be. Looking at the rules for NT23, I don't see any production that starts with NT23, except NT23->'t83'. So NT23 -> \"t83\".\n\nPutting that together: S -> \"t13\" \"t83\". But our string is \"t13 t17\", so the second part needs to be \"t17\". This first rule doesn't help because we get \"t83\" instead of \"t17\". So maybe this rule doesn't lead to our desired string.\n\nLet's look at the second rule: S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nAgain, NT41 -> \"t13\", so we just need NT58 to produce \"t17\". Checking the rules for NT58, I see NT58 -> \"t17\". Perfect!\n\nSo, S -> NT41 (\"t13\") NT58 (\"t17\"). That would produce the string \"t13 t17\" exactly. So yes, the grammar can generate this string.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Are there any potential overlaps or other rules that could cause issues? Let me double-check.\n\nAre there any other non-terminals that might produce \"t17\" or parts of the string, but I don't think so. NT58 directly gives \"t17\", and NT41 directly gives \"t13\". The other parts of the grammar don't seem to interfere here.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that \"t13 t17\" is indeed generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-11","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to work through this problem. So, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t13 t83\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules that look like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All non-terminals are on the left, and only two non-terminals appear on the right side. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that most of the productions on the right side of the rules have exactly two non-terminals, which fits CNF. However, I also notice some productions where a terminal immediately follows a non-terminal, like S \u2192 NT41 NT49, which becomes S \u2192 NT41 NT49, but then there are cases where a terminal is directly followed by another symbol, like \"t13\" as a terminal. Wait, but in CNF, terminals are on the right side as single symbols, but I'm not seeing any rules where a terminal is on the right except when a production like NT41 \u2192 't13' or similar. So, perhaps all the terminals are directly produced, which would mean the grammar uses a \"defined\" form with only non-terminals and terminals on the right.\n\nNow, the string to check is \"t13 t83\". Breaking it down, it's two symbols separated by a space, which I assume is a single token \"t13 t83\" since the grammar's productions have non-terminals and terminals combined. Alternatively, perhaps each token is a separate element in the string. Wait, in the grammar, some productions have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, like S \u2192 NT41 NT49, which eventually results in the terminals t13, t83, etc. So, in the string, each token is a terminal, possibly.\n\nBut the string is \"t13 t83\", so two tokens. To check if the grammar can produce this, I need to see how the grammar can derive this sequence. Given that the grammar is in CNF, each production step increases the length of the string by one. Since the given string has two symbols, the derivation would need to account for that.\n\nLet me think about how the grammar could produce \"t13 t83\". The start symbol is S. So, S must derive either the left-hand side of the first rule or the second rule. Let's look at the rules for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo, both options for S involve NT41 and another NT. Let's see what those produce. For instance, taking the first option S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then each NT is a non-terminal that needs to produce the appropriate terminals.\n\nSo, NT41 \u2192 't13' according to the production NT41 \u2192 't13'. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 't83' as per NT23 \u2192 't83'. So, if we follow that, S would directly produce 't13 t83' as S \u2192 NT41 NT23 \u2192 't13' 't83' \u2192 \"t13 t83\". That seems straightforward. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me look at the production rules for NT41 and NT23. Yes, NT41 is defined as \u2192 't13' and NT23 as \u2192 't83'. So, when S uses the first rule, it becomes NT41 NT23, which then substitutes to 't13 t83'.\n\nAlternatively, if S took the second rule, S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Then we'd have to see if NT58 can produce something, but in our case, the string is \"t13 t83\", so the second part needs to produce 't83'. Let's check the options for NT58. Looking at the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, and then NT15 \u2192 't71' and NT24 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal. Wait, but NT24 has other productions, like NT24 \u2192 't27' or other non-terminals. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The first path seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the derivation would be:\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nNT41 \u2192 't13'\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\nThus, S \u2192 't13 t83'.\n\nTherefore, the string can be generated by the grammar, so the answer is 'Yes'.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string given is \"t13 t71 t33\", and the grammar consists of various production rules. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall Chomsky normal form. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most of the rules are in the form A \u2192 BC, like S \u2192 NT41 NT23, or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Some of the non-terminals also have productions ending with terminals, such as NT23 \u2192 't83'. So each production here is either a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is \"t13 t71 t33\". This string has three terminals, so it should be generated by a sequence of productions starting from S and breaking down into these three terms.\n\nStarting from S, which is the start symbol. Looking at S's productions, it can go to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let me pick the first option: S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So that's two non-terminals, NT41 and NT23.\n\nNow, I need to see if NT41 can produce a terminal and what comes next. Looking at NT41's productions: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 or NT34 NT49 again. Wait, I see there are multiple productions for NT41, but most of them are duplicates except for one that goes to NT34 NT49. Hmm, no, looking again, it seems NT41 can produce NT34 NT49 once, and others are similar.\n\nWait, actually, I see:\n\nNT41:\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT41 \u2192 NT35 NT15\nWait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, checking the list:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT35 -> NT62 NT31\nNT34 -> NT26 NT22\nNT7 -> NT58\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list all NT41's rules:\n\nActually, in the grammar, it's:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT41 -> NT35 NT15\n\nWait, is that accurate? Wait, looking at the list:\n\nYes, the lines are:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nand\n\nNT41 -> NT35 NT15?\n\nWait, no, looking at the list, it's:\n\nWait, no, in the list, under NT41, I see NT41 -> NT34 NT49 and also NT41 -> NT35 NT15. So yes, two production rules for NT41.\n\nSo to expand NT41, which of these will give me a terminal or another non-terminal? Hmm, both of NT41's rules produce two non-terminals. So that's an issue because I think I need at least one path where NT41 can produce a terminal. But in this case, both productions from NT41 go to two non-terminals, which would require further expansion.\n\nWait, but in the string I'm checking, there's a 't13', which is a terminal. So perhaps I need another branch where NT41 can produce a terminal? Let me check the grammar again for NT41.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I see NT59 -> 't19', which is a terminal. But that's for NT59, not NT41. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that directly produce terminals. Let me check each:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't62'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't9'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't22'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't49'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't64'\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't24'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't65'\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't63'\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't11'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't27'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n\nWait, wait! Under NT41, there's a production: NT41 \u2192 't13'. Because I see a line: \"NT41 -> 't13'\". Similarly, I think there's another production: \"NT41 -> NT34 NT49\".\n\nAh, yes, I was missing that. So NT41 can produce either NT34 NT49 or 't13'. So that's good because in the string, we have 't13'.\n\nSo to generate 't13 t71 t33', starting from S, which can go to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Looking at the string, the first token is 't13', so perhaps we choose S \u2192 NT41 NT23 because the first part would give 't13'.\n\nSo expanding S as NT41 NT23. Now, the string is t13, so NT41 should produce 't13' directly. Okay, that makes sense. So NT41 -> 't13'.\n\nNow, the string is now 't13 t71 t33'. Wait, no, no\u2014it's a single string split into tokens: 't13', 't71', 't33'. So after generating 't13', we now have 't71' and 't33' to generate from the remaining non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, after S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the string is 't13' and then we have NT23 to generate 't71 t33'. Wait, that's not possible because 't71' and 't33' come after 't13', but perhaps I should consider each part.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to process each token step by step. Let me think of the entire string as a list: ['t13', 't71', 't33'].\n\nWe need to find a tree of derivations that, starting from S, reduces the string into these terminals.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So NT41 generates the first 't13', so that's settled. Now, the remaining string to generate is 't71 t33', which comes from NT23.\n\nSo we have to check if NT23 can generate 't71 t33'. Wait, but 't71' and 't33' are two separate terminals, which suggests that NT23 must generate a derivation that results in these two terminals in order.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nWait, no, in the list, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nAlso, looking through the list, perhaps others? Let me check:\n\nLooking again, I think I see NT23's rules:\n\nYes, \"NT23 -> 't83'\"\n\nBut in the string, after 't13', we have 't71' and 't33' as the next tokens.\n\nWait, that's confusing because 't71' is not 't83' and 't33' is also not 't83'. So perhaps I took the wrong initial step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT41 NT58 instead. Let me try that path.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Then, NT41 produces 't13', as before, and NT58 should then generate 't71 t33'.\n\nLooking at NT58's productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT58 \u2192 't17' and several other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-26","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out whether the string `t26 t57 t83` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It has a start symbol S, and a bunch of non-terminals that produce other non-terminals or terminals. The productions are mostly of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, except for a few where the right-hand side is a terminal. Each NT is a non-terminal, and terminals are represented by 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t26 t57 t83`. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens: t26, t57, t83. Terminals are each individual token, so each of these must come from terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n- S can produce NT41 NT23, and then each of those can produce terminals, I think. Wait, let me check where S goes.\n\nWait, the start symbol S can go to NT41 NT23, or NT41 NT58. So the string will start with something derived from NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's three terminals. So I think the string would be S -> NT... which then breaks down into three terminals. But wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is a single non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string has three terminals, which implies that the derivation must have two splits.\n\nWait, no. Each production in CNF is either A->BC or A-> terminal. So to generate a string of three terminals, we'd need S -> NT... which breaks down into two non-terminals, each of which can then produce two terminals each, but that would create four terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is of length three, so the derivation must have exactly two splits. Wait, let's think: S is the start, so S produces two non-terminals, say A and B. Each of those can produce two non-terminals or terminals. So for the string to be three terminals, perhaps there's a structure like A -> t26 and B -> t57 t83, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A splits into t26 and B, which splits into t57 and t83. But actually, looking at the grammar, each production for a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is three terms, so we need to split each non-terminal into two in some way that results in three. Let's think of S as producing two non-terminals, each of which then can produce either a terminal or non-terminals. So for a string of three terminals, one non-terminal might split into two terminals, and the other might stay as a single terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should first see which non-terminals produce t26, t57, t83.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nt26 is produced by:\n- NT24 -> t26\n- NT28 -> t26 (from NT24 NT28: wait, no, NT28's production has t26 as an option. Let me check NT28.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT28 has two productions:\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31\nNT28 -> t26\n\nAh, so NT28 can directly produce t26.\n\nSimilarly, t57 is produced by:\nLooking at the grammar, let me see where t57 is.\n\nLooking for 't57', I see NT43 -> t62, NT5 -> NT5 NT43 (which is t62), and so on. Hmm, I don't see 't57' in the grammar. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nWait, no, I'm looking at the grammar productions, and I see that NT7 -> t58, NT41 -> t13, NT30 -> t37, NT32 -> t24, NT58 -> t15, and so on. Hmm, I don't see a rule that directly produces t57. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT30 -> t37\n- NT24 -> t49\n- NT28 -> t26\n- NT36 -> t63\n- NT42 -> t11\n- NT24 -> t27\n- NT7 -> t58\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT30 -> t24\n- NT36 -> t54\n- NT23 -> t19\n- NT8 -> t35\n- NT15 -> t59\n- NT28 -> t7\n- NT3 -> t63\n- NT10 -> t28\n- NT31 -> t38\n- NT8 -> t14\n- NT24 -> t63\n- NT27 -> t9\n- NT49 -> t57\n\nAh, here it is. NT49 -> t57. So t57 comes from NT49.\n\nSo now, I have to see if the string can be generated through some path that creates NT26, NT57, NT83.\n\nWait, each terminal is a single token, so each must come from a non-terminal that directly produces that terminal.\n\nLooking at the string again: t26 t57 t83.\n\nSo, the first token is t26, which comes from NT28 (as NT28 has a production to t26). The second token is t57, which comes from NT49 (NT49 -> t57). The third token is t83, which comes from NT23 (since NT23 -> t83 directly).\n\nNow, let me see how these terminals can be part of the derivation starting from S.\n\nS can go to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me consider each possibility.\n\nFirst, option: S -> NT41 NT23.\n\nThen, NT23 can directly produce t83 (as NT23 -> t83). That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the other non-terminal, NT41, must produce t57 and something else? Wait, no. Because the string is t26 t57 t83, which is three terminals. So if we have S -> NT41 NT23, then NT41 would have to produce two terms (since each production from a non-terminal is either two non-terminals or a terminal), and then the other non-terminal would produce the remaining terms.\n\nWait, no. Because each step produces two non-terminals, but in the string, the total number of terminals is three. So this suggests that in the derivation, one non-terminal splits into two terminals, and the other splits into one terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to map out the steps.\n\nLet's try S -> NT41 NT23 (since S has multiple options).\n\nNT23 -> t83 directly. So that's one terminal.\n\nNow, NT41: looking at the grammar, NT41 can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, from the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT41: NT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nSo NT41 can produce NT34 and NT49. So Nt41 would have to produce these two, each of which then produce other terms.\n\nSo for the string t26 t57 t83, let's see:\n\n- NT23 is t83: so that's done.\n- NT41 branches into NT34 and NT49.\n\nNow, NT49 is t57 directly, so NT49 -> t57. That's another terminal.\nNow, NT34 must produce t26. Looking at NT34, the grammar doesn't show NT34 directly producing t26. Wait, no: looking back, I see:\n\nNT34's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar list:\n\nNT34 -> t26 is present.\n\nWait, yes! The production is: NT34 -> t26. So yes, NT34 can produce t26 directly.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nNT34 -> t26\n\nNT49 -> t57\n\nNT23 -> t83\n\nSo the derivation would be:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nNT34 -> t26\n\nNT49 -> t57\n\nNT23 -> t83\n\nThus, combining the four terminal productions, we get t26 t57 t83.\n\nSo the string is correctly derived from the grammar. Therefore, the answer is Yes.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-50","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the string `t26 t57 t71 t33` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one non-terminal on the right. So, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is `t26 t57 t71 t33`. Each of these is a terminal symbol. Let's list them out in order: t26, t57, t71, t33.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S and see the possible productions it has. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So, every derivation from S must start with these NTs followed by the corresponding NTs.\n\nLet's look at each starting option:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23:\n   - So, the string starts with NT41 NT23.\n   - Then, each NT can be decomposed into two other NTs or possibly a terminal.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58:\n   - Starts with NT41 and NT58.\n   - Similar decomposition as above.\n\nOur string starts with t26, which is a terminal. So, we need to see if any of the NTs can directly produce t26. Looking through the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 t26. So, NT28 can produce t26. \n\nWait, but in the given string, the first symbol is t26, which is derived from NT28. So, let's think about if NT41 or NT23 or NT58 can lead to NT28.\n\nLooking at NT41: Its productions are NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So, that's two NTs, but not t26. What about NT23? NT23 is a terminal, t83. So, that doesn't help. What about NT58? NT58 has two options: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 or NT58 \u2192 t17. None of these lead to NT28 either.\n\nWait, so maybe the first part S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is not the right path because NT23 is t83, not t26. So, that's a problem because the string starts with t26.\n\nLet's check the other option: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 again has two options: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So, let's see what's possible from there.\n\nNT41 can produce NT34 and NT49. Now, looking at NT34, the production is NT34 \u2192 t26. Oh! So, NT34 can directly produce t26. So, if NT41 can produce NT34, then S via S \u2192 NT41 NT58 can produce t26 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, yes. So, let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nNT34 \u2192 t26.\n\nThen, after that, what's next? The NT58 needs to be decomposed. NT58 can produce either NT15 NT24 or 't17'.\n\nBut in our string, after t26 comes t57. So, maybe NT58 needs to produce 't17'? Because t17 is a terminal. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf NT58 \u2192 t17, that would give us 't17' instead of t57, which doesn't match. Hmm. So, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, NT58 could produce NT15 NT24. Then, NT15 can be decomposed further. Let's see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT38, and NT3 \u2192 t63.\n\nWait, NT31 can go to NT38, which can go to NT32 NT36, or maybe other options. This is getting complicated. Let's think differently.\n\nLet's try to see what could produce 't26 t57 t71 t33' by breaking it down from the end.\n\nThe last symbol is t33. Let's see what can produce t33.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT33 has two productions:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49 and NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT36.\n\nAlso, elsewhere, NT33 is mentioned again with other rules, but maybe that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, t33 can come from NT33. Let's see which NT33 can lead to t33.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT33:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49 or NT31 NT36.\n\nWait, but I also see elsewhere NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26, which would produce t26 and t36. Hmm, that might be a way.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully: The rules show NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26, right? Wait, actually, the user provided some rules where NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26. Yes, for example:\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26.\n\nSo, if NT33 can produce t26 and t36, then perhaps the t33 in the string could come from NT33. But t36 is not the next symbol after t57 t71, so I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the entire string as a sequence of four terminals. So, the order must be respected. Each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with something that could eventually produce terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions.\n\nStarting from S, perhaps S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nBut let's think about whether the string can be generated step by step.\n\nSuppose we take S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Then, NT23 is a terminal, t83. But our string starts with t26, so this can't be the case. So, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is out because it has t83 at the end, not t26.\n\nSo, the other option is S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo, S decomposes into NT41 and NT58.\n\nNow, NT41 needs to produce the first part of the string. So, the first symbol is t26, which comes from NT34. And NT34 comes from NT41.\n\nSo, from NT41, we can go to NT34 NT49. So, NT34 produces t26, and NT49 can produce more.\n\nNow, the string after t26 is t57, t71, t33. So, let's move on.\n\nWe have S \u2192 NT41 NT58, with NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So, from NT34, we get t26.\n\nThen, NT58 can produce either 't17' or NT15 NT24.\n\nBut the next symbol in the string is t57, which is a terminal. So, can't get t57 from 't17' because that would require NT58 \u2192 t17, which doesn't help. So, perhaps NT58 needs to produce NT15 NT24, leading to more production.\n\nSo, let's say NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24.\n\nNow, NT15 can decompose further. NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT38. Then NT38 can decompose into NT28 NT32 or NT32 NT36.\n\nWait, NT38 has two options: \u2192 NT28 NT32 or \u2192 NT32 NT36.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIf NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, then NT28 is t26, right?\n\nLooking back at the rules: NT28 \u2192 t26. So, that would give us 't26' for the second symbol. But our string is t26 t57, so that's a match. Wait, actually, the second symbol is t57, so maybe not.\n\nWait, no, the string is t26, then t57. If NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, and NT28 is t26, then NT32 can produce another terminal. Let's see: NT32 can produce 't7' or it can be decomposed further, like NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT28 or NT32 \u2192 NT36 NT59.\n\nWait, looking at NT32's rules: NT32 \u2192 t7, t28, or decompose into further non-terminals.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is a non-terminal breaking down into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll note that the string is a sequence of four tokens separated by spaces. Since Chomsky Normal Form doesn't have terminals mixed with non-terminals in the same production unless they appear in the right order, I need to check if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of production steps.\n\nLooking at the productions, S can produce NT41 NT23. So I need to see if each of these non-terminals can lead to the corresponding terminals.\n\nStarting with NT41:\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49. Now, NT34 isn't a terminal, so it needs to produce something else. Looking through the productions, I see NT34 -> NT26 NT33. Neither of these are terminals, so I keep going. NT26 -> NT15 NT59, which also aren't terminals. NT15 -> NT31 NT3. Now, NT31 is a non-terminal, so it needs to produce something. NT31 -> NT98? Wait, no, looking through the productions, NT31 isn't present except in some other place I might have missed. Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, the productions include NT31 -> NT66. So NT31 is present. NT31 can produce NT66. Then, looking at NT66, I see if it's a terminal or a non-terminal. Scanning through, I don't see NT66 as a production on the left side, which means it must be a terminal. Wait, no, the productions given include NT66 only if there's a production for it... Wait, actually, looking through the productions, I don't see NT66 as a production. Hmm, maybe the user made a typo, but assuming it's correct, let's see.\n\nWait, the productions include NT66: Let me check the list again. Oh, here's NT52 -> NT30 NT49, and NT30 -> t66. So NT30 can produce t66, which is in the string. Wait, that's a different path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the steps. Let me try again. The string starts with t13. Looking at the productions, I see S -> NT41 NT23, so the first part is NT41. Let's focus on NT41.\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49. NT34 -> NT26 NT33. NT26 -> NT15 NT59. NT15 -> NT31 NT3. NT3 is a terminal with value 't64', which is in the string. So tracing back, NT3 -> 't64' matches the third part of the string, but the first part is t13. Hmm, maybe that's a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should start from the string and see if I can find possible derivations.\n\nThe string is \"t13 t66 t64 t49\". Let's break it down into each token.\n\nt13: Looking at the productions, NT41 -> NT34 NT49. NT49 -> t57. So if we have t13 being part of NT41, but t13 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the productions, NT43 -> t62, NT44 isn't there, but NT34 -> t63. Wait, no, in the productions, NT34 -> t63? Let me check. Looking through the productions, I see NT34 -> t63 is not there. Wait, actually, in the productions, I see NT34 produces NT26, so it's not terminal yet. Similarly, NT36 -> t33, and so on. \n\nWait, t13 is a terminal, so which production produces t13? Looking through the productions, I see NT43 -> t62, NT7 -> t58, NT41 -> t13. Oh, there's NT41 -> t13. So if a non-terminal NT41 is connected to t13, that suggests that NT41 can be directly derived to t13, which would mean t13 comes from NT41. So the first part of the string is t13, which suggests that in the grammar, there is a production where NT41 directly goes to t13. Yes, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT36 -> t63\nNT35 -> t62\n...\nWait, maybe I'm missing it. Wait, no, let's look more carefully. Scanning through all the productions:\n\nLooking at NT43 -> t62, NT7 -> t58, NT41 -> t13. Yes, here's NT41 -> t13. So that means, in the grammar, the non-terminal NT41 can produce the terminal t13 in one step.\n\nSo the first token t13 would come from NT41, so we have to see if the rest of the string can be derived from NT41.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t13, which suggests that the entire string is a direct derivation from S via NT41, but wait, the start symbol S is NT41 NT23. So S produces two non-terminals. Let's look at the string: it's four tokens, so each step would need to produce two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let's take it step by step.\n\nThe start symbol S directly produces NT41 NT23. So the start string is S \u2192 NT41 NT23. But the input string is t13 t66 t64 t49, which is four tokens. Hmm, that doesn't align because NT41 and NT23 each would produce two tokens each if they're non-terminals, so in total four tokens. But wait, how does that break down?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and each of these could be non-terminals which derive some terminals. So let's see what NT41 and NT23 derive.\n\nStarting with NT41: it can be NT34 NT49. Then, NT34 can be NT26 NT33, which can be NT15 NT59, then NT15 is NT31 NT3. NT3 is a terminal t64.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t13, which would have to come from a production where a non-terminal directly goes to t13, like NT41 \u2192 t13. That makes sense. So S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT41 can produce t13 directly, and NT23 can produce some sequence leading to t66, t64, t49.\n\nWait, but the string is four tokens: t13, t66, t64, t49. If NT41 produces t13, which is the first token, and NT23 produces the next three tokens, but that would be three tokens from one non-terminal, which doesn't fit. Because in Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal production is two non-terminals or a terminal, so each step adds one token. So NT23 would need to produce three tokens, which would require two steps: each step splitting into two non-terminals, then one of them being a terminal, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire derivation. Let's think about how the string is structured. Each terminal is a step in the derivation. So starting from S, which is NT41 NT23. Then, each of these non-terminals would produce their own parts.\n\nBut the string is four tokens, so after expanding S, we get four tokens. So the first two would come from NT41 and NT23, each producing two tokens. Wait, but NT41 could produce a single terminal t13, while NT23 would need to produce three tokens t66, t64, t49. But each NT production can only expand into two, unless they go through multiple steps. So maybe NT23 has a path that leads to three terminals through two expansions.\n\nLet me try to map this out.\n\nLooking at NT23: the production is NT23 \u2192 't83'. So NT23 can directly produce t83. But in the string, we have t66 as the second token. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the string. Wait, the string is:\n\nt13 t66 t64 t49.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation, so each of these t's represents a terminal. So for the string to be 4 terminals, the initial expansion from S would have to produce 4 terminals. But S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which would require each NT to expand into two terminals each, totaling four.

{"custom_id":"request-66","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check. The string is `t26 t57 t66 t64 t27`. My task is to figure out if this string can be generated by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From the grammar provided, I see several non-terminals leading to terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't63' and NT8 \u2192 't35'. So, each non-terminal eventually resolves to a single terminal symbol.\n\nThe string given is a series of terminals: t26, t57, t66, t64, t27. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production expands exactly two non-terminals to terminals, except when a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's five tokens long. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two tokens. So, starting from S, which is an initial non-terminal, the number of tokens should increase by one each time a pair is derived. But in this case, the string has five tokens, which is odd. Let me think: starting from S, which is S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Each of those might go to two terminals each, so that would be four tokens. If one of those non-terminals leads to two tokens, it might result in five. Wait, actually, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and each of NT41 and NT23 go to two terminals, that would make four tokens. So the string has five tokens. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23, leading to four terminals, but if one of them goes further? Wait, no, because each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So the depth of derivation from S would determine the number of terminals. For example, if S directly produces two non-terminals, each of which produces two, we'd have four. But to get five, maybe two of the non-terminals produce two each while one produces a terminal. Wait, no, each production from a non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals or one terminal. So, for example, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT41 \u2192 't26' (terminal) and NT23 \u2192 't57 t64', that would give t26 t57 t64, but the string is longer. Alternatively, perhaps NT23 produces two non-terminals, each of which then produces one terminal, but that would still result in four terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the sequence of non-terminals that can derive into these terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string `t26 t57 t66 t64 t27`. Let's map each token to the non-terminals that produce it. \n\nFrom the grammar:\n- t26 is produced by NT28 (from NT28 \u2192 't26'), but wait no, NT28 \u2192 't7' is in the grammar, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me check: \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT28 \u2192 't26'\u2014yes, there's \"NT28 -> 't26'\". Similarly:\n- t57 is produced by NT57 \u2192 't57'? Wait, does any non-terminal produce t57? Let me check: looking at the grammar, there's \"NT37 -> 't84'\", and \"NT36 -> 't63'\", etc. Hmm, wait, maybe I should check again. Oh, I see \"NT43 -> 't62'\", \"NT36 -> 't63'\", but I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t57. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, I need to double-check. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't9'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't63'\n- NT42 \u2192 't11'\n- NT30 \u2192 't37'\n- NT32 \u2192 't24'\n- NT55 \u2192 't65'\n- NT24 \u2192 't33'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT30 \u2192 't24'\n- NT36 \u2192 't54'\n- NT23 \u2192 't19'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't59'\n- NT28 \u2192 't7'\n- NT3 \u2192 't63'\n- NT10 \u2192 't28'\n- NT31 \u2192 't38'\n- NT8 \u2192 't14'\n- NT12 \u2192 't8'\n- NT59 \u2192 't19'\n- NT31 \u2192 't66'\n- NT5 \u2192 't66'\n- NT32 \u2192 't7'\n- NT8 \u2192 't14'\n- NT24 \u2192 't63'\n- NT27 \u2192 't9'\n- NT49 \u2192 't57'\n\nWait, yes! There's \"NT49 -> 't57'\". So t57 is produced by NT49. So, in the string, t57 must come from NT49.\n\nSimilarly, let's map each token:\n- t26 \u2192 NT28\n- t57 \u2192 NT49\n- t66 \u2192 NT36 or NT35\n- t64 \u2192 NT37 or NT33\n- t27 \u2192 NT27\n\nWait, wait. Let me list each token:\n\n1. t26 \u2192 NT28\n2. t57 \u2192 NT49\n3. t66 \u2192 NT36 and NT35 (looking at the grammar, NT35 \u2192 't62', no. Wait, checking NT35: NT35 \u2192 't62' so that's not right. Oh, wait, NT35 is a non-terminal that replaces to 't62', which is t62. So if we have t66, looking at the grammar, there's \"NT36 -> 't63'\", \"NT5 -> 't66'\", \"NT35 -> 't62'\", \"NT30 -> 't37'\", \"NT32 -> 't24'\", and \"NT55 -> 't65'\". Wait, no, I think I missed some. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT36 \u2192 't63'\n- NT5 \u2192 't66'\n\nSo t66 is produced by NT5. So the third token in the string is t66, which must come from NT5. \n\nNow, the fourth token is t64. Looking at the grammar, NT37 produces 't64', yes. So t64 comes from NT37.\n\nThe fifth token is t27, which comes from NT27.\n\nSo, putting it together, the string is:\n\nt26 (NT28) \u2192 t26\n\nt57 (NT49)\n\nt66 (NT5)\n\nt64 (NT37)\n\nt27 (NT27)\n\nNow, I need to see if these non-terminals can be connected in a way that allows the string to be generated. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let's see how these non-terminals can be linked.\n\nSo, let's see the dependencies:\n\n- t26: NT28\n- t57: NT49\n- t66: NT5\n- t64: NT37\n- t27: NT27\n\nNow, NTs: NT28, NT49, NT5, NT37, NT27.\n\nI need to see if these can be built up from the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo S is NT41 and NT23. Now, let's see what these produce.\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't13', so that's a terminal, so NT41 directly gives 't13'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't19', so that's a terminal\n\nWait, but that can't be, because then the string \"t13 t19\" would be the output, which is different from the given string. Hmm, perhaps this is a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the given string is constructed differently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps in the string, the non-terminals correspond to paths through the grammar. Let me try to find a way from S to derive the given string.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the string as a series of productions.\n\nLet me start from S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nTo get the string `t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since S produces NT41 NT23, I can write:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\n\nEach of these non-terminals needs to derive into something that gives the corresponding terminal.\n\nLooking at NT41: The productions for NT41 are:\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT41 (earlier) is actually, one production is NT41->NT34 NT49. Wait, checking the grammar, yes, in the Non-terminal NT41, the only production is NT41->NT34 NT49.\n\nSo, NT41 must be broken down into NT34 and NT49.\n\nLooking at NT34: NT34 has a production NT34->NT26 NT28.\n\nBut in the string, we have t26, but not t28. Hmm, that might be problematic. Wait, but maybe NT28 can be further broken down into terminals or other non-terminals. Let's see what NT28 can produce.\n\nNT28's productions: NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 and NT28 can also produce NT28 is in the non-terminals? Let me check: Yes, NT28's productions are:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT24\n- Wait, no: Looking back, NT28's productions are:\nFrom the grammar, NT28 -> NT38 NT31 and NT28 -> NT18 NT24.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Looking at the list given, for NT28, the productions are:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT24\n- Also, earlier in the list: NT24->NT23 NT28 and others, but that's for NT24.\n\nWait, so for NT28, it can produce either NT38 NT31 or NT18 NT24. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nSo, going back: NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT28.\n\nIf NT28 can produce NT18 NT24, then NT28 can produce t18 and t24? Wait, no, NT18 is a non-terminal, which needs to be broken down further. Let me see: NT18 can produce NT32 NT36. So that could get us t32 and t36, but that's not matching t28.\n\nAlternatively, NT28 can produce NT38 NT31. Let's check NT38. NT38's productions are:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32 and NT38 \u2192 NT32 NT62.\n\nWait, no, looking back: NT38 has two productions?\n\nWait, according to the grammar, NT38's productions are:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n- NT38 \u2192 NT32 NT62.\n\nSo NT38 can either produce NT28 followed by NT32 or NT32 followed by NT62.\n\nHmm, but we have t38 in the string, so one of these would have to produce t38. Let me see: Wait, but actually, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't26'. So each production must eventually derive into these terminals, not other non-terminals.\n\nWait, so let's reorient. I might have to look at each terminal in the string and see where they can come from.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should approach this by trying to find a derivation path for the entire string.\n\nThe string is `t26 t57 t38 t64 t49`. Let's list the tokens in order.\n\nSo, we need to derive t26 from somewhere, t57, t38, t64, t49.\n\nLooking back, let's start from S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo S starts as NT41 NT23. To get NT41 producing something that can give t26, t57, t38, etc., let's see.\n\nNT41 produces NT34 NT49. So, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Now, we need to break these down.\n\nNT34 produces NT26 NT28. So, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT28. That's good for the first t26. Now we need to get t57 from NT49.\n\nLooking at NT49, I don't see any production listed, but wait, let's check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, for example, NT35 -> NT62, and other possibilities, but I'm not sure if NT49 has any productions. Wait, in the grammar, looking back, I see NT49 is a non-terminal? Wait no, looking again: The productions are all for non-terminals like S, NT23, etc. So I think NT49 might not be a terminal, but let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT49 is on the right side of some productions:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT55 NT49\n\nNT37\u2192 't49' \u2192 Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at the last entries:\n\nNT53: Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, checking the grammar again:\n\nWait, according to the user's grammar list, NT24->'t49' is one of the productions. So for NT24, one of its productions is NT24 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal.\n\nBut for NT49, I don't see any production except some lines earlier. Let me scan the list again.\n\nLooking for NT's that can produce t49.\n\nHmm, let me check if any NT's include 't49' as a production.\n\nYes, I see: NT24 \u2192 't49'.\n\nBut what about NT49? There\u2019s a line: NT55->NT22 NT27, so NT55 is a non-terminal. I think in this case, NT49 is never a non-terminal on the left; perhaps only NT24 can produce 't49'. So, going back.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and NT41->NT34 NT49. Then, NT34\u2192NT26 NT28, and NT49, well, if NT49 can't be broken down, then this would potentially be a problem because we have t49 in the string, but NT49 might not have a production to 't49'.\n\nWait, but actually in the list, let's check NT49's productions. I see:\n\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nNT37->'t84'\n\nNT23->'t83'\n\nNT58->'t74'\n\nNT3->'t64'\n\nNT30->'t37'\n\nNT32->'t24'\n\nNT55->'t65'\n\nNT24->'t49'\n\nSo, in this grammar, only NT24 can produce 't49' as a terminal. But NT49 is a non-terminal that doesn't seem to have a production to 't49'. So, NT49 would need to be broken down into more non-terminals, which in turn would need to derive into 't49', but since it's not possible, this might mean that the string `t26 t57 t38 t64 t49` can't be generated because after deriving t26, we'd end up with NT49 which can't directly produce 't49' unless there's a rule that allows it, which I don't see here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should follow a different pathway.\n\nWait another idea: Maybe S\u2192 NT41 NT23 starts the process. Then, looking at S, which breaks into NT41 and NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23, its production is NT23 \u2192 't83'.\n\nSo if I have S \u2192 NT41 't83', then the string so far would be '... t83', which is not matching the string we have, which starts with t26.\n\nSo perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-86","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t13 t71 t19 t7 t22 t33` is generated by the provided CFG in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. Since the grammar is given in CNF, that should make parsing strategies easier, but I'll just take note as I go along.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals at the top level are S, NT23, NT27, and NT55. The start symbol is S. The production rules for S are:\n\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2. S -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo, the string starts with S, and from S, we derive either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58. Let's check where NT41 and NT58 lead.\n\nLooking at NT41, the productions are:\n- NT41 -> NT34 NT49\n- NT41 -> NT35 NT3 (from the rule NT38 -> NT28 NT32 and others, but no, wait. Let me check again. Wait, NT34 and NT35 are specific to NT41. \n\nWait, actually, the specific productions for NT41 are only two:\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT41 -> NT35 NT3\n\nSo, from NT41, we can split into NT34 NT49 or NT35 NT3.\n\nSimilarly, for NT58, the productions are:\nNT58 -> NT15 NT24\nNT58 -> NT15 NT28?\n\nWait, no, looking back: \n\nWait, for NT58:\n\nLooking through the rules:\nNT58 -> NT15 NT24\nAnd also, earlier, the rule for NT24: NT24 -> NT23 NT28, which is 't49' or something, but perhaps it's better to focus on NT58's productions.\n\nWait, the grammar for NT58 is:\nNT58 -> NT15 NT24\nAnd then looking at NT24's productions:\nNT24 -> NT23 NT28\nNT24 also has:\nNT24 -> NT28 NT36\nSo I think NT58 can produce NT15 NT24, and then NT24 can split into different things.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this by breaking down the string step by step, working from the root (S) downwards.\n\nThe string is: t13 t71 t19 t7 t22 t33.\n\nFirst, the string is six tokens long, so we need to generate a derivation tree that ends in six symbols. Since each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, each step will reduce the count by one.\n\nWait, no. In a CNF grammar, each production is either A -> BC or A -> aB, where a is a terminal. So each derivation step produces more symbols from non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to attempt to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S and applying the rules.\n\nLet me list the possible steps:\n\nThe string is six tokens: t13, t71, t19, t7, t22, t33.\n\nBut wait, according to the grammar, t's are terminals. So each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So each tX is a terminal.\n\nLet me list the string as a sequence: t13, t71, t19, t7, t22, t33.\n\nBut each step in the derivation will use productions to break down these terminals into their sources.\n\nBut first, let's consider the possible start.\n\nThe string begins with t13. Looking at the grammar, let's find which productions end with 't13'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT41 has a production: NT41 -> NT35 NT3, and NT41 also has NT34 NT49. Wait, perhaps looking for what produces a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should first note which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and see if their productions end with terminals:\n\nNT41:\n- NT41 -> NT34 NT49\n- NT41 -> NT35 NT3\nOther rules: looking at NT34: what does it produce?\n\nLooking at NT34's productions:\nNT34 -> NT26 NT28\nNT34 also has: NT36 -> ... but no, NT34 is only in NT41's productions.\n\nSo NT34 is two non-terminals, which means it's deeper into the grammar.\n\nSimilarly, NT35: looking for NT35's productions.\n\nNT35:\n- NT35 -> NT7 NT49\n- NT35 -> NT62 NT49 (wait, NT62? No, wait, the rules I see are:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's: NT7 -> 't58', NT41 -> 't13', etc.\n\nSo for NT35, the productions are:\n\n- NT35 -> NT7 NT49\n- NT35 -> NT62 NT49? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT7 is a terminal because it's 't58'. NT49 is a non-terminal.\n\nSo NT35 -> NT7 NT49 becomes 't58' NT49.\n\nBut in the string, we have t13. Where does t13 come from?\n\nLooking for NT35's rules:\n\nWait, under NT35:\nNT35 -> NT7 NT49\nand possibly other rules. Let me check if NT35 appears elsewhere.\n\nWait, I see NT47 -> NT10 NT22, so that's another NT47.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps NT35 is another non-terminal with more rules.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go methodically.\n\nLooking for where 't13' appears:\n\nIn the grammar, NT41 -> 't13' as the second part of the RHS in one of its productions. So when NT41 is derived, the second non-terminal could produce 't13' or 't35' or 't62'?\n\nWait, looking again, NT41's productions are:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nNT41 -> NT35 NT3\n\nSo when NT41 is expanded, the second part could be NT34 NT49 or NT35 NT3.\n\nBut in these, we might get to t13. Let's see.\n\nLooking down the chain:\n\nFor NT35, productions are:\n\nNT35 -> NT7 NT49\n\nAnd NT7 -> 't58'\n\nSo NT35 would expand to 't58' NT49.\n\nBut in the string, the terminal is t13.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another rule that I missed.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT34 -> NT26 NT28.\n\nThen NT26 -> NT15 NT59\n\nAnd NT15 -> 't71'\n\nSo NT26 would produce 't71' and NT59. Then NT59 might go to 't19' or what?\n\nWait, let me write out the expansions step by step.\n\nThe string is t13 t71 t19 t7 t22 t33.\n\nWe start with S -> NT41 NT23 or S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t13, which is a terminal, I think the first derivation would involve expanding NT41 because t13 is the second part of NT41's production.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t13, so perhaps NT41 must produce something that can lead to t13 as the first terminal.\n\nLooking at NT41, it can produce NT34 NT49 or NT35 NT3.\n\nSo to get t13 as the first symbol, perhaps NT41's second part must be something that leads to t13.\n\nLooking at NT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nNT34 -> NT26 NT28.\n\nNT26 -> NT15 NT59.\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT59 -> 't19'\n\nSo if we expand NT34, we get 't71' 't19' as part of a production.\n\nBut in the string, after t13, the next symbol is t71, so that might fit.\n\nWait, no. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the string is t13, t71, t19, t7, t22, t33.\n\nIf the first non-terminal is NT41, which can produce NT35 NT3, let's see:\n\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires each production rule to have exactly two non-terminals on the right side.

But looking at the grammar provided, most of the productions have two non-terminals, like S -> NT41 NT23, which is two parts. There are a few productions that have a single non-terminal, like NT5 -> NT5 NT43 (which actually has two, so maybe all are okay), wait, actually, all the productions are of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, which is consistent with CNF.\n\nSo, the string is about 't's, which are terminals, and the non-terminals are the NT numbers.

{"custom_id":"request-110","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the string `t26 t57 t71 t19 t7 t24 t38` is generated by the given grammar. First, I need to understand how the grammar works. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except possibly the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal. So every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the non-terminals are defined in terms of other non-terminals, and some are terminals. The terminals end up being the 't' followed by numbers. So the string consists of several terminals, and I need to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string we're checking is `t26 t57 t71 t19 t7 t24 t38`. Let's write them down: t26, t57, t71, t19, t7, t24, t38. Each of these must be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So any string derived from S will start with either NT41... or NT41... something else. Looking at the string, it starts with t26. Let's check where t26 comes from in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT24 \u2192 t33, NT28 \u2192 t26. So t26 is part of NT28. So perhaps the first part of the string comes from NT28's production.\n\nLooking at NT28, it can be NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, or NT28 \u2192 NT41 NT7, or others? Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nLooking back, the NT28 production is listed as NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 and also NT28 \u2192 NT41 NT2. Wait, no\u2014 looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT28 \u2192 NT41 NT2? Hmm, let me go through each production.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31\nNT43 -> NT16 NT7\nNT35 -> NT62 NT26\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all the NTs and their possible rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to try the CYK algorithm. Since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm can be applied.\n\nThe string has length 7. Let's consider each character step by step.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can try building a parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe string is t26, t57, t71, t19, t7, t24, t38.\n\nFirst, check which non-terminals can directly produce these terminals.\n\n- t26 is from NT28 (as per NT28 \u2192 t26)\n- t57: Looking at the rules, I see NT43 \u2192 t57\n- t71: NT15 \u2192 t71\n- t19: NT8 \u2192 t19\n- t7: NT7 \u2192 t7\n- t24: NT24 \u2192 t24\n- t38: NT38 \u2192 t38\n\nNow, let's see how these can fit into the grammar.\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nAssuming the string starts with NT41, which would produce t13 (from NT41 \u2192 t13), but our first symbol is t26, so that can't be. Alternatively, if it starts with NT58, but NT58 \u2192 t17, which is not t26. Hmm, that suggests maybe I'm misunderstanding how the start symbol works.\n\nWait, S can be NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the first non-terminal is NT41, which is part of the S production. Then the second part is NT23, which is a terminal (t23). Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the symbols like NT23 are non-terminals. But in the given string, the first token is t26, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure. The initial string is a sequence of terminals, but in the grammar, some non-terminals resolve to terminals. So let's see:\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So S would generate NT41 followed by NT23. Since the string has 7 tokens, perhaps we can split them accordingly.\n\nWait, the string is t26 t57 t71 t19 t7 t24 t38. Let's see if we can group them into two parts starting with NT41 and NT23.\n\nBut NT23 is a terminal (t23), but in the string, the last token is t38, so that can't fit. Alternatively, maybe the initial split is different.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and each NT is a non-terminal that can expand into terminals. So for the string, perhaps the first part is NT41 expanding into some sequence, and NT23 into others.\n\nWait, but NT23 is a terminal, so that can only be t23, but the string starts with t26, so this seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a longer chain. For example, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then NT41 needs to produce the first part of the string, but S is splitting the string into two parts, each of which must come from NT41 and NT23, respectively.\n\nWait, but in the string, there are 7 tokens, so when split by S's production, each part should have a certain number of tokens. For example, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the left part (NT41) could be 1 token, and the right part (NT23) could be 6 tokens. But looking at the grammar, NT41 and NT23 are both terminals (t13 and t23), which don't match the string's first and last tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is entirely generated from a single S production, but that seems unlikely because the length would have to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the NTs can produce multiple symbols each. So each NT can represent a part of the string, which itself is built from other NTs or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the CYK algorithm to determine if the string is in the language.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each cell (i, j) corresponds to a substring from position i to j.\n2. For each substring length, starting from 1 up to the length of the string.\n3. For each substring of that length, determine if it can be generated by any non-terminal A by checking if A can be split into two parts (from the grammar) and both parts can generate the corresponding parts of the substring.\n\nGiven the string length is 7, the CYK table will be 7x7.\n\nLet's label the string positions from 0 to 6 for easier reference:\nPositions: 0(t26), 1(t57), 2(t71), 3(t19), 4(t7), 5(t24), 6(t38)\n\nThe CYK table has rows and columns from 0 to 6.\n\nInitialize the table: For each position i, check if the single character can be derived from any non-terminal A. So, we look for A where A \u2192 a, with a being the character at position i.\n\nFirst step: populate the diagonal of the table with the non-terminals that can derive single tokens.\n\nSingle character 't26': Look for NTs that produce 't26'. Checking the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 t26, so NT28 can produce t26. So table[0][0] = NT28.\n\nSimilarly:\n- t57: NT43 \u2192 t57, so table[1][1] = NT43.\n- t71: NT15 \u2192 t71, table[2][2] = NT15.\n- t19: NT8 \u2192 t19, table[3][3] = NT8.\n- t7: NT7 \u2192 t7, table[4][4] = NT7.\n- t24: NT24 \u2192 t24, table[5][5] = NT24.\n- t38: NT38 \u2192 t38, table[6][6] = NT38.\n\nNext, for substrings of length 2: from positions i to i+1.\n\nCheck for all i from 0 to 5:\n\nFor example, positions 0-1: 't26', 't57'. The non-terminal must produce these two in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-131","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about determining if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I'm given is: t26 t57 t66 t63 t83 t7 t9 t33. I need to figure out if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It's a big set of productions, but I notice that some of them produce terminals directly. For example, S expands into NT41 NT23, which then might expand into other non-terminals. The goal is to see if I can break down the string into parts that match these productions.\n\nLet me start by breaking the string into tokens: t26, t57, t66, t63, t83, t7, t9, t33. Since Chomsky Normal Form only allows for two non-terminals per production, each production step should add one symbol to the string. Since the string has 8 tokens, and each production adds one, the string should be 7 productions long, starting from S \u2192 NTs.\n\nI think I need to see if each token corresponds to a terminal in some production. Looking at the grammar, there are several production rules that directly expand to terminals. Let's list some of them:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT24 \u2192 't49'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n- NT36 \u2192 't9'\n- NT37 \u2192 't84'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT30 \u2192 't37'\n- NT55 \u2192 't65'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't63'\n- NT42 \u2192 't11'\n- NT24 \u2192 't27'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n\nHmm, I need to see if each token in the string can be matched by these production rules.\n\nLooking at the first token, t26. Checking the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't26', right? So t26 corresponds to NT28. Then the next token is t57. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see a NT directly producing 't57'. Let me check more carefully. There's NT55 \u2192 't65' and NT36 \u2192 't63', but nothing clearly for 't57'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount.\n\nWait, wait. Looking back, the rules provided include:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\nNT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7\nNT16 \u2192 't81'\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\n\nOh, I see that NT7 goes to 't58'. Hmm, but I don't see 't57' being produced by any rule. Did I miss one? Let me scan the list again.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't57'. That seems problematic. Because if the second token is 't57', but there's no production for that, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me check the grammar again more carefully. I'll list the rules in more organized way:\n\nI see that NT58 is replaced by 't74', but 't57' isn't present.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me scan through all the rules again:\n\nLooking at the list, for NT rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT3 \u2192 't63'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT24 \u2192 't49'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n- NT36 \u2192 't9'\n- NT37 \u2192 't84' (and another rule for 't58' maybe? Or is that another one? Let me check.\n\nWait, 't58' is produced by NT58, and another rule says 't17' for NT58. Oh, so 't58' is ambiguous, but perhaps two rules point to 't58'. But for 't57', I don't see any NT that directly leads to that.\n\nSo that's a problem. If the second token is 't57', and there's no NT that produces it, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-125","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t13 t59 t83 t7 t9 t33 t24 t38`. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the derivation process, and it's commonly used in parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it indeed follows CNF since all the production rules either have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these production rules.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual tokens: [t13, t59, t83, t7, t9, t33, t24, t38]. I'll need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the grammar, and if the sequence can be part of a valid derivation starting from S.\n\nStarting with the beginning of the string, the first symbol is t13. Looking through the grammar, I see that S can produce NT41 NT23. NT41 is a non-terminal. So, let's see how NT41 derives. From the grammar, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then, NT34 \u2192 NT26, and NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. NT15 has two productions: NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, and NT15 \u2192 NT71. Wait, but NT31 is also a non-terminal, so maybe that's a path, but I need to ensure all steps lead to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see each terminal in the string and check the possible productions that can derive to them. For example, looking at t13: in the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t13. So, if a non-terminal can derive to t13, that's good.\n\nSimilarly, t59 is in NT49 \u2192 t59. So if a non-terminal can derive to t59, that's a yes.\n\nWait, but I need to see how these terminals can combine in a way that builds the string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to ensure that each consecutive pair of terminals in the string can be the result of expanding a non-terminal pair into those terminals.\n\nLet me list the possible production rules and their terminals:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23: So, if I can derive the substring t13 followed by t83 (since NT23's production is t83?), wait, NT23 \u2192 t83? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking up NT23: in the grammar, NT23 \u2192 't83'. Yes, so that's direct. So S \u2192 NT41 't83'.\n\nBut the string starts with t13, so I need to see if NT41 can derive t13 and the next non-terminal leads to the rest. But wait, S is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which would produce t13 followed by t83 as per NT41 and NT23. But the string starts with t13, then t59, then t83, etc. Wait, that doesn't match because t13 is from NT41 and t83 is from NT23. So S would produce t13 t83, but the string is t13 t59 t83... That doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps S isn't expanding directly via NT41 NT23. Maybe another path. Let's look at the other production of S: S \u2192 NT41 NT58. NT58 \u2192 t74 as per the grammar. Wait, in the grammar, NT58 \u2192 't74', yes. So S would produce t13 followed by t74 if NT41 produces t13 and NT58 produces t74. But in the string, after t13 is t59. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, maybe S isn't the starting point directly. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built through multiple steps, but given that the string is eight tokens long, I need to see a derivation that produces exactly this sequence.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach this by parsing the string from the start. Let's think about the structure.\n\nLooking at the string t13 t59 t83 t7 t9 t33 t24 t38.\n\nI can try to group the tokens into pairs, as in a rightmost derivation or something. Each step in the derivation would substitute a non-terminal into two tokens.\n\nBut the problem is, the string has eight tokens, which is 7 symbols, but since each production either emits a terminal or a non-terminal, perhaps it's 7 steps? Not sure. Maybe better to think in terms of how many steps would lead to eight terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from S and expanding it step by step, ensuring each expansion leads closer to the target string.\n\nLet me try a possible path.\n\nS can be S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nBut looking at t13 and t59, perhaps NT41 \u2192 t13 and NT58 \u2192 t59 is possible? Wait, but NT58 \u2192 t74, so no. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking for production rules that directly correspond to t13. NT41 \u2192 t13. So, if NT41 can produce t13, and then some other non-terminal that can produce the rest.\n\nBut let's see. Maybe S expands to NT41 and NT58. If we can get t13 from NT41, then perhaps NT58 can produce the rest of the string: t59 t83 t7 t9 t33 t24 t38.\n\nWait, but that would make the string t13 followed by whatever NT58 produces. The next part of the string after t13 is t59. So, maybe NT58's expansion starts with t59.\n\nLooking at NT58, the production is NT58 \u2192 't74' as per the grammar. But 't74' is not in the string. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can expand to other possibilities, but let's check all S's options:\n\nS can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nWe're looking for t13 t59... So, let's see:\n\nIf NT41 produces t13 (NT41 \u2192 t13), and NT23 produces t83 (NT23 \u2192 t83), then S would produce t13 t83 as the first two tokens. But in the string, the second token is t59, not t83. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if S expands to NT41 NT58, then NT41 \u2192 t13, NT58 \u2192 t74. But the string starts with t13, then t59, which doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe S is not the direct start. Alternatively, perhaps the string is the result of intermediate expansions of non-terminals, but I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: check all possible non-terminals that can derive into each token, and see if there's a way to form the string.\n\nt13: NT41 \u2192 t13.\n\nt59: NT49 \u2192 t59.\n\nt83: NT23 \u2192 t83.\n\nt7: NT7 \u2192 t7 (from grammar: NT7 \u2192 t58, but wait, no. Let me check. Oh, NO: the grammar has some entries that have terminals as 'a', like NT36 \u2192 't62' etc. So in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking for t7: I don't see any NT7 productions in the grammar. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT7 having a production to t7. So perhaps t7 comes from another non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar, the production NT7 \u2192 't58' is listed, but that's a terminal t58, not t7. So perhaps t7 is not directly produced, which is a problem because the string has t7 as the 7th token.\n\nWait, that's a problem because if t7 isn't directly produced by any rule, then the string can't be derived. But wait, maybe t7 is produced by another path. Let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production that directly gives t7. The rules for NT7 are given as NT7 \u2192 't58', which is a terminal, meaning t58 is produced. So t7 isn't directly a terminal in the grammar, which would be a problem because the string includes t7, which would need to be generated by some rule.\n\nSo that suggests that the string can't be derived because t7 isn't present in the grammar as a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t13 t38 t64 t83 t26 t7 t66 t7 t66`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that each production rule be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. It also specifies that all productions are binary except possibly the start symbol, but in this case, the given grammar seems to follow CNF because each rule on the left side has exactly two symbols on the right, except for the terminals which are single symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided, they all follow this structure, with each non-terminal expanding into two other non-terminals, and some ending with terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, where NT41 and NT23 are non-terminals. These non-terminals then expand further, typically into other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe string we're evaluating is `t13 t38 t64 t83 t26 t7 t66 t7 t66`. I notice that most of these are terminals. Each symbol in the string should correspond to a terminal produced by one of these rules. \n\nTo see if the string is possible, I can try to decompose it from start to finish or top-down, but given that the string is quite long, another approach is to see if the number of non-terminals or steps matches what's expected for the length of the string. Alternatively, we can build a parse tree and see if it correctly reduces to the start non-terminal S.\n\nAnother method is to simulate the parse process. For a string of length n, a context-free grammar would typically require a parse tree with n-1 internal nodes (since each internal node corresponds to a rule that combines two symbols). But in this case, the string has 9 symbols, which would require at least 8 internal nodes. However, the grammar has a limited number of non-terminals, so the structure is probably more constrained.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, each symbol is a terminal except for the NTs. The NTs are all connected in binary trees, so any valid string should follow a sequence that can be traced back up through these productions. \n\nLet me try to map each symbol in the string to possible non-terminals that can produce them. For example, 't13' comes from NT41 \u2192 t13 (from NT41 -> 't13'). Similarly, 't38' comes from NT28 \u2192 NT38, which then must derive to 't38'. But wait, checking the rule for NT28: it says NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, which are other non-terminals. \n\nWait, looking at the string again: the sequence starts with t13, which is a terminal. According to the grammar, NT41 can produce 't13'. So, the first symbol t13 must come from NT41. Now, the next symbol is t38, which comes from NT28, which then is part of NT41's production. So let's see:\n\nLooking at the string: t13 t38 t64 t83 t26 t7 t66 t7 t66.\n\nBreaking it down step by step. Start with S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the string would have to parse as starting with S, which is NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the entire string must be a sequence where the first part is the expansion of NT41 and the second part of the string is the expansion of NT23.\n\nLooking at the string: the first part is t13 t38 t64 t83 t26 t7, and the second part is t66 t7 t66.\n\nWait, but let me think: the entire string is 9 tokens, so when S (which is two non-terminals) expands, each part must derive into 5 tokens and 4 tokens, or something that sums to 9. But wait, no. Let me see:\n\nEach production of a non-terminal is two symbols, each of which could themselves expand into multiple symbols or be terminals. So the total number of symbols in the derived string must be determined by the number of leftmost expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the sequence of terminals can be linked through the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to map each terminal to its corresponding production.\n\nThe string: t13 t38 t64 t83 t26 t7 t66 t7 t66.\n\nFirst, t13 \u2192 NT41 (since NT41 \u2192 't13').\n\nNext, after t13 comes t38. So after NT41, which is 't13', the next symbol is t38, which should come from NT28, as NT28 \u2192 't38'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I don't see a rule that directly produces t38. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nLooking at NT38: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32.\n\nAh, so NT38 can produce NT28 and NT32, which are non-terminals. So for the second symbol, t38, it must come from NT38 \u2192 't38'. Wait, but in the rules, NT38 is NT28 NT32. So how does NT38 produce 't38'? Because in the rules, some NTs have terminals as their productions.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, I'm looking for where NT28 can produce 't38'. Actually, there is an NT38 rule: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. So NT38 doesn't directly produce 't38'; instead, it produces two non-terminals, NT28 and NT32.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an NT38 rule that produces 't38'. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31. So NT38 is a non-terminal, and another rule is NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. Wait, looking for where NT38 is a terminal? Maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking back, there's a line: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. So that's a rule for NT38. Another line: does NT38 produce a terminal? Checking the list, I don't see any terminal 't38' directly. For example, NT38 isn't mentioned with a rule that ends with 't38'.\n\nWait, but actually, maybe other non-terminals derive into 't38'. No, from the rules given, NT38 as a non-terminal always expands into other non-terminals.\n\nWait a second, maybe I missed some rules. Let me go through all the rules quickly.\n\nWait, one of the lines says NT7 \u2192 't58', NT41 \u2192 't13', and so on. So each of these NTs can end up as terminals.\n\nLooking for 't38' in the terminal productions:\n\nWait, looking at the lines:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't49' \n\nWait, but I'm looking for 't38'. Maybe I missed it. Looking through the provided rules, I don't see an NT that produces 't38' as a terminal. Because in the rules, NT28 is NT38 NT31, so it's not being directly set as a terminal.\n\nSo if 't38' is in the string, but there's no rule where a non-terminal directly goes to 't38', that would mean the string has a terminal that the grammar can't produce, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong and there's a rule I missed.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps in the provided rules there is a production that results in 't38', but I didn't spot it.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT37: NT58 NT32, but no terminal.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, in the rules, I have:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n\nSo NT28 and NT38 produce each other's non-terminals, which seems to form a loop. So they can't produce terminals, which means they can't derive to 't38'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't38', perhaps it's in another NT that's not shown here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, let me think differently: perhaps the string is t13 t38 t64 t83 t26 t7 t66 t7 t66. Let's try to build up the parse tree.\n\nStart"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-148","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string `t13 t38 t63 t83 t7 t24 t38 t7 t66` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not sure about the exact method to apply here.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t13, t38, t63, t83, t7, t24, t38, t7, t66. Each of these must have been derived from the non-terminals in the grammar through a series of productions.\n\nI think I should try to break down the string into parts that match the productions. Since each production in CNF splits into two non-terminals, except for the terminals themselves, each token in the string should correspond to a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, many non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, but NT41 \u2192 t13, NT23 \u2192 t83. So when S is expanded, it's t13 t83. But the string isn't just that; it's longer. So maybe multiple productions are involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed by multiple applications of the productions. Maybe I should try to see if each token corresponds to a production that can be derived from the others.\n\nLet me look at each token:\n\n- t13: Looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t13. So perhaps the first part comes from NT41.\n\n- t38: Where does t38 come from? Looking at the grammar, NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. NT28 \u2192 t26 and NT32 \u2192 t24. Wait, but NT28 also can expand to other things, like NT38 \u2192 NT32 NT31. Hmm, this seems a bit tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let's try to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, it should expand in a way that each step reduces the count of non-terminals by one.\n\nThe string has 9 tokens. So the start symbol S (which is a non-terminal) would generate a sequence of 9 terminals. Since S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which are two non-terminals, each of which can produce more non-terminals, but eventually, each must produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which are two non-terminals, so the string produced by S should have two parts, each part being the expansion of NT41 and NT23. So the string should be something like the concatenation of the expansions of NT41 and NT23.\n\nBut the given string is 9 tokens long. Let's see: t13 is the first token, which comes from NT41 \u2192 t13. Then t38, t63, etc., which must come from NT23's expansion.\n\nWait, NT23 is a non-terminal. Let me check its productions. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83'. Oh, so NT23 directly produces t83, which is the last token of the string. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, looking at the first part, after t13 comes t38, t63, t7, t24, t38, t7, t66. Wait, that's 7 tokens before the last t83. But since S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the entire expansion is the concatenation of NT41's expansion and NT23's expansion. So the first part (before t83) must be 7 tokens from NT41.\n\nWait, no. NT41 produces t13 (from NT41 \u2192 t13). So the first expansion is just t13. But the string has t13 followed by t38, etc., so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT41 is more complex. Let me check the productions for NT41.\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT41 \u2192 t13, and also other options? Looking at the list, yes, NT41 has two productions: NT41 \u2192 t13 and NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Oh, so NT41 can produce either t13 or the combination NT34 and NT49.\n\nSo if the first token is t13, then that's straightforward. But perhaps in this case, there's another possibility. Wait, no, the string starts with t13, which is derived directly by NT41 \u2192 t13, so that's fine.\n\nNow, the next token after t13 is t38. So after t13, we have t38, t63, t7, t24, t38, t7, t66 before t83. Hmm, this seems too long. Let's think about how the expansion proceeds.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT41 NT23, each of these non-terminals will generate their own parts. So the string must be a concatenation of what NT41 generates and what NT23 generates.\n\nBut NT23 \u2192 t83, so that's easy. Let's focus on NT41. If NT41 \u2192 t13, then the first token is t13, and then followed by the expansion of NT23, which is t83. But the string is t13 followed by 6 more tokens before t83. That's a problem because that would mean NT23 is expanding into 7 tokens, but in the grammar, NT23 directly produces a single terminal t83. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, the string is `t13 t38 t63 t83 t7 t24 t38 t7 t66`. Let me count the tokens: t13, t38, t63, t83, t7, t24, t38, t7, t66. That's 9 tokens. So S is expanding into 9 terminals. Since S is NT41 NT23, each of those must expand into a certain number of terminals, and the sum must be 9.\n\nWait, but NT41 can expand into either one terminal (t13) or two non-terminals (NT34 NT49). Similarly, NT23 can expand into one terminal (t83) or more. Let's think about how the string gets built up.\n\nPerhaps the first part comes from NT41 expanding into NT34 NT49, and then each of those non-terminals expand further. Let's see:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nThen NT34 \u2192 what? Let's check the productions for NT34: NT34 \u2192 t26. Wait, no, looking back, the productions for NT34: I see NT34 \u2192 t26 and also NT34 \u2192 NT36 NT26. So NT34 can produce t26 or NT36 NT26. Similarly, NT49 \u2192 t57 (if I'm looking correctly) or other options.\n\nWait, let's check NT34: looking at the grammar, NT34 has two productions: NT34 \u2192 t26 and NT34 \u2192 NT36 NT26.\n\nSimilarly, NT36 has two productions: NT36 \u2192 t9 and NT36 \u2192 NT28 NT32.\n\nSo for NT34, it can directly produce t26, but to get into a longer sequence, it would produce NT36 NT26. Then NT36 could produce t9 or NT28 NT32.\n\nBut in the string, after t13 (from NT41), the next token is t38. Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's consider that perhaps each token corresponds directly to a production rule, but that's not possible because the grammar includes non-terminal productions that split into two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build a tree starting from S and see if it can derive the string.\n\nLet's start. The string is t13, t38, t63, t83, t7, t24, t38, t7, t66.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So S must expand into two non-terminals, and the resulting string is the concatenation of their expansions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t13, which must come from NT41. Since NT41 can produce t13, that fits. Then the next token is t38, which must come from the expansion of NT23 or some other non-terminal.\n\nWait no, the first part is just the expansion of NT41, and then the second part is the expansion of NT23.

Let me see which non-terminals produce these:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT34 -> t26\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT36 -> t9, t22, t33, t63\n- NT33 -> t33 (wait, that's itself. Maybe a typo, but I'll proceed)\n- NT42 -> t11, t49, t74, t8, but wait, in the initial productions, NT42's rules are:\n  NT42 -> NT8 NT52, NT42 -> NT31 NT55, NT42 -> NT8 NT52, etc. So earlier, the user listed:\n  NT42 -> NT55 NT49, NT42 -> NT8 NT52, NT42 -> NT31 NT55, NT42 -> NT8 NT52. Let me check:\nLooking back, actually, at the initial grammar, NT42's rules are:\n  NT42 -> NT55 NT49, NT42 -> NT8 NT52, NT42 -> NT31 NT55, NT42 -> NT8 NT52.\n\nWait, in the initial list, the user wrote:\nNT42 -> NT55 NT49, NT42 -> NT8 NT52, NT42 -> NT31 NT55, NT42 -> NT8 NT52.\n\nSo each production for NT42 is a combination of two non-terminals. \n\nSimilarly, NT41's production is NT34 NT49, which is NT34 followed by NT49.\n\nSo, to break down the string step by step, starting from the end.\n\nThe string is: t13 t59 t19 t24 t54 t33 t7 t74 t7 t33.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to split the string into chunks that match the productions. Maybe I should build a parse tree starting from the end.\n\nLooking for the end symbols:\n\n- The last part is 't33 t7 t74 t7 t33' at the very end. Wait, the string is actually: t13 t59 t19 t24 t54 t33 t7 t74 t7 t33. So let's try to build from the end.\n\nFirst, the initial string is t13 t59 t19 t24 t54 t33 t7 t74 t7 t33.\n\nLet me split this into parts that might fit the grammar. I'll look for possible splits.\n\nFirst, the last two tokens are t74 and t7. Wait, that's two tokens, but in the grammar, only certain non-terminals produce two tokens. Wait, actually, in the grammar, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the string must be viewed as a sequence of terminals and non-terminals expanding into other components.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the entire string is a derivation from S.\n\nStarting from S, the grammar produces either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the first step is to see if the string can be split into two parts that each match NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's a sequence of 't's, so perhaps the entire string is built from S by expanding into a sequence of 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if the string can be divided into parts that match NT23 and NT41 or NT58 and NT41, but considering that each NT production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backward.\n\nLet's see.\n\nThe entire string is t13 t59 t19 t24 t54 t33 t7 t74 t7 t33.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of 't's, but non-terminals can generate 't's as well, perhaps the entire string is made up of non-terminals that each produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no. The string is given as a sequence of 't's, so each token is a terminal. So the string is a terminal string, meaning all non-terminals must have been expanded completely into terminals.\n\nSo, to check if the string is generated, I need to see if we can parse it into the non-terminals that S can derive.\n\nStarting from the entire string, I'll try to split it into components that match the right-hand sides of the grammar.\n\nFirst, check if the entire string can be matched by S's productions: NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, S is S -> NT41 NT23 or S -> NT41 NT58. So each production is two non-terminals. So the entire string must be generated from one of those.\n\nLooking at the string, it's t13 t59 t19 t24 t54 t33 t7 t74 t7 t33, which is 10 tokens. So the string must come from splitting into two parts each of which is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but how? Because each non-terminal can expand into multiple non-terminals, but in the string, it's all terminals. So I think that the string must be the result of fully expanding S into terminals, so the entire string is generated in one way or another.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string backward.\n\nThe last two symbols are t7 and t33. Wait, but perhaps it's better to consider that the end of the string corresponds to the end of a production.\n\nLet me look for possible splits.\n\nStarting from the end, t33 at the end. Looking for a production that ends with t33.\n\nLooking at the productions, some non-terminals produce t33 as NT33's production, which can be through NT33 -> t33 or other rules.\n\nWait, the user provided a list, so I should check all the rules that have 't33'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT26\n- NT33 -> NT36 NT22\n- NT33 -> NT24\n- NT33 -> NT54\n- Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the productions are listed as:\n\n- NT36 -> 't63'\nWait, no, in the productions, it's:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, here are some lines:\n\n- NT36 -> 't63'\n- NT28 -> 't7'\n- NT7 -> 't58'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the structure of the grammar and the target string. The goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding according to the rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of terminals: t26 t57 t66 t64 t19 t7 t7 t38 t7 t38. Since S is the start symbol, the string should be a sequence of terminals reachable from S through a series of productions.\n\nIn CNF grammars, each production either combines two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal. To generate the string, each step in the derivation should replace non-terminals with pairs of non-terminals or terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me start by looking at the possible ways the terminals in the string can be formed. Each terminal is a result of a production like NT... -> 'txxx'.\n\nI'll list out the productions that result in these terminals:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n- NT57 comes directly from NT43 \u2192 't43' (since 43 is 43 -> t62? Wait, in the grammar, NT43 \u2192 't62'. Wait, the string has t57, which isn't directly in any production. Wait, looking back, the string is t26 t57 t66 t64 t19 t7 t7 t38 t7 t38.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again to see if any non-terminals produce 't57'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT36 \u2192 't9' and NT28 \u2192 't26'. But I don't see any production that results in 't57'. Hmm, that seems like a problem because 't57' is in the string but I don't see any non-terminal in the grammar that produces it.\n\nWait, did I miss that? Let me go through each production carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that NT24 \u2192 't49', NT35 \u2192 't62', NT41 \u2192 't13', etc. But I don't see any production for 't57'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see NT36 -> 't9' and NT28 -> 't26'. There's also NT58 -> 't74' and NT3 -> 't64', but no NT57. Oh, wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I don't see any that produce 't57'. So the string contains 't57', which is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. That would mean the grammar can't generate the string, so the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Going through each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT41 (No, S's productions are S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or NT58, etc. But I don't see t57 for any of those.)\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying 't57' as a terminal. Let me see: the string is t26 t57 t66 t64 t19 t7 t7 t38 t7 t38.\n\nSo 't57' is indeed in the string, right in the second position. Now, in the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't57'? Looking through all the productions, I don't see any. Each 't' is either a direct terminal, but none seem to produce 't57'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\nFor example, NT26 \u2192 't26', NT28 \u2192 't26', NT36 \u2192 't9' (wait, that's t9, not t57), NT35 \u2192 't62', etc. I don't see 't57' anywhere. So 't57' is not part of the terminals generated by the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the string can't be generated because it contains a terminal ('t57') that's not present in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string `t26 t57 t66 t64 t19 t7 t7 t38 t7 t38` includes the terminal symbol `t57`, which does not appear as a production in the grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t26 t57 t38 t63 t19 t7 t24 t66 t7 t84 t33`.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals themselves.

But the grammar is given in CNF, meaning each production rule has two non-terminals. So I'd need to find a path from S down to these terminals through the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be generated by considering each terminal as being produced by a node in the parse tree, starting from S.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, maybe it's easier to look for possible paths in the grammar. Let me try to see for each terminal what non-terminals can produce it as the first and second symbols.\n\nWait, no. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and each terminal is a single terminal.\n\nAlternatively, each terminal must appear at the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the entire string and trying to split it into parts that can be generated by the grammar rules. Sometimes, starting from the beginning, but maybe it's better to look for longer sequences.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt26 t57 t38 t63 t19 t7 t24 t66 t7 t84 t33\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst, t26: From grammar, NT28 -> 't26', NT36 -> 't26'. So t26 can be from NT28 or NT36.\n\nSimilarly, t57: Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production that directly leads to t57. Wait, in the grammar, NT16 is 't81', NT7 is 't58', NT3 is 't64', etc. Wait, does any rule lead to 't57'? Looking through the non-terminals:\n\nLooking, for example, NT7 -> 't58' (line 42), NT5 -> NT5 NT43, etc. It seems that 't57' might not be a terminal in the grammar, because looking at the list, there's no production rule ending with 't57'. Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n- 't57' isn't directly mentioned in any production as the result. So perhaps 't57' isn't a terminal in the grammar. Hmm, that's a problem because the given string contains 't57'.\n\nWait, maybe 't57' is a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in the translation. Let me check the grammar again carefully:\n\nLooking at every production, no NT ends with 't57'. So that's confusing because the string to evaluate has 't57', which isn't directly produced by any rule. That means either the grammar doesn't generate this string, making it a No, or perhaps 't57' is an abbreviation or a more complex production, but according to what's given, it's not directly a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parsing. Let me double-check. Let me scan all productions again:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that produces 't57' as a terminal.\n\nIn the provided grammar, the terminals are:\n\nNT16 -> 't81'\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT36 -> 't26' (line 10)\nNT34 -> 't26' (line 2)\nNT28 -> 't26'\nNT36 -> 't22' (line 20)\nWait, no 't57' is anywhere. So the presence of 't57' in the string suggests that the string isn't produced by the given grammar, unless 't57' is a derived symbol, but in CNF, it would only be a terminal if a production rule directly ends with it.

{"custom_id":"request-184","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t26 t57 t59 t19 t24 t9 t33 t24 t66 t24 t66`, and the grammar is a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. From what I remember, CNF restricts each production rule to have at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Additionally, all non-terminals must appear on the left-hand side, and the start symbol is the only one that can produce a terminal string without non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems to be in CNF because each rule on the left side (like S, NT26, etc.) is non-terminal and the right side has either two terminals or a combination of two non-terminals. Wait, actually, looking closely, some rules have terminals and non-terminals together, like S->NT41 NT23. So that would be two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF. However, other productions have more than two symbols on the right, like NT52 -> NT12 NT37 and others. Wait, wait, actually, no. Looking at some lines, for example, NT36 -> 't9' 't63' which would be a terminal string of two letters, but in CNF, each production can only have two non-terminals. So maybe there are some rules with more non-terminals? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me check again. For example, NT36 -> 't9' 't63' \u2014 these are terminals, so each of those is a leaf, so the production is a terminal, meaning that rule just replaces the non-terminal with two terminals, which is allowed in a modified CNF where non-terminals can lead to terminals. But the structure of the grammar provided seems to follow CNF, as each non-terminal on the left only has two symbols on the right, either terminals or non-terminals. So maybe this is a restricted form.\n\nAnyway, moving on. The string to evaluate is `t26 t57 t59 t19 t24 t9 t33 t24 t66 t24 t66`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nThe first thing to note is that in the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2. S -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo any string generated by S must be the concatenation of two symbols derived from NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58. Let me look at the string and see if it fits this structure.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t26. Let's see which non-terminals derive t26. Looking through the rules, I see NT24 -> 't49' and NT24 -> 't27', but t26 isn't directly there. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for NT that derive t26. Scanning through:\n\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT31\n- NT58 -> NT15 NT24\n- NT36 -> NT28 NT32\n- Wait, perhaps I need to look for NT whose productions include 't26'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT28 -> 't26' is there.\n\nWait, let me check again. Looking for production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't26':\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, I see several lines where the RHS has a terminal:\n\n- NT24 -> 't49'\n- NT24 -> 't27'\n- NT28 -> 't26' (since NT28 is a non-terminal that goes to 't26') \u2014 Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31,\n\nNT24 -> NT23 NT28,\n\nNT24 -> NT18 NT2,\n\nNT2 -> 't33',\n\nNT7 -> 't58',\n\nNT24 -> 't49',\n\nNT2 -> 't33',\n\nNT15 -> 't71',\n\nWait, no, I see that NT28 is a non-terminal that's replaced by NT38 and NT31. But perhaps NT38 can lead to t26? Wait, no. Let me check each rule thoroughly.\n\nLooking for any rule that directly has 't26' as a terminal:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT28 -> 't26'? Or maybe another rule. Let me go line by line.\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT31\n\n- NT24 -> NT23 NT28\n\n- NT24 -> NT18 NT2\n\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n\n- NT7 -> 't58'\n\n- NT24 -> 't49'\n\n- NT2 -> 't33'\n\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n\n- NT33 -> 't64'? Wait, no, NT33's productions:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look for any line where a non-terminal is replaced by t26.\n\nAh, I see here:\n\n- NT28 -> 't26' \u2014 wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the lines, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT38 NT31\n\n- NT52 -> NT12 NT37\n\n- NT26 -> NT15 NT59\n\n- NT36 -> NT28 NT32\n\n- NT24 -> NT23 NT28\n\nWait, perhaps I missed where 't26' is a terminal. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the entire list:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't49'\n\n- NT24 -> 't27'\n\n- NT28 -> 't26' \u2014 No, wait: Looking through the lines:\n\nNo, I don't see any production where a non-terminal is replaced directly by 't26'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> 't26' \u2014 Wait, no, I think I'm misremembering. Let me parse through each line carefully:\n\nLooking for any line where RHS is a single terminal 't26':\n\n- Looking through the lines, I don't see a production for a non-terminal being replaced by 't26' directly. For example, NT28 is replaced by NT38 and NT31, which are non-terminals. Similarly, NT36 is replaced by NT28 and NT32, which themselves derive further.\n\nWait, but looking for t26 in the terminal symbols of the given string, which is `t26 t57 t59 t19 t24 t9 t33 t24 t66 t24 t66`.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is 't26'. So that must come from a production that eventually leads to t26. But if no non-terminal in the grammar directly produces t26, then that token can't be generated. But I must have made a mistake because the user provided the grammar, and I assume that the question is correct, so perhaps I missed a production.\n\nWait, let me go through all the lines again:\n\nLooking carefully, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n\nWait, yes, actually in the given grammar rules, I see a line:\n\nNT28 -> 't26' \u2014 No, wait. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar rules, is there a rule where a non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal 't26'?\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNo, actually, in the provided grammar, I see NT28 -> NT38 NT31, which is two non-terminals. But wait, where is t26 derived from?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me look for any non-terminal that can derive t26. Let's see.\n\nFrom the string, we have t26 as the first token, which must be derived from some non-terminal NT. So which non-terminals derive t26?\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT37 -> 't64' \u2014 No\n- NT58 -> 't17' \u2014 No\n- NT43 -> 't62'\n- NT33 -> 't64'\n- NT28 -> 't26' \u2014 Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-207","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to determine whether the string `t26 t57 t38 t64 t83 t7 t7 t38 t7 t13 t28 t33` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The starting symbol is S.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals:\nt26, t57, t38, t64, t83, t7, t7, t38, t7, t13, t28, t33.\n\nI'll start by parsing the string from left to right, trying to match it against the grammar. Each step will involve finding a production that can generate the next part of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level productions are:\nS -> NT41 NT23\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo, the string must start with either \"NT41\" or \"NT41 NT58\". Wait, but S is S -> NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58, so after S, we have two parts: NT41 followed by NT23 or NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t26. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t26.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT26 -> NT15 NT59. But that doesn't help because NT15 and NT59 aren't terminals. Alternatively, I see NT28 -> t7 and other rules. Wait, let's list all the productions where the right-hand side includes a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT37 -> t84\n- NT30 -> t37\n- NT24 -> t49\n- NT58 -> t74\n- NT3 -> t64\n- NT30 -> t37\n- NT32 -> t24\n- NT55 -> t65\n- NT24 -> t33\n- NT7 -> t58\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT30 -> t24\n- NT36 -> t63\n- NT42 -> t11\n- NT24 -> t27\n- NT7 -> t58\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT30 -> t24\n- NT36 -> t54\n- NT23 -> t19\n- NT8 -> t35\n- NT15 -> t59\n- NT28 -> t7\n- NT3 -> t63\n- NT10 -> t28\n- NT31 -> t38\n- NT5 -> t66\n- NT32 -> t7\n- NT8 -> t14\n- NT24 -> t63\n- NT27 -> t9\n- NT49 -> t57\n\nSo, the terminals are:\n\nt26 (NT26?), t57 (NT57?), but looking at the grammar, NT57 is not a terminal, it's a production: NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43. Wait, that's not a terminal. So, no NT57 in the grammar. Wait, looking back, the string is `t26 t57 ...`. But in the grammar, there's no NT57 rule that produces a terminal. So that might already be an issue.\n\nWait, in the string, the first part is t26, which is a terminal. I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t26. Looking through the productions, do I see any NT rule that produces t26?\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't immediately see any NT production that ends with t26. But wait, maybe NT26 can derive to something. Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT26: the productions are:\n\nNT26 -> NT15 NT59\n\nBut that's all, so NT26 doesn't produce a terminal. Therefore, if the string starts with t26, that can't be produced by the start symbol S, because all productions from S start with non-terminals that eventually must produce the terminals.\n\nWait, unless S can directly produce t26, but looking at the start productions, S produces either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the first two symbols in the string should come from S's first production, which is NT41 ND23.\n\nBut the string starts with t26, which isn't an NT but a terminal. So that would mean the first production is S -> NT41 NT23. But then NT41 and NT23 should each produce sequences of terminals, but the string starts with t26, which is a terminal. So maybe NT23 can produce t26.\n\nWait, looking at NT23's productions: in the grammar, I see NT23 -> 't83', so yes, NT23 can produce t83. So if S->NT41 NT23, then NT41 produces something ending with t26, but wait, no, S's first production is NT41 followed by NT23. So the first part of the string would be what NT41 produces, then what NT23 produces.\n\nWait, but NT41 itself has productions. Looking at NT41, its productions are:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nAND\n\nNT41 -> 't13'\n\nSo, NT41 can produce either another non-terminal (which then produces more symbols) or t13 directly.\n\nBut in the string, the first terminal is t26. So if NT41 is supposed to produce t26, there's no rule for that. Therefore, this suggests that S->NT41 NT23 can't produce a string starting with t26, because NT41 can only produce t13 eventually, not t26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so every production is a non-terminal going to two non-terminals or a terminal. So S-> NT41 NT23, meaning the string will start with whatever NT41 produces, followed by whatever NT23 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with t26, so perhaps NT23 is the one that produces t26. Let me check NT23's productions.\n\nLooking up NT23: in the grammar, it appears that NT23 has:\n\nNT23 -> 't83'\n\nThat's it. So NT23 can only produce t83, not t26. Therefore, if the string starts with t26, that can't come from NT23, so the production S->NT41 NT23 can't produce t26 as the first symbol. Therefore, the entire string must start with NT41 producing t26, but looking at NT41's productions:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49 or 't13'\n\nThere's no production for NT41 to produce t26. So that suggests that the string can't be generated by S because the first symbol is t26, which can't be produced by the start symbol's first part.\n\nWait, but this is getting confusing. Maybe I'm not approaching it correctly. Let me try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which can be NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nThe string starts with t26. Let's assume S->NT41 NT23.\n\nSo after applying S->NT41 NT23, the first symbol must come from NT41.\n\nBut NT41 can produce either t13 or another non-terminal. Since the first symbol is t26, which is neither t13 nor possible via another production, this path fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S->NT41 NT58 is the production. Then, the first symbol comes from NT41 or NT58.\n\nIf it's S->NT41 NT58, then NT41 produces the first symbol, which is t26, but as before, NT41 can't produce t26.\n\nAlternatively, NT58 can produce t74 for example, but in the string, the second symbol is t57, which isn't a terminal in NT58's productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for other possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string doesn't start with either NT41 or NT58, but looking at the string, it starts with t26, which is a terminal. So the first step in the derivation must be a production that starts with a terminal, which in the grammar is only possible for non-terminals that have a rule leading to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the NTs, the ones that can produce terminals are:\n\nNT37 -> t84\n\nNT30 -> t37\n\nNT24 -> t49\n\nNT58 -> t74\n\nNT3 -> t64\n\nNT30 -> t37\n\nNT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to figure out if each symbol in the string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions that are either A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So all the given productions fit that form.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. I think the approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, maybe building a parse tree from the bottom up or top down. Since it's CNF, recursive descent parsing might work, but perhaps constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) could help visualize the derivation.\n\nI need to map each terminal token to the corresponding production. For example, let's look at the start symbol S. The productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo S can derive two different pairs. Let's see what those pairs expand into.\n\nLooking at NT41: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. NT34 \u2192 t26, and NT49 \u2192 t57. So NT41 \u2192 t26 t57.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 \u2192 t83.\n\nSo from S \u2192 NT41 NT23, S would expand to t26 t57 t83.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Let's see what NT58 is: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. NT15 \u2192 t71, NT24 \u2192 t49. So NT58 \u2192 t71 t49. NT41 is t26 t57. So S \u2192 t26 t57 t71 t49.\n\nWait, but the string we have starts with t26 t57, which matches the first production of S. So the first two tokens are generated by S via NT41. Then we have t71 t19 t26 t57 t28 t33.\n\nWait, maybe I should break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t26, t57, t71, t19, t26, t7, t38, t7, t26, t57, t28, t33.\n\nLet me see if this can be built from S. Since S is a start symbol, the root of the parse tree would be S, which expands into two non-terminals. Each of those can then expand further.\n\nSo let's look at the first two symbols: t26 t57. That's exactly what NT41 expands to, as we saw earlier. So NT41 is the first production from S.\n\nSo the leftmost two symbols (t26 t57) are handled by NT41. Then the next symbol is t71.\n\nNow, the third symbol is t71. But wait, after t26 t57 (NT41), the S production via NT41 NT23 would require the next symbol after t26 t57 to be the expansion of NT23, which is t83. But in our string, the third symbol is t71, which doesn't match t83, which is the expansion of NT23. Alternatively, if we're using the other S production, NT41 NT58, then after NT41 (t26 t57), the next symbol should be NT58.\n\nWait, but after t26 t57, the next symbol is t71, which is the same as the first symbol of NT58, since NT58 \u2192 t71 t49. So perhaps after handling t71, we need to handle t49. But in our string, after t26 t57, the next symbols are t71, t19, etc., which might require more expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string isn't generated by S. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe first symbol is t26, which must come from NT41 or somewhere else. But looking at the grammar, NT34 \u2192 t26, which would require NT41 to have t26. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 t26 is another possibility, but looking at the grammar, only NT34 and NT28 have t26. Wait, no, looking back, I think in the grammar:\n\nLooking through, for NT28, in the productions, NT28 is defined as NT38 NT31 and sometimes leads to t26 as when NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, and looking at NT31: NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT2. NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, but I might be getting lost here. Perhaps it's better to build a mapping of each terminal to its possible non-terminals.\n\nLet me make a list of each terminal and which non-terminals produce it:\n\nt26: Look through productions, NT36 \u2192 t26, NT28 \u2192 t26, NT24 \u2192 t26. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t26\n- NT28 \u2192 t26 (from NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2, and NT18 can go to t26 via NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59? No, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the steps.\n\nWait, let's look for each production that results in a terminal.\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\n1. S -> NT41 NT23\n2. S -> NT41 NT58\n3.

Let's see: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, and perhaps a chain further down. Wait, no, NT38 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Looking deeper, NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, and NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT2. So NT28 can produce t26 via NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 \u2192 (maybe more steps needed). Alternatively, NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT2 can produce other symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I have to determine if a certain string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t13 t59 t19 t26 t24 t26 t57 t8 t11 t33 t7 t84 t33`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given rules, I see various non-terminals like S, NT27, NT8, etc., and they eventually produce terminals like 't13', 't59', etc.\n\nThe target string consists of a sequence of terminals: t13, t59, t19, t26, t24, t26, t57, t8, t11, t33, t7, t84, t33. So, the string is made up of all terminals, meaning that from the top symbol S, the derivation would generate only terminals without any non-terminals left at the end.\n\nThe first step is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step adds exactly one terminal or replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, to generate a string of length 13, the derivation must have a leftmost derivation of 12 steps (since each step replaces a non-terminal with two, increasing the length by one each time).\n\nBut instead of trying to parse the string from the top-down approach, maybe it's better to build the parse tree or see if the string can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t13. Let's see which production rule leads to t13. Looking through the rules, I see NT41 \u2192 t13. So, the start symbol S must derive to a production that includes NT41, because the first symbol is t13, which comes from NT41.\n\nLooking at the initial productions of S: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Since the first symbol is t13 from NT41, S must expand to the latter production, which is S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo the string starts with t13, which comes from NT41, so the leftmost symbol is NT41. The production for S in this case is NT41 followed by NT58.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second symbol is t59. Let's see what NT58 produces. Looking up the rules: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 and NT58 \u2192 t17. But t59 isn't there. Wait, perhaps I need to check all rules again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the rules for NT58 are:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n\nNT58 \u2192 t17\n\nSo t17 is directly produced by NT58, but the second symbol is t59, which isn't t17. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I've misread the rules.\n\nWait, let me double-check the NT58 rules. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again:\n\nThe user provided:\n\nNT58 -> NT15 NT24\n\nNT58 -> NT58. Hmm, no, wait, perhaps I missed some rules. Wait, the provided rules include:\n\nNT58 -> NT15 NT24\n\nand \n\nNT58 -> t17\n\nSo the two options for NT58 are producing NT15 and NT24, or t17. So, if S \u2192 NT41 NT58, then after NT41 (which gives t13), we have NT58, which can either produce t17 or combine into NT15 and NT24.\n\nBut the string after t13 has t59 as the next symbol. So this suggests that after t13, the NT58 must produce something that starts with t59, which isn't possible because NT58's productions are either t17 or NT15 NT24.\n\nWait, that can't be right because t59 is not in NT58's productions. So perhaps the initial assumption that S expands to NT41 NT58 is incorrect because after t13, we need t59. Therefore, maybe the initial expansion of S is the other one: S \u2192 NT41 NT23, but that doesn't fit because the first symbol after t13 would be t59, which doesn't come from NT23.\n\nWait, let me check what NT23 produces. Looking at the rules, NT23 \u2192 t83. So if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the string would start with t13 t83..., but the given string starts with t13 t59, which doesn't match. Therefore, that production path seems wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I got the initial expansion wrong. Let me see: S has two initial productions: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Since the first symbol is t13, which comes from NT41, the first production of S is the one that includes NT41, so it must be S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nBut then, after t13, the NT58 must generate t59 as the next symbol, which isn't possible because NT58 can't directly produce t59. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper into NT58's derivation. NT58 can produce NT15 and NT24, so maybe after t13, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. Then, we would have symbols from NT15 and NT24. Let's see what those produce.\n\nFirst, NT15: Looking at the rules, NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. So NT15 expands into two non-terminals, NT31 and NT3. Then, NT3 produces 't63'. But the next symbol after t13 is t59, so maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to try to represent the string and see if each step conforms to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can list each production step and see if the string can be matched.\n\nBut given the length of the string, it's a bit tedious, but let's try to break it down.\n\nThe given string is: t13 t59 t19 t26 t24 t26 t57 t8 t11 t33 t7 t84 t33.\n\nLet's denote each symbol as follows for simplicity: s1 to s13.\n\ns1: t13\n\ns2: t59\n\ns3: t19\n\ns4: t26\n\ns5: t24\n\ns6: t24\n\ns7: t57\n\ns8: t8\n\ns9: t11\n\ns10: t33\n\ns11: t7\n\ns12: t84\n\ns13: t33\n\nNow, starting with S, which is the start symbol. Since the first symbol is t13, which comes from NT41 \u2192 t13. So the production must be S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Now, NT41 \u2192 t13, so the first symbol is t13. Then, we have NT58. What does NT58 produce? Option 1 is to produce t17, but that's not the next symbol, which is t59. Option 2 is to produce NT15 NT24.\n\nSo, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. Now, the symbols after t13 are t59, which is s2, and s2 is t59.\n\nSo after NT41 (t13), we have NT15 and NT24, which should produce t59. But let's see what NT15 and NT24 produce.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. So NT15 produces two non-terminals. NT31 \u2192 NT16 NT37, or other options?\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT15. Looking back, the user provided rules include:\n\nNT15 -> NT31 NT3\n\nSo NT15 can only produce NT31 and NT3. So the symbols after t13 would be from NT15 (NT31 and NT3).\n\nBut wait, after S \u2192 NT41 NT58, we have NT41 (t13) and then NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So the next symbols should come from the expansion of NT15 and NT24.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the next symbol is t59, which is produced by NT24? Let's see what NT24 produces.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT24 \u2192 t33, t49, or t28"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's see, the string is \"t26 t57 t71 t19 t24 t54 t33 t7 t74 t7 t33 t7 t66\". Hmm, but in the grammar, I see that each symbol either produces two other symbols or a terminal like 't' followed by a number. Since the string consists of terminals, I'll have to parse it by breaking it down into these productions.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Let's look at the grammar provided. It's a large set of rules, so I'll need to organize the information.\n\nFirst, I notice that some non-terminals expand into terminals:\n- NT5 -> t66\n- NT8 -> t35\n- NT10 -> t28\n- NT12 -> t8\n- NT15 -> t71\n- NT18 -> t38 (Wait, no, NT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37, and then both of those expand into terminals, so NT18 is t38 and t37, which expand further.)\n\nWait, actually, most of these non-terminals eventually expand into a sequence of terminals. So each non-terminal is a node that generates two other symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nTo parse the string, I'll probably use a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the string from left to right.\n\nLet's look at the starting symbol S. The grammar has two options for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n2. S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo S is produced by either NT41 and NT23 or NT41 and NT58. Both of these non-terminals are connected to other parts of the grammar.\n\nLet me see what NT41 and NT23 expand into.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT34 \u2192 NT26 (from NT34 \u2192 t26)\n- NT49 \u2192 t57\n\nSo NT41 expands into t26 t57.\n\nNT23 in the first production of S is NT23, which directly produces t83 (from NT23 \u2192 t83).\n\nSo the first S production, S \u2192 NT41 NT23, produces t26 t57 t83. But the first token in the string is t26, then t57, which matches that first part. But the string continues, so let's check if this is possible.\n\nWait, but the string starts with \"t26 t57 t71 t19...\", so if S produces NT41 NT23, which is t26 t57, and then maybe that's followed by the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but I think I need to build the parse tree or use some parsing method. Maybe I should start by considering all possible parses.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a series of terminals, perhaps each symbol must be matched by some terminal part of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t26 t57 t71 t19 t24 t54 t33 t7 t74 t7 t33 t7 t66\n\nLet me break it down as follows:\n\nEach symbol is a terminal, so each step in the parsing must correspond to a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nStarting from the first symbol, t26. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce terminal t26.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, which later expands into t38 and something else. No, wait, NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, but those produce more NTs. So t28 is in the NT28's expansion only as part of the non-terminals, not directly as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals and their sources.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- t26: present in NT28 \u2192 t26 (from NT28 \u2192 NT28's production includes t26 in one of the steps)\nWait, let's check the productions:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 (no terminal there)\n- NT36 \u2192 t22\n- NT36 \u2192 t26\n- NT24 \u2192 t49 (no, wait, NT24 has another rule: NT24 \u2192 t33, but wait, is there a rule that directly produces t24? No, wait:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t26 (is that right?) Wait, no, let's look again.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT24: the rule is NT24 \u2192 t33. Wait, but that's not right.

But NT38 is NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, and NT32 \u2192 t7, and NT28 is NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to map each non-terminal to its possible terminal sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a table of all non-terminals that can produce a specific terminal sequence.\n\nLet me try to do that.\n\nFirst, list all non-terminals and the terminals they can produce, either directly or through production chains.\n\nStarting with NT26:\n\nLooking at NT26's productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n- NT26 also is produced by others?\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions are listed as S \u2192 NT41 NT23, etc., and then individual rules like NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59.\n\nSo, NT26's productions are:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n- Also, looking at the other rules, are there any others? No, only NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59 is listed.\n\nNow, to find what NT26 produces, we need to look at the productions of NT15 and NT59.\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t71 (directly)\n- NT59 \u2192 NT23 NT59: Hmm, that's a recursive production. Wait, no, let's check:\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe grammar rule is NT59 \u2192 NT23 NT59.\n\nWait, that's a recursive production. So NT59 can generate a string that starts with NT23 followed by any number of NT59.\n\nWait, but NT59 \u2192 NT23 NT59, meaning that to expand, it needs to first expand NT23, which is t8, then another NT59. So it's recursive and would generate an infinite loop. Hmm, but in reality, we can unroll it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Wait, perhaps the rule is NT59 \u2192 NT23 NT59, which would mean that it expands into t8 followed by the expansion of NT59 again, but that would go on and on. That can't be right because the string contains t19 somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in reading the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-248","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t13 t38 t64 t19 t26 t7 t26 t57 t28 t33 t24 t17 t24 t33` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably parse the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminals here are the 't' followed by numbers, like t13, t38, etc. The non-terminals are mostly the NT followed by numbers or single letters like S and T? Wait, actually, the non-terminals in the grammar are all like NT27, NT35, etc. Wait, no, looking at the productions, most of them are longer, like NT33, NT27, etc. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me see the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at a few rules, I see S \u2192 NT41 NT23, S \u2192 NT41 NT58, etc. Then NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32, etc. I also see that some non-terminals have rules ending with terminals, like NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, NT34 \u2192 t26, etc. Wait, but some rules have 't' followed by numbers, like NT34 \u2192 t26, which is a terminal. So, the non-terminals are the NT followed by numbers, except for NT7 and some others.\n\nSo, each non-terminal on the left side of the grammar produces two non-terminals on the right, except for those productions that directly produce terminals. Wait, but actually, no, looking again: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and NT34 \u2192 t26, so that's one terminal and one non-terminal. Wait, but in the given grammar, do any rules produce a single terminal? Or are all terminals in the right-hand side?\n\nWait, maybe I need to correct that. In Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, in the given grammar, any production that ends with 'a' (a terminal) must be a single terminal. So I should look for any production where the right-hand side is a single terminal, but looking through the grammar, it's not obvious. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, which is two non-terminals, so that's okay because they are non-terminals. Wait, but the right-hand side of each production can only have two non-terminals or one terminal? No, wait, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So I need to check if all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the right-hand sides are mostly two non-terminals, but sometimes they have a mix or a single. Wait, for example, looking at NT7 \u2192 't58'... Wait, that's a single terminal, so NT7 must produce 't58'. Then, for NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, but NT34 \u2192 't26' (single terminal), and NT49 \u2192 't57' (another single terminal). Wait, but NT41 is a non-terminal that can produce nt34 and nt49, which themselves can produce terminals. So that's how the string gets built.\n\nWait, the input string is a sequence of terminals: t13 t38 t64 t19 t26 t7 t26 t57 t28 t33 t24 t17 t24 t33. So these are all the terminals that could be in the string. Now, I need to see if this string is even a possible derivation from S.\n\nFirst, let's note that S is the starting symbol, so S must derive the entire string. Let's structure the problem by considering the string in terms of the non-terminals and terminals that would produce it. Since the grammar is a context-free grammar in CNF, each rule is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a non-terminal splitting into a terminal and a non-terminal, or another combination? Wait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form requires that every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So any non-terminal must either produce two non-terminals or one terminal. So the parsing should work by recursively replacing non-terminals with their possible productions.\n\nSo let's start from the string and see if it can be broken down into the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is:\nt13 t38 t64 t19 t26 t7 t26 t57 t28 t33 t24 t17 t24 t33\n\nI need to see if this can be represented as a sequence of non-terminals expanding into terminals.\n\nFirst, the entire string is a sequence of 14 terminals. Since each rule either produces one terminal or two non-terminals, the parse tree should have nodes whose number of children corresponds to the rules.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right or one terminal. So each expansion would take a non-terminal and replace it with two non-terminals (if the production is of the form A \u2192 BC) or a terminal (A \u2192 a).\n\nSince S is the starting symbol, the root of the parse tree is S. Let's see how S can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules, S can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nSo, the first step is that S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nBut our string starts with t13 t38... So perhaps S splits into NT41 and NT23, but let's see what NT41 can produce.\n\nLooking up the NT41 rules:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nThen NT34 \u2192 't26', and NT49 \u2192 't57'.\n\nSo, when NT41 is expanded, it becomes t26 t57. So S \u2192 NT41 NT23 would start with t26 t57. But our string starts with t13, which is a different sequence. So, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT41 NT58, then NT41 would produce t26 t57, and NT58 would produce 't17'.\n\nSo, putting it together, we'd have t26 t57 t17. But our string starts with t13, so that's not matching either. Therefore, perhaps S doesn't split into NT41 on the first step.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing some step where NT41 can produce a longer string. Because in the given grammar, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, and those produce terminals t26 and t57. So perhaps S splits into other non-terminals that lead to t13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to reach t13. Let me look at the rules for NTs that end with t13. Looking through the grammar:\n\nDo any NT rules produce t13? I see NT34 \u2192 t26, NT41 \u2192 t26 t57, etc. Wait, looking again, perhaps I missed some.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for 't13' in the right-hand sides:\n\nHmm, scanning the list, I see:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 t26\n- NT35 \u2192 t62\n- NT36 \u2192 t63\n- NT42 \u2192 t11\n- NT42 \u2192 t27\n- NT24 \u2192 t17\n- NT23 \u2192 t83\n- NT58 \u2192 t17\n- NT37 \u2192 t64\n- NT37 \u2192 t41 t10\n- NT23 \u2192 t83\n- Wait, I don't see any rule that produces 't13'. Hmm, but the input string starts with 't13', so if no grammar rule produces 't13', then the string can't be generated because it has a terminal that's never produced by any rule.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right, because the user is asking if the string is generated by the grammar. So if any terminal in the string doesn't appear as the right-hand side of any rule, then it's impossible for the string to be generated. Because the grammar's terminals are the ones that appear on the right-hand sides of the rules.\n\nLet me check: is there a rule for NT7 \u2192 t58, NT34 \u2192 t26, NT37 \u2192 t64, etc. Let me see if 't13' is ever the result of any production.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 t13:\n\n- NT rules: I don't see any rule that produces t13.\n\nSimilarly, T13 is in the string.

{"custom_id":"request-250","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which has production rules structured as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each production is either two symbols or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: t13 t59 t83 t24 t54 t33 t24 t13 t28 t33 t24 t66 t7 t66. That's a lot of tokens, so each token should correspond to a terminal in the grammar. I need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Let me check what NT41 and NT23 produce. From the rules:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. NT34 \u2192 NT26. So, NT41 becomes NT34 \u2192 NT26, which then eventually must go to a terminal. Wait, let me trace NT41:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT34 \u2192 NT26\nNT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\nNT31 \u2192 NT38\nNT38 \u2192 NT32 NT31\nWait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for the terminals in the string and see if they match the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t13. I'll check which NT production leads to t13. Looking through the rules, NT41 \u2192 't13' is one of the rules (line 14). So, NT41 can go to t13.\n\nNext, the second token is t59. Let's see NT15: NT15 \u2192 't59' (line 17). But from above, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then, NT34 \u2192 't26' (line 29). Wait, but the second token is t59, which would be under NT34, but NT34 \u2192 t26, not t59. So maybe I'm mixing up the NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nThe first production for S is S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT41 NT23, because the first option starts with NT41, which leads to t13.\n\nSo, NT41 becomes t13. Now, the next token should be whatever NT23 produces. Looking at NT23's rules: NT23 \u2192 't83' (line 46). So, NT23 is 't83'.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be t13 t83. But in the string, it's t13 t59, so that doesn't match. Therefore, maybe the first production isn't S \u2192 NT41 NT23, but the other option S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT41 NT58. NT41 \u2192 t13 (line 14), NT58 \u2192 't17' (line 49). So the first two tokens should be t13 t17. But the given string starts with t13 t59. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the NT58 production. Let me check NT58 \u2192 't58' (line 50). Wait, no, the rule is NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24, not 't58'. Wait, no: Looking back at the given grammar, line 50 says NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. Then, each of those can be further expanded.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. The grammar production for NT58 is: NT58 \u2192 't74' (line 55). Wait, no. Let me list the rules for NT58:\n\nLooking at the rules, line 51: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24.\n\nThen, looking up NT15: line 17, NT15 \u2192 't59' or NT31 NT3.\n\nSo, NT15 can be 't59' directly. And NT24: line 36, NT24 \u2192 't33'.\n\nWait, so if NT24 \u2192 't33', then NT15 \u2192 't59' and NT24 \u2192 't33', so NT58 \u2192 't59' 't33'. But in the string, after t13, the second token is t59. So maybe that's a possibility. But earlier, I thought S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which gave NT41 \u2192 t13 and NT23 \u2192 't83'? But in the string, after t13 comes t59.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding S's production. Let me re-examine. The first option for S is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the second is S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So regardless, NT41 is either t13 or something else.\n\nBut in the string, first token t13 suggests NT41 could be that. So let's see: if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then NT41 \u2192 t13, and NT23 \u2192 something else. But in the string, t59 is the second token, so perhaps I'm missing a production.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe it's possible to parse the string top-down using the grammar. Let's try to derive the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t13 t59 t83 t24 t54 t33 t24 t13 t28 t33 t24 t66 t7 t66.\n\nLet's index each token from 0 to 13: [0]t13, [1]t59, [2]t83, [3]t24, [4]t54, [5]t33, [6]t24, [7]t13, [8]t28, [9]t33, [10]t24, [11]t66, [12]t7, [13]t66.\n\nSince S starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nAssuming the first production: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41 can expand to T13, so the first token is t13.\n\nNow, we have to derive 't59 t83 t24 t54 t33 t24 t13 t28 t33 t24 t66 t7 t66' as the expansion for the second NT23.\n\nWait, that can't be, because NT23 is a single NT symbol, which should expand to a single terminal. But the second token is t59. So perhaps the first two symbols would be t13 t59. That would require NT41 \u2192 t13 and NT23 \u2192 t59. But looking at the rules for NT23: line 46, NT23 \u2192 't83'. So that can't be unless my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S uses the other production: S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So NT41 \u2192 t13, and NT58 should expand to the remaining string after t13, which starts with t59.\n\nSo NT58 \u2192 't59 ...'.\n\nBut NT58's rules are: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24.\n\nSo NT58 can be expanded into NT15 NT24. Now, NT15 \u2192 't59' directly. NT24 \u2192 't33' (line 36). So 't59' followed by 't33' would be t59 t33.\n\nBut in the string, after t13 comes t59, then t83. So perhaps this isn't matching. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the second token t59 comes from NT15 and the third token from NT24.\n\nWait, let me think: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So after t13 (from NT41), the next symbols should come from NT58, which is NT15 NT24. So, if NT15 is 't59' directly, and NT24 is 't33', that would give us t59 t33 as the next two tokens. But in the string, it's t59 t83. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT15 is expanded further. NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3 (line 15). Then NT31 \u2192 NT38 (line 17), and NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31 (line 18). So that's getting more complicated, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right. Each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t26, t57, t71, t83, t7, t24, t38, t7, t26, t57, t13, t66, t33, t7, t38. Let me count the tokens: that's 15 tokens. So the string has 15 terminal symbols.\n\nSince each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal, each step in the parse tree reduces the number of symbols by one. So, from the start symbol S, which produces two non-terminals, each step splits into more non-terminals until the leaves are terminals. The total number of symbols should be 2^n, where n is the depth of the parse tree, because each step doubles the number of symbols from two non-terminals to five terminals or some combination.\n\nWait, actually, each application of a production rule increases the count by 1: for example, if you have two non-terminals, each rule production reduces the number of symbols by one (since two non-terminals become one terminal). So the string length should be compatible with the number of productions.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in CNF can generate between 1 and 2 terminals, but actually in this grammar, each non-terminal is either a single terminal or can produce two more non-terminals that themselves can eventually produce terminals. So each production step is either terminal or splits into two more steps.\n\nBut the overall process for a string of terminals can be seen as whether the length is compatible. Let me think: the start symbol is S, which can produce two non-terminals. Each of those can either produce a terminal or two more non-terminals. So the number of terminals in the string must be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which depends on how many splits occur.\n\nLet me count the tokens again: 15. 15 is an odd number. Since each production adds 1 to the count of symbols (non-terminals), starting from S (1 non-terminal):\n\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23 \u2192 2 non-terminals\n2. Each of NT41 and NT23 can split into more non-terminals or a terminal.\nBut the final string has 15 terminals, so the parse tree must have 15 leaves. \n\nWait, in a binary tree, the number of leaves is equal to the number of internal nodes plus one. So if I have 15 leaves, the number of internal nodes would be 14. So the depth would be such that the total number of leaves is 15, but in terms of the number of production steps, it's a bit complicated.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look at the string and see if each terminal can be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: the terminals are t26, t57, t71, t83, t7, t24, t38, t7, t26, t57, t13, t66, t33, t7, t38.\n\nI can list them in order and see which non-terminals they can come from.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that several non-terminals map directly to terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> t63\n- NT5 -> t5 NT43 \u2192 So NT5 produces t5 and then NT43, which maps to t43? Wait no, looking at the rules, NT5 -> NT5 NT43, which is two non-terminals. So NT5 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT58 -> t17\n- NT43 -> t62\n- NT36 -> t9\n- NT28 -> t26\n- NT7 -> t58\n- NT41 -> t13\n- NT30 -> t37\n- NT32 -> t7\n- NT55 -> t65\n- NT24 -> t49\n- NT27 -> t9\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT5 -> NT5 NT43 (no terminal)\n- NT36 -> t22, t54, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make a mapping of non-terminals to terminals:\n\nNT26: Looking for where it appears on the right-hand side of a production.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t26\n- NT36 \u2192 t22\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 t9\n- NT35 \u2192 t62\n- NT58 \u2192 t17\n- NT55 \u2192 t65\n- NT6 \u2192 not present.\nWait, in the rules, NT24 is shown as producing t49, which is a terminal, but also has other options?\n\nWait, let's list all non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t26\n- NT58 \u2192 t17\n- NT35 \u2192 t62\n- NT5 \u2192 no, NT5 produces NT5 and NT43\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 t9\n- NT36 \u2192 t9, t22, t54, t33\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT3 \u2192 t63\n- NT7 \u2192 t58\n- NT41 \u2192 t13\n- NT30 \u2192 t37\n- NT32 \u2192 t7\n- NT6 isn't in the rules, but NT32 is t7.\n\nSo we have these non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT28: t26\nNT58: t17\nNT35: t62\nNT24: t49\nNT27: t9\nNT36: t9, t22, t54, t33\nNT3: t63\nNT7: t58\nNT41: t13\nNT30: t37\nNT32: t7\n\nNow, let's map each token to a non-terminal:\n\nt26 \u2192 NT28\nt57: Looking for any non-terminal that produces t57.

Hmm.\n\nBut in the string, the token is t57, which isn't any of these. So unless I'm missing a rule, t57 is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. That would mean the string contains a terminal that the grammar can't produce, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules to be sure.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see NT57 in the list. So that means that the terminal t57 is not present in any of the non-terminals' productions. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nSo the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a terminal symbol 't57' that is not produced by any non-terminal in the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol. Wait, no, that's not quite right. CNF allows productions to have a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right, or a single terminal. But in this case, looking at the rules, they all have the form like S -> NT41 NT23, which fits CNF since it's A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. So, that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t26 t57 t71 t83 t7 t24 t26 t57 t8 t24 t57 t66 t9 t57 t33`. It's a series of terminal symbols. Each terminal is a token separated by spaces.\n\nNow, the approach is to see if this string can be derived by applying the grammar rules in some way. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can use a parsing method, maybe like recursive descent or a top-down approach with backtracking.\n\nBut to make this manageable, maybe we can build a parse tree step by step, ensuring each step follows the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S can derive NT41 NT23, which translate to specific terminals. Let's look at those:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23: NT41 is 't13' and NT23 is 't83'. So, S directly can generate 't13 t83'. But our string starts with 't26', which doesn't match, so S can't be the top production unless there's a way to derive from it that produces our string.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the start symbol. No, the string doesn't start with 't13 t83', so maybe the string is longer than that, so S must derive into a chain of non-terminals that eventually produce the terminals.\n\nHmm, but the string is 15 tokens long, which suggests the parse tree is quite deep. Let me see the structure of the string:\n\nt26 t57 t71 t83 t7 t24 t26 t57 t8 t24 t57 t66 t9 t57 t33\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in tokenizing.

So perhaps the string can be broken down by looking for possible production paths.\n\nLet's consider that the string starts with 't26'. So, looking for a non-terminal that produces 't26'. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT26: Let me check the grammar rules. Wait, I don't see a rule for NT26, but looking through, some rules have two parts. For example:\n\nLooking for rules where the non-terminal expands to 't26'.

But since CNF requires each rule to have exactly two non-terminals, the terminals must come from other rules.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But given that, each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, looking through the rules to find where a non-terminal directly expands into a terminal:\n\nFrom the given rules, the terminals are when a non-terminal only has one side that is a terminal, but that can't be in CNF. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again.\n\nActually, CNF allows two possibilities: a non-terminal can produce two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC) or a single terminal (A \u2192 a). So perhaps some of the rules in the grammar actually are A \u2192 a, but presented as A \u2192 B where B is a terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-287","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left or a terminal on the left with a single non-terminal on the right. Looking at the rules, most of them are like NT... -> NT.. NT.., etc., except for some that directly map to terminals like 't13', 't38', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t13 t38 t63 t83 t7 t7 t26 t57 t26 t57 t66 t33 t24 t13 t28 t33.\n\nWait, looking at the string, I notice that it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is like 't13', 't7', etc., up to 't66'.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, the NT symbols are things like NT41, NT23, etc., and some of these NTs expand into terminal symbols. For example, NT41 -> t13, NT13 -> t13, etc.\n\nSo, each of these \"t\" tokens in the string must be generated by a production that directly expands to that terminal.\n\nNow, the string has 16 elements, so let's count: 1. t13, 2. t38, 3. t63, 4. t83, 5. t7, 6. t7, 7. t26, 8. t57, 9. t26, 10. t57, 11. t66, 12. t33, 13. t24, 14. t13, 15. t28, 16. t33.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if each of these terminals can appear in the left-hand side of any production. For example, NT41 can become t13, so t13 is valid. Similarly, NT38 can become t38, etc.\n\nSo, each token in the string is a terminal, which is allowed as a result of a production. Now, the next step is to check if there's a production path that can derive the entire string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals. So, when expanding a string, each step adds two tokens, except when a non-terminal expands into a terminal.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So, each expansion step increases the length by one, as each non-terminal becomes two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal expands into a terminal, which would stop the expansion for that part.\n\nSo, let's model the expansion as a parse tree. Each terminal token in the string must correspond to a leaf in the parse tree, and the internal nodes are NT symbols.\n\nGiven that, the string length is 16, so to parse it, we might need a binary tree of height log2(16) = 4, but perhaps more steps depending on the structure.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to find the parse tree for the given string.\n\nBut given that the grammar has a lot of rules, it might be complex. Maybe we can look for patterns or specific paths.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is in CNF, each step adds exactly two symbols to the string (until a symbol is a terminal). Wait no, each production either adds one terminal or not. So, for example, if A \u2192 BC, then A can be one symbol, but when expanding BC, each can be either terminals or more non-terminals. So the string length is variable.\n\nWait, actually, in a parse tree using CNF, each non-terminal expands into two symbols, which could be either terminals or non-terminals. So the number of terminals in the string is equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree.\n\nEach production produces two nodes in the parse tree before reaching terminals. So for a string of n terminals, the height of the tree would be log2(n), but n here is 16, so log2(16) =4, so height 4.\n\nSo that's possible.\n\nBut to determine if the given string is generated, we have to see if there's a way to produce it by expanding according to the grammar. Alternatively, we can try to parse the string by breaking it down into its components according to the grammar.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can look for sequences in the string that match production rules.\n\nLet me try to start from the root symbol S.\n\nS can derive to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t13, t38, etc. So the first two symbols after S must be the results of the two NT's derived from S.\n\nSo, after S, we have NT41 -> t13, as the first part. So t13 is from NT41. Then, after that, the second part is NT23 or NT58.\n\nWait, no. S can produce two non-terminals, so T1: NT41 and T2: NT23, or T1: NT41 and T2: NT58.\n\nSo, the string begins with t13, which is NT41->t13. So T1 is NT41, which is t13.\n\nThen, T2 can be either NT23 or NT58.\n\nLooking at T2: if it's NT23, which expands to 't83' or other options?\n\nWait, the string after T1 is t38. So after NT41 is t13, the next part is t38. So that would be the expansion of NT23 or NT58.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 has a production: NT23 -> 't83'. So NT23 can become t83.\n\nBut in the string, after t13 comes t38, not t83. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, if NT23 expands to more non-terminals, maybe through other rules. Let's see the productions for NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23's productions are:\n\nNT23 -> 't83'\nNT23 -> 't24'\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, looking back:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, so for NT23:\n\nYes, in the grammar list, under NT23:\nNT23 -> 't83'\nand also NT23 -> 't24'\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user listed under NT23:\n\nNT23 -> 't83'\nand also under NT24: NT24 -> 't27', etc. Wait, no, let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT23: \"NT23 -> 't83'\" so NT23 can produce 't83' directly, but the user also said under NT23: \"NT23 -> 't24'\". Wait, looking back:\n\nWait the user wrote for NT23:\n\"NT23 -> 't83'\"\n\nThen under NT28: \"NT28 -> 't26'\", but wait no, NT24 -> 't27' etc. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, the first part lists all the NT productions. Looking at the user's grammar:\n\nYes, under NT23, the rule is: 't83'\n\nUnder NT24, it's: 't26'\n\nUnder NT28: 't26'\n\nAnd for other NTs like NT23, there's a rule: NT23 -> 't24' as well? Wait no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nFrom the user's provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT23: \"NT23 -> 't83'\"\n\nSimilarly, NT24: \"NT24 -> 't26'\"\n\nNT28: \"NT28 -> 't26'\"\n\nBut wait, looking more carefully, under NT23: only 't83'.\n\nUnder NT24: \"NT24 -> 't27'\", \"NT24 -> 't33'\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, under NT23, the rule is 't83'; under NT24, it's 't26', and also 't27' etc. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nSo, going back, NT23 can only produce 't83' directly, or perhaps I misread. Let me check the user's grammar again.\n\nWait, the user wrote under NT23:\n\n\"NT23 -> 't83'\"\n\nSo only that rule. So NT23 can only produce 't83', no other rules for NT23 except that.\n\nWait, then in the string we have after t13 comes t38, not t83, so if NT23 only produces t83, this suggests that our"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-292","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t26 t57 t59 t19 t7 t7 t26 t57 t28 t33 t24 t17 t24 t33 t7 t38`, and the grammar is rather complex with multiple non-terminals and terminals. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The given grammar follows CNF because each rule on the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right sides are either terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals: t26, t57, t59, etc. Each of these must correspond to a production rule in the grammar. The approach I think is to start from the top-level non-terminal (S) and see if we can derive the entire string by expanding S step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo S can produce either of these combinations. I think I should check if either of these leads to the given string.\n\nLet's first consider the first production: S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Each of these non-terminals must then be expanded into the string.\n\nLooking at NT41, the production rules it can take are:\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 (Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I missed some? Let me check the grammar again. Oh, in the rules, NT41 only has one production: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nThen NT23 is also a non-terminal, and from the rules:\n- NT23 \u2192 't83' \n\nSo NT23 is a terminal, which is 't83'.\n\nPutting this together, if S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then NT41 must expand into some non-terminals, but eventually, it has to reach 't26' and other terminals.\n\nWait, expanding NT41, which is NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then NT34 is another non-terminal. Looking at NT34's productions: From the rules, it seems NT34 is only present once in the production of NT41 and another rule? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\n- NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26\n- NT49 is present in several productions, but directly, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49 is one possibility.\n\nWait, no, actually, the rules list for NT34 isn't directly provided, but from the string and the rules, let me scan:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, the productions are listed for various non-terminals, but for NT34, I see: In the grammar, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 is in the list, and perhaps NT34 has its own rules. Wait, maybe I missed NT34's own productions. Let me re-examine the given grammar:\n\nThe productions for NT34 aren't directly listed, but looking through, I see other rules involving NT34. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each line is a production rule for a specific non-terminal on the left. So, NT34 is not a terminal and is on the left side in some rules. Looking through the productions, the only mention of NT34 is in the production of NT41: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nSo that's it. NT34 only appears on the left side of one production: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, meaning NT34 must be expanded further. But that rule requires NT34 to produce two non-terminals, which are NT34 and NT49. Wait, that can't be right because each production's right side should have two symbols, NT34 and NT49, both non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps that's incorrect. That would mean NT34 \u2192 something, but looking at the rules, perhaps NT34 has its own productions. Wait, I think I missed that. Let me go through each production line and note which non-terminals have their own rules.\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n- NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n- NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n- NT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16\n- NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n- NT10 \u2192 NT12 NT42\n- NT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26\n- NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n- NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT36\n- NT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5\n- NT10 \u2192 NT41 NT5\n- NT42 \u2192 NT55 NT49\n- NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2\n- NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n- NT52 \u2192 NT30 NT49\n- NT37 \u2192 NT58 NT32\n- NT37 \u2192 NT41 NT10\n- NT42 \u2192 NT8 NT52\n- NT42 \u2192 NT31 NT55\n- NT16 \u2192 't81'\n- NT37 \u2192 't84'\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT58 \u2192 't17'\n- NT43 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't9'\n- NT28 \u2192 't26'\n- NT36 \u2192 't22'\n- NT24 \u2192 't49'\n- NT58 \u2192 't74'\n- NT3 \u2192 't64'\n- NT30 \u2192 't37'\n- NT32 \u2192 't24'\n- NT55 \u2192 't65'\n- NT24 \u2192 't33'\n- NT2 \u2192 't33'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't63'\n- NT42 \u2192 't11'\n- NT24 \u2192 't27'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT30 \u2192 't24'\n- NT36 \u2192 't54'\n- NT23 \u2192 't19'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't59'\n- NT28 \u2192 't7'\n- NT3 \u2192 't63'\n- NT10 \u2192 't28'\n- NT31 \u2192 't38' (Wait, no, looking back: NT31 is on the left in some productions, but its right side is either 't38' or other non-terminals.

CNF requires that every production rule be either:\n- A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals,\n- A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, looking at the grammar provided, all the rules seem to fit CNF because each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nNext, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by following these rules. The string consists of a series of terminals, and each of these should match the terminals in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. However, since this could get quite complex, maybe I can break it down by looking at each terminal in the string and seeing which non-terminals can produce them, then see if the sequence of non-terminals forms a valid derivation.\n\nThe string is: `t13 t38 t64 t83 t7 t54 t33 t24 t38 t7 t38 t24 t74 t24 t33 t24 t66`.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is a single terminal symbol, so I need to trace how the grammar can generate these in sequence.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which has two productions:\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo, the first thing to generate is either NT41NT23 or NT41NT58. Let's look at the first part of the string: it starts with t13, which is the result of NT41. Looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t13. So S must first produce NT41, which gives t13.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t13. After that, the next part should be NT23 or NT58. Looking at the second symbol, it's t38, which would come from NT23 because NT23 \u2192 t38. So after t13, the next is t38, which comes from NT23.\n\nWait, no. NT23 \u2192 t24. That's in the grammar: NT23 \u2192 't83' actually? Wait, let me check. Looking back, NT23 is defined as 't83'? Or is it NT27 \u2192 't9'... Hmm, wait, in the grammar, some NTs map directly to terminals. Let me list those:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\nNT3 \u2192 't64'\nNT5 \u2192 't66'\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\nNT41 \u2192 't13'\nNT38 \u2192 't7'\nNT24 \u2192 't49'\nNT36 \u2192 't63'\nNT30 \u2192 't37'\nNT32 \u2192 't7'\nNT59 \u2192 't19'\nNT31 \u2192 't38'\nNT58 \u2192 't15'\nWait, no, hold on, I think I messed that up. Let me go through the production rules again.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that for NT23, the rule is: NT23 \u2192 't83'. Similarly, NT38 \u2192 't7', NT24 \u2192 't49', etc. So, in the string, t13 is from NT41, which is produced from S via S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Let's take the first option: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the first two symbols are t13 and ... Then the next symbol is t38, which is from NT23, so NT23 produces t38. So after t13 comes t38.\n\nWait, but the second symbol is t38. Wait, no: the string is t13 t38 t64... So after t13, we have t38, which would require that the next NT23 must produce t7. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT23 \u2192 't83'. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nHold on, I might need to map each terminal to the non-terminals that produce them. Let me create a list:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t13 (from NT41 \u2192 t13)\n- NT38 \u2192 t7 (from NT38 \u2192 t7)\n- NT64 \u2192 t64 (from NT3 \u2192 t64)\n- NT83 \u2192 t83 (from NT27 \u2192 t9, but wait, no, NT27 \u2192 t9? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\nNT35 \u2192 NT62 NT3\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, it might be better to see each NT and its corresponding terminal.\n\nWait, for NTs that directly map to a terminal, here's a list:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t13\n- NT38 \u2192 t7\n- NT24 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 t9? No, looking again: NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15. Hmm, I'm getting lost. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the production steps. Let's start:\n\n1. Start with S. S can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let's first consider S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\n2. NT41 \u2192 t13. So we have t13 so far.\n\n3. Now, the next symbol should match NT23. But looking at the grammar, NT23 \u2192 't83'. However, the second symbol in the string is t38, not t83. That doesn't match. So this production path may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try the other option for S: S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\n2. NT41 \u2192 t13. So first symbol is t13.\n\n3. Now, the next symbol is t38. So the production of NT58 must yield t38.\n\nLooking at NT58's productions:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 or NT15 NT3..., but in the grammar, I don't see NT58 producing t38. Wait, no, NT38 produces t7, so that may not help.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any NT producing t38 except NT23, which is producing t38. Wait, no: looking back:\n\nWait, the production for NT23 is: NT23 \u2192 t83.\n\nWait, no, wait, the user provided a lot of rules, but let me pick out the ones where NTs map to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t38 (I think earlier I might have mixed up.

{"custom_id":"request-310","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left with exactly two non-terminals on the right. The string to check is `t13 t38 t63 t83 t24 t63 t33 t7 t38 t24 t38 t24 t38 t24 t13 t28 t33`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar consists of. The non-terminals are S, NT27, NT38, NT33, NT55, NT12, NT8, NT10, NT18, NT41, NT28, NT43, NT5, NT33, NT15, NT58, NT42, NT24, NT26, NT52, NT37, NT30, etc., and terminals are strings like t81, t38, t63, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal on the left side of an arrow leads to two non-terminals except for some that directly translate to terminals. The string we're checking is a sequence of these terminals. My goal is to parse this string by applying the grammar rules in reverse, starting from the string and trying to reduce it to the start symbol S.\n\nI know that in a CFG in Chomsky normal form, for string parsing, each step in the reduction replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. Each step should reduce the total number of symbols by one. Let's count the tokens: the string has 17 tokens. So the number of steps required would be 16.\n\nStarting with the string:\n\nt13 t38 t63 t83 t24 t63 t33 t7 t38 t24 t38 t24 t38 t24 t13 t28 t33\n\nFirst, let's see which non-terminals correspond to these terminals on the right side of the production rules. For example, looking up the rules, each non-terminal's production is either another pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me list the terminals and try to see which non-terminals can generate them. For instance, t13 is the right side of NT41 -> t13. Similarly, t38 is part of NT38 -> t38 followed by t31. Wait, no, according to the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT38: it's defined as NT28 NT31. Then NT28 is NT38 NT31, which loops. Hmm, maybe that's part of a loop. But perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since each step in the reduction is replacing a non-terminal with two symbols, I can look for the leftmost occurrence of a non-terminal in the current string and replace it accordingly.\n\nBut actually, perhaps it's easier to parse the string using a recursive descent approach, checking each production that can generate the tokens.\n\nWait, another way is to build a parse tree where the root is S and each step adds two symbols from a production. But the string is linear, so it must be leftmost or rightmost derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think in terms of the number of symbols and backtracking, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, use the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure I can apply it manually here without making mistakes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step, considering each token and see if I can find a matching production.\n\nLet's note down all the terminals, as some might be involved in multiple productions for different non-terminals. But looking at the grammar, every terminal is associated with only one non-terminal. For example:\n\nLooking at NT41's production: NT41 -> t13. So whenever we see t13, it must come from NT41.\n\nSimilarly, t38 is derived from NT38, which produces NT28 NT31.\n\nOther terminals:\n\nt63 comes from NT63? Wait, but NT63 isn't a non-terminal in this grammar. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, checking the grammar: all non-terminals are represented as NT followed by a number. Noticing that some non-terminals have specific terminals as their productions, like NT41 -> t13, NT38 -> NT28 NT31, etc.\n\nWait, so for t13, it must come from NT41. Similarly, t38 comes from NT38. t63? Hmm, I don't see a production rule where NT63 is a non-terminal here. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar includes things like NT27 -> NT35 NT15, etc. But I need to see if any non-terminals produce t63.\n\nLooking through the list again, I see NT24 -> t49, but that's about it. Wait, the given string includes t63. Let me check the productions again to see if any non-terminals have t63 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, for example, NT36 -> t9, t22, t26, etc. There's a NT36 -> t62. Wait, no, looking through:\n\nWait, in the list, NT43 -> t62, which is a production rule. Wait, but that's just one non-terminal. So if a non-terminal NT43 produces t16 and t7, and I don't see any production for NT63.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the string includes t63. So if t63 is a terminal, but none of the non-terminals directly produce it, perhaps the grammar doesn't accept that. So the string has t63, but there's no production for any NT that produces t63, so the string shouldn't even be possible.\n\nWait, did I miss any non-terminal that has t63 in its production?

{"custom_id":"request-333","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that might make parsing easier. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires production rules where each rule has either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a single terminal. The start symbol is S, and all production rules are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the grammar here definitely follows CNF since all production rules fit into these categories.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t26 t57 t66 t64 t83 t7 t7 t84 t33 t24 t13 t8 t65 t57 t33 t7 t84 t33`. That's a series of tokens separated by spaces. Each token seems to correspond to a specific production rule, right? For example, from the grammar, each terminal like 't26' has a production rule that directly produces it. So, to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if each token in the string can be derived from the grammar through a series of productions.\n\nLet me list out the production rules again for clarity. Each terminal is directly produced by a non-terminal.\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- But wait, looking closer, NT5 produces 't66' as per the last set of rules: `NT5 -> 't66'`? Wait, no, let me check again. The user listed a bunch of rules where some NTs produce terminals. For example, `NT28 -> 't7'`, `NT7 -> 't58'`, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first map each terminal to its production rule. That might be more efficient.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't66'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT24 \u2192 't49'\n- NT36 \u2192 't63'\n- NT37 \u2192 't64'\n- NT55 \u2192 't65'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT30 \u2192 't37'\n- NT32 \u2192 't7'\n- NT42 \u2192 't11'\n- NT16 \u2192 't33'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26'\n- NT35 \u2192 't62'\n- NT38 \u2192 't28' (Wait, let me check: `NT38 -> NT28 NT31` and in another rule, `NT38 -> NT28 NT31` again. Wait, perhaps some terminals are under multiple rules? No, actually, in the provided rules, some NTs produce multiple things. For example, NT28 is both `NT28 -> NT38 NT31` and `NT28 -> NT18 NT2`.

Wait, the user's grammar shows rules like:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31\nNT52 -> NT12 NT37\nWait, but some of these are two non-terminals, which would mean they are production rules where NT produces two non-terminals. But in the string, we have terminal tokens, so those cases don't apply directly to the string.\n\nSo, each terminal in the string must be produced by a single rule where the NT directly maps to that terminal.\n\nSo, let me map each token in the string to its production rule. If any token doesn't have a production rule that directly maps to it, the string isn't in the language.\n\nThe string is: t26 t57 t66 t64 t83 t7 t7 t84 t33 t24 t13 t8 t65 t57 t33 t7 t84 t33\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. t26\n2. t57\n3. t66\n4. t64\n5. t83\n6. t7\n7. t7\n8. t84\n9. t33\n10. t24\n11. t13\n12. t8\n13. t65\n14. t57\n15. t33\n16. t7\n17. t84\n18. t33\n\nNow, for each token, I need to see if there's a rule where NT -> t, where t is the token.\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules, let's list which NTs produce which terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t66\n- NT7 \u2192 t58\nWait, but in another rule, NT7 \u2192 t58 and another rule where NT30 \u2192 t37, which is different.\nWait, no, each NT can only map to one terminal because it's in CNF.

The string is `t13 t38 t63 t19 t26 t24 t38 t7 t38 t24 t26 t57 t26 t57 t66 t33 t7 t84 t33`. \n\nFirst, let's review the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll have to backtrack.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. In CNF, the left-hand side (LHS) of each production is a single non-terminal. So S can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Each of these has two parts, so each production branches further.\n\nLooking at the first part: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Let's see where these go. NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. Then NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59, and so on. This could get complex quickly. Each non-terminal probably leads to a terminal in the string.\n\nLet me try to map the string to possible non-terminals. The string starts with `t13`, so I need to see if any production directly leads to 't13'. Looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 't13'. So the first part of S is NT41, which produces 't13'.\n\nThen the next symbol is 't38'. Looking at NT23, which is derived from S as NT41 NT23. But NT23 \u2192 't83', which doesn't match 't38'. Hmm, maybe I took the wrong branch. Alternatively, the second part of S is NT41 NT58. NT58 \u2192 't74', which is not 't38'. So perhaps the path is different.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider another approach. Let's parse the string step by step, ensuring that each terminal appears in the correct order according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t13, t38, t63, t19, t26, t24, t38, t7, t38, t24, t26, t57, t26, t57, t66, t33, t7, t84, t33.\n\nLet me see what each symbol could correspond to:\n\nt13 is NT41 \u2192 't13', so starting with NT41.\n\nNext is t38. Hmm, what produces t38? Looking at the grammar, NT28 \u2192 t28 is one production, but nt28 \u2192 NT38, which \u2192 NT28 NT31. So NT28 \u2192 't28'. Similarly, NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31, which would be 't28 t31', but there's t38 in the string. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules. Looking back:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT28.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Looking for 't38' in the grammar:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't26' is one of its productions. NT28 \u2192 't26' is under NT41? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't26', so when NT28 is derived, it can become 't26'.\n\nBut t38 is in the string, so I need to see how 't38' is produced.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's no production directly to 't38', except in NT38 \u2192 't35' perhaps? Wait, let me look:\n\nLooking through, I see NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31. So NT38 can lead to 't38'? Let's see: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. NT28 \u2192 't26' so that would be 't26' at that point. Maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the beginning and try to see how 't13' can be part of a derivation.\n\nS starts with either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So first, S becomes NT41 NT23, which gives t13 followed by NT23's production.\n\nNT23 can be 't83' or maybe it has more non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, does NT23 have any rules with non-terminals?\n\nYes, looking back:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83', but also other options? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, it's listed as NT23 \u2192 't83'. So it's only one production. So if NT23 \u2192 't83', then the second part in S's first branch would be 't83', but the string is 't38' next. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if S is NT41 NT58, then NT58 \u2192 't74' or more non-terminals. But in the string, the next symbol after 't13' is 't38', so that approach doesn't fit either if NT58 doesn't produce 't38'.\n\nSo maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think differently. Since the string has 't13', which is only produced by NT41, that part is fixed as NT41. Then the next part is 't38', which must be from the other NT in S's production, either NT23 or NT58.\n\nBut NT23 only leads to 't83', so that can't be. NT58 leads to 't74' or more non-terminals. Hmm, maybe NT58 can go to more non-terminals?\n\nWait, looking again, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. So NT58 can branch into NT15 and NT24. Then, if NT15 and NT24 can produce 't38' somehow.\n\nBut looking further, what's NT15? NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, right? So NT15 branches into NT31 and NT3. NT3 is just 't64', but NT31 branches into NT38 and NT3. So NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT3.\n\nThen NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32. So NT38 branches into NT28 and NT32.\n\nNT28 can produce 't26' directly, as per NT28 \u2192 't26'. Or it can branch into NT38 and NT31, which again, seems like a loop unless we resolve it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can map this out step by step.\n\nLet's try building the string:\n\n1. t13 \u2192 comes from NT41.\n\n2. Next, t38. Since NT41 is S's first option, the second non-terminal in S is either NT23 or NT58. If it's NT23, it produces 't83', which doesn't match 't38'. If it's NT58, NT58 \u2192 't74' or NT15 NT24.\n\nLooking at NT24, the production goes to 't27' or more non-terminals. So NT24 can be 't27' or NT34 NT28. NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49, which then leads to 't26' and 't49'? Wait, NT26 is 't15' according to the grammar? Wait, looking:\n\nLooking through, NT26 \u2192 't26' is a production (NT26 \u2192 't26'). Similarly, NT15 \u2192 't71'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the nt24's production. NT24 \u2192 't49' or NT34 NT28.\n\nSo, if we take NT24 \u2192 't49' (as per one of its productions), then t49. But in the string, after t38, the next is t63.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem is in the parsing approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a better way, like using memoization or memoized recursive descent parsing, but since I can't code, I'll have to do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if each terminal in the string appears in the correct order in the grammar's production rules.\n\nLet me list out the string in order:\n\nt13, t38, t63, t19, t26, t24, t38, t7, t38, t24, t26, t57, t26, t57, t66, t33, t7,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-344","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing, but since I'm not doing parsing, maybe I can use another approach.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has both non-terminals and terminals as results of the productions. The string I'm given consists of a series of terminals: `t26, t57, t38, t63, t19, t7, t9, t33, t24, t84, t33, t24, t66, t24, t84, t33, t7, t84, t33`.\n\nSo, the idea is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S can be broken down into two parts: S -> NT41 NT23. So, the entire string should be a combination of what NT41 and NT23 generate. Let me check what NT41 and NT23 produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT34 -> t26 (terminal)\nNT49 -> t57 (terminal)\nSo, NT41 produces 't26 t57'.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 -> t83 (terminal). So, NT23 directly produces 't83'.\n\nTherefore, S should produce 't26 t57 t83'.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with t26, t57, then t38, which is after t26 t57. That doesn't match because the first production of S is 't26 t57 t83'. But the given string has more elements after t26 t57.\n\nHmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, S -> NT41 NT23. So, the derivation is S \u2192 (NT41)(NT23). Each NT41 and NT23 produce sequences of terminals. So, NT41 produces 't26 t57' and NT23 produces 't83'. So, S should produce 't26 t57 t83'. But the given string is much longer, starting as 't26 t57 t38 ...' which is longer than that. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. NT23: the rule is NT23 -> t83, right? So, the initial rule S produces NT41 followed by NT23, each of which is a string. So, S's expansion is the concatenation of what NT41 generates and then NT23 generates.\n\nWait, but the grammar might have other derivations. For example, NT41 might have a different way of expanding if possible. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT41:\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nThen, NT34 -> t26\nNT49 -> t57\nSo, NT41 \u2192 t26 t57. No other options for NT41 because it's a chain rule leading directly to terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 is a terminal: t83. So, the only way S can expand is to produce 't26 t57 t83'.\n\nBut the given string is much longer and doesn't match this. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar because the length and the content don't align with the production rules of S.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to parse it. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe the grammar allows for multiple steps, but I think in this case, NT41 and NT23 have fixed expansions. So, S can only produce that specific sequence. Any deviation would mean the string isn't generated.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the string can be broken down in a way that matches the grammar. For example, maybe the string starts with t26, but that's part of NT41, and then something else comes from NT23.\n\nWait, let's see. The string is: t26 t57 t38 t63 t19 t7 t9 t33 t24 t84 t33 t24 t66 t24 t84 t33 t7 t84 t33.\n\nSo, the first part is t26 t57, which matches NT41. Then comes t38 t63 t19 t7 t9 t33 t24 t84 t33 t24 t66 t24 t84 t33 t7 t84 t33. Wait, but S only produces NT41 followed by NT23. NT23 is just t83. So, the entire string after t26 t57 must be t83, but it's much longer and different.\n\nSo, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the only expansion for S is t26 t57 t83, but the given string is longer and starts differently after the initial t26 t57.\n\nWait, another thing: perhaps the NT23 can produce something else, but looking back, NT23's rule is actually NT23 -> 't83'. So, it's a single terminal. So, no, NT23 is fixed. So, the only way S can expand is into t26 t57 t83. Therefore, any string longer than that isn't possible, like the given string.\n\nSo, the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That's quite a bit, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form is. A grammar is in CNF if each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit that because each non-terminal on the left side of the arrow produces two non-terminals on the right, except for those that directly translate to terminals. So that's a good start.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how the string is structured. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces.

NT23 in the grammar has a production of 't83', so in the string, the first token should be 't83' if NT23 is the start of one of the productions. But in the given string, it starts with t26. That's odd because S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which would generate two terminals, so the string should start with what NT41 produces and then NT23.\n\nWait, let me check NT41's production. Looking at the grammar, NT41 has a rule: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. Then, looking at NT34, it produces 't26' (NT34 \u2192 't26'). And NT49 \u2192 't57'. So NT41 \u2192 't26' 't57'.\n\nSo the first part of the string should be t26 followed by t57. But looking at the provided string, it starts with t26, then t57, so that's good for the first part (NT41). The second part should be NT23, which is 't83'. But the string's second token after t26 is t57, and then t59, t83, etc. That suggests that perhaps NT41 is producing t26 t57, and then NT23 produces t83, but the string continues beyond that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire string is a sequence of terminals derived from S. So starting from S, which produces NT41 and NT23. S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So the expansion starts with NT41's derivation and then NT23's.\n\nFrom NT41:\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\nNT49 \u2192 't57'\nSo NT41 \u2192 't26' 't57'\n\nFrom NT23:\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nSo the entire derivation from S would be S \u2192 't26' 't57' 't83'.\n\nBut the string given is longer than that. It starts with t26 t57 t59 ... So that suggests that maybe I'm missing something in the parsing. Alternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of more than just two terminals. Maybe the NT23 production leads to more than one terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT23 only has the rule \u2192 't83', so it's a single terminal. So after S, we have t26, t57, t83, but the given string continues, which doesn't match. So that would mean the string can't be generated by this grammar. But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure of the grammar. Maybe the string continues further, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the entire string as a sequence of terminal symbols, and try to see if it can be split into a series of productions that each split into two terminals at a time.\n\nSo the string is: t26 t57 t59 t83 t7 t9 t33 t7 t13 t28 t33 t24 t71 t49 t7 t33 t24 t17 t24 t33.\n\nSo maybe the string is a derivation starting from S. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nNT41 \u2192 't26' 't57' (as derived earlier)\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nSo the first three symbols should be t26 t57 t83, but in the given string, they are t26 t57, but then t59, which doesn't fit. So perhaps the derivation is longer. Maybe I need to look deeper into the grammar to see how the non-terminals can derive more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that NT23 might be part of a larger derivation. Looking back at the grammar, NT23 only has one production: NT23 \u2192 't83', so it doesn't split into anything else. So in the string, after t83, perhaps NT23 is done, and the next part should come from another split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption is incorrect, and the string starts with NT41 and then another non-terminal that's not NT23, but perhaps I'm missing that.\n\nWait, another approach: let's list all the productions that end with terminals:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't26' 't57'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't17' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, let me check.)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT34's production is NT34 \u2192 't26'\u2014so wait, NT34 is a non-terminal that can produce 't26'. Similarly, NT58 \u2192 't17' is incorrect; looking at the grammar, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar rules are:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't57'\n\nSo that makes S produce 't26' 't57' and 't83'. But the string is longer than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look further into other productions. Let me check the grammar more thoroughly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT37 has several productions, one of which is \u2192 't84', another \u2192 't64', etc. Similarly, other NTs may produce different terminals.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to see how the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the productions, considering that each step of the grammar produces two terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string needs to be parsed as a sequence of symbols, each corresponding to an expansion. Let's try to model this.\n\nThe string is: t26, t57, t59, t83, t7, t9, t33, t7, t13, t28, t33, t24, t71, t49, t7, t33, t24, t17, t24, t33.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that the first two symbols (t26, t57) come from NT41, and the next symbol t83 comes from NT23, but that can't be because NT23 only produces t83 and would stop there. But the string continues, which would suggest that perhaps the next symbol should be derived from another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Maybe I should consider that the string continues beyond the first split, meaning that S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and then each of those non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-371","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is a specific form where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So that helps because it limits the structure of the grammar, which might make parsing easier, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nThe grammar provided has rules like S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and several other similar rules for S. Each rule seems to split the left-hand side into two non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals (like NT27, NT38, etc.) eventually derive into terminal symbols like 't81', 't26', 't33', 't13', etc. My string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals, and I need to check if it can be produced by any combination of the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is: t26 t57 t71 t83 t7 t7 t59 t63 t7 t33 t24 t66 t7 t13 t28 t33 t24 t66 t24 t38.\n\nFirst, I think I should try to break down the string into parts that correspond to the possible rule applications. Since CNF has productions that generate two symbols at a time, the entire string's length should be a power of two times some initial split. But wait, the string has 21 symbols, which is an odd number. That's a problem because each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the number of symbols should be 2^k for some k, right? But 21 isn't a power of two (2^4=16, 2^5=32), so that suggests it's impossible because starting from S, the number of symbols should always be a power of two. Wait, but maybe my reasoning is flawed because sometimes non-terminals can lead to terminal symbols, but each application doubles the number or keeps it if it's a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in a standard CFG, the number of symbols generated after each step increases by the number of new terminals produced. But in CNF, each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the total number of terminals in a derived string must be at least 1 for each non-terminal production step. However, the length of the string should be 2^n because each production step doubles the length, starting from 1 (the initial symbol S). Wait, but S can be split into two non-terminals, so the next step has two, which can be two more, so four, etc. So the string length should be 2^k, but here we have 21 symbols, which is not a power of two. So that's a deal-breaker.\n\nWait, but the initial string S in the grammar is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so that gives two symbols. Each of those can be non-terminals or terminals. If they derive into terminals, then each production could add more symbols. Wait, but the actual number of symbols in the string should correspond to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which for CNF is 2^n, where n is the number of productions. So a string of length 21 isn't a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for this string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S splits into two non-terminals, each of which can be either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the total number can vary, but the way it grows is that each split can either add a terminal (if a non-terminal produces a terminal) or two non-terminals (if a non-terminal produces another non-terminal). So the length could be 2, 3, 4, etc., depending on how the productions are applied.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because each time you expand a non-terminal into two, the total count increases by one for each such expansion. For example, starting with S, which is count 1. S \u2192 NT41 NT23, count 2. Then each of those can be non-terminals or terminals. If NT41 is a terminal, and NT23 is a terminal, then the string would have length 2. But if NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, then when that's expanded, each step adds another symbol for each expansion.\n\nBut in any case, the total length of the string should always be of the form 2^k or maybe even numbers depending on how the non-terminals are split. Hmm, but wait, no. Each non-terminal production increases the count by +1 in terms of symbols because two are added where one was before. So if you have a string that's length L, the parse tree would have a height such that L = 2^n if all expansions are non-terminals. But in this case, the string length is 21, which isn't a power of two, so it's impossible. Because, for example, with n=4, 2^4=16; n=5=32. So 21 isn't a power of two, so it's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe the string's length can be variable? Or am I confusing something here. No, in a context-free grammar derived from CNF, each expansion step replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols. So starting from 1 symbol, after one expansion, you have 2 symbols, then after two expansions, you could have 4 if all were replaced, or 3 if one was replaced and the others are terminals. So actually, the number of symbols can be either even or odd, depending on how many non-terminals are in the string.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let's think again. Each time you expand a non-terminal, the count increases by +1 (since one symbol becomes two). So starting from 1, you can have 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So any length is possible, as long as it's \u22651. But in this case, the string has length 21, which is possible if the grammar allows such a structure.\n\nWait, but the confusion is between the number of production steps and the length of the string. Each time you apply a production, you can choose whether to replace a non-terminal with two symbols or keep it as a terminal. So the length doesn't have to be a power of two. For example, in the sample string, it's 21 symbols, which is possible because each production could contribute +1 to the length as needed.\n\nBut then, how does this affect whether it can be generated? Wait, perhaps I need to look at the structure.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string backwards or try to match it step by step through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t26 t57 t71 t83 t7 t7 t59 t63 t7 t33 t24 t66 t7 t13 t28 t33 t24 t66 v24 t38.\n\nWait, the string is 21 symbols. Let's look at the end. The last symbol is 't38'. Looking at the productions, which terminals are possible? Let's list the terminals from the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, terminals are:\n\nt26, t57, t71, t83, t7, t7, t59, t63, t7, t33, t24, t66, t38, t28, t16, t8, t12, t5, t43, t36, t30, t24, t8, t5, t37, t23, t19, t8, t14, t26, t63, t27, t9, t49, t57, t28, t7, etc.\n\nWait, but the string has 't38' as the last symbol. Looking back at the grammar, where is 't38' produced? Let me scan the rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't33' 't3'\n- NT18 \u2192 't32' 't36'\n- NT28 \u2192 't38' 't31'\n- NT42 \u2192 't8' 't52'?\nWait, let me check. Looking at NT18's production: NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT36. Then NT32 is a non-terminal, but looking at NT32 \u2192 't24'. So NT18 \u2192 't24' 't36'. So 't24' and 't36'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the production rules where a non-terminal results in 't38'. Looking through the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 't33' 't3', and NT28 \u2192 't38' 't31'. So 't38' only appears as the first part of NT28's expansion. So any occurrence of 't38' must come from NT28.\n\nLooking at the string's last few symbols:\n\n... t38\n\nBefore that, the string ends with t13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-386","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to evaluate whether it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the problem is. The grammar is provided with productions, and each non-terminal and terminal on the right side can either be another production or a terminal symbol. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t26 t57 t38 t63 t83 t7 t22 t33 t7 t38 t24 t17 t7 t33 t7 t26 t57 t26 t57 t66 t33`.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each left-hand side (LHS) has exactly one non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) can have either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nMy task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step until only terminals remain. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation will consist of a number of steps equal to the height of the parse tree. Each production will split the derivation into smaller parts until all nodes are leaves.\n\nLet me think about the string. It's a sequence of terminals, and each of these must correspond to the strings derived from the productions. So, first, I should parse the string into tokens and see if I can match them through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some rules have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So S starts by expanding into two non-terminals. Then those can expand further until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string should be built by leftmost derivation, and each step would involve replacing the leftmost non-terminal with a sequence of productions.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into parts that might correspond to the productions.\n\nFirst, let's list the symbols in order:\nt26, t57, t38, t63, t83, t7, t22, t33, t7, t38, t24, t17, t7, t33, t7, t26, t57, t26, t57, t66, t33.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be matched by the grammar. Since S \u2192 NT41 NT23, perhaps the string can be divided into two major parts starting with NT41 and NT23.\n\nWait, but first, the very first symbol is t26. Looking at the grammar, are there any productions that directly start with t26? Scan the production rules.\n\nLooking through the productions: I see NT28 \u2192 t26, and NT26 \u2192 t59, but that's not a terminal. Wait, in the list provided earlier, is there a production for NT26?\n\nYes, for example, NT24 \u2192 t26. Hmm, but t26 is a terminal derived from NT24. So, if the first symbol is t26, perhaps it comes from NT24 \u2192 t26. So, S starts with NT41 and NT23.\n\nWait, but S splits into two. So, the first symbol t26 would come from either NT41 or NT23. Let's look: S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so the first symbol must come from NT41 or NT23.\n\nLooking at NT41's productions: NT41 \u2192 t13 and NT41 \u2192 t18 or t26? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the productions: NT41 has two rules: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 and NT41 \u2192 t13. So, perhaps the first t26 is from NT41 \u2192 t26? No, wait NT41's production for t26 comes from another production?\n\nWait, no, looking at the list of productions:\n\nLooking for NT41\u2019s rules:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nNT41 \u2192 t13\n\nSo, NT41 can produce either two non-terminals or 't13'. So, if the first symbol is t26, does 't13' match? No, because t13 is not present. So, perhaps the first t26 comes from another NT production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the entire string as a sequence, can I find a way to split it into leftmost derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can construct a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if all the terminal symbols in the string are reachable from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from S, S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So, let's consider NT41 and NT23.\n\nFirst, derive NT41. What can NT41 produce? The productions are:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nNT41 \u2192 t13\n\nSo, the first option is two non-terminals. Then, those can be expanded as well.\n\nBut our string starts with t26, so if NT41 is expanding to 't13', that would give t13, which is not in the string. So, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe NT41 is expanding to two non-terminals, which in turn produce t26?\n\nWait, perhaps I should see which non-terminals can produce t26.\n\nLooking for terminals in the grammar:\n\nt26 is a terminal and comes from NT24 \u2192 t26. So, t26 is generated by NT24.\n\nSimilarly, t63 is generated by NT36 \u2192 t63, but wait, NT36 can have several productions.\n\nWait, let's check the production rules for each non-terminal to see if t26 is a production.\n\nYes, NT24 \u2192 t26.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 t59.\n\nBut t59 isn't in the string, so unless t59 somehow is part of the string, but the given string doesn't include t59. So, unless I can find a way where a derivation leads to NT24 producing t26.\n\nBut coming back to the string: the first symbol is t26. So, possibly, the first non-terminal in the derivation is NT41 or NT23.\n\nWait, let's consider NT23. NT23 is a non-terminal whose production is: in the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 t83. So, NT23 can directly produce t83. The string starts with t26, so that can't be NT23 because t83 is not the first symbol.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t26, which comes from NT24 \u2192 t26. But how does NT41 (the first part of S) get to NT24.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Then, the NT41 might expand into something that could produce t26, and NT23 into something else, but the first symbol in the string is t26.\n\nSo, maybe the initial NT41 must expand into two non-terminals, and perhaps the first of those is NT24, which then can produce t26.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me write the string: t26 t57 t38 t63 t83 t7 t22 t33 t7 t38 t24 t17 t7 t33 t7 t26 t57 t26 t57 t66 t33.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see which symbols can be terminals and where their productions appear in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, I need to list all the terminals and their sources.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n- NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n- NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n- NT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16\n- NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n- NT10 \u2192 NT12 NT42\n- NT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT43 \u2192 NT16 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26\n- NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n- NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24\n- NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT36\n- NT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5\n- NT10 \u2192 NT41 NT5\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S, and each production has exactly two elements on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce two types of sequences: either NT41 followed by NT23 or NT41 followed by NT58. So, the string must originate from one of these two initial branches.\n\nLet me write down the string step by step and try to parse it. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I'll need to see if it's possible to derive this sequence by expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t26, t57, t66, t64, t19, t7, t24, t66, t24, t38, t7, t17, t24, t33, t24, t84, t33, t24, t66, t7, t38.\n\nI think it's easier to approach this by working from the start symbol S and expanding it step by step, checking if each part of the string can be matched.\n\nStarting with S -> NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let me take the two possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's try S -> NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41's production from the grammar: NT41 -> NT34 NT49. Let's see what NT34 and NT49 produce.\n\nNT34 -> NT26 NT49. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, looking back, the grammar has NT34 -> NT26 NT49? Or is it another production? Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, yes, under NT34: NT34 -> NT26 NT49.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided:\n\nUnder NT34: I don't see it in the initial list. Wait, actually, looking again, the grammar provided includes lines like NT34 -> t26, but looking through the productions, I see lines such as NT34 -> NT26 NT49? Wait, no, let me scan the productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, at the end, it's broken up:\n\nNT34 -> t26\nothers like NT41 -> t13\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each possible production for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each non-terminal's possible expansions.\n\nStarting with S -> NT41 NT23 and S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me first try S -> NT41 NT23.\n\nSo, NT41 -> NT34 NT49, and NT23 -> t83.\n\nWait, when I look at the grammar, NT23 -> t83, which is a terminal. So, NT41's expansion would be NT34 and NT49. Let me check what NT34 and NT49 produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT34 -> NT26 NT49. So, NT34 is replaced by NT26 and NT49.\n\nNow, NT26 can produce t54 (maybe?), or perhaps another production. Hmm, looking back: NT26 has a production NT26 -> NT15 NT59. Wait, not seeing NT26 terminal, but looking through the productions:\n\nWait, NT26 is present here: NT26 -> NT15 NT59. So, maybe I can expand further.\n\nWait, but looking back, the grammar has lines like NT26 -> NT15 NT59. So, let's see where NT15 and NT59 go.\n\nNT15 -> NT31 NT3 (I think, looking through the grammar. Yes, under NT15: NT15 -> NT31 NT3.\n\nAnd NT3 -> t63 but also NT3 is part of NT35: NT35 -> NT62 NT32? No, looking at grammar, I might have misread. Wait, I think NT15's expansion is NT31 and NT3.\n\nSo NT15 -> NT31 NT3 and NT3, for example, is a terminal? Looking at the grammar: yes, one of the productions is NT3 -> t63. So NT3 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting confused because this could take a long time without a better approach. Maybe a better strategy is to parse the string step by step and see if I can break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nEach terminal in the string can be matched against the grammar's terminal productions. For each non-terminal, when expanding, the two symbols it produces should correspond to consecutive terminals or further expansions.\n\nLet me try to split the string into parts based on possible NT productions.\n\nThe string is: t26 t57 t66 t64 t19 t7 t24 t66 t24 t38 t7 t17 t24 t33 t24 t84 t33 t24 t66 t7 t38\n\nI think the first part is t26, which I think corresponds to NT34 NT49, but that might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, looking for the beginnings.\n\nWait, S can expand to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let me check how each part goes.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT41 NT23.\n\nNT41's first production is NT34 NT49.\n\nThen, NT23 is t83.\n\nSo, the initial part would be NT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT34 NT49. Let's see if the first part of the string corresponds to that.\n\nThe string starts with t26, which may be from NT34 producing NT26 something. Let's check NT34's production: NT34 -> NT26 NT49.\n\nSo, NT34's expansion is NT26 and NT49.\n\nNow, the first terminal in the string is t26, which would come from NT26 being a terminal. Looking back: Does NT26 have a production that results in t26?\n\nYes, looking through the grammar, I see NT26 -> t54. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, in the grammar, no, looking more carefully. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me scan each line:\n\nLooking at NT26: Do I see NT26 as a production? I see:\n\n- NT26 -> NT15 NT59\n- Also, in the list, there's a line: NT26 -> t54? Or is that elsewhere?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT42 -> t11\n\nNT30 -> t37\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me recount:\n\nThe grammar list:\n\nLooking for NT26:\n\nNT26: no, the grammar includes:\n\nNT36 -> t22\nNT37 -> t58\n...\nWait, perhaps in the early part of the grammar, there's a NT26 -> t54? Or perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, no, I think I might have made an error. Let me list all the lines again, focusing on NT26:\n\nThe grammar lines are:\n\nNT26: Wait, I don't see \"NT26 -> ...\" except for NT58 -> t15 NT24, etc.\n\nWait, no, on second thought, perhaps I didn't list all correctly. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, the relevant part is:\n\nNT28: NT28 -> NA... etc.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check more thoroughly. I might have missed NT26 in the initial listing.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nLet me look for non-terminals with '26' in their ID.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT58 -> t74\n- NT30 -> t37\n- NT24-> t49\n- NT28 -> t26\n\nWait, I see NT28 in the grammar: NT28 -> t26, but that's from NT28, not NT26.\n\nSo perhaps NT26 produces a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-407","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is produced by the provided CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by recalling the basics. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals (except for 'a', which is a terminal).\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to have a mix of production rules. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and other similar rules. But I also notice that many non-terminals seem to directly produce terminals. For instance, NT41 \u2192 't13', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t13 t38 t64 t83 t26 t24 t38 t7 t17 t7 t33 t7 t13 t7 t81 t65 t57 t33 t24 t66 t7 t38`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse this string and see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't13'. Looking at the grammar rules, NT41 \u2192 't13'. So that must be produced by NT41. Now, looking back, S has production rules that produce NT41 something. For example, S can be NT41 NT23, so probably the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nLet me step through the string. The first symbol is 't13', which comes from NT41. So after NT41, the next part should come from NT23.\n\nLooking at the string: The first symbol is 't13', then 't38'. So after NT41 produces 't13', the next should be NT23. NT23 \u2192 't83', which is the next symbol in the string. So that works.\n\nNow, the string continues after 't83' with 't64'. So now, I'm at NT8, which would have production rules. Looking at the grammar: NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3. NT3 is 't64', so that fits. So the next production is NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3, which uses NT3 as 't64'.\n\nSo after 't64', what comes next? The next token is 't26'. Let me see if that's from any production. Looking at the grammar: NT28 \u2192 't26' is one production. So how do we get to NT28?\n\nWait, after NT8 (from NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3), the next is NT26. Hmm, perhaps NT33 \u2192 something. Let me check NT33. NT33 has multiple productions: NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26, NT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26 again, and others including a terminal 't33'.\n\nWait, perhaps the next step after NT8's 't64' is NT26, so the next token in the string is 't38'. But 't38' is a terminal, so let's see where that comes from.\n\nLooking for 't38' in the terminals: NT38 \u2192 't38'. So after NT28, which goes to 't26' or 't38', we have 't38'.\n\nSo probably, after NT8 \u2192 NT28 NT3, and NT28 \u2192 't38', that gives us the next symbol. So after 't64', the 't26' is from NT28, or maybe it's another step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try:\n\nThe entire string is:\nt13 t38 t64 t83 t26 t24 t38 t7 t17 t7 t33 t7 t13 t7 t81 t65 t57 t33 t24 t66 t7 t38\n\nBreaking it down incrementally:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT41 NT23. So first, NT41 \u2192 t13, and then NT23.\n\n2. NT23 \u2192 't83' as per the grammar.\n\nSo first two symbols: t13 t83.\n\nWait, but the second symbol in the string is t38, not t83. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the string is: t13 t38 t64 t83 ... So after t13, it's t38, not t83. So perhaps my initial assumption about the production is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the initial production is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which needs to generate the entire string. So each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal in some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production is split into multiple steps. So let's think again.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT41 NT23, we have NT41 and NT23. NT41 is 't13', so that gives us t13. Then NT23, which needs to generate the rest of the string starting with t38.\n\nSo, NT23 \u2192 what? Looking at the grammar: NT23 is not a terminal; it must produce something. From grammar, NT23 \u2192 't83'. Oh, that's the key! So NT23 is 't83'. But the second symbol in the string is t38, not t83. So that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe S is producing NT41 and another NT. Perhaps S \u2192 NT41 NT58 or another production. Let me check all S productions: the first two are S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo S has two options: S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSince the string starts with t13, which is NT41, we need to take the S \u2192 NT41 NT23 production because NT41 is 't13' in NT41 \u2192 't13', and NT41 can only produce that.\n\nWait, but wait, no, actually, NT23 \u2192 't83' is a production, so NT23 is 't83', which would mean that the string after t13 would be t83. But the string starts with t13 t38, so that suggests that S must have another production, perhaps S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t13, which is from NT41. So if we choose S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the second symbol should be t83, but it's t38. Therefore, perhaps S \u2192 NT41 NT58 is being used instead.\n\nLet me check NT58's production. NT58 can produce 't17', 't58', 't74', etc. So for example, NT58 \u2192 't74' or NT58 \u2192 't17', but the second symbol is t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing S's productions.\n\nWait, the original S productions are:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\n\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo S can split into two different non-terminals: NT41 and either NT23 or NT58.\n\nNow, the string starts with NT41 \u2192 t13, so then, from S, the next non-terminal must produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut the second token is t38, which must come from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there a non-terminal that can produce t38?\n\nYes, NT38 \u2192 't38'.\n\nSo, perhaps after NT41, we have another non-terminal that can produce t38, but how?\n\nLooking at NT38's productions: NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32 or other NT terms, but also, are there any direct t38?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, in the rules, I see NT38's productions: some are to non-terminals, but I see one production: NT38 \u2192 something, but wait, wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, there's a line: NT38 -> NT28 NT32. But no, there isn't a production that directly produces t38 as the only terminal. Hmm, wait, no, I just saw a line that says NT38 \u2192 ... but in the provided rules, NT38 only goes to NT28 NT32. So that would not directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-409","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t13 t71 t19 t7 t54 t33 t24 t38 t64 t19 t24 t22 t33 t24 t84 t33 t24 t38 t7 t33 t7 t66`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is binary, except for the terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar consists of a start symbol S and several non-terminals and terminals (with numbers). Each non-terminal on the left of a production expands into two parts, each can be another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with `t13`, which I need to trace back. Looking at the productions, `t13` appears on the right-hand side of one of the productions. Let me check where `t13` comes from. Scanning through the rules, I see `NT41 -> 't13'`. So, `t13` must be derived from NT41.\n\nSo, NT41 must be part of the derivation starting from S. The production for NT41 is `NT41 -> NT34 NT49`. So, I need to derive NT34 and NT49, and then combine them.\n\nLet's look at NT34: `NT34 -> t26`. So, NT34 is a terminal, as per the rule. So, that's straightforward.\n\nNext, NT49: `NT49 -> t57` and `NT49 -> t57`. Wait, actually, looking again, I see `NT49 -> t57` and also `NT49 -> NT23`. Hmm, I need to check if NT49 is a non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, NT49 is a non-terminal because it has two productions, one of which is a terminal and the other a non-terminal. So, to get t57, NT49 must go directly to 't57', right? Wait, looking at the given grammar, actually, under NT49, the rule is `NT49 -> t57`. So, wait, no, the last line shows `NT49 -> t57`, right? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the list: yes, under NT49, the rule is `NT49 -> t57`. So, that's a terminal. So, NT49 yields 't57', hence the chain for NT49 is just 't57'.\n\nPutting it together: NT41 produces 't26' and 't57', so the combined string for NT41 is 't26 t57'.\n\nWait, no, the production for NT41 is `NT41 -> NT34 NT49`, so the two derived strings are 't26' and 't57', so the combined string is 't26 t57'.\n\nSo, the first part of the given string is `t13 t71 t19 t7 t54 t33 t24 t38 t64 t19 t24 t22 t33 t24 t84 t33 t24 t38 t7 t33 t7 t66`.\n\nWait, but S is S -> NT41 NT23, so the overall string would be the concatenation of the expansions of NT41 and NT23.\n\nLet me see. So, the given string's first element is `t13`, which is part of NT41, as I derived. So, I've got 't26 t57' from NT41, but the string starts with `t13 t71 t19...`, which is more elements than 't26 t57' would produce. That doesn't seem to match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, the initial expansion of S is into NT41 and NT23, each of which will produce a sequence of terminals. So, the entire string is the concatenation of NT41's expansion and NT23's expansion. But the string starts with `t13`, which is part of NT41's expansion. So, we need to see how the rest of the string fits.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t13 t71 t19 t7 t54 t33 t24 t38 t64 t19 t24 t22 t33 t24 t84 t33 t24 t38 t7 t33 t7 t66.\n\nWait, that's 21 tokens. Let me count: 1. t13, 2. t71, 3. t19, 4. t7, 5. t54, 6. t33, 7. t24, 8. t38, 9. t64, 10. t19, 11. t24, 12. t22, 13. t33, 14. t24, 15. t84, 16. t33, 17. t24, 18. t38, 19. t7, 20. t33, 21. t7, 22. t66. Wait, no, the string given has 22 tokens. I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nSo, we have to generate the entire string as the concatenation of NT41's expansion and NT23's expansion.\n\nLet's start by expanding NT41 and NT23.\n\nFirst, NT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nAs above, NT34 -> 't26', NT49 -> 't57'. So, NT41's expansion is 't26 t57', which is two symbols.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is 't13', which doesn't match 't26', so maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the NT's derivation.\n\nWait, wait, looking back at the NT41 rule: is it `NT41 -> NT34 NT49` or `NT41 -> NT34 t57`? Wait, in the given grammar, under NT49, the rule is `NT49 -> t57`.\n\nSo, NT41's expansion is NT34 and NT49.\n\nNT34's rule is `NT34 -> t26`.\n\nSo, combining, NT41 -> t26 and t57, so two t's.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t13, so I must have a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the string starts with t13, so perhaps NT41's expansion starts with t13.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, for NT28: `NT28 -> NT38 NT31`, but perhaps I should check other NTs that expand to 't13'.\n\nIn the terminal list, the only terminal I see that starts with 't' is t13, t24, t26, t33, t34, t35, t36, t37, t38, t54, t57, t64, t66, t71, t74, t84, t81, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the right-hand sides of the terminals, I don't see 't13' in any rule except NT41's. So, NT41 must derive into 't13', but according to the grammar, NT41's production is NT34 and NT49, which we thought derive to 't26' and 't57', but that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine NT41.\n\nLooking at the grammar: S -> NT41 NT23, and NT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nThen, NT49 -> t57.\n\nSo, NT41 would produce 't26 t57', which is two tokens. So, the first token in the given string is 't13', which is not 't26', so that can't be the start.\n\nWait, that suggests that either the string isn't generated by the grammar, but perhaps I made a mistake in the parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT24's production or another NT's production leads to t13.\n\nWait, looking back, in the rules, I see NT41's production is `NT41 -> 't13'`. Wait no, looking at the rules again, under NT41, it's `NT41 -> 't13'` no, I think I confused it earlier. Wait, looking at the terminal list:\n\nLooking through each line, for NT23: it's `NT23 -> 't83'`, which is a terminal.\n\nFor NT41, I think in the rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-428","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that almost all the productions are in the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, except the ones where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example, NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, and many others. The last productions have terminals like 't81', 't26', etc.\n\nThe task is to check whether the given string `t13 t38 t64 t83 t24 t54 t33 t24 t17 t24 t33 t24 t74 t24 t33 t7 t66 t24 t74 t7 t33 t24 t38` can be derived from this grammar.\n\nSo, I think the approach here is to perform a derivation starting from the start symbol S and see if we can build the given string by expanding the non-terminals using the grammar rules.\n\nLet's list out the grammar rules that introduce terminals, because these are the leaf nodes in our parse tree.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't81'\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT58 \u2192 't17'\n- NT43 \u2192 't62'\n- NT5 \u2192 't43'\n- NT16 \u2192 't58'\n- NT7 \u2192 't58'\n- NT41 \u2192 't13' [Wait, NT41 is defined as NT34 NT49, and then NT34 \u2192 't26', NT49 \u2192 't57', so NT41 is 't26 t57' (which isn't directly a terminal, but a sequence of two terminals).

Similarly, NT24 \u2192 't33' [Wait, no: Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\nFor example, NT24 \u2192 't49' (so produces 't49')\nNT28 \u2192 't26'\nNT27 \u2192 't81'\nNT3 \u2192 't63'\nNT10 \u2192 't28'\nNT31 \u2192 't38'\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\nNT36 \u2192 't63'\nNT42 \u2192 't11', 't24', etc. Wait, no, for NT42 the rules are:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT55 NT49\nNT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\nNT27 \u2192 't81'\nSo when we expand NT42, it's NT55 followed by NT49. NT55 is NT22 followed by NT27 (which is 't81'), so NT55 becomes NT22 t81. Then NT22 is NT52 NT22? Wait no. Let's take it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to build a parse tree where the string can be broken down into a sequence of terminal symbols as given.\n\nLet me write down the string: t13 t38 t64 t83 t24 t54 t33 t24 t17 t24 t33 t24 t74 t24 t33 t7 t66 t24 t74 t7 t33 t24 t38.\n\nWe start from S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo the overall structure is S = NT41 NT23.\n\nOur string starts with t13, t38, etc., but let's see:\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S is NT41 followed by NT23. According to the grammar, NT23 \u2192 't83'.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string should be t83. But the given string starts with t13, which would mean NT41 cannot be expanding to t83 but perhaps via some intermediate steps.\n\nWait, NT41 is defined as NT34 NT49. Then, NT34 is 't26', and NT49 is NT57. Hmm, wait, does NT49 expand to anything terminal? Wait, looking at NT49's productions: Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT57 (no terminal)\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 \u2192 't26' followed by NT49, which is NT57.\n\nSo NT41 would expand to 't26' followed by whatever NT57 expands to.\n\nBut looking back, in the terminal productions, I don't see NT57 producing anything.

The string to evaluate is: `t26 t57 t59 t83 t24 t63 t33 t7 t26 t57 t8 t38 t7 t81 t84 t66 t62 t71 t33 t24 t66 t7 t38`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, it seems like some of the productions have terminals, which actually might not fit CNF's strict definition since in CNF all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with another form. Oh no, the user mentioned it's in CNF, but I see some rules like S -> NT41 NT23, which is S (non-terminal) producing two non-terminals, which fits CNF.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So if some productions have a mix, that might not be in CNF. Looking at the grammar, I see some rules have terminals, like NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15 where NT27 is a non-terminal, but it's producing other non-terminals. Wait no, if all productions are between non-terminals, then it's CNF. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, no, looking again, maybe the grammar is actually not in CNF because some of the non-terminals might be producing multiple non-terminals and a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.\n\nBut since the user said it's in CNF, I can proceed under that assumption, perhaps some rules have terminals on RHS, which is allowed in CNF. No, actually, in CNF, all productions must be of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where a is a terminal. So any production that has two non-terminals is fine, but having a terminal in the right-hand side is also allowed. So the grammar seems to fit CNF.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the bottom up, using a Pushdown Automaton (like the CYK algorithm) or try to find a derivation step by step. Since the grammar has a lot of non-terminals and productions, it might be a bit involved, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the productions that correspond to the terminals in the string because each production should generate a terminal symbol. Each production is a rule that a non-terminal can use to generate a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t26, t57, t59, t83, t24, t63, t33, t7, t26, t57, t8, t38, t7, t81, t84, t66, t62, t71, t33, t24, t66, t7, t38.\n\nLet me note that the string is a sequence of 22 tokens, each separated by a space.\n\nSo, each token represents a terminal in the string.\n\nSince the grammar is context-free, we can parse the string by recursively applying the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so the initial production requires that the entire string is broken down into two parts: one generated by NT41 and the other by NT23.\n\nSo, the first step is to check whether the string can be split into two parts: the part generated by NT41 and the part by NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, the total length is 22, so we can split it into any k and (22 -k) tokens, where k is the number of tokens in the first part and (22 -k) in the second.\n\nBut that might take a lot of time. Alternatively, maybe I can work backward and find the productions that generate the terminals.\n\nLet's look at each terminal and see what non-terminals can generate them.\n\nSome terminals in the string: t26, t57, t59, t83, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n\nFor example, NT23 \u2192 t83.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 \u2192 t49, but wait, in the string we have t26, t57, etc.\n\nLooking more carefully, let's find all non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't63'\n\nNT41 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT6?

{"custom_id":"request-452","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or terminals with a single terminal.\n\nFirst, let me list out the rules for clarity. The start symbol is S, and according to the rules, S can produce either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. That means the start string must be derived from S, which then splits into two parts, each being a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t26 t57 t71 t83 t24 t9 t33 t7 t26 t57 t8 t8 t57 t63 t8 t13 t28 t33 t7 t59 t19 t7 t7 t33. Hmm, that's 21 tokens. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 21 parts separated by spaces, so it's a list of 21 tokens. Since each production splits into two non-terminals, and each non-terminal eventually resolves to a single terminal, the number of symbols should be a power of two, but considering intermediate non-terminals, maybe not. But wait, in a CNF grammar, each expansion doubles the length, but in our case, the string has 21 symbols, which isn't a power of two minus one. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me list all the production rules to see how non-terminals and terminals are structured. Each rule is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal symbol which I assume is a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, some rules seem to be terminals because they directly map to a token. For example, NT23 -> 't83' means that NT23 is a production that results in the terminal 't83'. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT41, NT27, etc., either produce other non-terminals or terminate with 't' followed by some number.\n\nSo first, let's confirm that each symbol in the string matches the terminals of the grammar. The string tokens are: t26, t57, t71, t83, t24, t9, t33, t7, t26, t57, t8, t8, t57, t63, t8, t13, t28, t33, t7, t59, t19, t7, t7, t33. But wait, the provided grammar's rules have many terminals: like t81, t17, t62, t36, t26, etc. So the string consists of these terminals, which are valid.\n\nSo the next step is to see if the string can be produced by the grammar. To do that, I can try to parse the string from the bottom up, trying to find a derivation from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's suitable for using the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just reasoning, I might have to figure it out manually.\n\nBut parsing directly might be complicated, so maybe building a parse tree would help. Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe string starts with t26. Let's see which rule produces t26. Looking at the rules, I see that NT24 -> t49 and NT24 -> t33. Also, other rules produce t26: NT7 -> t58, NT26 -> t15, etc. Wait, maybe I should list down all rules that produce each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to notice that each rule either breaks down into two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is long, maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be divided into parts that match the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into possible parse units based on the production rules. Let me see: each production rule splits into two parts, which could correspond to two elements in the string. So perhaps the string can be split into pairs, and each pair must correspond to a rule.\n\nBut wait, the string has 21 tokens, which isn't a good number because each step in the grammar doubles the number of symbols (but perhaps more accurately, each non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals, but if those are terminals, then the string grows by a factor of each expansion. Hmm, maybe not exactly, but it's more efficient to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a sequence of productions. Let me see.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse-engineer the string: starting from the beginning, see which rules can produce the starting symbols.\n\nThe first token is t26. Looking at the rules, NT7 -> t58, and others produce t26 directly: NT28, etc. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT26 -> t15\n- NT26 -> t59\nSo if NT26 is a non-terminal, it can be broken down into t15 or t59. But in the string, t26 is the first token, so unless t26 is a terminal, it's generated by some other rule. Wait, wait, looking back, in the rules:\n\nAh, there's NT28 -> t26. And NT30 -> t24, but t26 is only in the rule for NT28. So to produce t26, the non-terminal must be NT28: NT28 -> t26. So the first token being t26 implies that the first two symbols must be part of a non-terminal that breaks down into NT28 and something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the string as a sequence that can be divided into non-terminals that match the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that each non-terminal must be followed by some other non-terminal or a terminal. Since the string starts with t26, perhaps the first non-terminal is NT28, as it can directly produce t26.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with NT28 -> t26, and then what comes after? The next token is t57. Let's see which rule produces t57.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> t58\n- NT24 -> t49\n- NT35 -> t62\n- NT65 -> t22\nWait, maybe a better approach: let's list all the rules that produce t followed by a number.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT23 -> 't83'\n- NT24 -> 't49'\n- NT28 -> 't26'\n- NT33 -> 't36' (no, wait, looking again)\nWait, in the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. Let me list all the terminals their non-terminals produce:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 -> 't62'\n- NT34 -> 't26'\n- NT35 -> 't62'\n- NT36 -> 't63'\n- NT37 -> 't84', 't41', 't10'\n- NT41 -> 't13'\n- NT42 -> 't11', 't24'\n- NT5 -> 't66'\n- NT15 -> 't71', 't59', 't3', 't58'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's try to figure out from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t26 t57. Let me see, t26 is produced by NT28. Then, t57 must be the result of the other non-terminal in the production that starts S, which can be either NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58.\n\nWait, S can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So S -> NT41 NT23 or S->NT41 NT58. So the string should structure around S, which would split into two parts derived from these two production rules.\n\nGiven the string starts with t26, which is from NT28, but NT28 isn't directly connected to S. So maybe the initial step is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the string doesn't start with S's production but is derived further down. Hmm, but the entire string should derive from S. So maybe the entire string is a result of expanding S into its components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the results of NT41 and NT23 or NT58. Let me think.\n\nWait, S produces NT41 and NT23 in the first case, so both of these non-terminals must expand into a string.

{"custom_id":"request-450","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky normal form has each production either as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I'm supposed to check is quite long, so I'll need to break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice some terminals are directly converted. For example, NT23 directly converts to 't83', and others like NT29 in another part (though that's not given) might be similar. The string provided is: t13 t59 t83 t24 t54 t33 t24 t13 t8 t24 t57 t66 t81 t58 t81 t58 t62 t81 t58 t81 t58 t9 t57 t33.\n\nI'm going to approach this by building the parse tree from the string upwards, starting with the leftmost symbols and trying to find the start symbol S. The start symbol is 'S' and according to the grammar, S can produce two possibilities: NT41 NT58 or NT27 NT15. Wait, no, looking again, S is written as S -> NT41 NT23? Or maybe there's a typo in the question, but let me check. The first line says S -> NT41 NT23, S -> NT41 NT58. So S can go to NT41 followed by NT23 or NT58. Wait, but looking at the productions later, there's NT41 -> NT34 NT49, which seems to go further. So the string must be generated by starting with S, which splits into NT41 and either NT58 or something else. Let me clarify the S production: It seems S can produce NT41 followed by NT23 or NT58? Or is it both options? The grammar says S -> NT41 NT23 and S -> NT41 NT58, but wait, that can't be right because NT41 would be followed by NT23 or NT58, but then NT41 and NT58 would have their own expansions. Hmm, maybe I'm misreading it. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, S is written as S -> NT41 NT23 and S -> NT41 NT58. So S splits into two parts: either NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58. That's a bit confusing because both have NT41. So the string must start with something that can come from NT41 or NT58. But in the string provided, the first token is t13, which I need to find where that comes from.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT7 \u2192 't58' and NT41 \u2192 't13'. So t13 corresponds to NT41. So the first token in the string is t13. So according to the grammar, the string starts with NT41. Now, S can produce NT41 and then either NT23 or NT58. So the string after t13 must be the result of NT41's expansion and then either NT23 or NT58.\n\nSo let's split the string into parts after t13. The string is t13 followed by t59, t83, etc. But wait, I think the first step is that S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So the entire string must be either (NT41 (NT23)) or (NT41 (NT58)).\n\nWait, but the string starts with t13, which is part of NT41. So let's see, after NT41 comes either NT23 or NT58. Let's see what comes next. The next token is t59. Now, I don't see a production where NT59 is a terminal. Looking through the productions, I see NT31 \u2192 't38', NT58 \u2192 't74', etc. Wait, are the non-terminals correctly named? Because in some cases, like NT58 \u2192 't58'?\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions to see which terminals are available.

{"custom_id":"request-468","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t26 t57 t71 t19 t26 t24 t38 t24 t71 t33 t24 t33 t24 t13 t24 t81 t38 t37 t57 t66 t71 t33 t7 t38`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the case where a terminal can appear. However, in the given grammar, it seems that there are terminals directly on the right-hand side of some productions, which is allowed because CNF can have terminals, but importantly, all non-terminals must only produce other non-terminals, not terminals. Wait, no, actually, in standard CNF, the productions are all of the form A \u2192 BC with B and C being non-terminals. But some derivations can involve terminals directly, perhaps as part of the initial rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, it seems there are rules like S -> NT41 NT23 and so on, and then each NT (non-terminal) has productions that eventually lead to terminals. So each step is replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and eventually we reach a terminal.\n\nBut to find out if the given string can be generated, I think I need to reverse engineer the derivation steps. Since the given string is made up of terminals, the process would involve starting from the start symbol S and applying productions step by step, expanding non-terminals until we reach the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to map out the derivation steps. But given the number of terminals in the string, this might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, maybe I can parse the string by seeing if each part corresponds to the possible combinations of the non-terminals and their expansions.\n\nLooking at the given string: `t26 t57 t71 t19 t26 t24 t38 t24 t71 t33 t24 t33 t24 t13 t24 t81 t38 t37 t57 t66 t71 t33 t7 t38`.\n\nThat's 24 tokens, which suggests that the string's length is 24 terminals. So each non-terminal expansion contributes a certain number of terminals. Since CNF allows only two non-terminals to be produced each step, each step can contribute up to two terminals, but perhaps more if they have multiple terminal symbols in their production chain.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, each production either starts with S and includes NTs, and the NTs lead down to terminals. So each NT in the grammar seems to eventually expand to a terminal, perhaps with some intermediates. For example, looking at NT26: `NT26 -> NT15 NT59`, and then NT59: `NT59 -> NT19 NT24`, NT19: `NT19 -> NT59 NT34`, NT34: `NT34 -> NT26 NT49`, and so on. Wait, but this seems to loop back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see which terminals can be generated and how.\n\nFirst, let's note all the terminal symbols in the string: t26, t57, t71, t19, t24, t38, t81, etc. So the string consists of these terminals.\n\nNow, I need to see if the given sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to find the sequence that the grammar can produce by looking at the possible non-terminals that can generate these terminals when expanded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar has a certain structure, and we can determine whether the string can be broken down into the right pattern.\n\nLooking at the string, I can see that it's a series of t's with numbers. I need to check for possible patterns or rules that generate such a sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is designed so that each rule expands into specific terminals. For example, some NTs directly correspond to a terminal, like NT37 -> 't84' and NT24 -> 't49', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to parse the string from left to right, trying to match each terminal against the possible productions of non-terminals, and see if we can find a derivation.\n\nBut without a parser, this could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the process can be approached by noting the production rules that generate these terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT5 -> NT5 NT43, which means NT5 is only replaced by other NTs until it can reach a terminal. Similarly, NT37 has two productions: one to 't84' and another to NT41 NT10. So if a NT37 in the string comes from the direct terminal, that's one possibility. If it's part of a production chain, then it might involve other NTs which can further expand.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, perhaps I can look for whether each terminal can be generated by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for the sequence of terminals and seeing if they can be produced by applying the productions step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to notice that each NT has a specific expansion that produces certain terminals in a fixed order. For example, NT37 can directly produce 't84', but also can produce NT41 NT10, which themselves expand to specific terminals.\n\nWait, but without a comprehensive expansion plan, it's hard to follow every step. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that the only terminals are those defined directly, and others are part of longer chains.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to note that the given grammar has some non-terminals that can produce terminals. For example, NT24 -> 't49', NT28 -> 't26', etc.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts where each part corresponds to a derived terminal from a non-terminal.\n\nBut honestly, this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe I should try to outline the possible expansion steps.\n\nWait, the string is long, but perhaps I can split it into parts and see if each part can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the string can be parsed into pairs of terminals that correspond to the productions. For example, each production in the grammar might produce two consecutive terminals in the string.\n\nWait, for example, S -> NT41 NT23, so NT41 and NT23. Let's see what NT41 and NT23 expand to. From the grammar:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT34 -> NT26 NT49\nNT26 -> NT15 NT59\nNT15 -> NT31 NT3\nNT31 -> NT38 NT36\nNT38 -> NT32 NT37\nNT37 -> 't84' or NT41 NT10\nWait, this seems like a loop because NT37 can go to itself via NT41 and NT10. Maybe I need to see what NT37 ultimately expands to.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated if it can be split into pairs where each pair is the result of expanding two non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nBut without a clearer approach, maybe I should consider that the string may not be generated because it doesn't align with any of the possible production paths.\n\nWait, but then again, the grammar might have a way to produce such a string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process involves noting that each terminal in the string must be generated by some non-terminal production, and in order, the productions must fit together correctly.\n\nBut honestly, without actually performing the full derivation, it's challenging to say definitively. But given the time constraints, I might infer that the string does contain some parts that don't align with any production rules. For example, if a terminal in the string cannot be generated by any non-terminal, then the string is invalid.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, some terminal symbols are present: t26, t57, t71, t19, t24, t38, t81, t3, t7, etc. So I can check if each of these terminals is generated by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nFor example, t26 is generated by NT28, t57 is generated by NT35, t71 is generated by NT35, t19 is generated by NT35, t24 by NT24, t38 by NT38, t81 by NT18, etc. So all these terminals are covered by the grammar's productions.\n\nBut perhaps the sequence is impossible because of the way the productions are structured.

{"custom_id":"request-464","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring the production rules where each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol seems to be S, which immediately goes to NT41 NT23. So, the start is a combination of two non-terminals. Each of these could be further expanded. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals: t13, t59, etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step either increases the number of symbols by one (replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals) or stays the same (replacing with terminals).\n\nWait, is that correct? Actually, no. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (which would mean the number of symbols can increase) or a terminal (so the count might stay the same or go down). But in this case, the grammar seems to have rules that can lead to multiple terminals, so perhaps the process is about breaking down each non-terminal into its components, each time splitting until we reach terminals.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if it can derive the given string. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation would build the string step by step. \n\nThe given string is: `t13 t59 t19 t26 t24 t38 t7 t38 t7 t26 t57 t8 t7 t81 t13 t26 t57 t66 t66 t81 t58 t62 t59 t57 t33`. \n\nI notice that some replacements might be repeated. For example, 't81' appears twice, so maybe that's a simple terminal, while others are non-terminals that can be expanded further.\n\nLet me try to map out the structure. Starting from S:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\n\nSo, the string starts with 't13' (since NT41 -> t13). That checks out as the first part of the string. So S produces NT41 which becomes 't13', and NT23 which becomes 't83' (since NT23 -> t83). So the string starts with t13 t83. But wait, the given string starts with t13, then t59. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the expanded symbols. So each production step adds symbols in order. So from S -> NT41 NT23, it would expand to NT41's expansion followed by NT23's expansion.\n\nBut looking at the string: the first part is t13 t59 t19..., which suggests that the first symbol is t13, which is NT41's expansion. But after t13, the string has t59, which doesn't fit with NT23 being t83. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I should check the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, let's check NT41 and NT23. Oh, right, the grammar rules are all in CNF, so each production is either a non-terminal leading to two non-terminals or a terminal. But in the given string, after t13, it's t59, which is a terminal. Is there a way that NT41 (which produces t13) is followed by another non-terminal that, when expanded, gives t59?\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the rules for NT41 and NT23. From the grammar:\n\nNT41 -> t13\nNT23 -> t83\n\nSo NT41 is t13, and NT23 is t83. Therefore, the expansion of S would be t13 followed by t83. But in the given string, after t13 comes t59, which is different. That suggests that either the string isn't generated by this grammar or I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't correctly ordered. Let me check the string again. The given string is:\n\nt13 t59 t19 t26 t24 t38 t7 t38 t7 t26 t57 t8 t7 t81 t13 t26 t57 t66 t66 t81 t58 t62 t59 t57 t33\n\nWait, maybe the first NT41 is t13, and the second NT23 is t83, but the given string starts with t13 followed by t59. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the order. Maybe the NT23 is being expanded in a way that leads to t59 or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming NT23 goes to t83. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 -> t83\n\nYes, that's correct. So the initial expansion of S is t13 t83. But the given string starts with t13 t59. So that's a conflict. \n\nUnless, maybe there's a mistake in the way the string is provided. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the order is reversed, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different derivation path that I'm not seeing. Let's think about the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, all productions are binary. So each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals until all are terminals. \n\nWait, maybe the initial expansion S -> NT41 NT23 doesn't produce t13 and t83 as the first step, but perhaps another approach. But no, the initial step is only S producing NT41 and NT23. So the string must start with the expansion of NT41 followed by NT23.\n\nGiven that the given string starts with t13 followed by t59, which isn't t83, it seems that S can't produce this string as the first two symbols. Therefore, it's not possible for the string to be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is t13, which is correct for NT41, but the next symbol should be t83, but it's t59, meaning it's different.\n\nWait, unless there's a different way to produce t59 from some non-terminal. Let me see the rules that produce t59. Looking at the grammar, is there any rule where a non-terminal expands to t59? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly expands to t59. For example, NT58 -> t17, NT5 -> t66, etc. So t59 is a terminal in some rules? No, in the rules, terminals are t13, t59, etc., but looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that produces t59. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rules. Let me double-check the grammar. Oh, I see some rules where NT58 -> t17, NT5 -> t66, etc. Wait, but the string has t59. Looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces t59. So t59 must be a terminal itself, not derived from any non-terminal. That means that in the string, t59 must be the result of a non-terminal expanding directly to t59, which doesn't exist in the grammar. So the string can't be generated by this grammar because t59 isn't produced by any rule.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Looking at the grammar again, I don't see any NT that produces t59 as a terminal. So any occurrence of t59 in the string must be the expansion of a non-terminal, but since there's no such rule, the string can't be derived. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is structured in a way that makes parsing easier, typically with two non-terminals on the left and one on the right or nothing. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some symbols are terminals, indicated by them being converted into specific strings. For example, NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15, but also some NT rules directly go to terminal strings like NT41 \u2192 't13'. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t13 t71 t19 t26 t24 t13 t7 t81 t38 t7 t81 t26 t57 t28 t66 t62 t71 t33 t7 t38 t7 t38 t24 t74 t7 t33`.\n\nI remember that in context-free grammars, we can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to work through the possible derivations.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the terminal tokens in the string to see if they can be derived from the grammar. The tokens are: t13, t71, t19, t26, t24, t13, t7, t81, t38, t7, t81, t26, t57, t28, t66, t62, t71, t33, t7, t38, t7, t38, t24, t74, t7, t33.\n\nI notice that some of these are long and some are short. The start symbol is S, which can produce two NTs, like NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the string starts with nt41 nt23, but I think I need to match the string's structure.\n\nLooking at the productions, some terminals are:\n- t13 \u2192 NT41\n- t26 \u2192 NT24 or NT15 or others... Wait, I need to look at the productions for each NT.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT41 can produce 't13' and other non-terminals. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't58', NT3 \u2192 't64', and others.\n\nI'll start by checking if the first token 't13' can be produced by some NT. Looking at the productions for NT41, one of them is NT41 \u2192 't13'. So NT41 can produce t13. Now, I need to see what else NT41 can produce.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so the string would need to start with NT41's derivation followed by NT23's. So the first part of the string should be a derivation of NT41 followed by a derivation of NT23.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t13, which is produced by NT41. So that part checks out. Now, the next part is t71, which I think is produced by NT41 as well (I see NT41 \u2192 t13 and another production? Let me check: looking through the productions, I think NT41 is only t13, so perhaps I need to see what produces t71.\n\nWait, no, perhaps t71 is produced by NT15. Looking at the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't71' (I think, let me check: yes, NT15: I see 'NT15 -> 't71''. So t71 is from NT15.\n\nSo, after NT41's t13, the next NT23 must produce t71, which would come from NT15. But NT23 produces 't83' according to the productions: 'NT23 -> 't83''.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the second token after t13 is t71, but NT23 produces 't83', not t71. So that doesn't match. That suggests that either my initial assumption is wrong or I need to explore other options.\n\nWait, maybe the initial split of S is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the string uses other production rules. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is built using a different combination. Let me check another approach.\n\nAnother way is to think of the string as a series of production steps. Each token must come from the left-hand side of some production.\n\nBut since the grammar allows for multiple production rules, it's better to approach this by seeing if the entire string can be broken down into the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into two parts, each part corresponding to one of the two NTs in the start symbol's production.\n\nThe string has 27 tokens. Let me see if I can divide it into two parts such that the first part is a derivation from NT41 and the second from NT23, or vice versa.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or another option (like NT41 NT58). Let's try both possibilities.\n\nFirst, suppose S \u2192 NT41 NT23. The string would be a sequence of 27 tokens, so potentially the first part is a number of tokens from NT41's derivation and the second part from NT23's.\n\nLooking at the string again: t13 t71 t19 t26 t24 t13 t7 t81 t38 t7 t81 t26 t57 t28 t66 t62 t71 t33 t7 t38 t7 t38 t24 t74 t7 t33.\n\nIf I split it after the first token, it's t13 and then... but that would require the second part to be a derivation of NT23, which needs to end with t83. But the second token is t71, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the split is earlier. Let's try to find a possible split point where the first part can be a derivation for NT41 and the second for NT23.\n\nLet me try to see what NT41 could produce. NT41 can directly produce 't13' or is there another production? Looking through the productions, NT41 has 'NT41 -> 't13'' and also: looking again, I see more productions for NT41, like `NT41 -> NT34 NT49`, but since I'm building from the bottom up, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split is S \u2192 NT41 NT23, but the string's first token is 't13', which comes from NT41. Then the rest of NT23's derivation should occur.\n\nBut if NT23 is 't83', then the rest of the string should eventually end with 't83', but looking at the string, the last token is 't33', so that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT41 NT58 is the initial split. Let's see: NT41 can produce t13, and NT58 can produce... looking at NT58's productions, I see `NT58 -> 't17'` or other non-terminals. So if NT41 is t13 and NT58 is something else, perhaps the string can be built that way.\n\nLooking at the string, after t13 we have t71, which could be part of NT58's derivation. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be derived by looking for the required nodes.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t13, which comes from NT41. Then t71 is the next token. According to the grammar, t71 comes from NT15. But NT15 can produce 't71' or other non-terminals. Wait, looking at the productions, for NT15 we have:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT12 NT42\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT59\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT58\n\nSo from NT15, it can generate t71 directly or go through other non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string starts with NT41, the next part must be a production from NT23 (from S \u2192 NT41 NT23). However, in the string, the second token is t71, which might not fit NT23.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the entire string is a right-derivation or left-derivation. Let me try to find the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be built by starting with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and then each non-terminal splits into their respective components.\n\nLet me try to break the string down into groups that might correspond to the productions.\n\nLet's see the entire string: t13 t71 t19 t26 t24 t13 t7 t81 t38 t7 t81 t26 t57 t28"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me see how they look:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which can produce two non-terminals each time, like NT41 NT41, NT58, etc.\n- Most of the rules are of the form NTxx \u2192 NTyy NTzz, meaning each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals.\n- Some non-terminals expand directly into terminals, which are letters like t13, t71, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t13 t71 t83 t26 t7 t13 t24 t81 t38 t8 t13 t24 t81 t37 t57 t66 t62 t81 t58 t81 t58 t9 t57 t66 t9 t33`.\n\nI'm a bit overwhelmed by the number of rules and non-terminals, but maybe I can break this down step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either terminates the derivation (by expanding into a terminal) or breaks down into two non-terminals, which themselves can continue expanding.\n\nOne approach is to try to parse the string backward. Start from the end and work our way back to the start, checking consistency with the grammar. Each terminal in the string must correspond to the right-hand side of some production rule. Since all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, the string must be built from the combination of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t13. I'll check the rules to see which non-terminal can produce t13. Scanning through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t13 (rule: NT41 -> t13)\n- NT27 \u2192 t7 (No)\n- NT38 \u2192 t32 (No)\n- NT33 \u2192 t63 (No)\n- NT55 \u2192 t65 (No)\n- NT12 \u2192 t8 (No)\n- NT8 \u2192 t35 (No)\n- NT10 \u2192 t28 (No)\n- NT18 \u2192 t37 (No)\n- NT42 \u2192 t11 (No)\n- NT5 \u2192 t66 (No)\n- NT33 \u2192 t63 (No)\n- NT15 \u2192 t71 (Yes, NT15 \u2192 t71)\n- NT31 \u2192 t66 (No)\n- NT58 \u2192 t74 (No)\n- NT3 \u2192 t64 (No)\n- NT30 \u2192 t37 (No)\n- NT32 \u2192 t7 (No)\n- NT55 \u2192 t65 (No)\n- NT24 \u2192 t49 (No)\n- NT7 \u2192 t58 (No)\n- NT41 \u2192 t13 (Yes, duplicated)\n- NT30 \u2192 t24 (No)\n- NT36 \u2192 t63 (No)\n- NT42 \u2192 t11 (No)\n- NT24 \u2192 t27 (No)\n- NT7 \u2192 t58 (No)\n- NT41 \u2192 t13 (Yes)\n- NT30 \u2192 t24 (No)\n- NT36 \u2192 t54 (No)\n- NT23 \u2192 t19 (No)\n- NT8 \u2192 t10 (No)\n- NT12 \u2192 t8 (No)\n- NT59 \u2192 t19 (No)\n- NT31 \u2192 t66 (No)\n- NT5 \u2192 t66 (Yes)\n- NT32 \u2192 t7 (No)\n- NT8 \u2192 t14 (No)\n- NT24 \u2192 t63 (No)\n- NT27 \u2192 t9 (No)\n- NT49 \u2192 t57 (No)\n\nWait, I'm trying to find where t13 appears as a terminal, and I see that NT15 \u2192 t71, not t13. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t13 (from NT41 \u2192 t13)\n- NT23 \u2192 t19 (No)\n- NT8 \u2192 t35 (No)\n- NT12 \u2192 t8 (No)\nWait, in the list above, I think I might have missed that NT41 \u2192 t13 is present. Yes, in the initial list, under NT41: it's written as \"NT41 -> NT34 NT49\", but then later it's specified:\n\nNT41 -> t13.\n\nSimilarly, I think the initial NT41: \"NT41 -> NT34 NT49\" is actually a longer production, but in the later rules, specific terminals like t13 are listed as individual productions.\n\nSo, the string starts with t13, which can come from NT41 \u2192 t13. So, that's the first step. Now, the string after t13 is t71, t83, etc., but let's process backward.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to reconstruct the parse tree. Let's take the given string and see if we can break it down into the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the string must be a concatenation of symbols derived from the productions, with each production contributing either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string is: t13, t71, t83, t26, t7, t13, t24, t81, t38, t8, t13, t24, t81, t37, t57, t66, t62, t81, t58, t81, t58, t9, t57, t66, t9, t33.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Maybe I should start from the beginning and try to see if each symbol can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the leftmost derivation. Let me try that.\n\nThe string starts with t13. Looking at the rules, t13 is produced by NT41 \u2192 t13. So, the first symbol is t13, which comes from NT41. Therefore, the leftmost derivation starts with NT41.\n\nNow, the production for NT41 is NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49, which is a two-symbol production. So, NT41 produces NT34 and NT49, each of which must be followed by the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no. In a leftmost derivation, the leftmost non-terminal is expanded first. So, if NT41 is the first to be expanded, it will produce NT34 and NT49. But in the string, after t13, the next symbol is t71. That suggests that the next symbols must come from the expansion of NT34 and NT49.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider how the string is built step by step.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Since all productions in CNF produce exactly one terminal or two non-terminals, the string can be viewed as a sequence of such steps. Therefore, each symbol in the string must correspond to a single terminal production or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string is a sequence of terminals, we can think of the derivation as a sequence where each step either terminates (by using a rule that directly produces a terminal) or splits into two non-terminals, each of which must themselves be terminals or split into further non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work backward. Let's start from the end of the string and see if it can be built by reversing the productions.\n\nThe last symbol is t33. Looking at the rules, which non-terminals produce t33?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any productions where a non-terminal directly produces t33. Wait, let's check:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t63 (No)\n- NT33 \u2192 t62 (No)\n- NT10 \u2192 t28 (No)\nWait, I'm looking for a rule that produces t33. Scanning through the given rules:\n\nLooking at the production rules, under NT33, I see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT36 NT26\nNT33 \u2192 NT36 NT54\nWait, but none of these produce t33. Let me check all the rules where a production ends in t33. Hmm, actually, none of the rules seem to have t33 as a right-hand side, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me check again. The rules provided include:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 NT12 NT42\n- NT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16\n- NT16 \u2192 't81' (Yes, NT16 \u2192 t81)\n- NT37 \u2192 't62' ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-504","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: t26 t57 t59 t83 t7 t54 t33 t24 t26 t57 t8 t38 t8 t66 t64 t19 t26 t24 t66 t81 t58 t9 t33 t7 t17 t24 t33.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one non-terminal on the right. This structure makes parsing easier because each step of the parse reduces the string by half.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I see that S can produce either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the string must start with either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. But looking at the string, it starts with t26 t57. Hmm, t26 is a terminal, so I need to see if NT41 or NT23 can be split into t26 and t57.\n\nWait, NT41 can produce NT34 NT49, and NT34 can produce t26. So if NT41 can derive t26 as a terminal, then perhaps NT41 can start the string. Let me check the productions for NT41. Yes, NT41 -> NT34 NT49, and NT34 -> t26. So S can produce NT41 NT23. Now, in the string, the first two tokens are t26 t57, but NT41 produces t26 and then NT49, which should produce more tokens. Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to parse the string step by step. The first symbol in the string is t26. So I need to find a production that starts with t26. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT23 -> t83, which is not helpful. Maybe another production: NT58 -> t17? Wait, no, the string starts with t26.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see that NT28 -> t26 is a production. So if a non-terminal can produce t26, then that's a possibility. So the string starts with t26, so the first non-terminal must be NT28 or any other that can derive t26. Let me check where t26 is mentioned.\n\nFrom the rules: NT28 -> t26, and NT59 -> t19, NT26 -> t59, etc. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I need to approach this more systematically.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. The CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell [i,j] represents whether the substring from i to j can be generated by the start symbol or any non-terminal in context.\n\nBut since the string has 26 tokens, that's quite long, but manageable. Let me try to think of a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since each production either splits into two non-terminals, the derivation tree will be binary. Each step of the parse tree doubles the number of symbols until we reach the input string.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, so the root of the tree has S. Each node will split into its two right-hand sides. So for example, S can split into NT41 and NT23, each of which can further split into their respective parts, and so on, until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that, the number of symbols in the string should correspond to 2^n, where n is the number of splits. Let's see: the string has 26 tokens. 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. 26 is between 16 and 32. Wait, but in a derivation, the number of symbols doubles each time. So starting from S (1 node), then 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. But 26 isn't a power of two, which is a problem. Maybe the grammar is ambiguous, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the string has 26 tokens, then when we parse it with a recursive descent parser, the parse tree height would have to accommodate 26 symbols, which is tricky. Unless the parse tree is not perfectly balanced, which can happen in certain cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into different paths. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to track the possible non-terminals that can derive into the beginning of the string.\n\nLooking again, the string starts with t26. From the grammar, the only way to get t26 is through NT28 -> t26. So the first non-terminal must be NT28.\n\nSo, starting with NT28, which can produce t26 and NT24. Wait, looking at the rules, NT28 -> t26 is direct, but is there another production? Looking back, I see NT28 can also produce t26, but no other productions for NT28 beyond that. So NT28 produces t26 and nothing else. Wait, that can't be right because in the initial split, NT28 would have to be part of the S split.\n\nWait, no: S can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. So the initial split is either NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58. But the string starts with t26, which is the production NT28->t26. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit because either NT41 or NT23 are being split. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial symbols split into more non-terminals. Let's think. If S is NT41 NT23, then both NT41 and NT23 need to derive into the string. Alternatively, if S is NT41 NT58, then NT41 and NT58 need to derive. The string starts with t26, so perhaps let's consider the first production S->NT41 NT23.\n\nSo NT41 and NT23. Let's see NT23: looking at the rules, NT23 -> t83, which is a terminal. So that would produce t83. So if the first part is NT23, it would produce t83, but the string starts with t26, so that doesn't fit. So maybe S must split into NT41 and NT58 instead.\n\nSo S-> NT41 NT58. Now, let's see NT41: As before, NT41->NT34 NT49. NT34->t26 and NT49->... Let's see, NT49: Looking for a production for NT49, but I don't see it in the given rules. Wait, in the rules provided, is there a rule for NT49?\n\nLooking back, in the productions provided, I see NT33 -> NT12 NT49. So NT49 is part of NT33's production. But where else is NT49 defined? It seems that NT49 is a right-hand side of NT33, but there's no direct production for NT49. So NT49 must produce some terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper. Let's see if any of the non-terminals point directly to a terminal or to another non-terminal that eventually points to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a structure where each non-terminal is linked to possible terminals they can produce. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed as follows. Let's think in terms of the tokens:\n\nStart with t26. So the first symbol is t26, which comes from NT28->t26. So the first non-terminal is NT28.\n\nBut the initial S splits into NT41 and NT23, or NT41 and NT58. So if the first symbol comes from NT28, which isn't part of the initial split, maybe the initial split is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because S is the start symbol, which must split into two non-terminals. If the initial split is NT41 and NT23, but the string starts with t26, which is from NT28, that's a problem because NT28 is not the left-hand side of S.\n\nAlternatively, if the initial split is NT41 and NT58, perhaps NT41 and NT58 can produce a t26 somewhere in their derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by following each production step by step.\n\nThe string is: [t26, t57, t59, t83, t7, t54, t33, t24, t26, t57, t8, t38, t8, t66, t64, t19, t26"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I notice the string is a sequence of literals separated by spaces. The literals are things like 't13', 't59', etc. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is on the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the non-terminals expand into terminals. For example, S is the start symbol, and it's defined as NT41 NT23. But I also see that non-terminals like NT23 directly produce terminal strings like 't83', and others expand into combinations of other non-terminals.\n\nThe key here is that the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, which means every part must be directly produced by some rule, or via intermediate steps where each step produces another non-terminal until we reach terminals all the way down.\n\nLet's start by looking at the given string:\n\nt13 t59 t19 t7 t24 t13 t8 t38 t8 t74 t24 t66 t9 t33 t24 t66 t24 t26 t57 t24 t81 t14 t8 t13 t13 t66 t33.\n\nThat's 28 elements. Now, let's see if each of these can be derived from some grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT41 NT23. Let's see what NT41 and NT23 produce.\n\nLooking at NT41:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nBut NT34 -> t26.\n\nNT49 -> t57.\n\nSo NT41 produces t26 and t57 in that order. So that's t26 t57.\n\nThen NT23 \u2192 't83'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT41 NT23 \u2192 t26 t57 t83.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t13, which is much earlier. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong production.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the non-terminals produce t13. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT41 -> t13. So NT41 can directly produce t13.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 -> NT35 NT15, and from there, we might get certain terminal symbols.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be split into parts that each correspond to individual productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by seeing which rules could match each sequence.\n\nStart with t13. From the grammar, that's directly produced by NT41.\n\nSo the string starts with t13. So the first production would be S \u2192 NT41 NT23, which would mean the first part is t13 (from NT41) and then the second non-terminal NT23.\n\nNT23 \u2192 't83', as I saw earlier. So the second part of the string after t13 should start with t83.\n\nLooking at the string: t13 t59 ... No, wait, the string after t13 is t59. That can't be t83. Hmm, that seems different.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the string is: t13 t59 t19 t7 t24 t13 t8 t38 t8 t74 t24 t66 t9 t33 t24 t66 t24 t26 t57 t24 t81 t14 t8 t13 t13 t66 t33.\n\nSo after t13 comes t59. Wait, t59 is a terminal. But in the grammar, any production ending with 't59' would have to come from a rule that ends with that. Looking at NT55, NT24: I don't recall any rule that directly ends with t59. Maybe I need to consider a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about S \u2192 NT41 NT23 is not the right path because the string starts with t13, which could come from NT41, but then the next symbol is t59, which doesn't seem to fit t83. So maybe this production isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another branch. Looking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15. NT35 \u2192 t62, and NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3. NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT36. NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31 NT23 (no, wait, the productions for NT38 are:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31. So NT38 would produce NT28 and NT31 in that order.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2. Let's see:\n\nIf NT28 is expanded, it would go through NT18, which has rules like NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT36, etc. This could get complicated, but perhaps it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be broken down by following each production step. Let's try to see if we can find a path through the grammar that constructs the string.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with t13. Looking at the grammar, NT41 \u2192 t13.\n\nSo the first part is NT41 \u2192 t13. Now, the next symbol after t13 is t59. So we need to see what comes next.\n\nBut wait, in the starting production S \u2192 NT41 NT23, the NT41 gives t13 and the NT23 gives t83. So the next symbol should be t83, but in the string, it's t59. That doesn't match. So perhaps this initial production is not the right way to parse the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated by a different production starting point. But since S is the start symbol, the entire string must be derived from S using the productions. So perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT55 NT22. Let's check NT55:\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27.\n\nIf NT22 is then expanded, let's see what happens. NT22 \u2192 NT52 NT5.\n\nNT52 can be multiple things. From the grammar, NT52 \u2192 NT12 NT37 or NT37 \u2192 NT58 NT32, or other options. This is getting complex; maybe trying to parse the entire string this way is too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to find if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar rules. Let's list all the symbols again:\n\nt13, t59, t19, t7, t24, t13, t8, t38, t8, t74, t24, t66, t9, t33, t24, t66, t24, t26, t57, t24, t81, t14, t8, t13, t13, t66, t33.\n\nWait, I notice 't14' later. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminal produces t14?\n\nLooking through the grammar entries, I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 t58, NT27 \u2192 terminal, etc. Wait, I don't see any production that directly produces t14. So t14 would have to come from a non-terminal that produces it via a series of expansion steps.\n\nLooking at NT14: Is there a rule for NT14? Scanning through, I don't see any production for NT14. Therefore, it's likely that the symbol 't14' cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar. Therefore, the string contains 't14', which is not derivable from the grammar because the grammar doesn't have a production for it. \n\nWait, but I need to check. Looking back, do I see any rules that end with 't14'? Let me go through each non-terminal:\n\n- NT58: produces 't17', 't58', 't74', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't64', 't63', etc.\n- NT59: produce 't19' directly.\n- NT24: many rules, but I don't see t14.\n- NT35: t62.\n- NT36: t26 and t9.\n- NT15: t71.\n- NT28: t26, t7, etc.\n- Wait, but earlier I thought NT28 was t26, but looking at the rules:\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2.\n\nBut NT18 can produce NT32 NT36. NT32 \u2192 t7, NT36 \u2192 t26, t9, etc. So NT28 would produce combinations of t7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-521","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal, where A, B, C are non-terminals. This should make parsing easier because each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, and eventually, all non-terminals get replaced by terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string I need to evaluate: `t26 t57 t59 t19 t7 t9 t33 t7 t84 t33 t7 t66 t24 t66 t7 t59 t19 t24 t22 t33 t7 t66 t7 t33 t7 t66 t7 t66`. It seems like a sequence of terminal symbols, each which correspond to symbols in the grammar. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me jot down the grammar rules to have them handy:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nWait, S can derive either NT41 plus NT23 or NT41 plus NT58. So the first step is to see which one of these applies to the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t26, and the last is t66. Let me note the structure of the grammar and see how each non-terminal resolves. It seems that each production splits into two non-terminals, so the string should split into pairs accordingly.\n\nLet's try to build the parse tree from the string. The string has 35 tokens, which is an odd number, so that's a bit confusing because each production replaces a non-terminal with two strings. Hmm, but perhaps I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, each production in Chomsky Normal Form is A \u2192 BC, so each step the number of symbols increases by one. Starting from S (1 symbol), after one step, it becomes 2 symbols (B and C). After the next step, each non-terminal is replaced, so the total could be 3, then 4, etc. So, actually, the depth of the parse tree will determine the number of symbols. The number of symbols in the derived string should be 2^n where n is the number of productions applied from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, but this might not be accurate because not all non-terminals might produce two terminals in each step. Wait, looking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the left of the arrows produces two non-terminals on the right. So, each production step increases the number of symbols by 1. Therefore, starting from S (1 symbol), after one step, we have 2 symbols. After each production, it's 2^n where n is the number of steps.\n\nBut wait, the length of the string here is 35 symbols. Let's see: 2^5 = 32, 2^6=64. 35 is between those. However, the string could have been expanded from S through multiple steps, but not all symbols might be terminals. So maybe the number of terminal symbols isn't tied directly to the exponent.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the string step by step using the grammar, starting from S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nNow, break down each of these non-terminals.\n\nNT41: NT41 is defined by a series of productions. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nThen, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\n\nAnd NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n\nAnd NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n\nAnd so on, until it reaches a terminal.\n\nWait, let me see. Let me attempt to fully expand NT41.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\n\nSo NT41 becomes NT26 NT49 NT49.\n\nThen NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59\n\nSo now, NT41 \u2192 NT15 NT59 NT49 NT49\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n\nSo now, NT41 \u2192 NT31 NT3 NT59 NT49 NT49\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT38 NT27\n\nSo, NT41 becomes NT38 NT27 NT3 NT59 NT49 NT49\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n\nThus, NT41 \u2192 NT28 NT32 NT27 NT3 NT59 NT49 NT49\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2\n\nSo NT41 becomes NT18 NT2 NT27 NT3 NT59 NT49 NT49\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n\nSo NT41 now is NT18 NT2 NT35 NT15 NT3 NT59 NT49 NT49\n\nFrom NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3 again.\n\nSo NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3 becomes NT31 NT3\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's look at the derivation of NT41.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in such grammars, each non-terminal might resolve into a specific terminal string, so perhaps I can map each non-terminal to its terminal equivalent.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps some non-terminals resolve to a sequence of 't's. For example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't58'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't22'\n\nAnd others. Wait, let me check all the terminals:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't63'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84' or 't32'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, actually, many of the non-terminals derive into a specific string of terminals. Maybe I should map each non-terminal to its production string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to see which non-terminals in the string have corresponding productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt26 t57 t59 t19 t7 t9 t33 t7 t84 t33 t7 t66 t24 t66 t7 t59 t19 t24 t22 t33 t7 t66 t7 t33 t7 t66 t7 t66\n\nLet me count how many terminals: Yes, 35 tokens.\n\nI should try to see if this string can be divided into pairs that correspond to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree starting from the root (S) and see if all tokens are generated.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the string starts with t26. Let's see which non-terminal starts with t26.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3, but looking at the terminals:\n\nWait, what is NT26's produce? NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59. Or, wait, looking at grammar:\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT26 is not directly a non-terminal; instead, it's resolved from other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals produce a terminal 't26'. Looking through the rules:\n\nYes, NT26 \u2192 't9'\n\nBut wait, that's in the last part: NT58 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't27'\n\nHmm, looking through all the terminals in the rules:\n\nWait, finding which NTs yield t26:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT15 NT59 (but NT15 is another non-terminal, not terminal)\n\nWait, is there a non-terminal that directly maps to 't26'? No, looking at the given rules, no. 't26' only appears as the output of NT58? Wait:\n\nWait, let's check each terminal:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't9'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't8'\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't22' (Wait, no, let's see.

{"custom_id":"request-523","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate whether it's generated by this grammar. First, I need to understand what the grammar looks like and how the string is structured. \n\nThe grammar consists of rules that define how non-terminals (like S, NT27, NT38, etc.) can be rewritten into terminals (like t13, t81, etc.) or other non-terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 t83, NT8 \u2192 t35, etc. The string I need to evaluate has several of these terminals, so I can start by trying to break down the string into its constituent parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t13 t59 t19 t26 t24 t38 t24 t13 t26 t57 t66 t81 t58 t62 t62 t62 t33 t24 t74 t7 t33 t7 t26 t57 t28 t33 t7 t66.\n\nFirst, I'll break the string into segments that might correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. Let's list the possible non-terminals and their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t13\n- NT58 \u2192 t17, but in the string, we have t58, so maybe another rule?\nWait, looking back, NT58 \u2192 t15 t24 is another production. Hmm, but I don't see NT15 mapping to t58 directly. Wait, in the rules, there's NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. But in the string, I see t58. Wait, another rule is NT25 (no, NT52?) Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24. But in the string, it's t58, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to trace back the non-terminals. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT41 | NT41 NT58\n- NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n- NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT32\n- NT33 \u2192 NT12 NT49 | NT36 NT26 | NT36 NT29\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT12 \u2192 NT32 NT16\n- NT8 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n- NT10 \u2192 NT12 NT42\n- NT18 \u2192 NT38 NT37 | NT32 NT36\n- NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 | NT34 NT49 maybe it's the same as previous? Or wait, looking again, NT41 has two productions: the first is NT34 NT49, and then later it says NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 again, maybe a typo? Or perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the NT41 productions are:\nS \u2192 NT41 NT41\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 again? Or is that a different rule? Maybe a mistake in the question, but perhaps it's a duplicate.\n\nContinuing, let's see the string: it starts with t13, which is NT41, so S must derive to something starting with NT41.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t13 (NT41), followed by t59. Hmm, t59 is a terminal\u2014let's see which non-terminal maps to t59. Looking through the rules, I don't see any production ending in t59 except perhaps NT31 \u2192 t38, NT5 \u2192 t5 NT43, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the given rules, NT58 \u2192 t15 t24, but in the string, it's t58. Hmm, maybe I need to look for a non-terminal that produces t58.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for how the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nLet me try to construct the parse tree.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT41 NT41 or NT41 NT58.\n\nLet's assume the string starts with NT41. So first part is t13, which is NT41. Then after t13, next token is t59. So after the first NT41 (t13), the second part should be another NT41 or NT58.\n\nWait, but in the first rule, S \u2192 NT41 NT41, so the string would start with NT41 (t13) followed by another NT41. The next token after t13 is t59, which is not t13, so maybe it's S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT41 NT58: first part is NT41 (t13), second part is NT58.\n\nNow, NT58 has production NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24.

Hmm, where do I start? Let's see, the grammar has a lot of productions, each of the form A -> BC, except for some that produce terminals. The string given is a sequence of t-terms, which I think are terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string into tokens. It looks like each word is a token, so the input string is:\n\nt13 t59 t83 t7 t54 t33 t7 t26 t57 t8 t24 t81 t26 t57 t8 t66 t37 t57 t66 t81 t58 t9 t66 t81 t58 t62 t71 t57 t33.\n\nThat's 33 tokens. Now, to check if this string can be generated by the grammar, I should see if it can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S can be rewritten as NT41 NT23. So the string must start with t13 (from NT41) followed by t83 (from NT23) because NT41 leads to t13 and NT23 leads to t83. Let me check the given string: the first token is t13, and the second is t59. Wait, that's not t83. So that's a problem. According to the grammar, S -> NT41 NT23, which expands to t13 followed by t83, right?\n\nSo the string starts with t13, then t59 instead of t83. That would mean the initial part is incorrect based on the grammar. So that's a red flag. Maybe the string isn't generated by this grammar. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Did I miscalculate the productions for NT23?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT23 -> 't83'. So after NT41 (t13), the next symbol should be t83. But in the string, after t13, it's t59. That would require that NT23 produces t59. But looking at the grammar, NT23 only goes to 't83'. So that's a direct contradiction. \n\nWait, could there be an error in my reasoning? Maybe the string isn't generated because the second part is wrong. Let me think again. The first production is S -> NT41 NT23. So the first two symbols should be the results of NT41 and NT23. NT41 gives t13, NT23 gives t83. So the first two tokens should be t13 t83, but the string has t13 t59. Therefore, it's impossible for this string to be generated by the given grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misreading the string tokens. Let me double-check. The given string is: t13 t59 t83... Hmm, no, it's t13 followed by t59. So the second token is t59, but according to the grammar, after t13 should come t83. So that's a mismatch. Therefore, the string is invalid under the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string does not match the initial productions of the grammar, as the second token should be t83 instead of t59.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-551","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite extensive, with several non-terminals and the rest of the productions leading to terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a context-free grammar (CFG) is and how it works. A CFG consists of four components: a set of terminals, non-terminals, start symbol, and production rules. In this case, the non-terminals are all the symbols except the terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. The string provided uses only these terminals, so the non-terminals can be expanded into these terminals using the production rules.\n\nThe string to check is: t26 t57 t71 t83 t7 t7 t13 t13 t66 t81 t58 t81 t58 t62 t33 t7 t38 t7 t38 t24 t66 t24 t38 t24 t66 t24 t66 t7 t84 t33.\n\nI notice that this string has 33 tokens. Each production rule in the grammar breaks down a non-terminal into two terminals or non-terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal symbol.\n\nMy approach will be to reverse-engineer the string by trying to see if it can be constructed starting from the start symbol S. Each step would involve splitting the string into two parts according to the production rules until everything is reduced to terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. From the given grammar, S -> NT41 NT23. So S is derived from two non-terminals: NT41 and NT23.\n\nLooking up the productions for NT41 and NT23:\n- NT41 -> NT34 NT49\n- NT23 -> 't83'\n\nWait, NT23 directly produces the terminal 't83', so that's the end of that path. For NT41, it splits into NT34 and NT49.\n\nNow, NT34 and NT49 need to be expanded:\n- NT34 -> NT26 NT49\n- NT49 -> 't57'\n\nSo NT34 splits into NT26 and NT49. NT26 expands into 't63', and NT49 is 't57'. So NT34 becomes t63 t57.\n\nPutting that back into NT41, which is NT34 NT49: t63 t57 't57'?\n\nWait, no, NT41 is NT34 NT49. NT34 is 't63' 't57', and NT49 is 't57'. So NT41 is 't63' 't57' 't57'? Hmm, that seems to produce three terminals from NT41, but the production for a non-terminal in a CFG can only directly produce two symbols. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Each production in the grammar can only have two sides. So when expanding, each step only replaces one non-terminal with two others or terminals. So the string t26 t57 appears at the beginning. Looking at the productions, which non-terminals produce 't26' and 't57'? From the list, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> 't26' (because NT26 is 't26'? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, I need to look for terminal symbols in the productions. Wait, the grammar ends with some productions, but perhaps I should list all the terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are the ones that appear as the results of productions. For example:\n- NT41 -> 't13'\n- NT34 -> 't26' and 't49'\nWait, no:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals are 't26', 't57', 't71', 't83', 't7', 't81', 't58', etc. So each production ends with a terminal or leads to a terminal.\n\nSo, NT26 must produce 't26'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT28 -> 't26' but also NT28 -> NT38 NT31. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> 't33' 't26' is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a more accurate parse tree.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nLet me try to construct the parse tree starting from the start symbol.\n\nStep 1: S -> NT41 NT23\nSo the string starts with NT41 and ends with NT23.\n\nSo, the string is S: t... t83 (since NT23 -> t83).\n\nWait, but the given string is 33 tokens, so we can represent it as S: ... (left side) ... t23.\n\nSo, S is built from NT41 and NT23. So the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT41 and NT23, which is t83 at the end.\n\nSo, the string must be S: left side (from NT41) followed by t83.\n\nSo the left part before t83 should come from NT41.\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nSo the left part is the expansion of NT41, which is N34 and N49.\n\nSo, the string is [NT34 NT49] t83.\n\nNow, NT49 -> 't57', so that's straightforward.\n\nNT34 -> NT26 NT49.\n\nSo, NT34 is [NT26 NT49], and NT49 is 't57'.\n\nSo, the string becomes [NT26 NT49] 't57' 't83'.\n\nBut 't49' is a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, let's check.\n\nWait, the terminals in the grammar are the 't' followed by a number, but we need to see which 't' terms exist.\n\nLooking through the productions, each production either produces a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo for example, NT41 -> t13, etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT34 -> t26 t49 (is that correct?)\nWait, no:\n\nI need to look through the productions:\n\nLooking at NT34:\n\nWait, actually, the productions provided are a mix of grammar rules and terminal productions, but it's a bit hard to parse. It might be better to list all terminal productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the given string step by step, breaking it down into possible rule applications.\n\nLooking at the given string: t26 t57 t71 t83 t7 t7 t13 t13 t66 t81 t58 t81 t58 t62 t33 t7 t38 t7 t38 t24 t66 t24 t38 t24 t66 t24 t66 t7 t84 t33.\n\nI'll try to split the string into chunks according to grammar rules.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t26, which is a terminal produced by, for example, NT28 or NT32? Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see NT28 -> t26?\n\nWait, in the grammar provided:\n\nLooking for the production for NT26: no, because NT26 appears as a terminal in NT24 -> t33, but that's a production to a terminal, so NT24 produces 't33' and 't26' maybe.\n\nWait, looking through, NT28->'t26'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nIn the part where NT28 -> 't26', is that correct? Wait, no. Wait, in the given grammar, the production is:\n\n- NT28 -> 't33' 't26' is not. Wait, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify. The last part of the grammar includes:\n\nNT24 -> 't33' 't26'\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, in the latter part, I see lines like:\n\nNT24 -> 't33' 't26'\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar is presented as a list, and each line might have a production. Let's go down the list:\n\nFor example, later lines:\n\nNT26 -> NT38 NT31\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to focus on the given string and try to see if it can be split according to possible productions.\n\nGiven that, let's see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-552","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no\u2014actually, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, right? Or is it exactly two symbols, at least one being a non-terminal? I might be mixing this up, but looking at the given rules, I see rules like S -> NT41 NT23. So it's two non-terminals. Then, for example, NT23 is a non-terminal that produces 't83'. So NT23 -> 't83' is a terminal production. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of t's followed by numbers. Each of these is either a terminal or corresponds to a non-terminal. My task is to parse the string according to the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the given grammar rules and the string.\n\nThe grammar rules are a bunch of NT's and S producing other NTs and sometimes terminals. Some non-terminals are clearly terminals because they have rules that produce 't' followed by a number, like NT23 -> 't83', or NT8 -> 't35', etc.\n\nThe string is: t13 t38 t63 t19 t7 t54 t33 t7 t66 t64 t19 t26 t7 t38 t7 t66 t7 t17 t7 t33 t24 t84 t33 t7 t38 t7 t33 t24 t84 t33.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation will split the string into two parts, each of which must be a terminal or a non-terminal that can produce that part.\n\nBut wait, the string is all terminals, so each part must be matched by a terminal production. So the string should be a series of terminals that can be derived from the starting symbols.\n\nBut starting from S, the grammar's top symbol is S. So the entire string should be derivable starting from S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the only rules are S -> NT41 NT23 and maybe others? Let me check. From the given rules, S appears only in two productions:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\n\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo two options: either NT41 followed by NT23 or NT41 followed by NT58.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT41 itself has two possible derivations. Let me trace that.\n\nNT41 can be either NT34 NT49 (from the rule NT41 -> NT34 NT49) or NT43 (from NT41 -> NT34 NT49? Wait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, in the rules, it says:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nWait, but in the initial context, the user says the grammar is in CNF, so all rules should be of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49. So that's two non-terminals. So this is a production with two non-terminals.\n\nThen, the terminals are on other sides, like NT23 -> 't83', etc.\n\nSo to parse the given string, we can try to break it down starting from S.\n\nSince the string starts with t13, let's see which non-terminal can produce t13.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT84 is a non-terminal that produces t74 (NT43 -> t62?), wait no. Wait, let me go through the list:\n\nLooking for a non-terminal whose terminal production includes t13.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for 't13' in NT rules.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't58'\n\nNT3 -> 't64'\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT8 -> 't35'\n\nNT23 -> 't83'\n\nNT58 -> 't17'\n\nNT43 -> 't62'\n\nNT36 -> 't9'\n\nNT28 -> 't26'\n\nNT36 -> 't22'\n\nNT24 -> 't49'\n\nNT24 -> 't33'\n\nNT2 -> 't33'\n\nNT15 -> 't59'\n\nNT34 -> 't26'\n\nNT35 -> 't62'\n\nNT36 -> 't63'\n\nNT42 -> 't11'\n\nNT24 -> 't27'\n\nNT7 -> 't58'\n\nNT41 -> 't13'\n\nSo, NT41 can produce 't13'. So in the string, the first symbol is t13, which comes from NT41.\n\nSo that suggests that the first part comes from NT41. Now, the rule for NT41 is NT41 -> NT34 NT49. So we need to split into two parts, NT34 and NT49, each of which must generate the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t13, so the first part is N13, which is 't13', and then the next symbol is 't38', which would come from NT38.\n\nLooking at NT38, from the rules, there's NT38 -> NT28 NT23. So NT38 produces two non-terminals, NT28 and NT23.\n\nSo, after t13, the next symbol is t38, which comes from NT38. So now we have:\n\nt13 from NT41 -> NT34 NT49\n\nThen, t38 comes from NT38 -> NT28 NT23\n\nNow, we need to process the next symbols after t13 and t38, which are t63 and t19, etc.\n\nWait, the string is t13 t38 t63 t19 t7 t54 t33 t7 t66 t64 t19 t26 t7 t38 t7 t66 t7 t17 t7 t33 t24 t84 t33 t7 t38 t7 t33 t24 t84 t33.\n\nSo, after t38, the next two symbols are t63 and t19. Since the derivation from NT38 and NT41 must produce t38, then the next part after that is 't63 t19', etc.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should approach it by trying to see if the entire string can be divided into sequences that match the grammar, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree from the start symbol, trying to match the string step by step.\n\nSo, starting with S, which can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let's explore both options.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT41 NT23\n\nFrom above, NT41 -> NT34 NT49, and NT23 -> 't83'.\n\nSo, this would generate 't13' (from NT41) followed by 't83' (from NT23). But the string starts with t13 t38, not t13 t83. So this path doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT41 NT58\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49 and NT58 -> 't17' (from NT58 -> 't17?

{"custom_id":"request-568","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) are structured in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and a single non-terminal on the right. The string we're checking has a mix of non-terminals (like S, NT27, etc.) and terminals (the 't' followed by numbers like 't26', 't57', etc.). In CNF, each production leads directly to either a terminal or another non-terminal, so that fits.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t26 t57 t59 t19 t7 t7 t38 t7 t38 t63 t19 t26 t7 t17 t24 t33 t7 t33 t24 t26 t57 t24 t81 t66 t65 t33 t7 t84 t33 t24 t38`.\n\nI need to parse this string from left to right using the grammar. Starting with the start symbol S, which according to the grammar can produce 'NT27 NT41 NT23' or 'NT27 NT58'. Hmm, but looking at the string, it starts with 't26', which doesn't directly correspond to either of those.\n\nWait, each production in CNF leads directly to another symbol. The initial S in the grammar produces two NTs, so the string should start with the non-terminals generated from these NTs. Alternatively, the string starts with terminals, which suggests that perhaps the S is being expanded into a sequence of NT combinations that eventually produce those terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that certain non-terminals have productions that end in terminals. For example, NT5's production is NT5 -> NT5 NT43, and NT43 is NT16 NT7. NT16 then becomes 't81', and so on. But the initial steps might be more complicated.\n\nLet me try to see which NTs can generate 't26'. Checking the rules, NT28 -> NT38 NT31, and NT38 -> NT28 NT32, which might not directly lead to 't26'. Wait, NT28 is transformed into NT38 and NT31. Let's check NT28's rules: NT28 -> NT38 NT31, NT38 -> NT28 NT32, and NT36 in another place splits into NT33 and NT26, but NT36 isn't shown here. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NT24 because 't26' appears in NT24's production: NT24 -> NT23 NT28, and NT28 includes 't26'. Maybe through expanding NT28. But NT28 is also transformed into NT38 and NT31, so perhaps I need to trace back.\n\nAnother approach is to see the entire string and see if it can be split into a sequence of non-terminals that expand into those terminals. The string has 35 tokens, which is quite a lot.\n\nLet me try to outline possible non-terminals that produce each 't' token:\n\nLooking at the terminals:\n\nt26: appears multiple times. Looking at the grammar, NT28's rule can produce t26 via NT28 -> ... -> 't26'. Similarly, NT36 -> NT26, but I don't see that in the given rules. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom NT36: NT36 -> NT33 NT26 and NT28, but looking at the given rules, NT28 includes 't26' directly. So if I have NT28, I can get 't26'.\n\nSimilarly, t57: NT49's production is NT49 -> NT39... but no, let me check: NT43 -> NT16 NT7, and NT16 -> 't81'. So t57 could come from NT49 if that exists, but in the given grammar, NT49 only appears as NT41 -> NT34 NT49. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT43's rule: NT43 -> NT16 NT7. NT16 is 't81', and NT7 is 't58', but wait, in the given rules, NT77 isn't a thing, but NT7's rule: NT7 -> 't62'. Hmm, so NT7 becomes 't62'. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT7 -> 't62'. But looking through the given rules, no, NT7 is not in the higher levels. Wait, checking the top-level rules:\n\nNT7 is shown as `NT7 -> 't62'`.\n\nSo NT7 produces 't62', but in other rules, like S -> ... etc. No, the given grammar includes NT7 pointing to 't62'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see each 't' token and see which NT can produce it.\n\nt26: can be NT24 (since in NT24's rules, I see 't26' as a terminal, but looking back, in the given rules, NT24 -> NT23 NT28, and NT28 has a rule that eventually includes 't26'. So perhaps NT24 can eventually produce 't26'.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, specifically:\n\nNT24 can only be derived from NT23 or NT33 in other layers, but looking through, NT24 has a production that leads to 't26', so maybe NT24 is directly connected to 't26'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe it's better to work step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't26', so I need to find an NT that can produce 't26' as a terminal. Looking through the rules, the only way to get 't26' is through NT24 because NT24's production includes 't26' as a result of NT28 and other expansions.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nNT28's rules include 't26', so if NT28 can be expanded to 't26', then yes. But how? Because NT28's rule is NT28 -> NT38 NT31, and NT38's rules are NT38 -> NT28 NT32, which seems cyclical. But then, NT28 can also be expanded via other rules?\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to look for which NT can directly produce each 't' token in the string.\n\nLet me list all the 't's and see how they could be generated:\n\nt26: NT24\nt57: Looking at the grammar, NT49 -> NT39...? Wait, no, in the given rules, NT42's rules include 't57', because NT42's production is NT42 -> NT8 NT52, and NT8 is 't33', and NT52's rules include 't57', so yes, NT52 can produce 't57'.\n\nWait, yes, for example, NT52 -> NT12 NT37, and NT37 can produce 't57'.\n\nWait, let me check: NT37 has two rules, one is NT37 -> 't58' and another is NT37 -> 't41' NT10. But in the grammar, NT37 also has NT37 -> NT58 NT32, which may lead to 't58' as a terminal, but perhaps through expansion.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be broken down into the grammar's rules.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string's length makes sense. Each production in CNF can increase the number of symbols, but the total number of steps depends on the grammar. The given string is 35 symbols long, which suggests at least several steps of expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a CYK algorithm or similar parsing method, but since I'm supposed to reason it out, I'll try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the entire string, I notice that it starts with 't26', which implies the leftmost non-terminal must expand to 't26'. Let's see which NT can produce 't26' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT24 has a rule that leads to 't26' directly via NT24 -> NT23 NT28. But wait, that's not direct. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT24's production includes 't26', but no, looking at the grammar, NT24 is defined as:\n\nNT24 -> NT23 NT28\n\nAnd NT28 is defined as:\n\nNT28 -> NT38 NT31, NT38 -> NT28 NT32, NT28 -> NT32, etc.\n\nWait, wait, no"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-566","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, first, I should probably understand what the grammar is and what the string looks like.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a set of productions where each non-terminal on the left side of an arrow produces two non-terminals on the right. And some of these non-terminals are terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by a number, like 't26', 't38', etc. Each of these terminals is a single character, and the productions seem to break down larger non-terminals into smaller ones until they reach these terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t26 t57 t71 t83 t7 t24 t84 t33 t7 t38 t7 t66 t7 t38 t24 t26 t57 t8 t22 t71 t19 t63 t7 t81 t59 t33 t7 t33 t7 t84 t33`.\n\nAlright, so my approach should be to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing in CNF is usually done with a top-down approach, maybe using the CYK algorithm, but since I'm dealing with a small string, I can try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S can derive into NT41 NT23 and also NT41 NT58. So, the string starts with S, which splits into two parts. Each part is derived from one of these productions.\n\nSo, the string is a concatenation of two parts. Let's split the string into two parts of equal length if possible. The entire string has 33 tokens. Hmm, 33 is an odd number, but each production splits into two symbols. Wait, that might not add up. Let me check: Each production of S is two symbols, so the string must be a concatenation of two such sequences. But the string length is 33, which is odd, meaning that the two parts might not have the same length. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should not split it yet. Let's see what the entire string looks like when broken down into the non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for production rules that match the string step by step.\n\nBut the start symbol is S, so let's see what S can produce. The possible productions are S \u2192 NT41 NT23 and S \u2192 NT41 NT58. So, let's see which of these could be part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t26. Let's check if any of the NT symbols derive directly to t26. Looking through the production rules:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n- NT38 \u2192 NT32 NT37\n- NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT7...\nWait, maybe that's not directly leading to t26. Let me check all production rules for NTs that derive to t26.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28 (so, production 9)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 (production 7)\n- NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT7 (from NT38 \u2192 NT32 NT31, which is production 13, so via NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT7 (I think not, maybe I'm mixing up). Wait, NT31 is defined as NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 (no, that's NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3). Wait, this might get too confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for where each t token appears. Let's see:\n\nLooking at each t in the string: t26 appears multiple times, t57 appears twice, t71 and t83 once, t7 once, t24 once, t84, t33, etc.\n\nLooking at the production rules, t26 is derived from NT28 via NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31? Or wait, NT28 \u2192 NT23 NT28? Wait, no. Let me list the relevant production rules:\n\nWait, the production rules for NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 (production 7). NT31: NT31 \u2192 NT38 NT7 (I don't see this in the given list, maybe I missed it). Wait, in the provided productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 (production 7)\n- NT31 \u2192 not explicitly listed except where used in other productions, like NT15 \u2192 NT31 NT3 (production 15), and NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 (but NT58 might produce terminal or non-terminals).\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if t26 can be derived from any NT.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NTs with t26 as their terminal: NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, and perhaps other rules where NTx eventually produces t26.\n\nWait, looking again: NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28, which eventually could lead to NT23 producing 't83' and NT28 perhaps leading to 't26'?\n\nWait, NT23 is defined as 't83', so if NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28, then it would produce t83 followed by whatever NT28 produces. If NT28 can produce t26, then part of the string could be t83 t26.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if any NT directly produces t26. Looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t26. So it must be derived indirectly through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, in the production rules, NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28 (production 9). NT23 is 't83', so that part is clear. NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 (production 7). Now, NT38 \u2192 NT32 NT37 (production 8), and NT37 can produce either 't84' or 't58' (productions 11 and 37, respectively).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting somewhere. Let's try to construct a possible derivation.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start from the given string and see if it can be reduced by the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the possible sequences in the string and see if they match any of the productions.\n\nLet me look for t26 at the beginning. So, the string starts with t26, which could be derived from NT28 since in the production NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31, and perhaps NT38 or NT31 can produce t26 through their rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should start with the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nLet me check if the string starts with NT41 and NT23, or if it starts with NT41 and NT58.\n\nThe string starts with t26 t57 t71 t83... So, the first token is t26, which would have to come from the first NT in either S \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the first part of the string should start with NT41. But NT41's productions are: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49 (from production 4), NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49 (from production 34), etc. So NT41 can produce t26 and NT49.\n\nWait, NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49 (looking at the production rules: NT34 is rule 34: NT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49. So NT34 can produce t26 and NT49. NT49 can produce t49, which may be a terminal? Wait, no, looking back, 't49' is a terminal? Or perhaps NT49 is a non-terminal. Wait, in the production rules, I see NT49 derived as NT42 \u2192 NT49 in rule 15 (wait, no, looking again, the production 15: NT42 \u2192 NT49... Hmm, perhaps not. Let me list the production rules involving 't49' etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach this step by step, trying to split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet's try to break down the string into possible sequences.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo, the string is a concatenation of the derivations from NT41 and NT23.\n\nNT23 is a terminal 't83', so the second part of the string must start with 't83', but looking at the string, after 't26' comes 't57', which doesn't match 't83'.

{"custom_id":"request-580","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Hmm, the string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: \n\nt13 t71 t83 t7 t7 t26 t57 t7 t81 t37 t57 t66 t81 t58 t62 t66 t63 t57 t33 t7 t66 t24 t66 t7 t84 t33 t24 t13 t26 t57 t66 t33.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, except the start symbol which can have two. Looking at the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and it's defined as:\nS -> NT41 NT23\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo every string derived from S must consist of two parts, each part being a sequence of terminals generated by the NT productions.\n\nEach NT production is in the form of NTxy -> NTab NTcd, except for the base cases where NTxy produces a terminal string. For example, NT8 -> 't35' means this NT can directly produce 't35'.\n\nThe string starts with t13, which I need to trace back through the grammar. Let's see which NT can produce t13. Looking through the rules, I see NT41 -> 't13'. So NT41 must be one part of the string.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't13', which is from NT41. So the first part after processing S must be NT41, and the second part must be NT23 or NT58, since S can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nLet's see if 't13' can be the first part. Then the second part would come from either NT23 or NT58.\n\nLooking at NT23 -> 't83'. So if the second part is NT23, the string would start with t13 t83. But in the string, after t13, the next token is t71. So that's not possible. Therefore, the second part must be NT58.\n\nSo the string must start with NT41 -> t13, followed by NT58 -> t71 (since looking at the NT58 production, I see NT58 -> 't71' as a rule. So the first two tokens are t13 t71.\n\nNow, the full string starts with t13 t71, so that checks out for the initial two parts.\n\nNext, we need to see how the remaining string can be formed. Let's break down the string into the parts:\n\nThe full string is:\n\nt13 t71 t83 t7 t7 t26 t57 t7 t81 t37 t57 t66 t81 t58 t62 t66 t63 t57 t33 t7 t66 t24 t66 t7 t84 t33 t24 t13 t26 t57 t66 t33.\n\nLet's list this as segments:\n\n- t13 t71\n- t83 t7 t7 t26 t57 t7 t81 t37 t57 t66 t81 t58 t62 t66 t63 t57\n- t33 t7 t66 t24 t66 t7 t84 t33 t24 t13 t26 t57 t66 t33\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each part as a separate expansion of NT41 and NT58.\n\nStarting with NT41, which is 't13'. Then NT58, which is 't71'. So the start of the string is good.\n\nNow, after t13 t71, the next part in the string is t83 t7 t7 t26 t57 t7 t81 t37 t57 t66 t81 t58 t62 t66 t63 t57.\n\nThis is the continuation from NT58 (which is t71). Wait, no. Wait, the overall string is derived from S, which splits into two parts: either NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nSo the initial part is NT41 (t13) followed by either NT23 or NT58 (t71). The rest of the string comes from NT23 and NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the entire string as the concatenation of two parts: one generated by NT41 and the other by NT58, or one generated by NT41 and the other by NT58. But looking at the string, after t13 t71, we have more tokens that need to be generated by either NT23 or NT58. But wait, after NT58, the production splits into other NTs.\n\nThis might get complicated, so perhaps a better approach is to consider that the entire string is a concatenation of the two expansions from S, each starting with NT41 followed by either NT23 or NT58.\n\nBut the string is starting with t13 (NT41) and then t71 (which is NT58, so that's the second part from NT58). So the string is formed by NT41's expansion followed by NT58's expansion.\n\nSo we need to check if the rest of the string (after t13 t71) can be generated by the expansion of NT23 and NT58, each starting from their respective points.\n\nWait, no. Because after NT41 and NT58, each of those can produce multiple tokens. So the entire string is the concatenation of the two parts. Let me see.\n\nThe string starts with t13 t71, so that's the start. Then, after that, it's t83 t7 t7 t26 t57 t7 t81 t37 t57 t66 t81 t58 t62 t66 t63 t57, and then another part.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be represented as the concatenation of two parts, each derived from NT41 and NT58 respectively.\n\nSo, let's try to parse the string into two parts:\n\nPart 1: t13 t71 t83 t7 t7 t26 t57 t7 t81 t37 t57 t66 t81 t58 t62 t66 t63 t57\n\nPart 2: t33 t7 t66 t24 t66 t7 t84 t33 t24 t13 t26 t57 t66 t33\n\nWait, but the string is only one string, so it's not clear if it's two separate expansions. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is a single sequence of NT productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree. Let's try to model the derivation.\n\nThe entire string is a sequence of t's, each corresponding to a terminal. We need to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe initial rule is S -> NT41 NT23 or S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nFirst, take S and derive NT41 followed by NT23 or NT58. Let's consider the first option: S -> NT41 NT23.\n\nThen NT41 can be 't13' (since NT41->'t13' is a terminal production). So the first token is t13.\n\nNext, NT23 can be 't83' (since NT23->'t83') as a terminal production. So the second token is t83.\n\nBut the string starts with t13 t71, so this doesn't match NT23. Therefore, S must be expanding to NT41 NT58.\n\nSo S -> NT41 NT58.\n\nThen NT41 is 't13', and NT58 is 't58' (since NT58->'t58' is a terminal production). But in the string, the second token is t71, not t58. So that's a problem. Wait, no, because NT58 has more productions. Let me check the rules for NT58.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT58 can be 't71' or 't15' followed by something. Because NT58 -> 't71' is a direct production, and also NT58 -> NT15 NT24. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT58 -> 't71' is a production.\n\nBut also, looking at the list:\n\nNT58 -> 't71' and NT58 -> NT15 NT24.\n\nSo NT58 can produce either 't71' or an expansion involving NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-579","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should recall how CNF works. In CNF, every non-terminal expands to exactly two non-terminals, except for terminals, which are the leaves of the parse tree. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing, and algorithms like theCYK algorithm can efficiently check if a string is in the language of a given CNF grammar.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of production rules. Let me list out the non-terminals and their productions to get a better overview:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23 or S \u2192 NT41 NT58\nNT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\nNT34 \u2192 NT26 NT49\n...\nI notice that the non-terminals are numbered, and each production is either a combination of two other non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Most of the non-terminals seem to have two productions, each leading to two other non-terminals, except some that directly go to a terminal when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe string to be evaluated is: `t13 t59 t83 t26 t7 t26 t57 t7 t81 t10 t7 t81 t74 t24 t33 t7 t13 t24 t81 t11 t33 t7 t13 t8 t35 t37 t57 t33 t24 t66 t7 t66`\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't13'. Let's check the grammar for the production that directly gives 't13'. Scanning through, I see NT41 \u2192 't13'. So, NT41 could produce 't13'. \n\nNow, I need to see how the entire string can be derived from S. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens:\n\nt13, t59, t83, t26, t7, t26, t57, t7, t81, t10, t7, t81, t74, t24, t33, t7, t13, t24, t81, t11, t33, t7, t13, t8, t35, t37, t57, t33, t24, t66, t7, t66.\n\nI start with S, which can go to NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT41 NT23.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't13', which is NT41's terminal. Now, I need to find what comes after. The second part is 't59', which could be NT58's terminal? Wait, looking back at the grammar, NT58 \u2192 't14' or 't74'? Wait, let's check:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT58 has two productions: NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 or NT58 \u2192 't74'. Oh, wait, no, in the grammar provided, NT58 \u2192 NT15 NT24 and NT58 \u2192 't17'. Similarly, NT24 has several productions. Hmm, perhaps I should list all the NTs with their terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT41 NT23, and the string starts with t13 (NT41's terminal), then we have NT41 and NT23. The second token is 't59'. Looking at NT23's productions, I see NT23 \u2192 't83'. So that's good because the second token is 't83'.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT41 NT23 produces t13 t83. The string starts with t13 t59... Wait, no, the second token is 't59' not 't83'. Oh, that's a problem. Because NT23 \u2192 't83', but the string's second token is 't59', which must come from NT59's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused NT58 and NT59. Let me check: Looking at the grammar, I see NT58 has productions, but 't59' is the terminal for NT59? Or maybe I'm getting the NTs mixed up.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some NTs produce terminals, like NT41 \u2192 't13', NT23 \u2192 't83', NT8 \u2192 't35', etc. Then, other NTs branch into non-terminals.\n\nSo, for the string:\n\n1. t13: must come from NT41\n2. t59: which NT produces t59? Let's check the grammar. Looking through, I see NT30 \u2192 't37', NT59 \u2192 't19' maybe? Wait, let me see the full list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NTs with terminals are:\n\nNT41 \u2192 't13'\nNT23 \u2192 't83'\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT34 \u2192 't26'\nNT35 \u2192 't62'\nNT36 \u2192 't9'\nNT37 \u2192 't84' (I think I saw that)\nNT5 \u2192 't66'\nNT57 \u2192 't57'? Wait, no, looking at NT58 \u2192 't74' and NT24 \u2192 't63'. Wait, wait, no, the terminals are listed as something ending with 't'. Like 't13', 't59', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can identify the NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT34 \u2192 't26' and NT36 \u2192 't9', NT37 \u2192 't84' and 't62' maybe?\nWait, looking through the grammar again:\n\nLet me list all NTs with terminals:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't13'\n- NT23 \u2192 't83'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT28 \u2192 't7' (I think, looking at production NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 and NT28 \u2192 't7')\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nYes, looking further, I see NT28 \u2192 't7'. So NT28 produces 't7'.\n\nSimilarly, NT37 \u2192 't84' and 't62'? Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't84' and NT37 \u2192 't62'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't84' (line: NT37 -> 't84')\n- NT37 \u2192 't62' (line: NT37->'t62'? Wait, no, NT37 has two productions: NT37\u2192 't84' and NT37\u2192 't62'? Wait, the grammar provided has NT37 \u2192 't84' and NT37 \u2192 't62'?\n\nWait, no, looking again at the grammar, it's:\n\nNT37 -> 't84'\nand later:\nNT37 -> 't62'\n\nHmm, that's unusual because that would mean NT37 \u2192 't84' OR NT37 \u2192 't62'? But wait, in context-free grammars, a production is a rule, so perhaps NT37 has multiple productions, some leading to terminals and others to non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let's look:\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT37 -> 't84'\nand\nNT37 -> 't62'\n\nWait, that's two separate productions. So, when deriving, if NT37 can go to 't84' or 't62', which means the string could have 't84' or 't62' when NT37 is expanded.\n\nBut in the string, one of the tokens is 't59', which isn't a terminal I see in the grammar. Wait, is there an NT that produces 't59'? Because in the string provided, there's a 't59', but looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't59'. Or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar rules. I might have missed some NT that goes to a terminal like 't59'.

{"custom_id":"request-591","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every production is either a two-symbol non-terminal transformation or a terminal. That should help in parsing.\n\nThe grammar given has a bunch of productions. I notice that some non-terminals on the right-hand side have terminals, like S \u2192 NT41 NT23, where NT41 and NT23 might expand to terminals. Wait, actually, looking closer, some right-hand sides have both non-terminals and terminals, like NT23 \u2192 't83'. So that makes NT23 a non-terminal that directly translates to the terminal 't83'. Similarly, others like NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43 might mean that NT5 can expand into NT5 (which is itself) followed by NT43.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t13 t38 t63 t19 t7 t7 t13 t8 t14 t24 t81 t26 t57 t13 t66 t33 t7 t26 t57 t24 t81 t8 t17 t7 t66 t81 t58 t81 t58 t62 t59 t57 t33`.\n\nThat's quite a long string. I'll list it as tokens for clarity:\n\n['t13', 't38', 't63', 't19', 't7', 't7', 't13', 't8', 't14', 't24', 't81', 't26', 't57', 't13', 't66', 't33', 't7', 't26', 't57', 't24', 't81', 't8', 't17', 't7', 't66', 't81', 't58', 't81', 't58', 't62', 't59', 't57', 't33']\n\nSo each token is a terminal. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step increases the number of symbols by one, except for the direct terminal productions. The string starts with 't13', so I need to check which non-terminal can produce 't13'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 't13' (from NT41's rule: NT41 -> 't13')\n\nSo NT41 can directly produce 't13', which matches the first token. So that position is covered by NT41.\n\nNow, let's see where NT41 is used. Looking at S's productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- So S uses NT41 and NT23, which together produce 't13' and another terminal. Wait, but the second non-terminal, NT23, in the input is also 't23'? Wait, looking at the string, the next token after 't13' is 't38', then 't63', etc. Wait, let me reindex.\n\nWait, the first token is 't13' (from NT41). The second token is 't38', which must come from NT23. Because in the production S \u2192 NT41 NT23, so after 't13', the next symbol comes from NT23. So NT23 must produce 't38'.\n\nLooking at the NT23 productions:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't83' (from line: NT23 -> 't83')\n\nWait, that's only one production. So NT23 can only expand directly to 't83'. But in the input, the next token after 't13' is 't38', not 't83'. So that's a problem. Because NT23 directly produces 't83', which is different from 't38'. \n\nSo if NT23 can only produce 't83', and the input has 't38' next, that would not match. Therefore, the string as a whole would not be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in looking up the productions. Let's check the NT23 rows:\n\nLooking back: Yes, there's a line NT23 -> 't83'. No other production for NT23. So NT23 can only be 't83'. So if the input starts with 't13', followed by 't38', that's incompatible with NT23.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I look at the string provided: \"t26 t57 t71 t19 t7 t24 t26 t57 t7 t81 t37 t57 t66 t62 t81 t58 t9 t57 t33 t24 t66 t24 t38 t7 t84 t33 t24 t38 t7 t74 t7 t33 t24 t38\".\n\nI notice that all the elements are separated by spaces, so each symbol is a separate token. The non-terminals in the grammar are things like S, NT27, NT38, etc., and some terminals are strings like 't26', which might correspond to a production ending in that terminal.\n\nI think the first step is to see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals according to the rules. Since each production is in CNF, each production is exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, actually, in CNF, each rule is A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, some rules have two non-terminals, and others have a terminal as their right side. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT42 is a rule, so that's a production with two symbols on the RHS. Similarly, NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15 is another. But some terminals are single symbols, like NT33 \u2192 't26' or 't9' or 't62'.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, in the grammar, some right-hand sides are terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT41 NT42 is a rule with two non-terminals on the RHS. But then, other rules like NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43 are both non-terminals. However, there are also productions where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, for example NT33 \u2192 't26', meaning that NT33 can derive the terminal 't26'.\n\nWait, but actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. So in the grammar, NT55, for example, is defined as NT55 \u2192 NT5 NT43. So each production is two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut now, the string starts with 't26 t57 ...', which are all terminals. So the first step is to see how these terminals are derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the string again for clarity:\n\nt26, t57, t71, t19, t7, t24, t26, t57, t7, t81, t37, t57, t66, t62, t81, t58, t9, t57, t33, t24, t66, t24, t38, t7, t84, t33, t24, t38, t7, t74, t7, t33, t24, t38.\n\nWait, I think I need to parse this string step by step using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be a derivation starting from S. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, 't26'. In the grammar, 't26' is a terminal, and looking at the rules, NT24 \u2192 't26', and other rules where 't26' is a terminal. For example, NT58 \u2192 't26', and several others.\n\nSo the first symbol, 't26', can be produced by any of the non-terminals that have 't26' as a production. Looking at the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 't26', and also NT24 is also a left-hand side of other productions, like NT24 \u2192 't33' and so on.\n\nWait, actually, let me look at all the productions where a terminal is listed:\n\n- S \u2192 ...

For example, 't26' is produced by NT24, NT28, and NT36. Similarly, 't57' is produced by NT49, which is a non-terminal.\n\nSo the first step is to see how 't26' can be derived from the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT41 NT42.\n\nSo from S, we get NT41 and NT42. Now, we need to see what each of these can produce.\n\nFirst, let's consider NT41. Looking at the rules, NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49. So NT41 produces two non-terminals, NT34 and NT49.\n\nNT34: NT34 \u2192 't26' (from the rules, NT34 \u2192 't26'). So NT34 can directly produce 't26'.\n\nNT49: NT49 \u2192 't57' directly.\n\nSo, from NT41, we can derive 't26' and 't57'.\n\nThen, the second symbol generated from S's production is NT42.

Wait, no, looking again, perhaps I confused it. Let me check:\n\nWait, the production for NT28 is listed as NT28 -> NT38 NT31. Also, looking further, I see NT28's other production is not 't26' directly. Wait, no, in the rules above, I think I might have mixed up some. Let me re-listen.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up. Let me list all the productions and see which right-hand sides produce 't*'.\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT24 -> 't49'\n- NT28 -> 't7', and also NT28 -> 't26'?\n\nWait, no, in the production for NT28, I see: NT28 -> NT38 NT31 and also a later line: NT28 -> NT38 NT31 again. Hmm, perhaps I misread that. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, no, the given rules have multiple lines. Let me go through them systematically.\n\nLooking at NT24: production is 't49' for NT24.\n\nNT28: There are two productions, both are NT28 -> NT38 NT31. Oh wait, that's two different instances of the same production. So NT28 is NT38 followed by NT31, but in the rules, it's written as NT28 -> NT38 NT31 and then again the same line. So perhaps that's a typo. Wait, no, perhaps it's two separate productions? Or maybe it's a single production repeated? That doesn't seem right. Wait, looking again, in the given grammar, the lines are all separate, so it's possible that NT28 has several productions.\n\nWait, I think I messed that up. Let me re-express the grammar by listing each production correctly.\n\nLet me parse the grammar step by step, noting all possible right-hand sides that lead to terminals.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS -> NT41 NT23\nS -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo S can produce either NT41 followed by NT23 or NT41 followed by NT58.\n\nNow, NT41: looking for NT41's productions.\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT41 -> NT35 NT15\nWait, no: looking at the given lines, I see: \n\nNT41: \n- NT41 -> NT34 NT49\nand later:\nNT41 -> NT35 NT15\nWait, but looking through the given, does NT41 have these two productions? Or is it perhaps the same production appearing twice? I think I need to list them all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line under the NT is a separate production rule.\n\nSo for NT41, the rules are:\n\nNT41 -> NT34 NT49\nNT41 -> NT35 NT15\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean a non-terminal NT41 can expand into two different left-hand sides, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal should expand into two non-terminals. So perhaps each NT X has multiple production rules, each of the form X \u2192 A B, where A and B are non-terminals.\n\nSo for NT41, two productions:\n\n1. NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\n2. NT41 \u2192 NT35 NT15\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have multiple production rules.\n\nNow, for each NT, I need to find which productions lead to terminals.\n\nLet's make a list for each NT:\n\nNT23:\nLooking through the given rules:\n- NT23 -> 't83'\nSo that's one production.\n\nNT27: check for terminal production:\nWait, in the given rules, is NT27 a terminal? Let me check. I don't see NT27 producing a terminal. It seems NT27 is a non-terminal that produces NT35 NT15. So no, NT27 isn't a terminal; it's two non-terminals again.\n\nWait, no: looking through all the given NT rules, I only see 't's in some cases. Hmm, this might take a while.\n\nWait, here's a better approach: create a reverse mapping from the terminals to the NTs that can produce them.\n\nLooking at all the given NT productions, find which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT33, for example: in the given rules, I see NT33 has two productions:\n\nNT33 -> NT36 NT26\nand\nNT33 -> NT12 NT49\n\nBut also, looking again, is there any NT \u2192 terminal? Yes, there are some.\n\nLet's go through each terminal:\n\nt26: Looking for NT that can produce t26. Scanning the rules, is there any NT \u2192 't26' directly? I see NT28: production is NT38 NT31 and appears twice, but not directly. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each NT for terminal outputs.\n\nWait, here are the NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t83\n- NT33 \u2192 doesn't directly produce a terminal\nWait, but looking through the rules again, I see NT24 -> 't49', so that's one.\n\n- NT41: no direct terminals? Only NT34 and NT35... wait, looking again, perhaps I missed a terminal. Let me check the given rules carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list of all terminals and NTs:\n\nTerminals:\nt26, t57, t66, t63, t83, t24, t63, t33, t7, t84, t33, t7, t13, t26, t57, t66, t62, t81, t58, t62, t81, t58, t81, t58, t81, t58, t81, t58, t81, t58, t81, t58, t81, t58, t62, t33.\n\nWait, perhaps some of these are duplicates, but moving on.\n\nLooking for NTs that have a production to a terminal. Let's go through each NT:\n\n- NT23: production is 't83' \u2192 yes\n- NT24: production is 't49' \u2192 yes\n- NT27: seems to produce NT35 NT15 \u2192 no\n- NT28: the given rules for NT28 are two identical lines: NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31 and NT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-654","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like each rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side as two non-terminals, except for the cases where a non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal ('t' plus a number). So, this is Chomsky Normal Form, which has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t26 t57 t59 t19 t7 t7 t38 t7 t74 t7 t33 t24 t84 t33 t24 t26 t57 t7 t81 t10 t7 t81 t13 t8 t66 t8 t17 t7 t66 t62 t59 t33 t24 t38 t24 t59 t63 t24 t33.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I'll note that each 't' plus a number in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So, each 'tX' must be produced by a rule where the non-terminal on the left maps directly to 'tX'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several rules that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n- NT37 \u2192 t84, t66 (appears twice)\n- NT43 \u2192 t62\n- NT24 \u2192 t49, t33, etc.\n\nI think a good approach is to look for all occurrences in the string that match terminals directly produced by non-terminals. Then, for each such occurrence, I can replace them with the corresponding non-terminals, expanding further until all symbols are non-terminals, starting from S.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\nt26 t57 t59 t19 t7 t7 t38 t7 t74 t7 t33 t24 t84 t33 t24 t26 t57 t7 t81 t10 t7 t81 t13 t8 t66 t8 t17 t7 t66 t62 t59 t33 t24 t38 t24 t59 t63 t24 t33\n\nI'll start by substituting all the terminals with their respective non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the string:\n\nt26 \u2192 NT24 (from NT24 \u2192 t24)\nt57 \u2192 NT5 (from NT5 \u2192 t5 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 t62, etc., but wait: NT5 is broken down as NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43, which is still a non-terminal. But in the grammar, NT5 has a production NT5 \u2192 't66', so actually, maybe NT5 is not on the production list. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, NT58 \u2192 't58' is given, but NT5 is only present in rules like NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43. Wait, no: let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar part provided includes several rules for NT5?

Wait, checking the given rules:\n\nLooking for NT5: I see:\n\n\"NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT27\"\n\"NT27 \u2192 NT35 NT15\"\n\"NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT28\"\n...\nWait, I don't see any production for NT5. Hmm. So perhaps NT5 is not directly producing a terminal. Wait, but in the given rules, I'm only seeing NT55 as producing a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nI see:\n\n\"NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT43\",\nso NT5 does not directly produce a terminal. Hmm, but in the string, we have t57. Is there a rule that produces t57?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any 't57' rule. Wait, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for 't57':\n\nWait, the grammar shows 't57' is listed here:\n\n\"NT37 \u2192 't62'\", \"NT36 \u2192 't63'\", \"NT58 \u2192 't74'\", \"NT7 \u2192 't58'\", etc. Wait, but t57 isn't directly listed. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, I think I need to double-check each line of the grammar provided.

NT49 \u2192 t57. So t57 in the string comes from NT49.\n\nSo, t57 is derived from NT49. Therefore, in the string, wherever we see t57, we can replace it with NT49. Then, we can expand NT49, which should produce something else.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see NT49 directly. Wait, let me check the production rules for NT49. The given rules include:\n\n\"NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\"\n\nWait, so NT49 doesn't directly produce anything. Wait, no: looking at the rules, \"NT49\" isn't on the left side of any production except for NT41's production: NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49.\n\nSo, NT49 is a root symbol, I think. But that's conflicting because if NT49 is a root, then it can't produce anything. Hmm, perhaps I got that wrong.\n\nWait, maybe NT49 is used in another rule. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the rules are only for the left-hand side non-terminals, and each right-hand side is either another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nIn this case, I don't see any rule where NT49 is on the left-hand side, except in the case of:\n\n\"NT41 \u2192 NT34 NT49\"\n\nSo, this implies that NT41 is derived from NT34 and NT49. But that doesn't help us unless we can produce NT49.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-755","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by trying to understand the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a set of production rules. It looks like the non-terminals are labeled with uppercase letters like S, NTxx, and Txx. Oh wait, actually, looking closer, the non-terminals are S and all the other strings that are two letters, like NT41, which I guess is actually representing the non-terminals. But in the string, I see tokens like 't13', 't38', etc. So the terminals are these 't' strings. The non-terminals seem to be things like NT41, NT23, etc.\n\nI recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. So here, the grammar seems to have a lot of production rules, mostly of the form NTabc \u2192 NTde NTfg, and some are terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 't83' means that NT23 directly generates 't83'.\n\nThe string I need to verify is a sequence of these terminal tokens. So the string is: t13 t38 t63 t19 t7 t24 t59 t63 t7 t33 t7 t17 t24 t33 t7 t84 t33 t7 t66 t24 t66 t24 t26 t57 t13 t66 t62 t81 t58 t33 t7 t13 t26 t57 t66 t33 t7 t66 t64 t83 t26 t7 t38 t7 t38 t24 t38 t24 t33.\n\nLet me break this down. Each 't' followed by two digits is either a terminal or a non-terminal? Wait, no, because in the grammar, the non-terminals like NT23 produce either other non-terminals or a terminal. So, actually, in the grammar, NT23 \u2192 't83' means that NT23 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't83' as a terminal. So in the string, each token is either a terminal or a non-terminal to be expanded further.\n\nThe task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. I'll need to construct a parse tree or use some method to see if the string can be generated by the given CFG.\n\nFirst, let's note the production rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT41 NT23\nS \u2192 NT41 NT58\n\nSo S can expand into two options: NT41 plus NT23, or NT41 plus NT58.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals (like NT41, NT41, NT23, NT58) have their own production rules, which could be further decompositions or terminals.\n\nFor example, NT41 can produce NT34 and NT49, which in turn can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe idea is to try to derive the given string step by step by breaking it down into smaller parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (every production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a), perhaps I can use a top-down parsing approach, like a recursive descent parser, or attempt to split the string into parts that correspond to the left-hand side of the productions.\n\nGiven the string is quite long, I might need to find parts that correspond to the start symbol S, and recursively check each segment.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t13. Let's see which non-terminals produce t13.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT where production ends with t13.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal leads to 't13' directly.\n\nLooking through, I see NT41 \u2192 't13'. Okay, so NT41 can produce 't13'.\n\nNow, looking at S's productions, S can produce NT41 NT23 or NT41 NT58.\n\nSo, the first possibility is that part of the string starts with t13, which could come from NT41. So, if we have S \u2192 NT41 NT23, then the first part of the string would be NT41, which can produce 't13', and then NT23 would need to produce the rest of the string after 't13'.\n\nAlternatively, if it's S \u2192 NT41 NT58, then NT41 would produce 't13', and NT58 would produce the rest.\n\nSo let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst path: S \u2192 NT41 NT23\n\nThen the string after 't13' would be 't38 t63 t19 t7 t24 t59 t63 t7 t33 t7 t17 t24 t33 t7 t84 t33 t7 t66 t24 t66 t24 t26 t57 t13 t66 t62 t81 t58 t33 t7 t13 t26 t57 t66 t33 t7 t66 t64 t83 t26 t7 t38 t7 t38 t24 t38 t24 t33'.\n\nWait, but after 't13', the next token is 't38' \u2014 so maybe NT23 needs to produce 't38' and some more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if the entire string can be broken down into segments matching the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see what tokens are possible to be produced by each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, let me list all the terminal tokens in the string:\n\nt13, t38, t63, t19, t7, t24, t59, t63, t7, t33, t7, t17, t24, t33, t7, t84, t33, t7, t66, t24, t66, t24, t26, t57,\n\nt13, t66, t62, t81, t58, t33, t7, t13, t26, t57, t66, t33, t7, t66, t64, t83, t26, t7, t38, t7, t38, t24, t38, t24, t33.\n\nLooking for these terminals in the production rules.\n\nFor example, 't38' is produced by NT38 \u2192 NT28 NT31, and NT28 \u2192 NT18 NT2, etc. But wait, looking at the production rules:\n\nLooking for NT that directly produce 't38'.\n\nIn the production list, I see:\n\nNT38 doesn't produce terminals directly. It produces NT28 and NT31.\n\nLooking for 't38' in terminals, let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't38', I don't see such a rule. So 't38' must be produced through a chain of non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check if any NT directly produce 't38' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\nWait, the grammar has rules like:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT38 NT31\n\nWhich suggests that NT28 can produce NT38 and NT31. But 't38' is not a terminal; NT38 is a non-terminal. So in the string, 't38' is a terminal. Therefore, there must be some NT rule where NT38 \u2192 't38', which isn't present. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nIn the productions, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't38' as a terminal. For example, looking for a rule where NTxyz \u2192 't38'.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT23 NT32.\n\nWait, that's not terminal. So 't38' must be produced by expanding through some non-terminals.\n\nSo, to get 't38' in the string, we need some non-terminal that can produce 't38' by expanding into 't38' in one step. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any such production. So this is a problem because 't38' is in the string but has no production rule that directly produces it. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Maybe I missed a rule. Let me re-express all the rules and scan for any NT \u2192 't38'.\n\nLooking through all the rules line by line:\n\nLooking for any line that starts with NTxxx and ends with a terminal.\n\nYes, for example, NT7 \u2192 't58', NT24 \u2192 't63', etc.\n\nBut does any"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
