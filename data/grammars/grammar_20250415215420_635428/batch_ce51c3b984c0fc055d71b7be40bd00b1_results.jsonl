{"custom_id":"request-3","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t73\" can be generated by the given CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. First, I'll look at the grammar to see what the starting symbol is. It looks like S is the start symbol because the first two productions are S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. So S is the starting point.\n\nNow, the string we're trying to generate is \"t73\". In the grammar, I see that some NT symbols are replaced by terminal strings, specifically 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT68 is 't83', NT93 is 't72', and others like that.\n\nLooking at the string \"t73\", it starts with 't', so I need to see if any non-terminal that can generate 't' has '73' as the suffix. Let me scan the productions for 'tX' where X is a number. Wait, actually, one of the productions is NT88 -> 't42', which is 't' followed by 42. Hmm, but that's not 73. Let me check others. Oh, NT68 is 't83' and NT93 is 't72', so 't' followed by 83 or 72. Wait, but none of the productions directly have 't73'. That doesn't seem right because maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe the derivation involves multiple steps. Let me try to see how 't73' could be built. Alternatively, maybe 't73' comes from a production where NT68 is 't73', but I don't see such a production in the given grammar. Let me check all the 't' productions:\n\n- NT2 -> 't64'\n- NT31 -> 't54'\n- NT5 -> 't5' -- Wait, that's just 't5', not 't73'\n- NT17 -> 't66'\n- NT79 -> 't72'\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT93 -> 't72'\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n- NT57 -> 't17'\n- NT78 -> 't56'\n- NT67 -> 't51'\n- NT28 -> 't63'\n- NT88 -> 't42'\n- NT39 -> 't39' (Wait, where is NT39 defined? I don't see it in the productions, so maybe NT24 -> 't2' isn't helpful here)\n- NT22 -> 't2' (Again, not helpful)\n- NT89 -> Not sure, but I don't see 't73' in any of the given 't' productions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through the list again. Perhaps I overlooked a production.\n\nLooking more closely: NT22 -> 't2', NT93 -> 't72', NT68 -> 't83', NT18 -> 't66', NT52 -> 't42', NT31 -> 't54', NT2 -> 't64', NT32 -> 't18', NT19 is 't9' or 't0', NT73 -> 't53' (Wait, NT73 is 't53', not 't73'). Oh, wait, no, NT73 is 't53' according to the productions. So NT73 can't produce 't73'.\n\nHmm, so none of the productions have 't73' directly. That would mean it's impossible to generate \"t73\" because there's no rule that produces it directly. Alternatively, maybe there's a longer production that could lead to it, but I don't see any 't73' in the terminal parts of any non-terminals.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the 't' terminals again to confirm there's no 't73' production.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT93 -> 't72'\n- NT67 -> 't51'\n- NT29 -> 't87'\n- NT27 -> 't79'\n- NT72 -> 't49'\n- NT66 -> 't95'\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n- NT57 -> 't17'\n- NT78 -> 't56'\n- NT15 -> 't96' etc. None of these produce 't73'.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misreading. The productions are symbols on the left, so I'm only looking at where a NT symbol is replaced by a 't' followed by another number. So, none of those 't' replacements have 73. So it's impossible for \"t73\" to be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong and there's a way to reach 't73' through more steps. Let me think: perhaps a non-terminal that isn't directly a 't' can produce a terminal string. But from the start symbol S, the productions are to two NTs. Then each of those NTs can perhaps split further. For example, maybe S -> NT29 NT9. Then NT29 could produce something that leads to 't73'.\n\nWait, let's look at NT29. From the grammar, NT29 -> NT14 NT86. So NT29 is composed of NT14 and NT86. Similarly, NT14 is 't2', as per one of the productions. Wait, no, looking again: NT14 is 't2' because in the productions, NT14 -> 't2'. So if S splits into NT29 and NT9, then NT29 becomes 't2' and NT9 becomes... Wait, what's NT9? Let's see: NT9 -> NT10 NT17. Then NT10 is 't96', and NT17 is 't9'. So NT9 would become 't96 t9', which is 't969' or something. But that doesn't get us anywhere near 't73'.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me see the rule for NT73. I think I might have missed it. Looking back, I see:\nNT73 -> 't53'\n\nNo, that's just 't53', not 't73'. So where is 't73' coming from? It doesn't seem to be a terminal in any production except possibly from NT65 which is defined as NT65 -> NT71 NT65 or NT65 -> NT10 NT96? Wait, no, the 't73' isn't in any production. Let me check all the non-terminals that might have a terminal part.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread NT73. Let me check the productions again.\n\nNo, NT73 is defined as NT73 -> 't53' in one of the productions, but that's 't53', not 't73'. So that's not helpful.\n\nSo, to generate 't73', we must have a production that ends with NT73 -> 't73', but I don't see that. So it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a production I missed. Let me go through each production line:\n\n1. S -> NT61 NT59\n2. S -> NT29 NT9\n3. NT47->NT58 NT95\n4. NT79->NT36 NT52\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-5","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the string \"t28\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a set of rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Let me look at the grammar provided.\n\nFirst, I think I should identify all the production rules and see how terminals and non-terminals combine. The grammar has a lot of rules, so I might need to parse the string step by step, applying the rules to see if it can derive \"t28\".\n\nBreaking down the string: it's just one terminal symbol, 't28', so I need to see if there's a path from the start symbol S down to 't28' using the rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n2. S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nNow, 't28' is a terminal. I need to see if any of these options can lead to 't28'. Let's look at each:\n\nFor the first option, NT61 and NT59. Let me check if NT61 can produce 't28'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 't83', NT60 \u2192 't49', NT58 \u2192 't95', NT67 \u2192 't32', and others. Hmm, looking for NT61, I see NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So NT61 depends on NT33 and NT55.\n\nNow, checking NT33: according to the rules, NT33 can produce NT32 NT72 or NT32 NT72 again. Both options are the same, so NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72.\n\nBreaking down NT32: NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65.\n\nAgain, NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT23, and NT23 can produce 't79' or 't13'. But we're looking for 't28', so this seems off track. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t go this route.\n\nLet me check the other option from S: S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So, we'll need NT29 to produce something and NT9 to produce something else, or the same.\n\nLooking at NT29: NT29 has two rules:\n1. NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n2. NT29 \u2192 NT62 NT83\n\nSince we're looking for 't28', let's see what each of these can derive.\n\nRule 1: NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86. Let's break both down.\n\nNT14 can produce various things. Let's see if it can lead to 't28'. Looking through the rules, I see NT14 \u2192 't48' or NT14 \u2192 't2'. Wait, NT14 has two options: 't2' and 't48'. So if NT14 \u2192 't2', then NT14 = 't2'.\n\nNT86: checking the rules, NT86 appears in multiple places. For example, NT86 \u2192 NT52 NT70, and also NT86 \u2192 't94'. So NT86 can directly produce 't94'.\n\nPutting this together, if NT14 \u2192 't2' and NT86 \u2192 't94', then NT29 via rule 1 would produce 't2' 't94', which is 't2t94', but our target is 't28', which doesn't match. So this path doesn't seem to lead to 't28'.\n\nNow, let's look at rule 2 for NT29: NT29 \u2192 NT62 NT83.\n\nNT62: checking the rules, I see NT62 \u2192 NT6 NT78, and NT6 leads to other things. Wait, NT68 \u2192 't83', but NT62 also leads to NT6 NT78, where NT78 can produce 't63' or other terms. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, let's check NT83: looking through the rules, I see NT83 can produce 't25' (NT83 \u2192 't25') or other options. So NT83 could directly produce 't25'.\n\nWait a minute, so if NT29 \u2192 NT62 NT83, and if NT83 can be 't25', then the other side NT62 might lead to 't28'. Because in the target string, we have 't28', so perhaps NT62 is 't28'?\n\nLooking back, I don't see NT62 directly producing 't28'. Let me check the rules again. Does any non-terminal directly produce 't28'? Looking through the rules, I see NT93 \u2192 't72', NT68 \u2192 't83', NT73 \u2192 't53', etc. I don't immediately see any rule where a non-terminal directly outputs 't28'.\n\nWait, but maybe through a series of productions. Let me think. Suppose I follow another route for NT62: NT62 \u2192 NT6 NT78. Then NT78 can produce 't63' or other things. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the rules again more carefully. Oh, I notice that NT68 \u2192 't83', so if I can get NT68 to produce 't83', and somehow connect that, but that's not directly helpful for 't28'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look at other rules involving NT61 and NT59. Wait, perhaps I should consider that 't28' could be derived from NT61 and NT59 but in a different way. Let me go back to that path.\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59. Then, what can NT59 produce? Let me check the rules for NT59.\n\nLooking at NT59: NT59 \u2192 NT66 NT23. So NT59 depends on NT66 and NT23.\n\nNT66: looking through the rules, I see NT66 \u2192 NT5 NT51. Hmm, NT5 can produce 't5' or other things. Wait, in the grammar, NT5 has multiple productions, including NT5 \u2192 't5', so if NT5 can produce 't5', then maybe NT51 can lead to 't84' (since NT51 \u2192 't84').\n\nBut that's getting complicated. This path might not lead directly to 't28'.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and since every production is of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, we can think of the string as a series of a's connected by non-terminals. So, 't28' is a single a, so we just need to see if any rule directly produces 't28' as a terminal.\n\nLooking back, do any non-terminals directly produce 't28'? Scanning the rules, I see:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 't72'\n- NT55 \u2192 't19'\n- NT93 \u2192 't72' again\n- NT95 \u2192 't94'\n- Other rules involve various 't's but none directly 't28'.\n\nWait, no non-terminal directly produces 't28' because in the provided rules, all the terminals are things like 't1', 't2', etc., but I don't see 't28' as a direct production. So does that mean 't28' cannot be derived? But wait, that can't be right because sometimes you can derive longer strings and individual parts of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if any non-terminals can generate 't28' through multiple steps. For example, can a non-terminal generate something that eventually becomes 't28'?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any chain of productions where a non-terminal derives 't28' as a terminal. Each terminal is like 't5', 't6', 't9', etc., but 't28' isn't listed anywhere. So perhaps 't28' isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a rule that leads to 't28'. Let me check each rule again.\n\nLooking at the list, the only 't's are:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT66 NT23\n- NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n- NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\nWait! Wait a minute. Look at NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28.\n\nSo, if I can get NT27 to produce NT7 and NT28, then the string could have 't28' as a terminal. So, is there a way for the start symbol to derive NT27 NT something else?\n\nWait, but the start symbol S is splitting into two non-terminals,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because parsing algorithms like CYK can be used, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break down the string and see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t42 t65`. Since it's a string of two tokens, each presumably derived from non-terminals, I'll check each token to see if they can be generated.\n\nStarting with the first token, `t42`. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT68 \u2192 t42 is a production. So, to generate `t42`, the non-terminal NT68 must expand directly.

Therefore, the non-terminal NT88 must expand directly to `t65`.\n\nNow, I need to check the overall structure. In the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So, the entire derivation starts with NT61 and NT59.\n\nWait a minute. For the string `t42 t65` to be generated, I think each part of S must produce their respective terminals. Let's see:\n\n- NT61 must produce `t42`.\n- NT59 must produce `t65`.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. NT33 is a non-terminal that I need to expand further. NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22, and so on. This suggests that NT61 isn't directly producing a terminal. Instead, it's through a series of expansions.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 \u2192 NT9. NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17. Then NT10 \u2192 NT60, and so on. It seems NT59 isn't directly producing `t65`. Instead, it's a longer expansion.\n\nWait, but looking again, in the grammar rules, there's a production NT68 \u2192 t42 and NT88 \u2192 t65. But where are these non-terminals NT68 and NT88 coming from?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT30 NT58. NT30 \u2192 ... hmm, wait, actually in the provided grammar, NT68 \u2192 't42' is not present. Wait, checking again:\n\nLooking at the list of grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't42' ? Let me scan through the productions. Yes, under NT68, I see NT68 \u2192 't42'. Similarly, NT88 \u2192 't65' is another production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, it's under NT68 and NT88 that these terminals appear. So, these are direct productions.\n\nBut in the start symbol S, the first production is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So, for S to produce 't42 t65', I need to have NT61 \u2192 't42' and NT59 \u2192 't65' directly, but looking at the grammar, that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express the grammar properly. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Then each NT is a non-terminal that can expand into other NTs or terminals.\n\nSo, for the string `t42 t65` to be generated, S must split into two non-terminals, NT61 and NT59, each of which expand into the corresponding terminals.\n\nBut looking at NT61's productions: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So NT61 can't go directly to 't42' because it expands into NT33 and NT55. Similarly, looking at NT59: NT59 \u2192 NT9, and NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't42'\n- NT88 \u2192 't65'\n\nSo, NT68 can produce 't42' directly, but where does NT68 come from? Looking for NT68's production:\n\nYes, NT68 \u2192 't42' is a production, but also NT68 \u2192 NT30 NT58 is another production.\n\nWait, no, actually in the provided grammar, the production is NT68: `NT68 -> t42`. So, it's directly producing 't42' as a terminal. So, that means NT68 is a non-terminal that can directly generate 't42'.\n\nSimilarly, NT88 \u2192 't65' is a direct production. So, NT88 can directly produce 't65'.\n\nNow, for the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So, the entire string must be the combination of NT61 and NT59 expansions. For the string `t42 t65`, NT61 must produce 't42' and NT59 must produce 't65'.\n\nBut looking at NT61's productions:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\n\nAnd so on. None of these produce terminals directly. So, NT61 doesn't produce 't42' directly but through a series of expansions. Therefore, it's impossible for NT61 to produce 't42' because it only breaks down into more non-terminals.\n\nOn the other hand, there's NT68 that can produce 't42', but in the start symbol, S only goes to NT61 and NT59. So, in this case, the string `t42 t65` cannot be generated because NT61 cannot directly or indirectly produce 't42'; it only produces more non-terminals which eventually may produce terminals, but in this case, the string has 't42' as the first symbol, which cannot be generated by NT61.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 \u2192 NT9, and NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17, and so on, none of which directly produce 't65', except for NT88, but that's a different non-terminal. So, NT59 can't generate 't65' directly either.\n\nWait, but looking again, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So, each of these must derive to a terminal string. So, for the string `t42 t65`, NT61 must derive to 't42' and NT59 must derive to 't65'.\n\nBut as I saw, NT61's productions don't include 't42' directly. The only direct terminal in NT61's subtree is NT68 \u2192 't42' is a separate non-terminal. So, perhaps the derivation would involve NT61 expanding into NT68 via some rules, but looking at the grammar, that's not possible because NT61 doesn't have a production that includes NT68.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT68 and NT61. NT61 can only go to NT33 and NT55. There's no production that connects NT61 to NT68.\n\nSo, in conclusion, since S splits into NT61 and NT59, and neither can directly produce 't42' and 't65' respectively, the string `t42 t65` cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t2 t74` is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol which can also produce a single non-terminal or terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It's a bit lengthy, with a bunch of NT rules and terminal symbols. The start symbol is S, and the string to check is `t2 t74`. Since the string has two tokens separated by a space, I believe this implies it's a sequence of two terminals. So I need to see if S can derive `t2` and then `t74` in that order.\n\nI should start by figuring out how each token is generated from the grammar. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first token is `t2`. Let me search through the grammar rules to see if any production leads directly to `t2`. Scanning through the provided rules, I notice that in the ' grammar section under NT67, there's a production NT67 -> NT67 NT29, but that doesn't seem helpful. Looking through the list, I see that NT2 -> NT52 NT86, but that's not directly leading to `t2`. Wait, in the terminal part, under the ' NT sections, I notice NT20 -> NT73 NT73, and elsewhere, NT27 -> NT7 NT28. Hmm, wait, looking for `t2`:\n\nWait, in the end, under the 'grammar rules, I see NT2 -> NT52 NT86, but that's an NT production. For terminals, I see lines like NT27 -> NT7 NT28, which are non-terminals. But where is `t2` directly produced?\n\nAh, I notice that in the terminal productions, there's NT52 -> 't42', NT67 -> 't74', NT60 -> 't49', and others. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\n- NT52 -> 't42'\n- NT67 -> 't74'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT9 -> 't23'\n- NT33 -> 't32'\n- NT48 -> 't97'\n- NT19 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't39'\n- NT19 -> 't9'\n- NT72 -> 't49'\n- NT56 -> 't87'\n- NT66 -> 't95'\n- NT55 -> 't5'\n- NT59 -> 't35'\n- NT33 -> 't82'\n- NT66 -> 't95'\n- NT71 -> 't50'\n- NT61 -> 't36'\n- NT56 -> 't9'\n- NT68 -> 't16'\n\nWait, where is `t2` produced? I don't see any terminal production that directly results in `t2`. That's a problem because both `t2` and `t74` need to be generated from the grammar, but from the given rules, I don't see a rule that produces `t2`.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan the terminal parts again. Looking at the end, I see:\n\n- NT52 -> 't42'\n- NT67 -> 't74'\n- NT27 -> 't7 NT28' (no, that's non-terminal)\nWait, no, actually, looking at the list, I think I might have missed a `t2` rule. Let me check line by line.\n\nIn the grammar rules, I see NT67 -> 't74'? Let me check carefully:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT67, is there a production that results in a terminal?\n\nYes, here's one: NT67 -> 't74'? Wait, no. Let me recheck each terminal production:\n\nWait, actually, looking through the list, the terminals are:\n\n- NT52 -> 't42'\n- NT67 -> 't74'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT27 -> ... non-terminal productions\n- Wait, is there an 't2' somewhere?\n\nLooking through the list again, I think I might have missed `t2`.

So if `t2` is part of the input string, and since the grammar doesn't have any rule that produces `t2`, then it's impossible for `t2` to be in the language generated by this grammar. Therefore, the string `t2 t74` can't be generated because it requires a production that isn't present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a rule where an NT leads to `t2`. Let me check non-terminals that produce terminals. \n\nLooking at ND67: is there any production NT67 -> 't2'? No. Similarly for others. \n\nWait, perhaps it's via multiple steps. Suppose we have some NT that can produce a string ending with 't2'. But in the grammar, no such rule exists. Because all the terminal rules result in 't' followed by another number, but not just 't2'. \n\nTherefore, since the grammar doesn't produce 't2' anywhere, the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nThe grammar provided does not have any production rule that generates `t2` or `t74`.

Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with production rules. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, looking at the given rules, I see that some have two non-terminals on the right side (like S \u2192 NT61 NT59), and others have just two non-terminals. Wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so maybe some of these are two-terminals on the right, which might complicate things, but perhaps in this case, all are non-terminals except when they become terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the right-hand sides, some have 't' followed by numbers, like 't12', 't94', etc. Those are terminals. So the actual terminals are these 't' followed by some numbers, and non-terminals are the NTs with numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t28 t33 t62\". Let me split it into parts: t28, t33, t62. So each of these is a terminal symbol.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if there's a way to derive this sequence starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, S branches into two non-terminals: NT61 NT59 and NT29 NT9. Let me check if \"t28 t33 t62\" can come from either of these.\n\nWait, no, because each production of S would split the string into two parts. But the given string is three 't's, so maybe it's a combination of two productions from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' is the result of a production from some non-terminal. Maybe the string is built by going through several steps.\n\nLet me see. The string has three 't's, so perhaps it's a derivation like NT1 \u2192 NT2 NT3, and NT2 \u2192 ... and NT3 \u2192 ... until each part becomes 't's. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by S producing three parts, but wait S only has two productions. So each S production has two non-terminals. So to get three 't's, maybe it's a matter of merging two productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if each 't' corresponds to a path in the grammar. Let me start by looking at each terminal and seeing which rules produce them.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83\n- NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT65\n- NT47 \u2192 NT48 NT33\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13, but perhaps 't23 is not a terminal. Wait, looking at 't's in the right-hand sides, 't23' is a terminal.\nWait, the rules include 't12' which is a terminal, so some of the non-terminals produce 't's.\n\nWait, let's list all the 't' rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't74'\n- NT65 \u2192 't32' (since NT65 \u2192 NT32 but then is that terminal? No, NT32 is another non-terminal. Wait, wait, let me look again. For example, NT60 \u2192 't49' because NT60's rule is NT68 NT52 which then becomes 't83' and 't49', but looking at the rules, I think some are terminals.\n\nWait, it's a bit confusing. Maybe I should make a list of all the right-hand sides and see which are terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see that NT10 \u2192 NT71 NT47, and both of those are non-terminals, so 't96' isn't in there. Wait, actually, I think I need to make a list:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\n- NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23\n- NT8 \u2192 't2'\n- NT12 \u2192 NT52 NT86, but that seems off.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some are in the form of NTn \u2192 NTm NTk, others are directly to a 't'. For example:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\n\nHmm, I think that's non-terminals again, until eventually they resolve to terminals.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nFor example, NT67 appears in two rules:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\n\nBoth are non-terminals. But looking at the right-hand sides of these, they must be non-terminals, so they can't be terminals yet. So each of these requires further expansion.\n\nBut the string we're looking at is \"t28 t33 t62\". So I need to see how each 't' can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules to see where 't's appear as RHS:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't51'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't19'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't18'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't64'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't39', 't2'\n\nWait, no, for example:\n\nLooking among all the rules, 't's are only in certain production rules. So maybe 't28', 't33', 't62' are the result of specific productions.\n\nWait, let's check each 't' in the string against the production rules.\n\nLooking for NT that produce 't33': I see NT47 \u2192 NT48 NT33, but that's NT48 is another non-terminal. So that's not terminal.\n\nWait, but NT33 appears on the RHS of several rules:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT96 NT33, but NT48 would produce something else. Alternatively, NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, but those are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should map each 't' and see which rule produces it.\n\nWait, 't28' occurs once, 't33' once, and 't62' once.\n\nLooking for rules that have a terminal on the RHS, especially 't's.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83: so NT93 can produce 't62' if NT83 is terminal, but NT83 is followed by NT36, which isn't a terminal. Or wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for where 't62' occurs as a terminal. Hmm, let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking at 't62' in the RHS:\n\nI see NT93's rule has 't62' as part of NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83. So 't62' is on the RHS of NT93.\n\nSimilarly, 't83' as part of NT93's RHS.\n\nWait, no, 't62' is on the RHS of NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83, so for NT93 to produce one 't62', it must go through NT62 or NT83 being terminals. But in the rules, NT62 would produce NT57 NT14 and NT29 NT87. Neither are terminals. So 't62' must come directly from NT32, but wait, in the rules, we have NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: to see what sequences of productions would lead to the string \"t28 t33 t62\".\n\nEach 't' is a terminal, so each must come from a rule where that non-terminal directly produces a 't'. So let me first identify which non-terminals produce 't's.\n\nLooking at all the rules, 't's appear on the RHS as:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't74'\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't32' (because NT65 \u2192 NT32 NT78, but that's not a terminal yet. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the rules have both sides as terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7: NT78's RHS is NT93 ('t94') and 't7', so NT78 \u2192 't94' NT7.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, for example:\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7: So NT93 is a non-terminal that produces 't94', and NT7 is a non-terminal that probably produces 't7'.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the rules for NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT46 NT54 and NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' comes from a non-terminal that directly produces it.

The string is `t82 t18 t38 t13`, and the grammar is provided with all these production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. It's a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar given seems to fit that because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are pairs of non-terminals or symbols like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string has four tokens separated by spaces: t82, t18, t38, t13. So, I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar, meaning that starting from the start symbol (which is S), the grammar can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so the start symbol expands into two non-terminals, NT61 and NT59. The string starts with t82, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, the only way to get a terminal is through the production rules. So I need to find rules that expand to t82 and see how it fits into the derivation.\n\nLet me look at the production rules to see where 't' symbols appear. For example, I see that NT53 \u2192 't53', NT46 \u2192 't60', etc. So t's are the base cases where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the string tokens:\n\n1. t82: Check if there's a production rule that produces 't82'. Scanning through the given rules, I see NT73 \u2192 't53', NT68 \u2192 't83', NT23 \u2192 't13', etc. Wait, I don't see a rule for t82. Hmm. Maybe I missed one. Let me check again. Oh, I don't see 't82' in any of the provided rules. So that's a problem. If t82 is a terminal, there must be a rule that directly gives t82. Otherwise, it's impossible to generate it.\n\nWait, did I look through all the rules? Let me check once more. Looking through each production, I see NT33 \u2192 't32', NT81 \u2192 't94', NT88 \u2192 't76', etc. No 't82' production. So that means the string cannot be generated because t82 isn't a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. Looking through the list again:\n\nNT33 -> 't32'\nNT32 -> 't18' (Wait, no, NT32 is a non-terminal whose production is \u2192 NT18 NT65)\nNT17 -> 't48' (Wait, NT17 is a non-terminal)\nWait, no, the t's are on the right-hand side of the productions. Let me check each line:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't73'\nNT61 \u2192 't36'\nNT78 \u2192 't95'\n...\nWait, I see production rules where certain non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number.

{"custom_id":"request-60","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string \"t51 t13 t48 t48\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) generates strings through a series of productions. The given grammar is in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This simplifies things a bit because each step in the derivation can only replace one non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of four tokens: t51, t13, t48, t48. Each of these seems to correspond to a specific production rule. I'll need to trace a possible derivation that can produce this string.\n\nLet me list the relevant production rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83' (Production 30)\n- NT9 -> 't18' (Production 19)\n- NT14 -> 't2' (Production 14)\n- NT70 -> 't52' (Production 64)\n- NT93 -> 't72' (Production 16)\n- NT88 -> 't42' (Production 26)\n- NT95 -> 't94' (Production 25)\n- NT47 -> 't73' (Production 9)\n- NT82 -> t? Wait, looking through, I don't see NT82 directly, but perhaps it's derived from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by starting from the top-level non-terminals and see how they can produce the given string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the productions for S:\n\nS -> NT61 NT59 (Production 1)\nS -> NT29 NT9 (Production 2)\n\nWe need to see if either of these can lead to the given string. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's take S -> NT61 NT59.\n\nLooking at NT61: Production 61 says NT61 -> NT33 NT55.\n\nThen NT33 can go to NT32 NT72 (Production 77), or NT79 NT22 (Production 93). Similarly, NT55 can go to NT5 NT88 (Production 17) or NT67 NT59 (Production 59). Hmm, this could get complicated quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps starting with S -> NT29 NT9 is a better approach because NT9 is a terminal (from production 19: NT9 -> 't18'), so that might help.\n\nLooking at NT29: Production 29 is NT29 -> NT14 NT86 (Production 10). Then NT14 is 't2' (Production 14), and NT86: Let me check production for NT86. Scanning through, I don't see an explicit production for NT86, but wait\u2014that can't be right. Looking back, Production 86 is NT60 -> 't65' at line 49? No, looking again: Oh wait, line 60 says NT60 -> 't49' (Production 60). So wait, no, NT86 is another non-terminal. So I need to find how NT86 is produced. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT86 -> 't95' (Production 20) and also NT93 -> 't72' (Production 16). Hmm, so NT86 can be a terminal. Wait, let me check: Are there any NT86 productions?\n\nLooking back, line 86: \"NT60 -> 't65'\" So NT60 is a terminal? Or is that a production for NT60?\n\nWait, no, the left side is the non-terminal, so NT60 is being defined as 't65'. So NT60 is a terminal. Similarly, NT86: I don't see a production for NT86 as a terminal. Wait, let me check each line for NT86, T86, etc.\n\nLooking through, I see NT23 -> 't79' (Production 9?), NT47->'t73' (Production 9), NT88->'t28' (Production 8), NT19->'t0', etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Wait, no production for NT86 as a terminal. So perhaps it's a non-terminal. So NT86 must be derived from two non-terminals.\n\nLooking for NT86's productions, I see Production 85: NT60 -> 't65' (Wait, that's NT60, not NT86). Then looking, does NT86 have any production leading to two non-terminals? Let me check each production that starts with NT86. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> NT52 NT86 (Production 22)\n- NT58 -> NT66 NT23 (Production 21)\n- NT86 -> 't33' (Wait, no\u2014that's NT87: Production 75, maybe? Wait, line 75: NT87 is defined as 't48'. So actually, NT87 is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the given production list:\n\nLooking for 'NT86' in the left side:\n\n- Production 22: NT2 -> NT52 NT86\n- Production 60: NT60 -> 't65'\n- No others.\n\nSo NT86 must derive into two non-terminals because the grammar is in CNF. So let's see, from the list, NT86 is used in production 22 as NT2 -> NT52 NT86. But for NT86, does it have a production as two non-terminals? Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, for example:\n\n- NT58 -> NT66 NT23\n- NT29 -> NT14 NT86\nBut for NT86 itself, do we have a production? It seems not until perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's scan each production line to see if any are for NT86.\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nProduction 22: NT2 -> NT52 NT86 (So NT2's production includes NT86 as part of it)\nProduction 60: NT60 -> 't65' (So NT60 is a terminal)\nProduction 14: NT14 -> 't2' (Terminal)\nProduction 19: NT9 -> 't18' (Terminal)\nProduction 10: NT29 -> NT14 NT86 (So NT29 is split into NT14 and NT86)\nProduction 86: wait, line 22 is NT2, but I need to find any NT86 on the left.\n\nWait, perhaps line 60 is NT60, line 67: NT67 -> NT57 NT14, etc. Wait, no NT86 on the left. So maybe NT86 is only used in production 22 as part of another non-terminal. So NT86 is a non-terminal and must be derived from two non-terminals.\n\nLooking for NT86's production: I don't see any production where NT86 is on the left. So perhaps this approach is leading me nowhere. Maybe I should try a different starting point.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if S can produce \"t51 t13 t48 t48\" by another route.\n\nLooking at S->NT29 NT9: NT29 can be NT14 NT86, and NT9 is 't18'. But in our string, we have 't51', which is a terminal; so perhaps we should see if any other path can lead to t51.\n\nLet me check NT72: looking for 't72' in the productions. Production 16 says NT72 -> 't49'. Wait, no, that's not NT72. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT72: It's defined in Production 17 as NT9 -> 't18', Production 77: NT93 -> 't72', and so on.\n\nAh, wait, no, looking through again:\n\nLine 16: NT78->'t53' (Production 78), line 17: NT67->'t53' (Production 74?), wait, let me list the relevant NTs that produce terminals.\n\nLooking for 't51', is that a terminal? Let me check line 67: NT78 is defined as 't53' (line 74). Wait, no. Let me check all lines:\n\nLooking for 't's as terminals:\n\n- 't51' (line ?): Looking through the given productions, I see line 54: NT55->'t19' (Production 55)\n- 't13' corresponds to NT23->'t13'?

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is a good start because it's simpler to parse with either recursive ascent or a parse table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. It starts with S, which can go into NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So S is the starting symbol, and the string has t30, which I don't see being directly derived from S. Hmm, maybe I need to break this down step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each token in the string and see how they can be generated by the grammar. Let's list them: t30, t83, t2, t54, t99.\n\nI notice that t30 is represented in the grammar as NT78 -> t30. Wait, no, looking back, I don't see NT78 directly going to t30. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals go directly to terminal symbols. For example, NT60 -> 't94', NT5 -> 't5', etc. So each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a production rule where that non-terminal produces that terminal.\n\nSo, to generate \"t30 t83 t2 t54 t99\", each 't...' must be generated by some NT rule. Let's map each token:\n\n- t30: Does any NT have a production to 't30'? Looking through, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t30. Wait, let me check more carefully. Scanning the rules, I don't see any NT -> 't30'. So maybe that's a problem. If there's no NT producing 't30', then how can t30 appear in the string? Unless I'm missing it.\n\nWait, let me go through all the NT rules. I see entries like NT27 -> 't79', but not t30. Let me see if any combination of NTs can produce t30. For example, maybe through intermediate steps.\n\nBut in this grammar, each production either goes to another NT or directly to a terminal. Each step is a single production. So to produce 't30', there must be a non-terminal NT which has a production rule directly ending with 't30'. If none exists, then 't30' can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me check again. The user listed the rules, but perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each rule exhaustively.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any that produce 't30'. For example:\n\n- NT78 -> t30 is not present as a rule, but instead, NT78 could produce other things, but in the given rules, I don't see 't30'. Wait, actually, in the first part of the grammar, NT78 is transformed into NT93 NT7, which then can be further broken down. But none of the end terminals are 't30', so maybe 't30' is not in the language. If that's the case, then the string can't be generated because it contains t30, which isn't in the grammar's terminal symbols.\n\nWait, let me confirm. In the provided grammar, does any NT produce 't30'? I don't see that. The rules list ends with various NT going to t's, but looking for t30:\n\n- NT78: I see NT78 -> NT65 NT7 but not t30.\n- NT66: -> t95\n- NT46: -> t60\n- NT51: Does that exist? Looking, I don't see 'nt51' as a terminal, but do I see NT51 being used? Wait, the rules are all given, so I can scan through them.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any 't30'.

So, I need to analyze the grammar provided and see how these rules might generate the string provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice several productions that directly substitute symbols with terminal strings (like 't' followed by numbers). For example, some S productions are S -> NT29 NT9, S -> NT47 NT59, etc. Each of these seems to represent a step towards generating the terminals.\n\nThe string given is \"t30 t63 t39 t38 t9\". Since each production may produce a constant, these terminals are tokens from the grammar. So, essentially, the problem is asking whether the string can be generated by applying these production rules in sequence.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the CYK algorithm or to construct a parse tree step by step. But since the string is of length 5, maybe a step-by-step approach is manageable.\n\nLet me list where 't30' appears. I look through the grammar and see:\n\n- NT78 -> NT93 NT7 \u2192 then NT93 -> 't72', NT7 -> 't66'. So, 't72' 't66'. Not t30.\n- NT93 -> 't72', so it's only 't72'.\n- NT66 -> 't95', so that's just 't95'.\n\nWait, no 't30' seems to be in some NT's productions.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I find NT67 -> NT57 NT14, and NT57 -> 't17' 't27'? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, NT57 is defined as \u2192 NT17 NT27, and both NT17 and NT27 are terminals? Let me see:\n\nNT17 is defined as NT46 NT54. That would expand into 't60' and 't64'. So, wait, NT17 would produce t60 t64. But that's not t30.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each rule that can produce t30. So, is there any rule that directly expands to a single 't30'? Or is it a combination of non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't30'. Hmm, so maybe t30 comes from a combination of non-terminals.\n\nLooking for NT that can eventually expand to 't30' as part of their reduction.\n\nThe string has 't30 t63 t39 t38 t9'.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each of these terminals is the result of a non-terminal's production, which then must be linked through the grammar.\n\nSo, t30 is a terminal. So, which rule produces 't30'? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT67 -> NT57 NT14\n- NT57 -> NT17 NT27 \u2192 No, that's non-terminals again.\n- NT55 -> 't5' \u2192 No\n- NT47 -> 't73' \u2192 No\n- NT60 -> 't49' \u2192 No\n- NT75 \u2192 Not sure, but wait, looking again:\n\nLooking for any NT that expands to include 't30'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 't30' comes from NT63 or another NT. Let me check the productions for each.\n\nWait, no, the string is 't30 t63 t39 t38 t9', so each t is a terminal. So, perhaps each of these must be produced by a production rule in the grammar where a non-terminal expands into such a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't directly see any production that results in 't30'. For example:\n\nIs there a non-terminal NT that expands directly into 't30'? From the list:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT -> 't30'.\n\nSo, how can 't30' be part of the string? It must be generated by a chain of productions where non-terminals expand into other non-terminals until eventually 't30' is reached. But I don't see how that would happen because none of the NTs directly produce 't30'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT67 is defined as NT57 NT14, and both are non-terminals, so no.\n- NT57 is NT17 NT27 \u2192 again non-terminals.\n- NT17 is NT46 NT54 \u2192 both non-terminals.\n- NT27 is NT7 NT28 \u2192 non-terminals.\n- NT7 is NT19 NT23 \u2192 non-terminals.\n- NT9 is NT10 NT17 \u2192 non-terminals.\n\nSo, 't30' can't be generated directly. But wait, maybe I'm missing somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps it's an error in my initial approach. Maybe each 't' is part of a production where the non-terminal is part of a chain leading to that 't'. For example, perhaps a series of rules that ultimately result in a 't' at the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a production that isn't listed correctly, but I don't think so. The grammar is given in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is supposed to be built from the start symbol S through a series of steps.\n\nLet me consider the start symbol S, which is defined as:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT65\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo, the string would have to start with either NT61 followed by NT65 or NT29 followed by NT9.\n\nSo, for the string 't30 t63 t39 t38 t9', the first two tokens should be a production of S. So, looking at 't30', it's part of the start symbol production. But I don't know how 't30' relates to these rules.\n\nWait, perhaps 't30' is the result of NT61 or NT65, etc.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLooking for the production of NT61:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.\n\nSo NT61 expands into NT33 and NT55.\n\nThen, NT33 can be:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NT33 definitions:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\n- NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\n- NT65 has rules like:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT47, etc.\n\nWait, this seems too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a way to derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see that NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14.\n\nWait, NT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27 (and both are non-terminals), which then go to more non-terminals, and it's unclear how they produce any 't's because none of their productions directly result in 't's.\n\nGiven that, perhaps 't30' is not present in any of the terminals, making the string invalid. But that can't be right, because the problem provides the string to evaluate, so it must be either valid or not, and I need to find the reason.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking for the production that leads to 't30'. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT that eventually leads to 't30':\n\nWait, perhaps some deeper expansion leads to a terminal like 't30'. But I'm not seeing it because none of the NTs seem to have a direct or indirect terminal 't30'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't30' comes from a specific NT whose production is a chain that ends in 't30'. But I don't see any such NT in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through each non-terminal to see if any of them can produce 't30':\n\n- NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14 \u2192 which then expand into other NTs, but not producing any 't's.\n- NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7 \u2192 ends up being 't's but not t30.\n- NT83 \u2192 NT66 NT8 \u2192 no t30.\n- NT73 \u2192 NT26 NT24 \u2192 no.\n- NT29 \u2192 various things, but none result in 't30'.\n- NT93 \u2192 't72' and others, no.\n- NT47 \u2192 't73', no.\n\nHmm, so it seems that none of the NT productions directly or indirectly generate 't30'. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to contain 't30' as a terminal. Therefore, the answer must be 'No'.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check if I missed any NT that can produce 't30'.\n\nLooking for NT where a production includes 't30':\n\nLet me go through each"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this structure because each rule on the left side of the arrow either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string in question starts with `t62`, which is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see that `NT62` is a production that results in 't12'. Wait, but the string starts with `t62`, which doesn't directly match any terminal in the grammar. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see `NT62 -> t12` but the string starts with `t62`, not `t12`. That doesn't match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, maybe the non-terminals NTT62 are producing 't62', but I don't see such a rule. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT62 -> t12\n- But in the string, it's `t62`, not `t12`. So this is a problem because the production for NT62 gives 't12', not 't62'. That would mean the string has a terminal `t62` that isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe the rule is written as NT62 -> t62 somewhere else. Let me scan through all the rules to check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT62 -> t62. The closest is NT62 -> t12. So that suggests that `t62` isn't a terminal in the grammar\u2014it's produced by NT62. But in the string, we have `t62`, which suggests that NT62 should produce `t62`, but according to the grammar, it produces `t12`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is in a different form. Let me check again. Upon re-examining, I see that `NT62 -> t12` is listed as a production. Therefore, NT62 must derive 't12', not 't62'. So the presence of `t62` in the string cannot be derived from any of the non-terminals except if that non-terminal produces a different terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is `t62`. Maybe there's a mistake in the initial assessment. Let me double-check all the given productions to see if any produce `t62`.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT62 -> t12\n\nSo, NT62 only produces t12. Hence, the string contains t62 which can't be generated by any production in this grammar. Therefore, the string can't be derived from the grammar because the first symbol is t62, which doesn't have a corresponding production that maps to it.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another angle. Maybe the string is a combination of several productions, including t-like terminals. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the NT symbols. Let me ensure I'm looking at all the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT62: yes, it's `NT62 -> t12`. So, if the string has `t62`, that can't come from any production of NT62.\n\nAlternatively, is it possible that the NT is being used differently? Or perhaps the string is being processed in a way that some combination of rules creates t62. But given the grammar, I don't see any way to produce `t62`.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm conflating NT numbers with the terminals. Let me think again. The string is `t62 t33 t65 t95 t35 t35`. Each of these are terminals, and according to the grammar, each must be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting with `t62`: looking for a production rule where NT62 -> t62. But in the given rules, NT62 -> t12 is present. So, no NT62 rule exists that produces t62. That would mean `t62` cannot be derived from any non-terminal in this grammar.\n\nWait, but looking through all the NT rules, I don't see any rule that produces t62. For example, checking NT12: is there a rule where NT12 -> t62? Looking through the rules, I don't see anything like NT12 -> t62.

{"custom_id":"request-96","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the string \"t38 t18 t46 t79 t73 t16\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I'll recall that CNF grammars have production rules where each production's left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe given grammar has several productions. Notably, there are some terminals mixed into the right-hand sides, like NT68 -> 't12'. So, it looks like these 't' strings are the leaves of the parse tree, meaning each 't' is a terminal, and the NT symbols are non-terminals.\n\nThe string to parse is t38 t18 t46 t79 t73 t16. It has six terminals, so the parse tree should have six leaves. Let's list them in order: t38, t18, t46, t79, t73, t16.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree must be a full binary tree for a string of length n, so here, a string of length 6 (in terms of leaves) should result in a parse tree with height 2, as log2(6) is a bit less than 3, so the height is 3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Actually, in a full binary tree, the number of leaves is 2^h, where h is the height. But here, 6 isn't a power of 2, so this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for the string to be generated with a certain structure.\n\nLooking at the string, the first step is to see which non-terminals can directly produce these terminals. For example, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT68 -> 't12'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT47 -> 't73'\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n- NT56 -> 't9' \u2014 wait, wait, in the given grammar, some have 't' and others are longer. Let me check the provided productions in detail.\n\nWait, from the user input, the productions are a mix. For example, NT68 -> 't12', which directly produces terminal t12. Similarly, NT60 -> 't49', and NT5->'t5'. So these indicate that some NTs directly produce a single 't' symbol.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I need to find a way to combine these 't's through the productions. Each production in the grammar either combines two non-terminals into another or a non-terminal into a terminal.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions are either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where B and C are non-terminals. This implies that in any parse step, all nodes are non-terminals except for the leaves, which are the terminals (the 't's in this case). So, each step in the parse consumes two non-terminals and produces another non-terminal until we reach the start symbol, which then produces the entire string as a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, but the initial start is typically S. Let me check the start productions:\n\nS -> NT61 NT59\nS -> NT29 NT9\n\nSo S produces two non-terminals, each of which is a combination of NTs. For example, NT61 and NT59. From the productions given, I can see that NT61 produces 't36' and NT59 produces 't46'. So S can produce 't36 t46', but our string starts with t38, so that doesn't match. Alternatively, the other S production is NT29 and NT9. NT29 produces 't62', and NT9 produces 't18'. So S -> NT29 NT9 would produce 't62 t18' as the first two terminals. But the string starts with t38, not t62 or t18. So perhaps neither of the start's initial productions lead directly to the first t38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built through more steps, combining other NTs. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if 't38' can be derived from some NT. Looking at the productions, which NTs produce 't38'? Looking through the production list, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't38'.

Hmm, that's problematic. If the string starts with t38, but there's no production that directly generates t38 from a non-terminal, then that would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Because each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal. So, to start with t38, there must be a production NT\u2192t38, but looking at the provided productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't38'.\n\nWait, let me double-check the productions for 't38'.\n\nLooking at the user-provided grammar, it's given that:\n\nNT54 -> 't64'\n\nBut is there an NT that produces 't38' directly?

That's conflicting. Wait, I might have misread. Let me parse it again.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the user's provided grammar, some entries are:\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT5 -> 't83'\nWait, that can't be right because a single NT can't produce two different terminals. So perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe I misread.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar more carefully:\n\nThe lines in the grammar are:\n\nNT68 -> 't12'\nNT60 -> 't49'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT47 -> 't73'\nNT88 -> 't42'\nNT18 -> 't66'\nNT5 -> 't58' (Wait, NT5 is supposed to have two productions? Or is this correct? Maybe it's a typo, and I should check the entire list carefully.)\n\nWait, perhaps the user input has duplicated some rules or mixed up the terminals. To avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to assume that each production is correct and that each NT is assigned a single production.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of production rules, some showing NTx \u2192 'ty'. For example:\n\n- NT88 -> 't42'\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n- NT23 -> 't13'\n\nAnd also:\n\n- NT58 -> 't95'\n- NT59 -> 't96'\n- NT55 -> 't19'\n- NT57 -> 't17'\n\nWait, but in the list, are there any NTs that produce 't38'? It doesn't seem so. For example, looking through the right-hand sides:\n\n- 't38' is present once as NT55 -> 't19', wait, no, 't19' is generated by NT55. Similarly, NT47 -> 't73', etc. I don't see any 't38' being produced directly by any NT in the provided production rules.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string cannot be generated because the first symbol 't38' can't be produced by any NT. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of production rules that derive non-terminals into other symbols, which can eventually result in terminal symbols or more non-terminals. The terminals in this grammar are strings like 't12', 't94', 't5', etc., as well as some non-terminals that seem to expand into these terminals. The string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t19 t96 t65 t3 t42 t94 t41`.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the top down using the grammar. That is, start with the start symbol S and see if we can generate the string through a series of expansions. Alternatively, we can use the reverse approach: try to reduce the string using the productions, working from the string upwards to see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nWait, but how do I know which approach is easier? Maybe starting from the start symbol and expanding it until I reach the string. Alternatively, starting from the string and trying to match productions from the end.\n\nLooking at the string: it's a sequence of seven tokens. Each token is a 't' followed by numbers. Let me list them:\n\nt19, t96, t65, t3, t42, t94, t41.\n\nI need to see if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nI notice that several non-terminals directly produce certain tokens. For example:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't60'\n- NT88 \u2192 't33'\n- NT23 \u2192 't79'\n- NT29 \u2192 't87', etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I see 't19', 't96', 't65', etc. I should check if any of these tokens have production rules.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I find that:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't13'\n- NT24 \u2192 't2' (Wait, no, checking the rules...

No.\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71' and 't47'? Wait, no. NT15 has production NT15 \u2192 't5'? No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's better to think in reverse: can the string be reduced using the given grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to simulate the derivation steps.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the string is a sequence of seven terminals, I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\n\nOR S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo first, S can be expanded into either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with 't19', which is a terminal. In the grammar, the only way to get a terminal is through a production that directly outputs that terminal. So to get 't19', it must come from a production that has a rule like A \u2192 't19'.\n\nBut looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't19'. The closest is NT19 \u2192 't0', which is different.\n\nWait, so 't19' isn't directly produced by any rule. That's a problem. Wait, looking through the rules again, in NT46 \u2192 't60'.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me look through all the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't19' directly. Hmm. So that's a red flag. If the string contains a terminal that isn't directly produced by any rule, then it's automatically not part of the language, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but I can also check if 't19' can be derived through a chain of productions. For example, if some NT produces another NT that produces 't19'. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through all the NT\u2192 productions, I see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't13', 't39', 't71', etc.\n\nBut none of them produce 't19'.\n\nWait, so perhaps the string cannot be generated because 't19' can't be derived. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all NT rules again.\n\nWait, I see this rule: NT47 \u2192 't18', and also NT47 \u2192 NT73?\n\nWait, no, the rules list includes:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\n\nNT15 \u2192 't48'?\n\nWait, no, let me parse each rule correctly.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which should make parsing easier. Let's start by analyzing the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the productions in the grammar. Each non-terminal (on the left side of the arrow) is only on the left in two places. For example, S -> NT61 NT59, and it's the only place where S appears. Similarly, NT47 -> NT58 NT95, and so on. This might mean that the grammar is a regular grammar or perhaps a right-linear grammar, but I'm not entirely sure. \n\nNext, the string starts with `t9`, which I assume is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I notice several NT followed by 't' and a number. For example, NT5 -> 't5', NT88 -> 't42', etc. So each NT with a number might produce a string that starts with 't' followed by another number. \n\nLet me map out the possible productions that produce 't*number' strings. For example, NT5 -> 't5', NT10 -> 't96'? Wait, no, looking back, I see that NT10 is not defined directly, but in the grammar, I see entries like NT5 -> 't5', NT9 -> 't10', or wait, no. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT5 -> 't5', NT8 -> 't25', NT19 -> 't0', NT2 -> 't64', NT73 -> 't53', etc. So each NT seems to produce a terminal followed by a number. Hmm.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of t... like `t9 t73 t86 ...`, and each of these must be produced by some NT. So, the string consists of tX where X is some number. I need to see if the grammar allows for the entire string to be derived by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet me consider how the string is structured:\n\n1. `t9`: Looking at the grammar, NT9 -> 't10' (from the list: NT93 -> 't72', wait no, earlier I thought NT9 wasn't in the given grammar. Wait, I need to be precise. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar includes:\n- NT9 -> NT10 NT17, but I don't see NT9 -> 't10' or anything. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, no. Looking carefully, I see that NT9 -> NT10 NT17. Then NT10 -> 't96'? No, looking back:\n\nWait, the list is a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe first few lines are:\nS -> NT61 NT59\nS -> NT29 NT9\nThen NT47 -> NT58 NT95, etc.\n\nLooking for 't*' in the right-hand side, for example, NT47 -> 't48' or similar. Wait, actually, the first entry after S is S -> NT61 NT59. Then looking for NT definitions:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I notice:\n\nNT5 -> 't5', NT8 -> 't25', NT19 -> 't0', NT2 -> 't64', NT73 -> 't53', etc. Also, there's NT24 -> 't39' and NT29 -> 't62', etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have `t9 t73 t86 t54 t94 t73 t0 t9`. So each tX is a terminal. So I need to see if each tX can be derived from some NT.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t9: Is there any NT such that NT -> t9? From the list, I don't see any NT directly producing t9. For example, looking through NT9 -> NT10 NT17. So NT9 is broken into other non-terminals. Similarly, NT2 is produced as t64, but that doesn't help here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the NT productions are rules that can be followed to derive 'tX' eventually. But each NT is made up of two other NTs, except for some that produce terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have rules like NT5 -> t5, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT19 -> t0, and several others.\n\nSo in the given string, each 'tX' must be the result of a direct production from some NT. So looking for which NTs produce which 'tX's.\n\nLet me list the 'tX' in the string: t9, t73, t86, t54, t94, t73, t0, t9.\n\nSo for each of these, I need to find if there exists an NT that directly produces them.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- t5: NT5\n- t25: NT8\n- t2: NT2\n- t0: NT19\n- t53: NT73\n- t94: NT65, etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT8 -> 't25'\nNT19 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't64' \u2014 no, wait, in the list, it's NT2 -> 't64'? Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar list, I see:\nNT2 -> NT52 NT86, and also, wait, let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, under the grammar, NT2 is defined as: NT2 -> 't64'? No, actually, looking at the grammar more accurately, here's a line: NT2 -> 't64' \u2014 yes. So NT2 produces t64. So in the string, t9 is present, but where does t9 come from? From the list, I don't see any NT directly producing t9. So that's a problem because the string includes 't9', which isn't the result of any direct production in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check all the productions for 'tX' where X is a single digit:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT65 -> 't51' (line: NT65 -> 't51')\nWait, so NT65 -> 't51', which is different.\nWait, wait, perhaps I should look for NTs that produce each 'tX':\n\nLooking through each entry:\n\n1.

The grammar provided has all such productions, so that's a good start.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of 't' tokens followed by numbers.

So the last token 't65' is part of a production from NT65?\n\nWait, looking for 't65' production: I don't see any rule where NT65 produces a terminal. Wait, let's check all the 't' productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5', 't56'\n- NT65 -> 't32'\n- NT19 -> 't0' and 't9' \u2014 Oh, NT19 can produce 't0' which is the first token in the string.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't0', which would have to be from a production where the non-terminal derived is 't0'.

Also, looking for NT88: NT88 \u2192 't25', so we need to have something producing 't25' and then 't65' from NT60.\n\nSo, we can have NT88 produce 't25' and NT60 produce 't65'.

Let me start by recalling that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals:\n- NT6 -> 't74'\n- NT66 -> 't95'\n- NT54 -> 't64'\n- And others like NT19, NT28, etc., have rules leading to terminals.\n\nThe string ends with 't64', which comes from the rule NT54 -> 't64'. So, one of the non-terminals in the string must be NT54.\n\nNow, let's break down the string step by step:\n\n1. The string is: t87 t96 t60 t53 t62 t9 t49 t30 t9 t64.\n\n2. Let's map each token to the corresponding non-terminal:\n   - t87 comes from NT87 \u2192 t87 (NT87 is a terminal here).\n   - t96 comes from NT96 \u2192 t96.\n   - t60 comes from NT60 \u2192 t60 (but wait, in the grammar, NT60 has a rule NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52 and others. Oh, but in this case, it seems to map directly to 't60'? Let me check the rules. Indeed, NT60's rule includes 't60' via NT60 -> 't60'. Wait, no, looking again, the actual rule is NT60 -> 't49'. Hmm, no, wait that's under another part. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rule NT60 -> 't49' is present. So, NT60 maps to 't49', not 't60'. That's a bit confusing. Similarly, NT6 -> 't74', NT46 -> 't60', which means when a non-terminal like NT46 appears, it's replaced by 't60'.\n\nSo, for the string, let's list each token and see which non-terminal it comes from:\n\n- t87: NT87 \u2192 t87 (so NT87 is a terminal).\n- t96: NT96 \u2192 t96 (terminal).\n- t60: Look for a non-terminal that directly maps to 't60'. Checking the rules, NT46 \u2192 't60', so maybe the token 't60' comes from NT46.\n- t53: Check where 't53' comes from. Looking through the rules, NT73 \u2192 t53? Let me check: NT73's rule is NT73 \u2192 't53'. So 't53' is NT73.\n- t62: Check for NT62. The rule is NT62 \u2192 't12'. So 't62' is from NT62.\n- t9: NT9 \u2192 't9' (since NT9: NT9 \u2192 't23' wait, no. Wait, wait, looking again, I see NT9: NT9 \u2192 't18'? Wait no, actually, looking at the rules, NT9 is NT9 \u2192 't18', but also in another part, NT9 has a rule NT9 \u2192 NT23 NT29. Hmm, no, wait. Let me check the actual rules again.\n\nWait, the rules for NT9 are:\n- NT9 \u2192 't5' (I'm seeing NT5 \u2192 't74' but other NT rules. Wait, the actual rules: I think I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking again, the rule for NT9 is: NT9 \u2192 't18' (I think it's in the grammar as NT9: NT9 \u2192 't18'). So when a non-terminal is NT9, it's replaced by 't18'. So the token 't9' must come from NT9? Or wait, maybe another rule.\n\nWait, looking again, the rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n- NT9 \u2192 't18'\n\nSo NT9 can either produce 't18' or another NT. But 't9' is a terminal symbol, so it must come from a non-terminal that directly maps to it. Scanning the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't9'. Hmm, that's a problem because 't9' is in the string but I don't see a non-terminal mapping to 't9'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't0'\n- NT72 \u2192 't49'\n- NT59 \u2192 't35'\n- NT46 \u2192 't60'\n- NT73 \u2192 't53'\n- NT62 \u2192 't12'\n- NT67 \u2192 sometimes 't55' or 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't83'\n- NT17 \u2192 't46'\n- NT93 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't58' (but also 't83')\n- NT9 \u2192 't18'\n\nWait, so 't9' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal. That's a problem because the string has 't9', which suggests that it must come from some non-terminal that directly maps to 't9'. But none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't9'. So perhaps this string is invalid because 't9' isn't present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the rules. Let me check again: Oh, looking at the grammar, I see NT93: NT93 \u2192 't72', and NT72 \u2192 't49'. But no, 't9' isn't directly produced. So that token is impossible according to the grammar.\n\nSo if the string has 't9', which seems impossible according to the grammar, then the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I've misread any rule. scrolling through the rules again...\n\nWait, looking at the rule for NT93: it's mapped to 't72', and NT72's rule is mapped to 't49'. So NT93 can produce 't72', and so on. But none of the rules produce 't9' directly. Therefore, any occurrence of 't9' in the string must be incorrect, as per the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the given string includes 't9', which cannot be generated by the grammar.

Hmm, but in the string, the first token is t62. So how can we get t62?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking through the productions. Let me check again. Looking through the list, I find NT29 appears as:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n- NT29 \u2192 NT56 NT23 (I think I might have misread earlier)\n\nWait, no, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking through the production list:\n\nLooking for NT29, I find:\n\nNT29 -> NT14 NT86\nNT29 -> NT56 NT23\n\nWait, but I don't see any production where NT29 produces a terminal. Hmm, that's odd because the string starts with t62. So if NT62 isn't a terminal, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the mapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals in the string are part of the NTs. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t62 t18 t50 t42 t2 t37 t76 t66 t82 t60\n\nLet me list the terminals in order: t62, t18, t50, t42, t2, t37, t76, t66, t82, t60.\n\nSo I need to find a sequence of productions that, starting from S, can derive this string.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S can produce either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nLet's consider both options.\n\nFirst option: S \u2192 NT61 NT59.

Or perhaps a production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more systematic approach is better. Let's try to work from the string backward.\n\nEach token in the string must correspond to either a terminal in the grammar or be part of a derivation that ends with a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see which non-terminals can produce each terminal in the string.\n\nLet me list each terminal from the string and see what non-terminals can produce it.\n\n1. t62: Looking through the production rules, is there any non-terminal that can produce t62?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that ND88 \u2192 t42, NT24 \u2192 t2, CT29 \u2192 t56? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, looking through the production list, I see:\n\nWait, let's list all the non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the list, NT29 \u2192 t62? Wait, no, looking at the list, I don't see NT29 producing 't62'. But wait, in the production list, I see:\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed something.\n\nIn the production list:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT56 NT23\n- NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n\nSo no, NT29 doesn't produce a terminal directly.

{"custom_id":"request-196","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t79 t35 t41 t9 t76 t50 t42 t0 t28 t86 t79`, and the grammar is quite extensive with all these production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar here is already in that form except for the terminals appearing on the right-hand side of some productions. Wait, no, in CNF, the productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, and some produce terminals directly. So, it's a mix. Hmm, wait, actually, I might be confusing Early CNF, where all productions are like that. But in standard CNF, it's only A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, no mix. So, perhaps the given grammar is a mixed one because some rules have two non-terminals on the right, others have terminals.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. So, it must be that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Let me check a few rules. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Wait, no, that's two non-terminals. Similarly, NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\u2014again two non-terminals. So, yes, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNow, to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step, expanding non-terminals until only terminals remain, and the resulting string matches the given string.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can try to reconstruct a parse tree for the string and see if it's possible.\n\nThe string given is `t79 t35 t41 t9 t76 t50 t42 t0 t28 t86 t79`. Since all elements are terminals, the parse tree must expand into these.\n\nLet me note that each token is a terminal, either a 't' followed by a number, or a number on its own. Wait, looking back at the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce a terminal string, like NT5 \u2192 't5', so some rules directly produce a single 'tX' or multiple 't's.\n\nWait, no\u2014the grammar seems to have some rules that produce multiple terminals. For example, NT67 \u2192 't29' and possibly others, but looking closer, actually, many rules produce a single terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 't5', which is a single 't5'. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't58', etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, each 't' is a single terminal, so perhaps each step in the derivation must produce a single terminal or a combination that eventually leads to the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string needs to be written as a concatenation of terminals derived from the grammar. So, each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, either directly from a production or through a chain of productions.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production step will only produce non-terminals or two non-terminals. So, to get a terminal, we need a path of productions from S down to the terminal that produces it.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by building a derivation tree that results in the given string. Let's try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe string has 11 elements, so 11 terminals. In the grammar, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, in a derivation, each production either reduces the number of symbols by one (if a non-terminal is replaced by two, increasing the count by one) or keeps it the same if a terminal is introduced.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either has two non-terminals (increasing the count by one) or a terminal (leaving the count as is). So, the total number of symbols in the string must be matched by the number of steps. Let's see: Starting with S, which is a single non-terminal. Each application of a CNF production either produces two non-terminals (so count increases by 1) or a terminal (count remains the same). So, to reach N terminals, starting from 1, the number of steps must be N-1 if all are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in our case, the string has 11 terminals. So, from S, we would need to apply 10 productions that either produce non-terminals, and then each of those eventually produce terminals, or perhaps some combination.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string as a leftmost derivation, or use another method like checking if it's a valid string by looking up a parser or using the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is large, that might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if each 't' in the string is a terminal that appears as a production in the grammar. Wait, no; for example, the string starts with 't79', so is there a production for NT79? Looking back at the grammar, I see that NT79 has a rule NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52. Wait, okay, so 't79' itself is not a production, but its non-terminal, so 't79' can't appear as a terminal in the string unless it's derived through a production that results in it being a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal strings directly. For example, NT5 \u2192 't5', NT6 \u2192 't6', etc. So, 't5' can be generated by NT5, and 't6' by NT6, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I see 't79', so does NT79 produce any terminals directly? From the grammar, I see NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52. Both NT36 and NT52 produce other non-terminals, like NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78, and NT52 \u2192 multiple rules, some producing terminals like 't42', 't54', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is impossible because the first token is 't79', but there's no production for NT79 that directly produces a terminal. All rules for NT79 are to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. Looking at NT79, I see:\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52.\n\nBoth NT36 and NT52 produce rules. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78. Then NT6 \u2192 't6', and NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7. Let's see NT93 is 't72', and NT7 is 't83', so NT78 would produce 't72 t83'. So, NT36 \u2192 t6 followed by 't72 t83', so 't6 t72 t83'. Then NT52 has several rules, one of which is NT52 \u2192 't42'.\n\nSo, putting it together, if NT79 is expanded, it leads to NT36 and NT52, which further expand, and so on. But in the given string, the first element is 't79', so that would have to be produced directly, which isn't possible because NT79's production only leads to non-terminals. Unless NT79 can lead directly to a terminal string, which it doesn't. Therefore, the string cannot start with 't79', meaning it's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check all rules that directly produce a single terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 't5', NT6 \u2192 't6', etc. So, some non-terminals do produce single terminals. But for NT79, it's not a terminal and only produces other non-terminals. Therefore, 't79' cannot appear as a terminal in the string unless it's a production that eventually expands to a terminal, but since the first element is 't79', it's impossible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check if any NT rule can directly produce 't79'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52: two non-terminals.\n- Any other production for NT79? No, it's only that one.\n\nSo, no production for NT79 that produces a single terminal. Therefore, 't79' cannot appear in any string generated by this grammar. Therefore, the given string is invalid because it starts with 't79', which can't be produced.\n\nWait, but let me look at other rules just in case. For example, does NT93 \u2192 't72'?

CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or two terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided.

Oh, wait, no rules have NT86 as the start, but in the rules list, I see:\n\nNT55 \u2192 't5', NT46 \u2192 't60', NT67 \u2192 't53', etc.\n\nWait, actually, there are some rules where both sides are terminals, like NT5 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't83', NT5 \u2192 't94', etc. But the main point is that certain non-terminals produce specific two-digit strings.\n\nSo, for 't86', I need to see which non-terminals produce it. Looking through the rules:\n\n- In rule NT56 \u2192 't51', NT95 \u2192 't94', NT88 \u2192 't72', NT47 \u2192 't18', NT68 \u2192 't83', NT14 \u2192 't2', NT93 \u2192 't72', etc.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't51', but that's 51, not 86. Wait, looking for 't86' in any production.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT60 \u2192 't65', NT67 \u2192 't31', etc.\n\nWait, no rules have a production for a non-terminal directly producing 't86', but maybe a non-terminal can derive it through several steps. Alternatively, perhaps 't86' can be reached via a sequence of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a series of terminals that can be derived by starting from S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet's attempt a leftmost derivation.\n\nThe start symbol is S.\n\nFrom the grammar, S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo first, S expands to NT61 NT59.\n\nNow, each of these NTs needs to be expanded. Let's see what NT61 and NT59 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT61: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.\n\nThen, NT33 can produce 't32' or other non-terminals, but looking for 't33' from NT33? Wait, the rules for NT33 are: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65, and so on. That seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to eventually reach the terminals.\n\nWait, but our string starts with 't86', which might come from a non-terminal downstream. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model each terminal as being the result of a specific non-terminal, and then build a parse tree.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to check for each terminal if there's a path in the grammar that can produce it, considering the structure of the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt86, t18, t62, t18, t95, t86, t80, t19, t83, t94, t33.\n\nFor each, check if any non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- t5: from NT5 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't83', NT5 \u2192 't94'\n\n- t18: NT18 \u2192 't66', wait no, looking at the rules, NT18 is 't66'? Or is there a rule where NT18 appears?\n\nWait, let me look for NT18. The rules list includes:\n\nNT18: looking for any production. In the given rules, I see NT18 \u2192 't36'? Wait, checking:\n\nThe rules include NT18 \u2192 't66'? Let me parse the list.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't66' (in the list: NT18 -> 't36')? No, wait, in the initial list, the rule is:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't66' ?\n\nWait, in the full list, I see:\n\nIn the rules, for example, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28, NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT67, NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86.\n\nWait, the rule for NT18 is at the end: NT18 \u2192 't36'? Or is that another rule.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nAt the end of the rules:\n\nNT18 -> 't66'\n\nYes, so NT18 produces 't66' as well as other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the list, I see:\n\n\"NT73 -> 't53'\", but looking for NT18.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT18: 't66'\n\nSo NT18 \u2192 't66', but also appears in other productions.\n\nSo, if a non-terminal NT18 is present in the string, and it can derive 't66', that could match.\n\nBut in our string, there's 't18', which is not 't66', so how would that work?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the rules. Maybe NT18 is in the rules as 't66', but the string has 't18'. That would mean that NT18 cannot produce 't18' directly, so maybe the 't18' comes from another non-terminal that eventually produces it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built from a sequence of NTs that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-217","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the string `t87 t41 t99 t63 t86 t65 t63 t64 t41 t96 t48 t95` is generated by the given grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I think I should try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules. Each token in the string must be matched by a production's right-hand side. Let's list the tokens for clarity: t87, t41, t99, t63, t86, t65, t63, t64, t41, t96, t48, t95.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are several rules that directly produce terminals (like 'tX'), such as NT2 -> t64, NT6 -> t74, and others. So, I can start by matching the first token t87.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT67 and NT87 are production rules. For example, NT78 -> t63 (t63 is the same as 't63'), so that might be useful.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with the string: t87 t41 t99 t63 t86 t65 t63 t64 t41 t96 t48 t95.\n\nI know that the top-level rule is S -> NT59 NT61 or S -> NT29 NT9.\n\nWait no, looking at the top two rules:\n\n1. S -> NT61 NT59\n2. S -> NT29 NT9\n\nSo, S can produce either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nI think the string starts with t87, which isn't a terminal in the initial S. So perhaps the starting symbol S is expanded into two non-terminals (like NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9). Then each of those can be expanded further until they reach terminals.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of tX's, which are terminals. So the parse tree must consist of the root S, which splits into two non-terminals, each of which must expand into a sequence of tX's.\n\nLet's see the possible NT productions and their terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT67 -> NT53 NT14 (Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I need to list all NT productions that directly produce a terminal.)\n\nLet me scan the grammar for rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t25\n- NT10 -> t96\n- NT14 -> t48\n- NT15 -> t87\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t87. Let me check the grammar for NT15: NT15 -> t87? Wait, no. Looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for where NT produces a terminal (like 'tX').\n\nLooking through the grammar, some NT rules produce a single terminal. For example:\n\n- NT55 -> t5\n- NT58 -> t95\n- NT7 -> t83\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t25\n- NT10 -> t96\n- NT14 -> t48\n- NT15 -> t87? Or does NT15 have a production that includes a terminal?\n\nWait, looking carefully, many of the rules have a terminal as one of the right-hand side's components, but not necessarily as a single production. For example, NT15 might produce something like NT58 NT95, but NT58 -> t95, and NT95 is another NT rule that perhaps produces something else. Wait, looking back:\n\nI think I need to build a list of NT productions where the RHS includes a terminal. It's possible that a non-terminal can produce a terminal by having a rule that includes a terminal and another non-terminal, but the problem is that the initial productions don't have a single terminal except in cases where a rule directly produces a terminal, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT production that directly produces a single terminal like tX. Instead, all the NT rules seem to produce two other NT symbols, except a few that may produce a terminal and another NT.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, some rules have a terminal and a non-terminal. For example:\n\n- NT46 -> t60 NT33\n- NT88 -> t72 NT28\n- NT77 -> t79 NT61\n- And so on.\n\nSo each NT production might have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Therefore, when expanding, we might get a terminal followed by another NT or something similar.\n\nNow, the string starts with t87. So, I need to find a production for some NT that can start with t87. Looking through the productions, I see that NT15 has a production: NT15 -> NT58 NT95. Both NT58 and NT95 are non-terminals, so that doesn't help here.\n\nWait, let's go through each NT rule to see if any have a terminal in their RHS when expanded.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 -> NT32 NT72, where NT32 and NT72 are non-terminals.\n- NT32 -> NT18 NT65\n- NT72 -> NT49 NT55\n- NT49 -> ?\nWait, perhaps I should look for any NT production that includes 't' as a terminal in the RHS.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t25\n- NT10 -> t96\n- NT14 -> t48\n- NT15 -> t87? Or is that a production? Wait, looking through all the NT rules, let me check if any of them produce a terminal.\n\nWait, I think I need to look for any NT production where the RHS is a terminal, but I don't think that's the case. Instead, many NT rules have two non-terminals, but some have a mix.\n\nSo, starting over, perhaps the first token t87 can be generated by an NT production that eventually leads to t87.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 -> NT58 NT95\n\nWait, but perhaps NT15 has a production that includes t87. Let me check all NT rules:\n\nLooking for any NT rule that has 't87' as part of the RHS.\n\nWait, no NT rule directly produces t87.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's check each rule again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT67 -> NT53 NT14 (no t)\n- NT87 -> t48 NT95 (Hmm, here we go! NT87 -> t48 NT95. So NT87 can produce a terminal t48 and another NT95.)\n\nSo, if a production has a terminal on the left, we can potentially expand it as a terminal, and the other non-terminal needs to produce something else.\n\nWait, but t48 is a terminal, so if a production is something like NT15 -> t48 NT95, that would mean that NT15 can produce t48 followed by the expansion of NT95. Wait, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't48' directly. Let's see:\n\nLooking for any NT rule that has 't48' in the RHS:\n\nYes! NT14 -> t48 \n\nBecause in the list:\n\n- NT14 -> t48\n\nAh, so NT14 produces the terminal t48. That's one possibility.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The grammar for NT14 is:\n\nNT14 -> t48\n\nYes, that's a rule. So NT14 can produce the terminal t48.\n\nNow, looking back at the string: The first token is t87.\n\nSo, perhaps the first NT in the string must be NT87, which expands to t48 NT95.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT87 with t48. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking again, one of the NT rules is:\n\n- NT87 -> t48 NT95\n\nWait, yes, I see: NT87: NT87 -> t48 NT95 (assuming it's correctly written). In the list of rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT87:\n\nNT87 -> t48 NT95 ?\n\nWait, looking back through the list:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT87 -> t48 NT95\n\nThat's the production for NT87. So, the production is NT87 can produce t48 followed by another non-terminal, NT95.\n\nThen, the expansion for the first token t87 (t48) comes from NT87.

{"custom_id":"request-216","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine if the string \"t19 t73 t12 t74 t19 t9 t39 t28 t39 t80 t16 t36\" is generated by it. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a context-free grammar where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59 means it's two non-terminals generating S. Other productions like NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95 and NT6 -> t74 (where t is a terminal) fit this structure.\n\nThe string provided is composed mostly of terminals starting with 't'. Each 't' is followed by a number, which is two digits except for 't9' (I assume it's 't9' and not 't09' or something). So, the string is a sequence of these terminals: t19, t73, t12, t74, t19, t9, t39, t28, t39, t80, t16, t36.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. The string has 12 terminals, so the derivation would involve 11 steps where each step replaces exactly one non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each step can only derive one non-terminal into two others. So, for a string of length 12 (12 terminals), the derivation would require a parse tree of height 11 (since each step adds one node to the depth). Alternatively, it's about the number of productions used in the derivation, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe focusing on how each terminal in the string corresponds to a production would make more sense.\n\nLet me list all the nodes in the grammar that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the given productions, every production where the left-hand side is a non-terminal and the right-hand side includes 't' as a terminal. Each of these terminals is a leaf in the parse tree, so each must correspond to a production that directly produces it.\n\nLet me list these productions:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 t74 (Production 65)\n2. NT2 \u2192 t64 (Production 27)\n3. NT4 \u2192 t48 (Production 2)\n4. NT59 \u2192 t46 (Production 49)\n5. NT7 \u2192 t83 (Production 74)\n6. NT1 + others \u2192 various.

{"custom_id":"request-240","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string can be derived from the grammar. The string is `t3 t83 t25 t54 t48 t30 t60 t16 t99 t12 t54 t33 t33`, which is a sequence of tokens. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, every step in the derivation only replaces a single non-terminal with two others, which could be non-terminals or terminals. Importantly, the start symbol can't be a terminal, so the first step must produce something else.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only start symbol is S. The initial productions for S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo, any valid derivation must start with either NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9. Each of these NTs will then be expanded further according to the given rules.\n\nNow, let's parse the string step by step. The string is a series of tokens, which I believe correspond to terminal symbols in the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So, I need to see if the string can be formed by expanding non-terminals into sequences of terminals.\n\nLet's break down the string token by token:\n\n1. t3\n2. t83\n3. t25\n4. t54\n5. t48\n6. t30\n7. t60\n8. t16\n9. t99\n10. t12\n11. t54\n12. t33\n13. t33\n\nI need to see if these terminals can result from a proper derivation starting from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation will involve multiple steps where each non-terminal produces exactly two others until all are terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards. Starting with the string, can I find a sequence of reductions that leads back to the start symbol S through the grammar productions?\n\nEach reduction would involve taking two consecutive tokens and seeing if they can be replaced by a non-terminal according to any production rule. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, so when I look at the string, each pair of consecutive tokens should correspond to the expansion of some non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in a derivation, the number of symbols can increase. However, since the string has 13 tokens, I need to see if they can be grouped into the correct structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a leftmost derivation, so we start with S and expand to two symbols, each of which may expand further.\n\nLet me try to look for possible starting points. The first step could be S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t3. Let's check the productions of NT61 and NT59.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 and NT59 \u2192 NT46 NT33.\n\nWait, but in the given productions, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and NT59 \u2192 NT46 NT33. So to get a terminal, NT61 needs to be expanded, but looking at NT33, in the grammar, NT33 can produce t32 or t79 or t27 or t18 or t32, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, some of the NTs have terminals. For example, looking through the productions, NT65 is listed as NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65, which is a left recursion. But others have direct terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all NTs and their possible expansions to see if the tokens in the string can be derived.\n\nLet me start by listing the productions for each NT:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\n- NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n- NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\n- NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 (left recursion)\n- NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\n- NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96\nWait, I notice that NT65 has two productions: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 and NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96. The first is a left recursion which might cause issues, but in a correct derivation, this could loop back. But for our purposes, we can choose which production to take.\n\nBut more importantly, looking at the string, the first token is t3. So perhaps it's derived from an NT that produces t3 somewhere. But looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces t3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for any NT that can produce t3 as a terminal directly. Scanning through the grammar, none of the NTs seem directly to produce t3. The productions are either to other NTs or to some t's but not all t's are in the string.\n\nWait, for example, NT93 has a production to 't72' and 't2', so NT93 can produce t72 or t2. Similarly, NT60 \u2192 't49' and 't52', so it can produce t49 or t52. NT5 \u2192 't5', nt58 \u2192 't95', etc.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t3. Maybe I need to find an NT that can produce t3 as a terminal. Let me scan through the NTs:\n\nLooking for any NT production that ends with t3. Oh wait, looking at the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produce t3. So the first token is t3, which is not the start symbol, so perhaps it's coming from NT33 or another NT that can produce t3.\n\nWait, no, looking through the grammar, for example, NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72 or NT32. Hmm. NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. NT18 \u2192 t36. Wait, this might be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that I'm not looking correctly. Let me check the grammar more thoroughly.\n\nLooking through all the productions, is there any NT that can produce t3? For example, looking for NT3, but I don't see any NT3 in the productions. The productions all either start with NT47, NT79, etc. So perhaps t3 is not derivable, which would imply that the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But that would make the answer 'No'.\n\nBut wait, am I sure? Let me check more carefully. Perhaps the NT that can produce t3 is somewhere. Let me think again. Looking at NT65, it has two productions: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 and NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96. NT10 is a non-terminal, so perhaps it can expand further. But looking through the grammar, NTT10 \u2192 NT71 NT47? Wait, no, NTT10's production isn't listed in the grammar. Wait, looking through the grammar list, is there an NT10? Wait, the list only shows items like NT15, NT29, etc., but I don't see NT10 as a production. So perhaps NT10 doesn't exist, or maybe it's a typo.\n\nWait, maybe the NT's production is NT5 \u2192 't5' and so on. So in this grammar, perhaps t3 is not an option. Looking at the given NT productions, I can't find any that produce t3, so if the string has t3 as the third token, it might not be derivable.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t3 as the first token. That means in the derivation, the first step must be producing a terminal t3, but as I can't find any NT that directly produces t3, that would mean the string is invalid.\n\nHowever, I might be wrong because perhaps after some expansions, an NT somewhere can produce t3 as part of an indirect expansion. Maybe through a chain of productions, but given that the grammar doesn't have any NT that directly outputs t3, I think it's safe to say that the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure of the grammar or the string. Let me check again. The output is `t3 t83 t25 t54 t48 t30 t60 t16 t99 t12 t54 t33 t33`. So it's 13 tokens. Maybe it's better to see if any path in the grammar could produce this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map the string to possible non-terminals. For example, the first token t3, if it comes from a production like NT33 \u2192 t3 something? But I don't see any NT that produces t3. So, unless there's an NT that can produce t3 through a series of steps, the string can't be generated.\n\nAnother"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it mostly fits, except some have more than two non-terminals on the right side. Wait, no, actually, many production rules have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT61 NT65. But some have one, like NT68 \u2192 't12'. So, the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which correspond to the terminals in the grammar. So, each token in the string is a terminal.

Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 't49', 't65', 't84', 't94'. So, there's no direct production for t60. But in the string, the first token is t60, so that would have to be produced by a rule where NT60 \u2192 some production that leads to t60, but since it's a direct terminal, I need to see if there's a rule where NT60 is replaced by 't60' or if there's a way to derive it through other rules.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT60 \u2192 't60', so that's not directly possible. Maybe it's derived from a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the initial rule has to combine multiple non-terminals, and one of those non-terminals is NT60, which might be expanded into 't60' via another rule.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT61 NT65. So maybe the string starts with NT61 and NT65, which might expand to other non-terminals that can eventually produce the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be built by considering the productions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as S \u2192 NT61 NT65, and then each of those can produce other non-terminals, which eventually produce the terminals.\n\nBut since the string starts with t60, I need to find a way to get t60 from the start. Let me look for any production paths that start with NT60.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT60 appears in several productions:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52\nNT60 \u2192 NT67 NT65\nNT60 \u2192 NT58 NT23\n\nWait, none of these produce 't60' directly. So, to get t60, one of the non-terminals that produce it must terminate with t60. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any direct 't60' production. So that's a problem. Because the first symbol in the string is t60, which can't be produced directly unless there's a production rule for NT60 that produces t60, which I don't see.\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see a production where NT60 is replaced by 't60'; instead, the terminals come from other NTs like NT68, NT52, etc. So, that means the string can't start with t60 because there's no production that directly produces t60 from NT60.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe NT60 can be part of a longer chain where one of its expansions leads to t60. For example, if NT60 can produce another non-terminal that can eventually produce t60. But looking through the rules, I don't see any such path. All the productions of NT60 lead to two non-terminals, and none of their expansions lead to t60.\n\nFor example, take NT60 \u2192 NT65 NT65. Each NT65 can produce, say, 't65' or 't49', etc. But that doesn't help because the string starts with t60, which isn't a terminal for NT60.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again to see if any of the NT symbols can directly produce t60.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT60 has productions to 't49', 't65', 't84', etc., but not t60. The other non-terminals, like NT68, might produce t60 if they have a rule NT68 \u2192 't60', but I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking through the 't' rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5', 't18', 't53', 't64', etc.\n- NT65 \u2192 't32', 't35', etc.\n- NT93 \u2192 't72', 't94', etc.\n- NT68 \u2192 't12', 't83', 't16', etc.\n- NT60 \u2192 't49', etc.\n\nI don't see any rule that produces 't60'. So, if the string starts with t60, that's only possible if there's a production for NT60 that outputs 't60', which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the string starts with a non-terminal that can produce t60 via other means. For example, if there's a production S \u2192 something that includes NT60, and then that NT60 can produce a combination that eventually leads to t60.\n\nBut looking at S's productions, S \u2192 NT61 NT65, and NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, etc. It seems like all these start from the start and expand into other non-terminals, none of which directly produce t60.\n\nWait, perhaps the string's first symbol t60 is part of a larger expansion from a different non-terminal. For instance, maybe there's a rule where another non-terminal can produce a sequence starting with t60, but given the structure, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar rules, seeing if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nBut given that the first token is t60 and I can't find a production for NT60 that produces t60, it might be impossible. Therefore, the answer could be 'No' because the first symbol can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again the grammar rules for NT60:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT60 has several productions:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52\n- NT60 \u2192 NT67 NT65\n- NT60 \u2192 NT58 NT23\n\nAnd none of these produce 't60' directly. So if the string starts with t60, it's impossible because NT60 can't produce it.\n\nWait, but perhaps the starting symbol S can lead to another path that includes t60. Let me think: S can produce NT61 NT65. Each of those can produce other non-terminals. For example, NT61 \u2192 NT68 NT55, and NT68 \u2192 't12' or 't83', and so on. None of these seem to produce t60.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long, but that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-256","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure this out. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars can be tricky, but since it's in CNF, each production rule produces two non-terminals, except for the terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT61 and NT59. NT61 then goes to NT33 and NT55, and so on. Looking at the production rules, some of them are terminals like 't12', 't18', etc. So, these are the terminal symbols, and others like NT are non-terminals.\n\nThe string given is `t12 t18 t25 t13 t33 t9 t19 t28 t49 t54 t94 t51 t12 t65`. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nChomsky normal form grammars are parsed using a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol and expanding until we reach the terminals. Since this is a small string, maybe I can manually trace a possible derivation path.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. The string has 14 tokens, so each step in the derivation should produce two tokens, right? Alternatively, each step could produce more if there are non-terminals, but in CNF, each production is two symbols.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is either a terminal pair or two non-terminals. So each step can either introduce two terminals or two non-terminals, which then each may produce their own expansions. So the process can be a bit deeper.\n\nBut let's see. The string is 14 tokens, so it must have an even number of steps because each production in CNF adds two symbols (if replacing a non-terminal) or replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. Hmm, but in the end, we get all terminals, so the number of symbols must be a result of the expansion steps.\n\nWait, but each production adds at most one non-terminal, so the total number of symbols is 2^n, where n is the number of steps. So 14 is not a power of two, so that suggests that perhaps the string is not generated by this grammar, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a derivation that matches the string. Let's start by looking at the first few tokens: t12, t18, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT65 goes to NT66 NT23, but that might not help here. Let's see which non-terminals could directly produce t12. Looking through the rules, NT6->t74, NT2->t64, NT7->t83, NT27->t7 t28, NT68->t83, NT23->t3, NT22->NT2 NT67, and others. Wait, looking at NT28: the rule is NT28->t63, but that's t63, not t12. Oh, wait, looking back: NT68 -> t83, NT28->t63, and another rule says NT23->t3. Hmm.\n\nWait, also, NT52: look for NT52's productions. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT52 is present in NT65 -> NT10 NT96, and other places. Wait, in the grammar, NT52 -> t42 is a rule. Also, in NT67 -> NT57 NT28, and looking at NT57->t51, so NT57 is another terminal. But in the string, I see t54 which is derived from NT29->t9 t62, perhaps? Let me go step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to figure out the possible expansions step by step starting from the start symbol S.\n\nS -> NT61 NT59\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\nNT33 -> NT18 NT65\nNT18 -> t36\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is t12, then t18, so NT18 should produce t36, but we have t12 next, which might come from another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me map each token in the string to possible production rules.\n\nLooking at t12: which NT production leads to t12? Let's see the rules:\n\nLooking through the RTD: NT2 -> t64, NT27->t7 t28, NT68->t83, NT56->t9, NT67->NT31 NT28, NT20->t73 t73, NT58->t95, NT61->NT33 NT55, NT65->t32, NT93->t72, NT68->t83, NT60->t49, NT5->t5, NT77->t79, and others. Hmm, I don't see any production directly matching t12 except in some NT68 rules? Wait, looking again.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see: NT2->t64, which is token 64. But in the string, the token is t12. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules for any terminal being t12.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83' \u2192 t83\n- NT60 -> 't49' \u2192 t49\n- NT5 -> 't5' \u2192 t5\n- NT47 -> 't73'\n- NT88 -> 't72'\n- NT93 -> 't72'\n- NT65 -> 't32'\n- NT83 -> 't46'\n- NT54 -> 't64'\n- NT55 -> 't19'\n- NT59 -> 't46'\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n- NT87 -> 't48'\n- NT62 -> 't12'\nAh, here's one: NT62->'t12'.\n\nSo NT62 can produce t12, which would be the first token in the string. So in the derivation, somewhere we must have NT62, which then becomes t12.\n\nThen, the string starts with t12, so the first non-terminal must expand to NT62.\n\nSo looking back at S->NT61 NT59, but in the string, the first symbol is t12, which comes from NT62. So maybe S is part of a different expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up where NT62 can be derived. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT62 -> 't12' is the production.\n\nSo if in the derivation, NT62 is a symbol that can appear. Then, in the string, the first token is t12, so at some point, the start symbol S would have to derive to a structure that eventually produces t12 in the first position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be produced by S first expanding to NT62 NT59 or something else? Wait, no, because S's only production is NT61 NT59. So S can't directly produce NT62, because S is NT61 and NT59. Therefore, to have t12 as the first symbol, the first NT must somehow derive t12, but S starts as NT61 and NT59.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to build the entire parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try.\n\nThe string is: t12 t18 t25 t13 t33 t9 t19 t28 t49 t54 t94 t51 t12 t65.\n\nThis is 14 symbols, so the derivation must involve several steps where each non-terminal expands into two symbols, possibly non-terminals, until all terminal symbols are used.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo the first expansion is S \u2192 NT61 NT59, which corresponds to t12 t18... So maybe NT61 needs to derive t12 as the first symbol. Wait, but in the initial production, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so if NT61 can produce a terminal and NT59 produces another, perhaps the first token is NT61's first symbol. But according to the string, the first token is t12.\n\nLooking for where NT61 can expand to t12. Looking through the grammar, does any production for NT61 result in t12? Let's look.\n\nLooking at NT61, its only production is NT61 -> NT33 NT55. So NT61 can't produce t12 directly. Therefore, how does t12 get produced?\n\nWait, maybe the first t12 comes from a different non-terminal, not directly from NT61.

The string is \"t79 t36 t2 t65 t60 t9 t87 t86 t41 t48 t48 t73 t39 t62\".\n\nChomsky normal form means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

NT46 \u2192 't79'. So when NT46 is expanded, it produces t79.\n\nSimilarly, NT36 \u2192 t36, NT2 \u2192 't64' (Wait, looking for t36, is there any production that produces t36?)\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78 (from line: NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78)\n\nWait, but in the string, after t79 comes t36. So perhaps in the derivation, the NT46 (which becomes t79) is followed by NT36 (which becomes t36). But we need to see if that's possible.\n\nWait, but to derive t79, we need NT46 \u2192 't79' which is in the last line.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar:\n\nYes, line: NT46 \u2192 't79'\n\nSo NT46 can be directly expanded to t79.\n\nAlso, NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78. So NT36 is composed of NT6 and NT78. Now, do these have terminal expansions?\n\nLooking for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t74? Let me check.\n\nYes, looking through the lines:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\n\nSo NT6 can be expanded to t74, but in the string, after t36 comes t2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the string, the part after t36 is t2. So the sequence is t79, t36, t2,...\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's take it step by step.\n\nThe string is: t79 t36 t2 t65 t60 t9 t87 t86 t41 t48 t48 t73 t39 t62.\n\nSo after t46 (t79), the next token is t36.\n\nLooking at the grammar, how do we get t79 and t36?\n\nIf S can split into NT46 NT something else. Wait, but S starts as S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nBut in the string, the first part is t79, which is from NT46 \u2192 't79', so maybe after that comes t36, which is from NT36 \u2192 't36'. But where does NT36 come from?\n\nLooking at the top-level productions, none of them directly produce NT36. So perhaps S is not the starting point for this string. Wait, but the string starts with t79, which is an expanded non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another production branches off from S to produce more non-terminals that eventually derive to the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this by trying to build the parse tree from the string upwards, checking if each symbol can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the top symbol S.\n\nOption"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But wait, maybe there's a better approach. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to parse it from right to left because CFGs can handle this using the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do it manually since the string isn't too long.\n\nThe string I need to parse is: t60, t82, t36, t62, t9, t12, t54, t32, t41, t48, t63, t5, t53, t33, t82.\n\nLet me list out all the terminals in the string in order: t60, t82, t36, t62, t9, t12, t54, t32, t41, t48, t63, t5, t53, t33, t82.\n\nNow, I need to see if these can be generated by the grammar.

So t25 must come from some NT that has a production to t25. Let me check the productions for terminals starting with t25.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice NT59 \u2192 t46, and S \u2192 NT59. Also, NT59 is derived from S, so perhaps the string starts with S \u2192 NT59 and then some other NT that produces t25. Or maybe S \u2192 NT29 NT9, but let me think.\n\nWait, let me look for NTs that can produce t25. Scanning, I see NT8 \u2192 t25 in one of the productions. So NT8 can produce t25. So perhaps part of the string starts with NT8.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t25, which is from NT8, then NT8 must appear somewhere in the derivation. Let me see, NT8's productions: looking through the provided rules, I see NT8 \u2192 t2, but that's not t25. Wait, actually, the line: NT59 \u2192 t46. Hmm, maybe I missed. Let's check again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65, NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT65, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to trace back from t25. Let's see, how is t25 generated.\n\nLooking for NTs that have a production to t25: I see in the rules, NT8 \u2192 t2 and another line says NT8 \u2192 t60? Wait, looking back, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the line NT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29 is there, and NT29 \u2192 t62. But I'm looking for t25. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 t2 and other lines like NT8 \u2192 t49. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 t36\n- NT29 \u2192 t62\n- NT48 \u2192 t97\n- NT96 \u2192 t67\n- NT19 \u2192 t0\n- NT24 \u2192 t2\n- NT29 \u2192 t62\n- NT48 \u2192 t97\n- NT96 \u2192 t67\n- NT19 \u2192 t9\n- NT24 \u2192 t39\n- NT2 \u2192 t64\n- NT79 \u2192 t80\n- NT28 \u2192 t63\n- NT8 \u2192 t25\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT8 \u2192 t25. So to generate t25, the derivation must go through NT8 \u2192 t25.\n\nSo the string starts with t25, so the first part must come from NT8. Therefore, the non-terminal NT8 must be in the parse tree.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: I don't see any rules where NT8 is a non-terminal on the left side except its own production. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8's productions are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t2\n\nWait, so in the given rules, it seems NT8 only produces t2, but that's probably not correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me list all the NT rules:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t64\n- NT79 \u2192 t80\n- NT28 \u2192 t63\n- NT8 \u2192 t25\n\nSo yes, only those. So if the grammar says NT8 only produces t25, then how can the string start with t25? Because S can produce NT59 or NT29 NT9. So how does NT59 lead to t25?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe NT59 is somewhere on the left side. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59. Wait, so NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59, and NT48 \u2192 t97, and NT59 \u2192 t46.\n\nBut looking for how t25 is generated, maybe through another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with NT8 \u2192 t25. So how does S parse into that?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT29 NT9. NT29 \u2192 t62, and NT9 \u2192 t18? Or wait, checking NT9: in the rules, NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17, etc. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to see the entire string:\n\nThe string is: t25 t49 t82 t39 t12 t39 t64 t94 t49 t50 t32 t19 t64 t5 t49\n\nLet me break it down step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\n1. t25: This must come from NT8, as the only rule for NT8 is t25. So the first step is NT8 \u2192 t25.\n\nSo, we need to have NT8 in the parse tree, which comes from S.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S \u2192 NT29 NT9 or S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo, we can have S \u2192 NT29 NT9, and then NT29 must produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but the first terminal is t25, which is from NT8. So how does NT8 fit into this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT8 is the result of a derivation from some other NT.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT59, and NT59 \u2192 t46, but that's a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT59: in the rules, NT59 \u2192 t46. So yes, NT59 \u2192 t46. But t46 is a terminal, so if S \u2192 NT59, then the string would start with t46, but our string starts with t25. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT29 NT9, then perhaps NT29 could derive a string that includes t25, but NT29's first production is to t62. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is longer and requires a sub-derivation that eventually leads to t25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT8 is derived from another NT. Let me look for NTs that have a production to NT8.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT2 or NT39\n- NT24 \u2192 t2 or t39\n- NT29 \u2192 t62\n- NT59 \u2192 NT82\nWait, no, let me check all the NT rules for producing other NTs.\n\nWait, here's an important point. In the grammar, some NTs are terminals and some are non-terminals. Wait, no, in the given grammar, all the left-hand sides are non-terminals, but the right-hand sides can be either terminals or non-terminals. So, in our case, NT8 has a production to a terminal t25, but perhaps it's derived from another NT.\n\nWait, no, if NT8 is a non-terminal, it must have a production where it's split into two non-terminals. Let me look for NT8's productions.\n\nWait, in the given rules, the lines are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t2\n- NT8 \u2192 t60?\nWait, no, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me scan all the production rules:\n\nLooking through each line, NT8 appears in the rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t25\n- No other rules for NT8.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is a bit complex with a lot of production rules, so I need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the productions start with S and chain through various NT (non-terminal) symbols. Each rule splits into two NT symbols until we reach terminals or non-terminals that produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals immediately produce a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT65 -> 't32' (so NT65 is a terminal itself)\n- NT9 -> 't18' (so NT9 is a terminal)\n\nSimilarly, many other NT symbols produce 't' followed by a number. This suggests that the string we're evaluating consists of multiple terminals, and each terminal is produced by some NT production.\n\nThe string given is a series of t's followed by numbers, which I assume are the terminals derived from the grammar's NT productions. So each 't' and the number after it are likely the result of some production.\n\nNext, I need to check if the entire string can be derived from the grammar starting from S. That means each part of the string should be matched step by step through the productions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the string:\n\nt36 t3 t35 t13 t46 t99 t35 t48 t2 t76 t95 t72 t9 t49 t83 t35\n\nI notice that the string is a concatenation of 17 parts, each starting with 't' and a number. Each of these must correspond to some production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: the last part is t35. Let's see if there's a production that directly gives 't35'. Looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT33 -> NT58 NT22 (but 58 and 22 produce t52 and t14, etc.)\nWait, I'm looking for a production that gives t35 directly, but I don't see any NT that directly goes to 't35'. Hmm, maybe it's a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about building the parse tree for the string in reverse. The last symbol is t35, which is part of the string. Let's see what production rules can produce t35.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it step by step, trying to find how the string is built.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to model the derivation process. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals, so the derivation will involve breaking down each symbol into its components until we reach the leaves, which are the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals, perhaps I can model this as a tree and see if each path from the root to leaf can generate the string.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for some patterns or key steps in the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: it can produce either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So the string should start with one of these two pairs.\n\nWait, the string starts with t36 t3... Let's see what these could correspond to. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t36 or t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT67 -> 't67' (since NT67's rules only go to itself?) Wait, no. Let me check the rules:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see:\nNT60 -> 't65'\nNT65 -> 't32'\nNT83 -> 't28'\nNT68 -> 't83'\nNT93 -> 't62'\nNT58 -> 't52'\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's go through the terminals step by step.\n\nWait, first, t36 appears early. Let's check where NT36 appears.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n- NT36 -> NT6 NT78\nSo NT36 splits into NT6 and NT78.\n\nThen each of those needs to be either terminals or further split.\n\nLooking for NT6 and NT78.\n\nNT6: Looking through the rules, do I see NT6 anywhere? Not directly. Wait, let me check each rule.\n\nWait, actually, the first rules include:\nNT67 -> NT57 NT14\nNT57 -> NT17 NT27\nNT78 -> NT56 NT5\n... and so on. It seems NT6 isn't a non-terminal that splits into anything\u2014it's always a terminal. But in the grammar provided, I don't see any rule where NT6 is on the left side, so that means NT6 must produce a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but in the rules provided, I don't see any NT6 as a production. That suggests that NT6 is a terminal because it's not present in any production as the left-hand side. So NT6 -> tsomething, but the rule isn't present.\n\nWait, but I need to check all the rules. The rules provided are all for various NTs. So looking through the list of NTs:\n\n- NT66: 't58' (if present)\nWait, let's check each NT:\n\nLooking at the rules, the ones ending with 't' correspond to NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example:\nNT61 -> 't36' ?\n\nWait, no. Let's look:\n\nThe rules show:\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\nWhich would mean that NT61 splits into NT33 and NT55.\n\nNT33 is in another rule:\nNT33 -> NT32 NT72\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, I might be getting tangled here. Maybe I should list all the NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT55\n- NT33 -> NT32 NT72\n- NT32 -> NT18 NT65\n- NT65 -> 't32' ?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, the ones that produce 't' are:\n\nNT9 -> 't18'\nNT65 -> 't32' (from NT65 as NT32? Wait, no.)\n\nWait, I'm looking for rules where the result is a string like 't32', 't36', etc.\n\nFrom the rules provided:\n\nNT6 -> 't74'\n\nNT2 -> 't64'\n\nNT10 -> 't96'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5' (from NT5->'t5')\n\nNT24 -> 't2'\n\nWait, maybe I should list all NTs that produce a terminal:\n\n- NT6 -> 't74'\n- NT2 -> 't64'\n- NT10 -> 't96'\n- NT7 -> 't83'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT24 -> 't2'\n- NT58 -> 't52'\n- NT65 -> 't32'\n- NT54 -> 't64' (wait, no, check the rules: NT54 -> 't64'?)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, each production that ends with 't' followed by a number is a terminal production.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT65 -> 't32'\n\nNT67 -> 't57'\n\nNT58 -> 't66'\n\nNT55 -> 't5'\n\nNT66 -> 't58'\n\nWait, the key is that each production where the result is a single terminal is only in the list. So I need to find all NTs that directly produce 't' followed by a digit.\n\nSo, let's list all NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74' (from NT6 -> 't74')\n\nNT2 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT65 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT35 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, let me go through each rule step by step.

The steps would involve applying the production rules in reverse, starting from the start symbol S. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and according to the rules, S can produce NT61 NT59. So the initial expansion would split into NT61 and NT59. But wait, the first substring t28 t65 seems to come from other parts. Maybe it's derived through a series of steps.\n\nI'm noticing that some of the non-terminals directly expand into 't' followed by a number. For example, NT23 -> 't79', and so on. Others produce single symbols like t9, t25, etc. So, the approach is to see if the given string can be broken down into these terminal symbols using the production rules.\n\nLet me start by trying to parse the string backward, because it's often easier when dealing with CF grammars in Chomsky form since each production has at most two non-terminals.\n\nThe string is: t28 t65 t3 t48 t5 t87 t49 t33 t87 t65 t64 t94 t97 t53 t39 t13.\n\nLooking at the end, the last few symbols are t53 and t39, t13. I need to see if these can be derived from some non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I find NT53. Wait, is there an NT53 rule? Let me check: Wait, I don't see NT53 in the given productions. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. No, in the grammar, I see NT53 -> 't53'. Wait, no, actually, looking through the rules, I find:\n\nWait, let me scan the rules. For example, NT77 -> 't51', NT73 -> 't53', etc. So NT73 goes to t53. But in the string, the last part is t53. How was that achieved?\n\nWait, t53 comes from NT73: NT73 -> 't53'. So t53 must come from NT73.\n\nThen, before that, we have t39 t13. Let's see: t13 comes from NT13, which is the terminal. And t39 comes from NT39. But looking through the rules, do we have NT39 defined? I check and don't see it. Wait, maybe NT39 is part of another rule. Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT39 expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Or maybe t39 comes from another rule.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT42 -> 't36', NT36 -> 't32' and so on. Let me see. Hmm, looking through the rules, I'm trying to find how t39 is derived. Let me check: 't39' comes from NT39. Is there a production for NT39? Hmm, I don't see it in the given rules. That's a problem because it wouldn't exist, so the string might not be part of the language.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's backtrack.\n\nThe last token in the string is t13. Where does t13 come from? Looking at the rules, I see NT13 -> t24 and NT24 -> t42 in some rules. Wait, no. Let me check: The rules say NT24 -> 't48' and NT13 -> t24.\n\nWait, let me see: NT13 -> NT24. Then, NT24 -> 't48' via a rule like NT24 -> 't48'. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I don't see NT24 being a terminal. Or maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't48' (from NT58 -> 't95' and others, but wait, no. Let me list the rules properly.\n\nWait, it's time-consuming, but let me try to spot where the symbols come from.\n\nt53 comes from NT73 -> t53.\n\nt39 comes from NT19, maybe NT19 -> t39. Or does NT39 even exist? Wait, in the rules, I see NT29 -> 't62', NT24 -> 't48'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t39 comes from NT19's expansion. Wait, I don't have a rule for NT19 directly as producing t39. Alternatively, perhaps it's derived from a chain of rules.\n\nWait, maybe the parsing is getting complicated, so perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAnother approach is to represent the string as a sequence of symbols and see if they can be derived from the grammar step by step.\n\nThe string has 17 symbols. Let's try to parse it from the start symbol S.\n\nS produces NT61 NT59.\n\nSo the leftmost production is NT61 NT59. So the string starts with t28 and t65, which would have to come from NT61 and NT59. Wait, maybe NT61 -> t28 and NT59 -> t65? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT61, I see:\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\n\nAnd looking for t28, I see NT58 -> 't95', NT67 -> 't83', etc. Wait, no, I don't see a direct rule for NT61 -> 't28'. Alternatively, maybe NT61 expands into symbols that can lead to t28.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT61:\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\n\nSo to get t28 from NT61, we need to follow this. NT33 -> 't32' and NT55 -> 't19'. So perhaps the initial steps would lead to t32 t19, but that doesn't match t28 t65.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me see:\n\nStarting with S -> NT61 NT59.\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\n\nNT59 -> 't46'\n\nSo, after one step, we have NT33 NT55 't46'\n\nBut 't46' is a terminal, so that can't be right because the initial expansion is S -> NT61 NT59, and then both NT61 and NT59 need to produce their symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of parse trees. Each non-terminal expands into two symbols, possibly more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S expands into two parts: NT61 and NT59. Each of those can produce sequences that lead to the tokens in the string.\n\nSo, let's start by splitting the string into pairs based on the grammar productions.\n\nLooking at the initial string: t28 t65 t3 t48 t5 t87 t49 t33 t87 t65 t64 t94 t97 t53 t39 t13.\n\nWe have 17 tokens, which is an odd number, so that should be impossible since the grammar is in CNF where each step produces two symbols, so the number of symbols should be 2^n - 1, which for n=5 is 31, but this is 17, which is not a power of two plus one. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, 2^4 is 16, so 16 +1 is 17. So n=5 steps, starting from S which is length 1. For 5 steps, the maximum length is 2^5 = 32, but if some steps produce terminals, lengths can vary. Wait, actually, no: Each production in CNF has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation length is such that the number of symbols at each step depends on the number of terminals produced.\n\nBut in this case, the string is 17 tokens. Let's see: Starting from S, each production replaces one symbol with two, so the number of symbols doubles minus one each time a production is used. But if some productions result in terminals, the count increases by one.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck here because 17 is an odd number, while I thought it should be 2^something -1. Let me recheck: 2^4 -1 is 15, 2^5-1 is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-316","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens: `t5 t87 t30 t25 t79 t63 t53 t42 t3 t18 t74 t19 t95 t0 t51 t32 t9`. The instructions say to determine whether the string is generated by the grammar and respond with 'Yes' or 'No'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this grammar is. CFGs in Chomsky normal form have rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar has rules like S -> NT61 NT59, and others that split into two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Some rules directly produce terminal symbols like t5, t87, etc. So, these are the terminal tokens in the string.\n\nThe string provided consists of all these terminal symbols. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S and applying the production rules to see if I can reach the given string.\n\nStarting with S, the initial symbol, I see that the grammar has two main options: S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. The string starts with t5, so I need to look for which of the non-terminals can produce 't5'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT5 -> 't5' and NT59 -> 't46'. So, if I can get to NT5, that could produce t5.\n\nBut let's map this step by step. Let me attempt to parse the string.\n\nThe string is: t5 t87 t30 t25 t79 t63 t53 t42 t3 t18 t74 t19 t95 t0 t51 t32 t9.\n\nFirst, S can split into two parts: either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Let's see if the string starts with t5, which suggests that the first part might come from NT5.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT5 can produce 't5'. Let's take that as the first step.\n\nSo, S -> NT5 NT9.\n\nNow, the string starts with t5, so the NT5 must produce t5, meaning the next part is NT9 handling the rest.\n\nWait, but the grammar for S has S \u2192 NT5 NT9 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So in this case, since we're using NT5, which gives t5, the next symbol must be produced by NT9.\n\nBut looking at the string after t5, the next token is t87. So, NT9 must produce t87.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 has the rule NT9 -> 't18', which is t18, not t87. Wait, that's a problem. Because the second symbol is t87, but NT9 in the grammar can only produce t18. So, if S is split into NT5 and NT9, then after t5, NT9 would have to produce t87, but it can't. So maybe I need to consider a different split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first split is S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Let's see. Then, NT29 could produce t29, but the first token is t5, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that's a problem because NT29 -> 't29' is a production rule, and the string starts with t5, not t29. So if I take S \u2192 NT29 NT9, that would produce t29 t18, but the string starts with t5. So that split can't be correct.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the production rules again. NT5 \u2192 't5' and NT59 \u2192 't46'. So NT59 is 't46'. So, if the first part is NT59, it would produce t46, but the string starts with t5, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me confirm NT5: in the rules, NT5 \u2192 't5' and NT59 \u2192 't46'. So, if NT5 is part of S, it would produce t5. The second part is NT9, which can't produce t87 as per its rule.\n\nSo that suggests that starting with S \u2192 NT5 NT9 would not get us to t87 after t5. But the string starts with t5, so that must come from NT5, but then how do we get t87 from NT9? Because NT9 only produces t18.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Maybe I need to see if there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me try to consider the entire string and see if it can be built step by step.\n\nThe string is: t5, t87, t30, t25, t79, t63, t53, t42, t3, t18, t74, t19, t95, t0, t51, t32, t9.\n\nI need to break this down as a series of productions from the grammar. Each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a production step.\n\nLet me think about the overall structure. The string starts with t5, which as I saw can come from NT5. Then, the next token is t87, but that comes after t5. So perhaps the production structure is something like NT5 -> t5 and then something that produces the rest.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think about each token in the string and see if I can find a path through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire string as a tree of productions. Each token must be produced by some rule.\n\nLet me try starting from the beginning.\n\nToken 1: t5.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that produces t5. From the rules, that's NT5 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT5 NT9.\n\nNow, after producing NT5, which is t5, the next symbol is t87, which must come from NT9.\n\nBut looking at the rules, NT9 has only one production: NT9 \u2192 't18'. So, how does NT9 produce t87?\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and I should consider a different split of S.\n\nLet me try S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Then, the first NT29 would produce t29, but the string starts with t5, so this can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in S \u2192 NT5 NT9, the NT5 produces t5, and the NT9 produces t87. But as per the rules, NT9 can't produce t87, only t18. So that seems impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the production rules, some non-terminals produce more than one terminal. For example, NT6 -> 't74', NT7 -> 't77', and so on. But in the provided rules, non-terminals like NT83, NT93, etc., have specific rules. But the first-level productions (the ones without dots) seem to map certain NT<numbers> to a terminal string.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nNT9 -> 't18'\n\nNT19 -> 't9'\n\nNT24 -> 't2'\n\nNT29 -> 't29' (but in the provided rules, wait, looking again, no: earlier I thought NT59 is 't46', but maybe I misread the rules. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking back at the problem: The provided list includes several lines, like 'NT65 -> NT71 NT65' and others, but towards the end, certain NT tokens produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT67 -> 't53'\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking through the provided list, I see several entries where a non-terminal becomes a terminal, like:\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nNT9 -> 't18'\n\nNT18 -> 't66'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in the string, each token corresponds to a single non-terminal that directly produces that token.\n\nSo, the string token sequence is a list of such non-terminals in order.\n\nThus, the string is a sequence of NT tokens being processed, each corresponding to a rule that directly produces that particular token as a terminal.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, there must be a parse tree where each leaf node is one of these terminal productions.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to whether the given string of NT tokens can be directly derived from the left-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nSo, for each token in the string, we"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Scrolling through the productions, I notice that several non-terminals are replaced by 't's. \n\nFor example:\n- NT9 \u2192 t18\n- NT18 \u2192 t66\n- NT60 \u2192 t49\n- NT59 \u2192 t35\n- NT33 \u2192 t32\n- Also, looking at NT5: NT5 \u2192 t5, so any path that leads to NT5 will terminate with t5.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t9`, which might correspond to a non-terminal that produces 't9'. Let me check if any non-terminals are defined to produce 't9'. Scanning through, I see:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides (RHS) of the productions, the terminals include t9, t3, t62, etc. \n\nI see that NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86, and in the RHS of NT86, it's 't19'. But wait, NT29's RHS doesn't directly produce a 't', unless through another chain. Alternatively, looking for any non-terminal that directly gives a 't9'. \n\nWait, is there a production where a non-terminal ends up being 't9'? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT9: I don't see it in the productions as a direct terminal, but NT9 might be part of a larger chain. Alternatively, maybe NT6 (which is in the productions as NT6 \u2192 't74'), but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each symbol 'tX' is a terminal string, so each production that leads to a terminal (like NT5 \u2192 t5) contributes a 't5' to the string. So, for the string, I need to break it down into terminals and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is 17 symbols long:\nt9, t3, t62, t32, t16, t79, t62, t62, t82, t63, t80, t9, t82, t73, t72, t12, t49.\n\nI need to see if these can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nLooking at where t9 appears:\n\nIn the grammar, NT9 \u2192 t18. So t9 is 't18'. Then, t18 is produced by NT18. So, looking at NT18: NT18 \u2192 t66.\n\nSo, t9 in the string would be from NT18 \u2192 t66? Wait, no. Because NT18 is a single symbol, but in the string, it's appearing as 't9', which is 't18'.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me clarify: Each symbol in the string is a terminal, so each part of the string must correspond to a substitution of a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to work backwards. Let me try to parse the string from the end.\n\nBut given the length, it might be time-consuming. Alternatively, let's consider what each production can produce in terms of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 t18. So if a non-terminal NT9 is generated, it will produce 't18'. But in the string, I see 't9' which would imply NT9 producing 't9', but in the grammar, NT9 produces 't18', not 't9'. That seems contradictory. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. In the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t18. So 't18' is the result of NT9. But in the string, there's a 't9' symbol. Which non-terminal produces 't9'? Checking the productions, I don't see any non-terminal where the RHS is 't9'. The closest is NT5 \u2192 t5, NT6\u2192t74, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo, but assuming the grammar is correct, perhaps 't9' is a terminal. But the grammar doesn't define any non-terminal producing 't9' except perhaps a direct production. Looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 t9. So perhaps that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each production carefully.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t18\n\nNT18 \u2192 t66\n\nNT59 \u2192 t35\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n\nNT86 \u2192 't19'\n\nWait, so NT29 can lead to t14 followed by t86, which is t19. So that would create the terminal sequence t14 t19, but that may not directly help.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that leads to 't9': only NT9 does, but it leads directly to 't18'. So unless t18 is somehow re-derived to produce 't9', but that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps that's an issue. Because in the string, there's a 't9' which the grammar doesn't directly produce. Unless maybe 't9' is a typo, and it should be t18. But assuming it's correct, maybe that's an indication that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So S starts by generating two non-terminals. Let's see what these produce.\n\nLooking at NT61:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 or NT61 \u2192 NT10 NT96.\n\nWait, in the productions:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nand\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT10 NT96\n\nSo NT61 branches into two paths. Let's explore NT61 further.\n\nLooking at NT33:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72 or NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22\n\nSimilarly, NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n\nWait, NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78\n\nNT78 can go to NT93 NT7 or NT65 NT88.\n\nLooking at NT93: NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83, and NT62 is 't12'.\n\nWait, so if NT93 is part of the chain, it would generate 't12' followed by whatever NT83 produces.\n\nBut in the string, we have 't12', which is one of the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is 't9 t3 t62...', but the first symbol is t9, which is NT9 \u2192 t18. But the string has t9. So that's a problem. Unless the string is supposed to have t18 instead. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t9 is a symbol that's a combination of multiple productions, but that seems unlikely in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm being dense. Let me check if any non-terminals can produce 't9'. Looking at all productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 t9. So t9 is a terminal, and if the grammar doesn't define how it's produced, then the string can't be generated unless t9 is allowed as a terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, I don't see any production where any non-terminal is replaced by 't9'. So the string has a 't9' that's not produced by any non-terminal. Therefore, that symbol cannot be part of the language, since there's no production in the grammar that allows 't9' to be generated.\n\nHence, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-338","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string `t86 t37 t37 t33 t95 t53 t25 t37 t99 t74 t66 t48 t65 t35 t0 t97 t12 t36` can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar and the string to see how they might connect. The grammar has production rules that expand non-terminals (like S, NT15, NT29, etc.) into other non-terminals or terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number). The string starts and ends with these 't' symbols, so that's a good sign because the grammar itself includes multiple 't' productions.\n\nI think the best approach here is to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step. The start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, expands into NT61 NT59. Let me write that down:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\n\nEach NT is a non-terminal that eventually expands into a terminal symbol or another NT. So, I'll need to break down each of these NTs until I get to terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, there are ten 't' symbols. Wait, let me count the 't' symbols in the string:\n\n1. t86\n2. t37\n3. t37\n4. t33\n5. t95\n6. t53\n7. t25\n8. t37\n9. t99\n10. t74\n11. t66\n12. t48\n13. t65\n14. t35\n15. t0\n16. t97\n17. t12\n18. t36\n\nSo, there are 18 terminal symbols, specifically 18 't' symbols, each with different numbers. Now, the string is structured with non-terminals leading up to these terminals. So I'll have to see how the non-terminals in the start symbol's expansion and their subsequent expansions can lead to the given terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So the string should be a combination of NT61's expansion and NT59's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT61 has a production rule:\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nSo NT61 expands into NT33 and NT55. Then, let's see what NT33 and NT55 do.\n\nNT33 has multiple production rules. Checking the grammar:\nNT33 \u2192 NT33 NT72\nNT33 \u2192 NT6 NT78\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\n\nWait, the first rule for NT33 is NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22. Oh, no, let me check again. The user provided the grammar as a list, so I should look for NT33 in that list.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\n\nWait, no, from the user's grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT33: \n- NT33 -> NT32 NT72\n- NT32 -> NT18 NT65\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\nNT32 -> NT18 NT65\nNT33 -> NT32 NT72\nNT32 -> NT18 NT65\n\nSo, NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\n\nBut then NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. So let me write that expansion:\n\nNT33 \u2192 (NT32 NT72)\nNT32 \u2192 (NT18 NT65)\nSo, NT33 \u2192 (NT18 NT65) NT72 \u2192 NT18 NT65 NT72\n\nWait, but NT32 also has a different rule:\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65 (only). Is there another rule for NT32? Let me check again.\n\nNo, from the list:\n\nNT32 -> NT18 NT65\n\nSo NT32 only has that rule. Then NT33 becomes NT18 NT65 NT72.\n\nBut looking further, each of these NTs might expand further. Let's check NT18, NT65, NT72.\n\nFor NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT29\n\nSo NT18 \u2192 (NT26 NT29)\n\nNT26: NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT2\n\nNT24: NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT67\n\nNT2: NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\n\nSo NT2 \u2192 (NT52 NT86)\n\nPutting this together: NT2 \u2192 (NT52 NT86) \u2192 which is 't64 t12' (from the grammar, NT52 -> 't42').\n\nWait, but hold on. The grammar has several 't' productions. For example:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT86 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo, NT2 \u2192 t64 t12.\n\nTherefore, NT26 expands as NT24 NT2:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT2 NT67\n\nNT2 \u2192 't64' and NT67 can expand.\n\nNT67 has rules:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\nNT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\nNT17 \u2192 NT9 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\nNT28 \u2192 NT65 NT88\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me see if I can track how one NT can lead to a 't' symbol.\n\nLooking at the last part of the string: ending with t36, and before that, t48 and t12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t12 is produced by NT52 \u2192 't42' or NT52 \u2192 't64'? Wait, no:\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules converted by the user, NT52 branches into either 't42' or via other NTs:\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't42' and also NT52 \u2192 NT68 NT52.\n\nWait, that can't be because NT52 \u2192 NT68 NT52 would lead to an infinite loop unless NT68 also expands into terminals. Let's check NT68.\n\nNT68 \u2192 't83' and also NT68 \u2192 NT93 NT88.\n\nHmm, this seems like a possibility. Let's look at the string:\n\nThe last few 't's are 36, 96, etc. Wait the string ends with t36, t24, etc. Let's see t36 is produced by NT36\u2192NT6 NT78, NT6\u2192t74, etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step, starting from the longest possible match, using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, we can try to see if the string can be generated.\n\nBut given the length of the string, this might take a while. Let me try to outline the steps.\n\nThe string has 18 't' terms. The start symbol S divides into NT61 and NT59. Let's explore both.\n\nStarting with NT61:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nNT18 \u2192 NT26 NT29\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\nNT52 \u2192 t42\nNT86 \u2192 t12\n\nSo, let's see what this sequence would produce.\n\nNT18 expands to NT26 NT29. NT26 expands to NT24 NT2, which then expands to NT52 and NT86.\n\nSo, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT2 \u2192 (NT2 NT67) NT52 \u2192 (t64) (t42) ?\n\nWait, wait. Let me get this straight.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT2 NT67\nNT2 \u2192NT52 NT86\nNT52 \u2192 't42'\nNT86 \u2192't12'\nSo NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT67 \u2192 (t64) (NT67). But NT67 itself expands into more NTs:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\nNT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\nNT17 \u2192 NT9 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\nNT28 \u2192 NT65 NT88\nNT65 \u2192 't6' or via other rules:\nNT65 can expand into 't49' or via other NTs.\n\nWait, this is getting too deep. Maybe focusing on the end of the string would be better.\n\nThe string ends with t36, t24, t36.\n\nLooking at where 't36"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t95 t54 t53 t54 t73 t65 t94 t67 t28 t73 t32 t79 t42 t72 t86 t13 t94 t86`. \n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions where each right-hand side is exactly two non-terminals. This is important because it simplifies the derivation process. However, the presence of terminals complicates things because in CNF, all productions are non-terminals. So, all the terminals in the string must be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production right now seems to involve non-terminals. For example, the start symbol S -> NT61 NT59, which are non-terminals. The grammar has a mix of rules with NT followed by numbers and a few rules that directly produce terminals like 't12', 't94', etc.\n\nSo, my first step is to check if each terminal in the input string has a corresponding production rule in the grammar. If any terminal doesn't have such a rule, the string can't be generated, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are: t95, t54, t53, t54, t73, t65, t94, t67, t28, t73, t32, t79, t42, t72, t86, t13, t94, t86.\n\nI need to check each of these against the grammar rules.\n\nLet me go through each terminal one by one:\n\n1. t95: Looking through the grammar, I see NT60 -> 't49' and NT95 -> 't94'. Wait, nowhere do I see a production for t95. Let me check again. Oh, yeah, I don't see any production where a non-terminal produces t95. So that's a problem.\n\n2. t54: I see in the grammar NT57 -> 't60', but t54 is another terminal. Let me check all the rules. Hmm, I don't see any production that results in t54. So t54 is not present either.\n\n3. t53: Checking the rules... I don't see any production where a non-terminal produces t53.\n\n4. t54 again: Same issue as before, no production ends with t54.\n\n5. t73: Checking the grammar, NT23 -> 't3' and NT55 -> 't5'. There's no production directly mapping to t73.\n\n6. t65: Looking around, NT62 -> 't12' and NT65 has rules like NT65->NT71NT65, which is recursive, but t65 isn't present.\n\n7. t94: Oh, I see NT60->'t94' and NT5->'t5', but wait, looking at this, I think I might have missed some. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT60 -> 't94', so t94 is covered.\n\n8. t67: Checking the rules... I see NT67->NT56NT5 which becomes t5 and t67. Wait, but I don't see a direct production for t67 in the terminals. Let me check the rules again. Oh, I think I see NT67->NT56 NT5, which is a production of non-terminals. But in the productions, 't' comes in for some. Wait, maybe I missed t67. Let me look through all the terminals. Hmm, no, I don't see any production that ends with t67. So t67 is not present.\n\n9. t28: Checking the rules... I don't see any terminal 't28' in the grammar.\n\n10. t73: As before, no production for t73.\n\n11. t32: Hmm, I don't see any production that ends with t32.\n\n12. t79: Looking through the rules... I don't see t79 as a terminal.\n\n13. t42: Checking the grammar, I don't see any terminal t42.\n\n14. t72: Not present either.\n\n15. t86: I see NT68->t83, NT5->t86? Wait, no, the productions are: looking through, I see NT59->'t35', but for t86, I don't see a rule. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT20->t37, NT83->t33, NT65->t32, but nothing for t86. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through, under NT7, NT27, etc., but no, I don't see any production resulting in t86 except perhaps NT93->t72. No, I don't think t86 is present.\n\n16. t13: Checking the rules, I don't see a production that ends with t13.\n\n17. t94: As before, seen, so okay.\n\n18. t86: Again, not present.\n\n19. t86 again: Same issue.\n\nSo, compiling the list, the terminals not present in the grammar are: t95, t54, t53, t54, t73, t65, t94 (Wait, t94 is present with NT60), t67, t28, t73, t32, t79, t42, t72, t86, t13, t94, t86.\n\nWait, but wait, t94 is present, so let me clarify. The string has t95, which is not present; t54, t53, which are not present; t73, t65 (t65 is in a production, but no terminal t65 directly). Wait, but in the grammar, NT65 -> NT71 NT65, which is recursive, but perhaps that's producing something else. Wait, no, that's still a non-terminal production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the only way to produce a terminal is via specific rules. So, any terminal must be produced by a non-terminal that has a production ending with that terminal.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has a few terminals:\n\n- NT60 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't5', 't5' again (from NT57->'t60' and others)\n- NT2-> 't64'\n- NT60->'t94'\n- Other terminals like 't9', 't84', etc., but I think I miss one in the earlier analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all terminals present in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each production that ends with a 't':\n\n- NT60 -> 't94'\n- NT58 -> 't95' (Wait, wait! Hold on, line by line:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT60 -> 't94'\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT47 -> 't22'\n- NT93 -> 't72'\n- NT83 -> 't66'\n- NT23 -> 't79'\n- NT97 -> 't73' (Wait, under NT66 -> 't8', but no, under NT93: NT93 -> 't72'\nWait, checking each line that ends with a 't':\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mislooking.

{"custom_id":"request-360","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string `t51 t37 t13 t5 t51 t33 t97 t60 t73 t87 t16 t5 t13 t73 t42 t97 t41 t42 t32` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing, but since I'm not actually parsing but rather checking if the string can be derived, I need a different approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S has two productions: S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So the string must be derived starting from S, and ultimately, the entire string must be composed of terminals.\n\nMy string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. So I need to see if this exact sequence can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar uses non-terminals, the string must be such that all non-terminals eventually expand into the given terminals.\n\nLet me look at the productions. Each non-terminal can only produce a pair of terminals or other non-terminals, except for the ones that produce terminals directly. For example, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65, NT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60, and so on, until they reach terminals like 't5', 't16', etc.\n\nGiven the string, I can check each terminal and see if there's a non-terminal that maps to it. For example, looking up the productions:\n\n- 't5' is produced by NT5.\n- 't9' is produced by NT9.\n- 't16' is produced by NT16.\n- 't2' is in NT28.\n- And so on for each terminal in the string.\n\nBut the key is to see if the entire string can be generated step by step through the grammar. Since the grammar is context-free, each step is a replacement of a non-terminal with two other symbols.\n\nThe string has 20 elements, so I need to see if it's possible starting from S to derive a string of 20 terminals. The start symbol S splits into NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Let's consider both options.\n\nFirst, let's take S \u2192 NT61 NT59. NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72. NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. NT18 \u2192 NT66. NT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60. NT6 \u2192 NT74. Hmm, wait, but in the string, I don't see 't74' which is NT6. So maybe I need to explore further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up all the productions that produce each terminal. For instance, the string starts with 't51'. Looking at the grammar, NT62 \u2192 t12, but I don't see 't51'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14, which then maybe goes into 't79' or other paths. But the string has 't51', which I don't immediately see in the terminal productions provided. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the provided productions carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT67\u2192 NT57 NT14, but where is 't51'? Hmm, I don't see any production that ends with 't51'. So that's a problem because 't51' isn't a terminal in the grammar's productions. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given productions, I see NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14, but do any non-terminals produce 't51'? Let me scan through the list:\n\nLooking for NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27. NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54. NT46 \u2192 NT96 NT33. NT96 \u2192 NT86 NT32. Wait, NT86 is 't93', because in production NT83 \u2192 't42', and another production is NT96 \u2192 't86'. Wait, no, in the productions provided, I see several 't's, but for 't51' it's not present as a terminal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLooking again: the productions end with 't5', 't83', etc. Let me check for 't51' in the grammar. Scanning through, no production ends with 't51'. So if the string contains 't51', then that can't be derived from the grammar because it's not a terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but the user provided the entire grammar, including all the productions. So I should double-check. Maybe I missed 't51' somewhere.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't74'\n- NT56 \u2192 't51'\nWait, yes! NT56 produces 't51'. Let me check that: NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT23, but wait, no. Wait, looking again: NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT19? Or another path?\n\nWait, looking at the productions: I see NT56 \u2192 NT51. Let me check: yes, the production is NT56 \u2192 NT51. Then NT51 \u2192 is it a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT51 in the productions: the productions provided don't have NT51 as a non-terminal, so if NT56 \u2192 NT51, and that's a terminal, then NT56 must produce a terminal. So in the given productions, NT56 \u2192 't51' directly, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, this production is present: \"NT56 \u2192 t51\". Yes. So the string has 't51', so the non-terminal NT56 must be used to produce 't51'.\n\nSo then, the first part of the string is 't51', which must come from NT56 \u2192 't51'. Then, looking further, the string starts with t51 t37 t13 t5...\n\nNow, the second part is t37. So after t51, how do we get t37? Looking at the grammar, do any production chain produce t37?\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each terminal in the string to a possible non-terminal and see if there's a possible chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree step by step. Let me try that.\n\nThe string is: t51 t37 t13 t5 t51 t33 t97 t60 t73 t87 t16 t5 t13 t73 t42 t97 t41 t42 t32\n\nThe first terminal is t51. From the grammar, this must come from NT56 \u2192 t51.\n\nSo the first production would be S \u2192 NT29 NT9, or S \u2192 NT61 NT59. But since the first symbol in the string is t51, which comes from NT56, which is in a different part of the grammar, perhaps from S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Wait, no, because NT56 is connected via other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps S is not directly producing t51. Wait, actually, the start symbol S produces a pair of non-terminals, which then expand into the entire string.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe string must be a series of terminals generated by expanding the start symbol S through production rules. Each symbol in the string must be either a terminal or the result of expanding a non-terminal.\n\nGiven that, each symbol in the string must be either a terminal or generated by a non-terminal.\n\nIn the given string, we have t51, which is a terminal, so it must come from a production that directly yields t51.\n\nLooking through the grammar, we see NT56 \u2192 t51, so that's possible. So in the derivation, at some point, we must have a NT56 which is replaced by t51.\n\nThen, looking at the grammar, NT56 is used as NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT19, but wait, does it have another production?\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT56 is given as \"NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT19\". So NT56 can only produce NT55 followed by NT19. But NT55, according to the grammar, is NT5 \u2192 t5. So NT55 \u2192 t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT19 can produce t9.

{"custom_id":"request-356","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem and the grammar.\n\nThe grammar consists of multiple production rules starting from S and various non-terminals NT followed by numbers. Each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal ('t' followed by a number). The string to evaluate is a series of terminals separated by spaces: `t36 t99 t63 t36 t33 t50 t38 t79 t36 t64 t76 t28 t50 t76 t19 t16 t37 t36 t39`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires that each production be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, I can consider using the CYK algorithm to parse the string. However, manually going through the CYK steps would be time-consuming, especially for someone like me who might make mistakes. Alternatively, I can try to trace the derivations step by step to see if the string can be generated.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual terminals:\nt36, t99, t63, t36, t33, t50, t38, t79, t36, t64, t76, t28, t50, t76, t19, t16, t37, t36, t39.\n\nSince the string starts with t36, I should look for where t36 appears in the grammar. Scanning through the productions, I find that NT36 -> NT6 NT78, and NT6 -> t74, and NT78 -> t83. So from NT36, we can get to t74 and t83, but that's t36 -> t74 t83. Hmm, not directly t36, but perhaps through other steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a production that leads to t36 directly or indirectly. Alternatively, maybe the string can be broken down into combinations that match the productions.\n\nLet me consider each production that results in a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see several terminal outputs like t12, t94, t83, t5, t36, t2, etc. So, any time a production ends with a terminal, that's a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nFor example, NT5 -> t5 directly. Similarly, NT9 -> t18, NT65 -> t67, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be matched by combining these terminal productions in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to identify which non-terminals can generate which terminals. For instance, NT76 has a production NT76 -> NT53 NT29. Both NT53 and NT29 might lead to specific terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT76:\nNT76 -> NT53 NT29\nNow, looking for NT53: Not immediately clear. But for NT29, I see two productions:\nNT29 -> NT14 NT86 and NT29 -> NT62 NT83.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to group consecutive terminals that correspond to a single non-terminal's production.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with t36. Looking for a production that can produce t36 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> NT6 NT78\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT65 -> NT71 NT65\n- NT67 -> NT57 NT14\n- NT78 -> NT93 NT7\n- NT65 -> NT10 NT96\n- NT78 -> NT62 NT83\n\nBut none of these start with t36 being the first production. Instead, it seems that NT36's first symbol is t74 (from NT6 -> t74) and then t83 (from NT78 -> t83). But in the string, the first terminal is t36, so perhaps we need to find a non-terminal that directly produces t36.\n\nWait, I see that NT36's production is NT6 NT78, which are two non-terminals. To derive t36, we have to see if both NT6 and NT78 can produce the appropriate symbols.\n\nLooking at NT6: From the productions, NT65 -> NT6 NT60 and NT67 -> NT6 NT14, NT27 -> NT7 NT28, etc. Wait, I'm getting mixed up here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for chain productions.\n\nAnother approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length must be equal to the number of steps taken during the derivation. Each production in CNF either reduces the number of symbols by one (since each step replaces two symbols with one, and we start with one symbol). However, I'm not entirely sure about this; maybe it's better to try to figure out the possible steps.\n\nWait, the string has 19 terminals. Starting from S, the initial step would involve S \u2192 NT... NT..., which are two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals can further produce either another non-terminal or a terminal. So, the string's length would be 19, which is consistent with (n-1) steps, where n is the number of symbols in the string. Since starting from one symbol, each step increases the count by 1. So, 19 symbols would require 18 steps. That makes sense.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed step by step. Maybe I can find a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S, the first step must be S \u2192 NT61 NT59, since it's the first option for S.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nNow, we have two symbols to expand: NT61 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT61, from the productions, NT61 -> NT33 NT55.\n\nFor NT59, there's a production NT59 -> NT10 NT17, but let's check: actually, looking back, wait, the initial S has two productions, but in the provided grammar, all S productions are listed as S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. Wait, perhaps the user made a formatting error, but the initial lines show S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. So, I think S can only go to NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Hmm, perhaps I misread the initial grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided the following: S -> NT61 NT59, S -> NT29 NT9. So, initially, S branches into two possibilities. So, to construct the string, either starting with NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nBut the string starts with t36, which is the first terminal. So, I need to check which initial productions can lead to t36.\n\nLooking at NT61: NT61 -> NT33 NT55.\n\nNT33 can produce t5 (from NT33 -> NT32 NT72, then NT32 -> NT18 NT65, etc. Wait, perhaps this is too complex.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NT that directly produce t36.\n\nWait, NT36's production is NT6 NT78. So, t36 could come from NT36 if both NT6 and NT78 can produce the appropriate terminals. Let's see.\n\nNT6 -> t74, and NT78 -> t83. So, t36 would be t74 t83, but the string starts with t36, which is 2 symbols, but in our case, the first symbol is t36, so perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S is S\u2192 NT61 NT59, which is then expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to see if the entire string can be decomposed into a sequence of productions.\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. Maybe another approach is to see if the string can be generated by tracing through the grammar's terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is t36 t99 t63 t36 t33 t50 t38 t79 t36 t64 t76 t28 t50 t76 t19 t16 t37 t36 t39.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the string starts with t36, and from the grammar, NT36 can produce t74 and t83, but in the string, after t36, it's t99, which is a different terminal. So perhaps the initial segment isn't generated from NT36.\n\nLooking for other NTs that produce t36.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplic"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the productions, I see variables like S, NT2, NT4, etc., each producing two other NTs or a terminal symbol (tX). The terminals are things like 't38', 't12', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t38 t12 t95 t65 t96 t67 t46 t87 t9 t37 t32 t46 t42 t99 t95 t79 t86 t67 t86 t3`. \n\nI need to derive this string from the grammar, step by step. Let's break down how the string is constructed.\n\nThe string starts with 't38', which needs to appear as a terminal in some production. Looking at the grammar, 't38' is produced by NT56 \u2192 't38' (since NT56 \u2192 't38' is one of the productions). So the first symbol must come from this production.\n\nThen, after 't38', we have 't12'. Looking at the grammar, 't12' is the result of NT68 \u2192 't12' and NT60 \u2192 't12'. So after 't38', the next symbol 't12' could be from either NT68 or NT60.\n\nLet me consider the possible sequence:\n\nt38 (from NT56) \u2192 t12 (from NT68 or NT60). Suppose it's NT68, so current NT is NT68. So the string starts with NT56 producing t38, and then NT68 producing t12. So far, the derivation could be S \u2192 NT56 NT68, which gives t38 t12.\n\nNext, 't95' in the string. We need to see how 't95' is generated. Let's check the grammar. 't95' is produced by NT54 and NT71, specifically NT54 \u2192 't64' (no, that's not right). Wait, looking back, 't95' is produced by NT47 \u2192 't95' (production NT47 \u2192 't33'? Wait, no. Let me look again. Wait the grammar has NT47 \u2192 't73'? Wait, hold on, the productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I need to find which NTs produce 't95'. Scanning through:\n\nNT47 \u2192 't73'\u2014no, not 't95'.\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\u2014nope.\nLooking further, I see NT95 \u2192 't94' (I think I might have misread the previous comment). Wait, let me list all the productions that lead to terminals:\n\nHere's a list of all NTs that produce terminals:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't60'\nNT55 \u2192 't5'\nNT67 \u2192 't83'\nNT71 \u2192 't50'\nNT73 \u2192 't53'\nNT78 \u2192 't56' (wait, no, looking back, NT78 is producing 't56'? Wait, no, checking: NT78 \u2192 't56' (is that correct? Let me scan the grammar:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar: There's `NT78 -> t56 NT5` and `NT78 -> t6 NT50`, etc. So NT78 \u2192 't56'. Hmm, that's a bit complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by looking at the entire string step by step, trying to find possible productions.\n\nAnother approach is to perform a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe string is: t38, t12, t95, t65, t96, t67, t46, t87, t9, t37, t32, t46, t42, t99, t95, t79, t86, t67, t86, t3.\n\nSo, the first three symbols are t38, t12, t95. Let's see how these could be generated.\n\nt38 comes from NT56 \u2192 t38.\n\nt12 comes from either NT68 or NT60.\n\nThen t95 comes from... Looking at the grammar, maybe NT95 produces t95.

Or is that something else?\n\nWait, no, let me look again. The grammar is presented in a block, so I need to find NT47's production. Let me parse that:\n\nLooking through the block, I see:\n\nNT67 -> t83 NT22\n\nThen later:\n\nNT20 -> NT73 NT73\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead list all terminal productions to avoid confusion. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this using a parsing method, such as CYK, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help, but given the complexity, maybe a bottom-up approach is better.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo to generate the string, each symbol in the string must be the terminal produced by some NT.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\n\nSo the first two symbols are 't61' and 't19' or something else? Wait, no.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side except for the start symbol, which can produce two terminals. Wait, actually, no, C nf allows productions to produce terminals and non-terminals, but each production has exactly two non-terminals or one non-terminal leading to a single terminal in some cases.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some productions expand to a non-terminal and a terminal (like NT46 -> t60) but in general, most are two non-terminals. However, in this specific case, some rules directly produce terminals like S->NT61 NT65, etc., but others like NT6->t74 and NT2->t64 are more direct.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t25 t41 t46 t67 t74 t41 t16 t67 t9 t30 t96 t95 t95 t2 t63 t25 t0 t25 t25 t30`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar uses a lot of specific productions for terminals, so the string must be a result of expanding the start symbol S using these rules and substituting the non-terminals with the correct terminals.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n\nS -> NT61 NT65\nS -> NT29 NT9\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to one of the options from S.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the first part is NT61 NT65 and the second is NT29 NT9, or vice versa.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminal symbols. The start symbol is S. Each production has two non-terminals on the left and either two terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of symbols, some of which are terminals (like t50, t53, etc.) and some are non-terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of replacements by the grammar rules.\n\nI notice that the string has 21 symbols, and each step in the derivation should expand non-terminals into terminals, increasing the length of the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either increases the length by one (if it's a non-terminal being replaced by two terminals or vice versa) or stays the same. But in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal, so the number of symbols can sometimes increase or decrease based on how the non-terminals are expanded.\n\nI should probably start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive this string step by step. But given the complexity, maybe it's easier to parse the string backwards, starting from the last symbol and working my way back to S. This is similar to checking if a string is a parse tree by reduction, sometimes called the CYK algorithm for context-free grammars, but maybe not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the sequence of rules that can produce each part of the string. I'll need to map each part of the string to possible productions.\n\nLet me list out the string again:\n\nt50 t53 t32 t66 t50 t54 t9 t38 t64 t53 t60 t50 t66 t38 t66 t46 t32 t72 t72 t66 t30.\n\nI think the approach should be to use the rightmost derivation, as is typical in the standard parsing methods. Wait, no, usually CFG parsers use leftmost or reduce using lookaheads. But perhaps the easier way is to parse the string step by step, expanding symbols as needed.\n\nAlternatively, I can check whether the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to find a way that each symbol in the string is produced by the grammar rules. To do that, I might need to traverse the string and see which non-terminals could generate each part.\n\nLet's see. The string starts with t50, t53, etc. Let me consider the last part of the string first, trying to reduce from the end. If I can find the rightmost steps that produce the string, that could help.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for possible splits in the string based on the productions. For example, check if the start symbol's productions can lead to the given string.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S: it can produce two different non-terminals, NT29 NT9 or NT47 NT59.\n\nLet me check if the first part of the string can be derived from NT29 or NT47.\n\nLooking at NT29, according to the grammar:\n\nLooking back, NT29 has a production NT29 -> NT14 NT86.\n\nSo if NT29 can produce NT14 and NT86, then NT14 and NT86 need to be terminals or further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT14: NT14 -> t2.\n\nSo NT14 is t2, which is our first symbol 't2' but in the string, the first symbol is 't50'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the string starts with t50. So if the first expansion steps are leading to t2, which is the first symbol, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I should check another production. Let's consider the first symbol in the string is 't50'. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce 't50'.\n\nLooking at the production list, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t19\n\nWait, but none of the terminals in the string are t's beyond certain points. Wait, the string has t's like t50, t53, t32, etc. Looking back at the productions, I see that several non-terminals produce t\u2019s:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT10 -> t96\n\nNT69 -> No, the productions listed don't have NT33 as non-terminal. Wait, looking through:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, several non-terminals expand to 't' followed by a number:\n\n- NT61 -> t36\n- NT31 -> t54\n- NT72 -> t49\n- NT96 -> t67\n- NT93 -> t72\n- NT88 -> t42\n- NT98 -> No, wait, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking carefully, in the productions, I see for example:\n\nNT61 -> t36\n\nSo NT61 can produce t36, which is 't36'. Similarly, NT31->t54.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't50'. Hmm, is there a non-terminal that produces 't50'? Looking through the list, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to 't50'. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, looking through the productions, I see NT59 -> 't46', NT56 -> 't51', NT57 -> 't17', etc. But none explicitly produce 't50'. So maybe the string has symbols that aren't generated by any production, meaning it's not part of any derivation.\n\nWait, but the string is given, so I must check all symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the productions. Let me scan the entire productions again for any that have a 't' followed by a two-digit number.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT61 -> t36\n- NT31 -> t54\n- NT72 -> t49\n- NT92 -> t86\n- NT58 -> t95\n- NT60 -> t42\n- NT67 -> t32\n- NT98 -> t38\n- Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, in the list, there's NT29 -> t62, is that right?

The string is \"t51 t13 t66 t82 t94 t67 t63 t66 t79 t9 t19 t2 t60 t35 t3 t39 t53 t64 t37 t38 t65\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to understand what non-terminals are present and their productions. The grammar starts with S and has several non-terminals like S, NT2, NT4, etc., which eventually lead to terminals like 't5', 't13', etc. \n\nI notice that some terminals like 't51', 't13', etc., are direct productions. For example, NT67 -> t51, NT13 -> t2, etc. So, to generate the given string, each 't' term must come from a production of the form NTxxx -> tyy or directly from a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't51'. Checking the productions, I see that NT67 -> t51, so NT67 must be expanded to t51. So, I need a path in the derivation starting from S to NT67.\n\nStarting from S: S can go to NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Let's see which of these can lead to NT67.\n\nIf I take S -> NT61 NT59, then I need to see if NT61 and NT59 can produce substrings that eventually lead to the required terms. Looking at NT61's production: NT61 -> NT33 NT55. Wait, no, actually, I'm looking for NT67, which is produced by NT67 -> NT17 NT27. Hmm, maybe I should track the path differently.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, reversing from the string upwards to S. Since the grammar is in CNF, leftmost or rightmost derivations are easy, but since it's reversed, maybe I can look for the string in reverse.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if each 't' in the string has a corresponding production. Let's list all the 't's and their positions.\n\nt51, t13, t66, t82, t94, t67, t63, t66, t79, t9, t19, t2, t60, t35, t3, t39, t53, t64, t37, t38, t65.\n\nBut wait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT67 -> t51 (from NT67)\nSo, t51 is from NT67. So, in the string, 't51' must be the result of NT67.\n\nLooking at the string, 't51' is the first token. So, the initial production would have to start with NT67 expanding to t51, followed by other productions.\n\nLooking at the first token position: t51 is the first, so the leftmost part of the string starts with t51. So, the first part of the string is t51.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions for S are S->NT61 NT59 or S->NT29 NT9.\n\nIf I take S->NT61 NT59, then NT61 and NT59.\n\nNT61's production: NT61 -> NT33 NT55\nWait, but then NT33 can produce t3 or other non-terminals. Let's see, in the string, the second token is t13. But in the given string, after t51 comes t13.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see NT61 producing t13. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the other production for S is better.\n\nS -> NT29 NT9.\n\nSo, the first part is NT29, then NT9.\n\nNT29: Looking at the productions, NT29-> NT14 NT86. So, the first token t51 would need to come from NT29 expanding.\n\nWait, but NT29 is S's first child. Let me map:\n\nIf S->NT29 NT9, then the string would be NT29's expansion followed by NT9's expansion.\n\nSo, the first part is t51, which would have to come from NT29. But looking at NT29's productions: NT29-> NT14 NT86. So, the first symbol from NT29 would be part of NT14 or NT86, which may expand into terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nBut from the string, the first token is t51, which comes from NT67, not NT29. So maybe S can't choose S->NT29 NT9, as that would require the first part to start with NT29's production, and NT29 doesn't directly produce t51. Therefore, the first part must come from NT61.\n\nSo, S->NT61 NT59.\n\nLooking at NT61: NT61->NT33 NT55.\n\nBut NT33 can produce t32 or t33.\n\nWait, the second token is t13, but NT61 expands to NT33 and NT55. Since it's in CNF, each step is a binary split. So, in the first expansion, S is NT61 NT59. Let's see how these can produce the string.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the second token and see what productions could produce it.\n\nAfter t51 is t13, which is a 't'. Looking at the productions, I see NT13 -> t2, but not t13. Wait, let's check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice:\n\n- NT9 -> t18\n- NT13 -> t2\nBut not t13. Hmm. So, perhaps the second token t13 could come from a non-derivation where a non-terminal is used.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' corresponds to a non-terminal that directly produces that 't'. Let me check for each 't' what non-terminals can produce them.\n\nt51: NT67 -> t51\nt13: Checking non-terminals which can produce 't13'? Wait, looking through the productions, do any NTs produce t13 directly? Looking through the list, I don't see any NT -> t13. So, perhaps t13 comes from a NT that eventually leads to it via other productions.\n\nWait, but the grammar seems to have rules that sometimes expand into terminals. For example, NT29 -> NT14 NT86, and if NT14 or NT86 can produce terminals, maybe t13 is downstream.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t13 itself isn't a direct production, and the string has a 't13', so maybe I should look for a non-terminal NT that can produce 't13' through a chain.\n\nWait, looking back, I can see:\n\nNT15 -> NT48 NT59, and NT48 -> t64, etc. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces a 't'.\n\nWait, in the given productions:\n\nLooking for NTn -> txx:\n\n- NT5 -> t61, t83, t5, t58, etc. Wait, no, not 't13'.\n\n- NT33 -> t32 or t33.\n\nWait, let's look more carefully. The productions list includes:\n\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT28\n- NT77 -> t79\n- NT28 -> t63 (Wait, no, looking at the list again, it's a bit confusing. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through all productions, I see:\n\n- NT55 -> t19\n- NT32 -> t18\n- NT22 -> t2, etc.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me go through each production line carefully and note which non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT67 -> t51 (yes, directly)\n- NT13 -> t2 (yes, but t13 is different)\nWait, looking at each line:\n\nChecking all NT -> t:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT67 -> t51\n- NT17 -> t46? Wait, no, NT17 is a non-terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the list:\n\nLine 28: NT17 -> t46\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, looking at each line:\n\nFor example:\n\nLine 22: NT22 -> t2\n\nLine 25: NT88 -> t28\n\nLine 39: NT22 -> t2 (another occurrence)\n\nLine 40: NT24 -> t2 (multiple lines)\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up.

{"custom_id":"request-420","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has each production rule as either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that most rules are of the form NTsomething \u2192 NTsomething NTsomething else, which is consistent with CNF. Some rules directly produce a terminal like 't12' or 't5', which also fits.\n\nThe string to check is: `t53 t72 t96 t67 t33 t74 t12 t46 t65 t48 t62 t36 t32 t67 t49 t30 t41 t38 t64 t48 t86 t73`.\n\nMy approach is to use a parsing method, maybe recursive descent, or perhaps a stack-based approach like the CYK algorithm. Since the grammar is CNF, the CYK algorithm would be efficient. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps. Alternatively, I can manually trace the string through the grammar.\n\nLet me think about how the string is built. Each terminal in the string must be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar. So, let me start from the initial symbol S and see how it can generate the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the grammar, S can produce NT61 NT59. So the string must start with something that is derived from NT61 followed by NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t53, t72, t96, etc. I need to figure out which non-terminals these terminals correspond to.\n\nFor example, the first part is t53. Looking at the grammar, NT97 \u2192 't67', but I don't see a production for NT53. Wait, wait, looking back, I see a rule NT67 \u2192 't53'. So NT67 can produce 't53'. So maybe some production chain leads to NT67.\n\nBut let me look at the string step by step. The string is a sequence of terminals. So each part must be produced by a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build a parse tree for the given string, breaking it down into the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by splitting the string into tokens as they are given: each space-separated as a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps the string is in order, so I need to see if it can be divided into a sequence of productions starting from S.\n\nLet me consider the first few tokens. The first is t53. Looking up the grammar, NT67 \u2192 't53'. So the first part is NT67.\n\nNext, I have to see how the rest of the string can be built using the remaining rules.\n\nWait, but the initial step is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So the first two parts of the string should come from NT61 and NT59.\n\nBut the first token is t53, which is NT67, not NT61 or NT59. So maybe I have a problem here. That would suggest that perhaps the string is not generated by this grammar because the initial symbols don't match.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misunderstood. Let me check if t53 can be derived from NT61 or NT59 somehow, but I don't think so. In the grammar, NT67 directly produces t53, and NT61 and NT59 don't directly produce t53. So maybe the initial part is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong way. Let me check again. The string is `t53 t72 t96 t67 t33 t74 t12 t46 t65 t48 t62 t36 t32 t67 t49 t30 t41 t38 t64 t48 t86 t73`. \n\nWait, the first symbol is t53, which I know comes from NT67. So perhaps the starting rule is different. But in the given grammar, the starting symbols are S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So the string must start with something derived from NT61 followed by NT59.\n\nBut t53 comes from NT67, which is a different non-terminal, not directly connected to NT61 or NT59. Therefore, this suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the initial symbols don't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I should confirm. Let me look up NT61 and NT59. \n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT55 \u2192 NT19 NT87\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\nNT48 \u2192 NT96 NT33\nNT96 \u2192 't48'\n... and so on.\n\nWait, but according to the given grammar, NT61 can be broken down into NT33 and NT55, which then can be further down to terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a little confused. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So the string must start with the expansion of NT61 followed by the expansion of NT59.\n\nBut the first token is t53, which comes from NT67, not NT61 or NT59. So unless the grammar allows for some indirect derivation, but I don't think so because NT67 is a separate chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The initial expansion is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So S will generate a string that starts with NT61's expansion followed by NT59's expansion.\n\nBut the given string starts with t53, which is NT67. So unless there's a way that NT61 can somehow produce t53, which seems impossible because NT61's productions don't lead to t53 in the grammar.\n\nWait, I'm starting to think that the string is not generated by this grammar because the initial symbols don't align. The first symbol t53 suggests that the first part is NT67, but S in the grammar can only start with NT61 and NT59.\n\nHmm, perhaps the production tree is not starting at the beginning of the string but branching somewhere else, but I don't think so because the parsing usually starts from the root symbol S and builds the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Then other rules follow, like NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95, and so on.\n\nLooking at t53 in the string, it's from NT67 \u2192 't53'. So the first part is NT67.\n\nSo the string is supposed to be built as NT67 followed by something that comes from NT59.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the initial symbol is S, and the entire string is generated by S. But perhaps the string is a possible part of a larger derivation starting from S.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the string may or may not be in the language defined by the grammar, which is generated from S.\n\nSo I have to see if the entire string can be generated starting from S.\n\nBut starting from S, which is NT61 NT59, the string should start with NT61's expansion. But the string starts with t53, which is part of NT67, not NT61 or NT59. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because the initial part doesn't match any production from S.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string starts with `t53`, which corresponds to the non-terminal NT67 in the grammar. However, the start symbol S produces NT61 and NT59, neither of which derive to NT67.

Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the string we're evaluating.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I notice some that directly produce terminals, like S \u2192 NT61 NT59, which are probably part of the base case in derivations.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t63 t51 t54 t30 t41 t28 t39 t49 t5 t94 t25 t32 t41 t65 t32 t67 t76 t95 t33 t66 t19 t42`.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the terminals in the string to see if they match any productions. The terminals are numbers from t5 up to t96, each corresponding to a specific production that ends in a terminal. For example, NT60 -> 't68' or NT84 -> 't57'.\n\nTo prove that the string is generated, I need to construct a leftmost derivation from the start symbol S to exactly match the given string. \n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. \n\n- NT61: Looking at the productions, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So substituting:\n  S \u2192 NT33 NT55 NT59\n\n- NT33: NT33 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n  So S \u2192 NT27 NT58 NT55 NT59\n\n- NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\n  S \u2192 NT7 NT28 NT58 NT55 NT59\n\n- NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT63 NT76\n  So S \u2192 NT7 NT28 NT58 NT55 NT59 \u2192 NT7 (NT63 NT76) NT58 NT55 NT59\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Maybe I should use the rules for NT28. Looking back, the productions for NT28: There's no direct NT28 production; instead, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28, and NT28 \u2192 NT63 NT76. So actually, replacing NT28 gives:\n\nS \u2192 NT7 (NT63 NT76) NT58 NT55 NT59\n\nBut wait, NT7 is another non-terminal. So I need to expand NT7. Looking at the productions, NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23. So:\n\nS \u2192 (NT19 NT23) NT63 NT76 NT58 NT55 NT59\n\nNow, NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT9 NT59, as per the productions.\n\nSo S becomes (NT9 NT59) NT63 NT76 NT58 NT55 NT59\n\nNow, NT59: NT59 \u2192 NT25 NT57. So replacing:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT25 NT57 NT63 NT76 NT58 NT55 NT59\n\nNT9: NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n\nSo: S \u2192 (NT10 NT17) NT25 NT57 NT63 NT76 NT58 NT55 NT59\n\nNT10: NT10 \u2192 NT61 NT96, so:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT96 NT17 NT25 NT57 NT63 NT76 NT58 NT55 NT59\n\nNT96: NT96 \u2192 't67' because NT96 \u2192 't67' from the productions.\n\nSo, replacing NT96 with t67:\n\nS \u2192 ... (I'll replace this as needed) ... The string starts with t51, but wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reverse engineer the string by checking each production rule step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t63 t51 t54 t30 t41 t28 t39 t49 t5 t94 t25 t32 t41 t65 t32 t67 t76 t95 t33 t66 t19 t42`\n\nThat's 22 terminals. Starting from S, which produces two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can produce either more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me see the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n   NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n   NT59 \u2192 NT25 NT57\n\nSo far, the string starts with NT61 and NT59, which would produce some terminals further down.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent each step as a sequence of non-terminals and then terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a bottom-up approach, looking at the string from the end.\n\nLet me reverse the string and see if I can match the productions in reverse.\n\nReversed string: `t42 t19 t67 t76 t95 t33 t66 t25 t94 t5 t49 t39 t28 t41 t2 t32 t32 t53 t2 t33 t54 t15 t96 t63`\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by a production of a non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string in order:\n\nt63, t51, t54, t30, t41, t28, t39, t49, t5, t94, t25, t32, t41, t65, t32, t67, t76, t95, t33, t66, t19, t42.\n\nSo 22 terminals.

Wait, this loop could go on indefinitely unless I stop when I hit terminal steps.\n\nAlternatively, let's follow the steps as per the string:\n\nThe first part is t63, which comes from NT28. NT28 comes from NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28. So, first, NT28 \u2192 t63 t76.\n\nWait, no. NT28 \u2192 NT63 NT76. So the string starts with t63 followed by t76.\n\nWait, the string starts with t63, then t51. Hmm, t51 is 't51', which is from NT51 \u2192 't51' because looking at the productions, NT51 is directly a terminal. Oh, wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT51 is directly 't51'. So t51 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t63 is t51, which would be \"t63 t51\". How is that possible?\n\nLooking back, I might have misread the productions. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking for NT51: Scanning through the productions, I see that NT30 \u2192 't39', NT46 \u2192 't49', NT51 \u2192 't51'. So yes, NT51 is a terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nNow, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT27 NT58.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT9 NT59.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17.\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT61 NT96.\n\nNow, NT61 is again a chain, so this could cause recursion without hitting terminals, so perhaps this substring does not lead to the given string's starting terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part of the string comes from a different chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.\n\nThe given string starts with t63 and t51. So let's see if any production starts with these.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT2 \u2192 't64', NT3 \u2192 't36', NT5 \u2192 't5' from one production, 't83' from another. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking for producing t63: In the productions, NT63 \u2192 't63' is present? No, wait, checking the productions for NT55: NT55 \u2192 't5' and others. Wait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nWait, for NT24, there's a production NT24 \u2192 't42' and 't...'?

{"custom_id":"request-434","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with production rules. Since it's inCNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which makes parsing easier using methods like CYK. The string to evaluate is: `t42 t74 t50 t9 t86 t5 t87 t54 t97 t95 t96 t82 t2 t86 t63 t74 t32 t65 t74 t36 t2 t49 t38`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a sequence of t-terms and numbers. Some of these are terminals (like 't42', 't74', etc.) while others are non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014wait, in a CNF grammar, all symbols except the non-terminals are terminals. So, looking back at the grammar, all the right-hand sides consist of combinations of two non-terminals (since everything is either 't' or a two-digit number). Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, some of the productions end with a two-digit number, like 'S \u2192 NT61 NT59', but then other rules have t's on the right side. Wait, looking again, some rules like S \u2192 NT61 NT59, NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52, etc., but then there are productions like NT5 \u2192 't83', so the 't's are terminal symbols, and the non-terminals are the NT entries.\n\nWait, no, wait\u2014looking more carefully, some productions under NT are the 't' and number sequences, like NT5 \u2192 't83'. So the 't's are terminals, and the NTs are non-terminals. So each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo the string is a series of 't's and numbers. Now, I need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nThis seems like it might be a candidate for parsing with CYK. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Parse the string into tokens\/phonemes. The string is already split as individual tokens: `t42, t74, t50, t9, t86, t5, t87, t54, t97, t95, t96, t82, t2, t86, t63, t74, t32, t65, t74, t36, t2, t49, t38`.\n\n2. Identify the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand sides (RHS) of the productions. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, and so on. So each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal.\n\n3. For CYK parsing, build a table where each cell [i, j] represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j.\n\nGiven that this might be a bit complex, let's see if we can approach it by looking for possible non-terminal sequences that can derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards from the start symbol and see if each part of the string can be generated.\n\nWait, looking at the start symbol S, which can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So the first production would require NT61 and NT59, or NT29 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t42. Let's check which productions end in t42. Looking at the grammar, there's a production NT26 \u2192 t60, NT60 \u2192 t49, etc. Wait, looking for t42, I see that NT2 is \u2192 t64... No, that's not t42. Wait, looking at the productions, perhaps NT88 \u2192 t42? Yes, the productions include NT88 \u2192 t42. Similarly, NT62 \u2192 t12, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each token and see if it can be generated by any production. Then try to chain these together.\n\nAlternatively, use the CYK approach step by step.\n\nLet's note the tokens and their positions:\n\n1: t42\n\n2: t74\n\n3: t50\n\n4: t9\n\n5: t86\n\n6: t5\n\n7: t87\n\n8: t54\n\n9: t97\n\n10: t95\n\n11: t96\n\n12: t82\n\n13: t2\n\n14: t86\n\n15: t63\n\n16: t74\n\n17: t32\n\n18: t65\n\n19: t74\n\n20: t36\n\n21: t2\n\n22: t49\n\n23: t38\n\nTotal of 23 tokens. So n=23.\n\nWe need a 23x23 table, but that's a bit too much, but perhaps I can look for patterns.\n\nLet's identify each token and see if it's a terminal or from which non-terminals:\n\n- t42: NT88 \u2192 t42 (produces t42)\n\n- t74: Hmm, looking through the productions, do any non-terminals produce t74? Looking at the list: NT66 \u2192 t95, NT8 \u2192 t2, etc. No, I don't see any non-terminals that produce t74 as a terminal. Wait, check again: NT66 \u2192 t95, NT88 \u2192 t33, etc. Hmm, that's a problem because the first token is t74, but I don't think any production ends with t74. So perhaps the string cannot be generated because the first token is t74, which is not produced by any production.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Let me verify:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT58 \u2192 t66, NT46 \u2192 t79, NT62 \u2192 t12, NT54 \u2192 t51, etc. Do any NT symbols produce t74? No, I don't see t74 in any RHS. So the first token, t74, cannot be generated by any production, which means the string can't be part of the language.

{"custom_id":"request-438","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right. The string to evaluate is: `t37 t42 t48 t74 t12 t42 t96 t66 t13 t72 t41 t2 t97 t48 t50 t65 t36 t67 t86 t37 t19 t0 t87`.\n\nFirst, I notice that some of the tokens in the string are terminal symbols, like 't37', 't42', etc. These correspond to specific productions in the grammar that terminate the derivation and produce a terminal string. Other tokens are non-terminals, which need to be replaced by other rules.\n\nI'll start by mapping the string's tokens to their possible positions in the grammar. The string has 21 tokens, so I need to see how these can break down into the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the first token is 't37'. Let's find where 't37' comes from. In the grammar, 't37' corresponds to the production rule:\n- 't37' is from NT20: NT20 -> 't37'.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar rules:\nNT20 -> 't37'. Wait, the grammar has:\nNT20 -> NT73 NT73. But then another rule says NT20 -> 't37'? No, looking back, no, in the grammar, 't37' corresponds to NT20 -> 't37'? Wait, no, I have to check each production.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT20 -> 't37'? Or is it another rule? Let me check the grammar rules provided:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT20, there's a rule:\nNT20 -> 't37' (Yes, in the list: NT20 -> 't37') and another rule: NT20 -> NT73 NT73.\n\nWait, no, looking again: The grammar provided has:\n\n- NT20 -> NT73 NT73\n- NT20 -> 't37'\n\nSo NT20 has two productions. That means when we see 't37' in the string, it must come from the NT20 -> 't37' production, not the other one.\n\nSo the first token is 't37', which is derived from NT20. So the string starts with NT20.\n\nSo the derivation would be starting with S, and S breaks down into NT61 and NT59. Let me check the first rule: S -> NT61 NT59.\n\nSo S becomes NT61 and NT59. Each of these must generate parts of the string. Let's see:\n\nNT61 -> 't36' or other rules. Wait, looking back: The rule for NT61 is in the grammar as NT61 -> NT33 NT55.\n\nWait, wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar and then the string. I need to map each token in the string to a production.\n\nLet me start by listing all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nThe non-terminals are: S, NT61, NT59, NT47, NT79, NT15, NT65, NT78, NT65, NT29, NT83, NT88, NT36, NT93, NT15, NT73, NT68, NT17, NT60, NT67, NT67, NT70, NT58, NT2, NT31, NT57, NT78, NT70, NT77, NT79, NT65, NT67, NT59, NT20, NT7, NT77, NT61, NT27, NT77, NT55, NT17, NT18, NT77, NT15, NT71, NT47, NT5, NT46, NT84, NT67, NT27, NT2, NT79, NT28, NT8, NT60, NT52, NT67, NT22, NT29, NT48, NT96, NT67, NT19, NT18, NT21, NT83, NT66.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Maybe it's easier to see which terminals correspond to which non-terminals.\n\nLooking through each production and see which terminals are produced:\n\n- NT20 -> 't37'\n- NT2 -> 't64'\n- NT31 -> 't54'\n- NT57 -> 't17'\n- NT59 -> 't46'\n- NT29 -> 't62' and 't87'\n- NT15 -> 't96' and 't71'\n- NT47 -> 't73', 't18', 't59'?\nWait, no, actually, for NT47, the productions are:\n- NT47 -> NT58 NT95\n- NT47 -> NT10 NT96\n- NT29 -> NT14 NT86\n- Wait, no, looking at the grammar again, let's make sure.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should create a list where each non-terminal points to all the terminals it can produce.\n\nLet me go through each production and extract the terminal strings.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-453","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is \"t25 t65 t96 t64 t28 t73 t46 t41 t28 t3 t64 t64 t12 t50 t83 t13 t13 t80 t25 t5 t5 t82 t51 t33\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF has production rules where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The grammar provided has a lot of production rules, so I should parse through them to see what terminals and non-terminals are involved.\n\nLooking at the rules, I can see that some non-terminals like NT2, NT46, NT5, NT88, etc., eventually derive into terminals like 't25', 't5', 't65', etc. The string starts with t25, which probably comes from NT5 since NT5 \u2192 't5' (among others). Let me check the rules for NT5: \n\n- Oh wait, there's NT5 \u2192 't5', 't56', 't59', 't83', 't86'. Wait, 't5' is one possibility. But in the string, it's t25 first. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by figuring out which non-terminals in the grammar can derive into the given string. Let me see.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. So I need to find a path through the grammar that produces this exact sequence.\n\nI can approach this by trying to reverse engineer the production steps. The last production step is probably the top-level symbol S. The top-level production in the grammar is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So S produces two non-terminals, which would each generate parts of the string. Let me see if that's consistent with the string.\n\nThe string starts with t25, which might come from NT83 (since NT83 \u2192 't25' directly). Then the next few tokens might be part of the production. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built by multiple steps, so each terminal in the string must be generated by some production.\n\nI think a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm. But since the grammar is in CNF and we have all the productions, I can model it as such. Let me list the productions as pairs of non-terminals generating a terminal, like (NTXY \u2192 a).\n\nWait, looking at the production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\n- NT46 \u2192 NT96 NT33\n- NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\n- NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT84 \u2192 but wait, in the original, NT5 has multiple productions: NT5 \u2192 't5', 't83', 't56', 't67', etc.\n\nWait, the grammar seems a bit complex. Each production is a terminal or two non-terminals. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nBut the CYK algorithm would require building a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of symbols that can derive the substring from i to j. But manually doing CYK for a 24-token string would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build the parse tree step by step. The top symbol is S, which is NT61 NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, after S, we have t25 t65 t96 t64... which suggests that the left part (NT61) might generate something. NT61 is involved in some productions. Looking at the rules, I see NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, which are both non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t25, which might be derived by NT83. So perhaps the right part (NT59) is NT59 \u2192 NT29 NT59? Wait, looking at the rules: NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86, and NT59 appears in some other rules, like NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT61.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about how the productions could combine to form the string.\n\nAnother approach is to see each token in the string and see which production could lead to it. For example, t25 is directly derived from NT83 (since NT83 \u2192 't25').\n\nSo if the top production is S \u2192 NT61 NT59, which then must produce the entire string. So both NT61 and NT59 would need to derive parts of the string.\n\nWait, let me consider the left and right sides:\n\nThe string starts with t25. If that comes from NT83, then the S production would require that NT59 also produces the remaining part of the string.\n\nBut NT59 is part of the right-hand side of S. So NT59 would then need to produce the rest: t65 t96 t64 t28 t73 t46 t41 t28 t3 t64 t64 t12 t50 t83 t13 t13 t80 t25 t5 t5 t82 t51 t33.\n\nBut that's a long list. Let me check if the initial part aligns. The next token is t65, which is a terminal. Looking at the productions, is t65 a terminal? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see 't65' directly. Wait, but I see NT65 has multiple productions, including NT65 \u2192 't67', NT65 \u2192 't6'?

{"custom_id":"request-461","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I'm supposed to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t39 t37 t41 t74 t79 t99 t25 t99 t83 t18 t99 t80 t97 t99 t50 t2 t33 t9 t74 t5 t3 t66 t30 t94`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar allows. CNF has production rules where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So every production is either A \u2192 B, A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit dense, but I can see some patterns. A lot of non-terminals like S and NTxx are defined, but some terminals (the 't' followed by numbers) are present. Wait, hold on\u2014CNF only involves non-terminals on the RHS, right? So if any production has a terminal on the RHS, that might be an issue unless it's allowed in CNF. Wait, actually, CNF allows for productions that introduce terminals, sometimes at the end. But maybe in this case, each production either has terminals or non-terminals, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should check.\n\nWait, the initial production in the grammar is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So S is a non-terminal. Then, other non-terminals like NT47, NT79, etc., are defined. Some of them produce two non-terminals, others produce terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 't16'. So that's a terminal. Hmm, but wait, in some derivations, when you have a production that produces a terminal, that terminal is added to the string, which would be part of the derived string.\n\nSo the given string is a sequence of terminals, each represented by 't' followed by a number. Now, the provided grammar has some NT productions that directly produce terminals. So 'tX' is a terminal symbol, and these are allowed in the RHS of productions. Wait, but in CNF, each production can have two non-terminals or one non-terminal. So maybe for NT rules that produce two non-terminals, it's fine, but for those that produce a terminal, the terminal is just added as a terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, or one non-terminal. But terminals can't be on the RHS; so that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the grammar uses symbols that can include both terminals and non-terminals, but in CNF, typically, you only have non-terminals on the RHS. Hmm, perhaps the grammar here isn't strictly in CNF, or maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps in this context, some productions have terminals on the RHS, but that would mean it's not a proper CNF. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Chomsky Normal Form requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 B, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and B and C are not the start symbol. However, sometimes people present context-free grammars without terminals in the RHS, but in this case, I see some rules like NT68 \u2192 't16'. But 't16' is a terminal, which suggests that the grammar includes terminals in the RHS, which would imply it's not strictly in CNF because each production's RHS should consist of only non-terminals for CNF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this context, the grammar is modified to include terminal symbols on the RHS, meaning that each production might have a terminal followed or preceded by non-terminals, but that might not be the case. I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, all the RHSs are either single non-terminals or two non-terminals, except for some cases like NT68 \u2192 't16'. So for those that produce terminals, the RHS has a terminal symbol, which suggests that the grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals in the RHS. That might mean it's not in proper CNF. But the user provided it as a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting which parts are non-terminals and terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given string consists only of terminals, and the grammar includes non-terminals that derive into those terminals. So the problem is about whether the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the productions. \n\nWait, looking again, all the productions in the grammar start with S or NT, which are non-terminals. The terminal symbols are things like 't16', 't39', etc. So each rule might either terminate (produce a terminal as part of the string) or continue with non-terminals.\n\nSo now, for the given string `t39 t37 t41 t74 t79 t99 t25 t99 t83 t18 t99 t80 t97 t99 t50 t2 t33 t9 t74 t5 t3 t66 t30 t94`, I need to check if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the approach should be to reverse-engineer the string, starting from the start symbol S and see if we can derive it step by step. But that's tedious, as the string is 24 symbols long. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to parse the string backward, starting from the start symbol and seeing if it can produce the string.\n\nWait, but parsing is often done from the string to the grammar. So maybe it's easier to start with S and see if it can derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for patterns or paths in the grammar that can produce the given string. But that might be challenging.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in the given grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 't16', so in the string, 't16' can be generated. Similarly, 't39' is generated by NT60 \u2192 't46'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 't49'. Wait, no, not directly. Let me check all the productions that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't16'\n- NT62 \u2192 't12'\n- NT54 \u2192 't64'\n- NT55 \u2192 't19'\n- NT14 \u2192 't2'\n- NT29 \u2192 't62' (but NT29 also is defined elsewhere)\n- NT24 \u2192 't2' (twice)\n- NT23 \u2192 't79'\n- NT23 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't74'\n- NT27 \u2192 't7'\n- NT79 \u2192 't80'\n- NT88 \u2192 't72'\n- NT26 \u2192 't42'\n- NT59 \u2192 't46'\n- NT9 \u2192 't18'\n- NT24 \u2192 't39' (Wait, NT24 \u2192 't39'?

Wait, in the grammar, under NT:\n\nLooking again: \n\n- NT24 \u2192 't39' ? Or is it NT24 \u2192 't39'? Because earlier in the list I see:\n\n\u201cNT24 \u2192 NT59\u201d and also later \u201cNT24 \u2192 't39\u2019\u201d So, yes, NT24 has two rules: one is NT59 and the other is 't39'.

{"custom_id":"request-479","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to evaluate is: `t30 t54 t30 t76 t73 t97 t19 t63 t49 t16 t9 t12 t18 t66 t79 t97 t42 t96 t38 t32 t18 t49 t18 t97 t50`.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the non-terminal symbols in the grammar. From the grammar, the non-terminals are S, NT47, NT79, NT15, NT65, NT78, NT65 (but it's duplicated), NT29, NT83, NT88, NT36, NT93, NT15 (again), NT73, NT68, NT17, NT60, NT67, NT67 (again), NT70, NT58, NT2, NT31, NT57, NT78, NT70 (again), NT52, NT67 (again), NT20, NT7, NT77, NT77 (again), NT20 (again), NT15 (again), NT5, NT46, NT84, NT67, NT27, NT77, NT77 (again), NT20 (again), NT15 (again), NT5, NT46, NT84 (again), etc. Wait, that's a lot. So maybe I can make a list.\n\nBut looking at the string, I notice that all the symbols in the string are terminals, which are either 't' followed by a number. For example, 't30', 't54', etc. So the string is made up entirely of terminals, which suggests that the grammar should derive this string from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production splits the non-terminal into two parts. Since the string contains 26 symbols, the derivation must consist of exactly 12 productions (since for a string of length n, n-1 productions are needed, but since it's binary, it's log2(n) steps. But with 26 symbols, it's not a power of 2, so I might need to consider that.)\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the length increases by one each time. Starting from S, the first step would be two non-terminals, then four, etc. So for the string to have m tokens, it's 2^k = m. Here, m=26, which is not a power of 2. That might already be a problem because 2^4=16 and 2^5=32, so 26 isn't possible. That suggests that the string length isn't compatible with the grammar, implying that it's not possible. But I'm not sure if that's the case, because maybe some symbols are terminals and some steps might involve replacing non-terminals until you reach terminals.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions have non-terminals on the right-hand side. So the start is S, and if each replacement replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the number grows exponentially. Unless some of the rules have terminal symbols, but looking at the given grammar, it's all non-terminals on the right side. Oh wait, no, I see some production rules where the right-hand side ends up being a terminal. For example, NT68 -> 't16', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT60 -> 't49', and others.\n\nSo each derivation step can potentially produce terminal symbols. So the number of symbols can increase exponentially, but some non-terminals can be terminals, so the total number doesn't have to be a power of two. So maybe it's possible. But the key here is that when you have all terminals, the string is a combination of the leftmost derivations. So I need to check if each step in the string corresponds to possible productions.\n\nBut manually tracing the entire 26-symbol string would be very time-consuming. Maybe I can look for the structure in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar defines a specific language, and the string might be part of it. Another approach is to try to build the parse tree from the bottom up, but that would involve choosing the correct non-terminals at each step, which is complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce the terminals in the string. For example, looking through the grammar, some NTs map to 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT68 -> 't16', NT52 -> 't42', NT31 -> 't54', etc. So perhaps individual non-terminals can directly produce parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t30, t54, t30, t76, t73, t97, t19, t63, t49, t16, t9, t12, t18, t66, t79, t97, t42, t96, t38, t32, t18, t49, t18, t97, t50.\n\nI can try to see if these terminals correspond to any of the productions. For instance, looking for the right-hand sides:\n\n- t30: Do any NTs produce this? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't30'. Wait, in the grammar, does any rule have a t30 on the right side? Scanning, I don't see 't30' as a terminal in any production.\n\nWait, so the first symbol in the string is 't30', but in the grammar, the right-hand sides of all production rules either are two NTs or a single NT producing a terminal. Wait, no, only two NTs on the right side, except perhaps the last one. For example, looking at NT68: NT68 -> 't16' is given. But for 't30', I don't see any production rule that has 't30' on the right. So if the first symbol is 't30', then that cannot be the result of any production in the grammar, since all productions produce either two NTs or terminals, but no NTs produce 't30'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe some NTs can eventually produce 't30' through multiple steps. Alternatively, perhaps 't30' is not present in any terminal production, which would mean that 't30' cannot appear in the string. So the string starts with 't30', which is not a terminal from any production, meaning the string cannot be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. The production rules are all of the form S -> NT1 NT2, where NT1 and NT2 are non-terminals. The right-hand sides have either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT68 -> 't16' is a terminal, but I don't see 't30' anywhere. Looking through the entire grammar, I don't see any production rules where a non-terminal produces a 't30'. So 't30' can't appear in the language, as it's not a terminal that any non-terminal can produce.\n\nTherefore, the string must contain a terminal that isn't in the grammar's terminal symbols, making the answer 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-478","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is \"t9 t83 t83 t42 t51 t33 t33 t54 t95 t28 t30 t55 t93 t62 t42 t25 t83 t73 t83 t83 t95 t50 t73 t73 t52 t24 t96 t83 t83 t83 t95 t62 t83 t22 t23 t42\". \n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, in strict CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, but in many cases, especially when allowing terminals, each RHS can be a terminal followed by a non-terminal. However, sometimes the definition includes any number of symbols, but in the strictest form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. Wait, no, wait: actually, in the strict CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals? No, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, but sometimes you can have A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me clarify: Chomsky Normal Form requires that every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So some productions can have a terminal, but all have two symbols on the RHS. Also, the start symbol does not appear on the RHS of any production. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the productions are of the form S \u2192 NT61 NT61, where NT... represents non-terminals, but there are some terminals in the RHS. For example, NT68 \u2192 't12', where 't12' is a terminal. So the grammar allows both NT productions and terminal productions.\n\nNow, the string to check consists of a series of terminals \"t9\", \"t83\", etc. To determine if this string is in the language, I need to see if it's possible to derive this string from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI'll approach this by simulating the derivation. Starting from S, each production splits the string into two parts, applying the production step by step until the entire string is consumed.\n\nThe given string is: t9 t83 t25 t13 t38 t33 t42 t25 t95 t62 t3 t3 t42 t97 t83 t35 t94 t53 t95 t50 t83 t73 t35 t73 t25.\n\nThe string has 31 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step splits the string into two parts, each of which must be a valid substring produced by a grammar rule.\n\nSo, starting with S, which has to produce a pair of NT symbols. Let's see the productions for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT61 (I assume, since there are two S rules, maybe I need to check which one is applicable. Wait, looking back, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So perhaps there are multiple S productions. Wait, but in the initial grammar, it's written as:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo S can expand into two different pairs of non-terminals. But since the string starts with t9, which corresponds to 't9' being generated by a terminal from a non-terminal, maybe I should look for productions that can generate 't9'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT9 \u2192 't9'. So 't9' comes from NT9. So perhaps the string starts with a production that includes NT9.\n\nBut let's think: to generate the string starting with t9, perhaps one of the productions for S leads to NT... that expands to 't9'. Or perhaps it's through a long chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a path from S down to the given string. Since each step doubles the length (as each production is two symbols), but that's not necessarily true because the grammar allows for production into terminals, which are single symbols. So the string length could vary.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is two symbols, but when one of them is a terminal, that contributes a single symbol. So when you have a tree of productions, the number of leaves (terminals) can be variable, depending on how many non-terminals you can split.\n\nWait, in our case, the given string is 31 symbols. Let me see if 31 can be expressed as 2^n -1. Wait, 31 is 2^5 -1, so n=5. That would mean the derivation has 5 levels of splits. But each level would produce more symbols, but perhaps with some being terminals.\n\nWait, but the initial string is 31, which is an odd number of terminals, but in CNF, each production adds exactly one symbol, so the total number of terminals depends on the splits. But perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe it's better to see if each token in the string can be matched by a terminal production.\n\nSo let's start by trying to match the string from the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to see if each part of the string can be broken down according to the grammar, step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is given and the string is provided, perhaps it's feasible to write out the possible derivations.\n\nBut looking at the grammar rules, it's quite extensive. Let's see if I can find the 't' tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, certain NT symbols produce 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\nNT8 \u2192 't2'\nNT12 \u2192 't97'\nNT22 \u2192 't67'\n...\nSo each 'ti' is produced by a specific NT. So for the string to be generated, every symbol must be matched by a corresponding NT that produces that 'ti'.\n\nGiven that, for the string to be generated, each 'ti' must be present in the NT productions as a terminal. So let's go through the string and see if each 'ti' is present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t9, t83, t25, t13, t38, t33, t42, t25, t95, t62, t3, t3, t42, t97, etc.\n\nLet's check each:\n\nt9: Check the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't9' exists. So the first 't9' is OK.\n\nt83: Check if any NT produces 't83'. Looking through the grammar: yes, NT83 \u2192 't83' exists (grammar has NT83 \u2192 't83').\n\nt25: Check NT25. Wait, do we have any production that produces 't25'? Let's look through the grammar: NT25 is not present. Hmm, this is a problem. Because t25 would have to come from a production of NT25, but I don't see any such production in the grammar. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me scan the grammar lines again.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines provided, I see lines like NT25 \u2192 't25'. Let me check: yes, indeed, in the list:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't25'\n\nSo t25 is produced by NT25. So the third token is OK.\n\nt13: Check NT13. Looking through the grammar, NT13 is produced as: NT13 \u2192 NT9 NT59, and possibly elsewhere. Wait, the specific productions for NT13: in the list, I see NT13 \u2192 't13'. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't13' is listed.\n\nWait, no, no: looking at the grammar provided, the lines are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT66\n\nBut I don't see NT13 in the list. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT13 \u2192 Not present.\n\nWait, wait, let's recount. The NT symbols are:\n\nNT61, NT65, NT29, etc. Wait, I'm trying to see if any NT13 is present. Looking through the list:\n\nLooking at each line starting with NT...:\n\n- NT47...\n- NT79...\n- NT15...\n- NT68...\n- NT17...\n- NT60...\n- NT29...\n- NT83...\n- NT18...\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CFBN means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Each NT leads to a chain of productions, eventually terminating with terminal symbols like 't'.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. Each 't' is followed by numbers, which probably correspond to rules that produce them. My goal is to see if these terminals can be generated via the grammar's production rules.\n\nI'll note that each terminal is generated by an NT production. For example, NT67 can produce t53, which I see in the string. Similarly, NT68 produces t83, which is present. Other NTs in the string, like NT38 (I think, since the string has t38), should have rules that produce 't38'.

For example, NT2 is defined as NT52 NT86, which themselves have rules leading to 't64'. \n\nWait, but for the string, each 't' is produced by a specific NT. For example:\n\n- 't18' comes from NT9. Check: Indeed, there's NT9 -> t18.\n- 't82' could come from NT82. Wait, looking at the grammar, do any NTs produce 't82'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through, I see NT82 isn't listed on the right-hand side of any production. Hmm, wait, but the string includes t82, so I need to see if that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps 't82' is an input terminal, meaning there might be a rule that directly gives 't82'. Let me check the grammar rules provided. Scanning through the provided list:\n\nI don't see any NT that directly produces 't82'. So, perhaps the string contains a terminal that isn't directly produced by the grammar, making it invalid.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check.

Let me see if any of the NTs can produce 't82'.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT36 -> NT6 NT78, and NT78 has rules like NT78 -> NT62 NT83, which then leads to ...

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar has production rules with non-terminals and terminals (marked as 'tX'). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky normal form looks like. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, I see that each rule has either two non-terminals on the right (e.g., S \u2192 NT61 NT65) or a terminal (e.g., NT68 \u2192 't16'). \n\nThe string to check is: t95 t16 t32 t35 t87 t30 t41 t79 t25 t49 t32 t12 t32 t49 t54 t9 t37 t16 t41 t80 t66 t72 t94 t16 t32 t79.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use either top-down (e.g., recursive descent using a parser) or bottom-up (e.g., CYK algorithm). However, given the structure, a top-down approach might be more straightforward, trying to match the string by following the production rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the possible starting symbols, which is S. The initial production for S seems to be S \u2192 NT61 NT65 or S \u2192 NT29 NT59. \n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string are t95 and t16. I need to find if these can be the result of any production rule. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT68 \u2192 't16', and NT65 has a production NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65, which also appears for NT60. Wait, maybe I should look for any non-terminals that produce t95.\n\nLooking through the production rules for terminals, there's NT5 -> 't5', NT67 -> 't72', NT88->'t72', etc. I also notice that NT68 production ends with 't16'. So, in the string, the second token is 't16', which could be from NT68. So, maybe the second production is NT68.\n\nWait, but the first step is S \u2192 NT61 NT65. Let's see if 't95' can be produced by NT61 or NT65.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n- NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT20\nWait, NT19 \u2192 't0', NT20 \u2192 't37'. Hmm, but none of these directly produce 't95'. Let me check the other possible starting point S \u2192 NT29 NT59.\n\nThe first token is 't95' which could be from NT67? Wait, NT67 isn't a non-terminal in the S production; actually, NT67 only has productions that end in other rules, like NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14, etc. Or wait, looking again, I see NT93 \u2192 't72', but not NT33.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a better strategy. Maybe working backwards from the string's tokens to see how they can be derived. Alternatively, using a table to track possible non-terminals and symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be decomposed into the possible chains of non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t95 t16 t32 t35 t87 t30 t41 t79 t25 t49 t32 t12 t32 t49 t54 t9 t37 t16 t41 t80 t66 t72 t94 t16 t32 t79.\n\nSo, that's 27 tokens. I'll try to group them into chunks that match production rules.\n\nLooking at the beginning, 't95' and 't16' \u2014 perhaps these are from a production like NT68 \u2192 t16, but how does 95 come? Wait, looking back at the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t95? Let's see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5', NT65 \u2192 't51', NT47 \u2192 't73', etc.\n\nWait, in the production rules, I see that NT88 \u2192 't42', NT24 \u2192 't2', etc. Hmm. Wait, looking for a non-terminal that can produce t95. Checking all the production rules ending with terminals, the non-terminals that do so are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't58' (Wait, no, looking back: NT5 is one of the early non-terminals, but looking again, some have 't5':\n- Wait, I see:\n  - NT5 \u2192 't5'\n  - NT65 \u2192 't67' and 't94' (from some rules)\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the production rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't60'\n- NT2 \u2192 't64'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT14 \u2192 't2'\n- NT17 \u2192 't46'\n- NT20 \u2192 't37'\n- NT29 \u2192 't87', 't62'\n- NT48 \u2192 't64'\n- NT54 \u2192 't64'\n- NT55 \u2192 't19', 't5'\n- NT59 \u2192 't46'\n- NT65 \u2192 't51', 't94'\n- NT67 \u2192 't72', 't95'\nWait, I think I might have found one. NT67 has a production NT67 \u2192 't95', so t95 can come from NT67. So, maybe the first two tokens can be produced by NT67 and another non-terminal.\n\nWait, the first two tokens are t95 (NT67) and t16. So, perhaps S \u2192 NT67 ...? But looking at S's productions, S only starts with two non-terminals. So, maybe S \u2192 NT61 NT65 is not the start, but perhaps another production.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, S can also produce NT29 NT59. So, maybe S \u2192 NT29 NT59 is the start, but then NT29 would produce t16? Let me check NT29's rules:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86, and then looking further down, NT86 \u2192 't19' and 't55', which might not produce t16.\n\nAlternatively, NT67 \u2192 't95' and 't72'. Hmm, maybe that's the first token.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to represent the possible way the string can be split into non-terminals and terminals using the production rules.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree. Since it's a CFG, let's see if each token can be derived through rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a series of non-terminals that align with the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from the first token, t95. Looking for production(s) that can reach t95. From earlier, it seems that NT67 \u2192 't95' is possible (though in the list, NT67 \u2192 't95' was not immediately obvious; perhaps I missed it).\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT67 has two productions: NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT28 and NT67 \u2192 NT31 NT28. Those don't help. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar is extensive, so perhaps the production rules that end with terminals are fewer. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the productions one by one:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT20, etc. (No terminal)\n- NT24 \u2192 't39', 't42'\n- NT14 \u2192 't2', etc.\n- NT47 \u2192 't73' as one of the rules.\n- NT29 \u2192 't87', and others like 't62'\n- NT65 \u2192 't67', 't94'\n- NT88 \u2192 't29', 't72'\n- Others like NT93 \u2192 't72', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a way where t95 and t16 come from a production. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into sequences that match the grammar.\n\nWait, let's start by looking for each production that produces a terminal in the string. For example, 't95' could come from NT67 if NT67 \u2192 't95' exists.

{"custom_id":"request-516","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t13 t96 t46 t49 t96 t79 t87 t96 t46 t13 t72 t95 t0 t36 t87 t54 t2 t19 t80 t41 t51 t66 t42 t76 t13 t66 t67`.\n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The given grammar seems to have both terminals and non-terminals, with some productions ending in terminals like 't' followed by numbers and others ending in non-terminals.\n\nThe approach I take is to simulate the parsing process, similar to how a top-down parser like LL(1) would work. Since the grammar is in CNF, an LL(1) parser can handle it if it's unambiguous. However, I might need to build a parse table and check for each symbol in the input string to see if it matches the grammar.\n\nLet me first list out the productions given, categorizing them into terminals and non-terminals. Non-terminals are denoted by uppercase letters (NT...), while terminals are any strings that include 't' followed by numbers, like 't13', 't96', etc. There are some rules where the RHS is two non-terminals, such as S -> NT61 NT59, which breaks down to S being the start symbol.\n\nThe string starts with 't13', which is a terminal. So I need to see if there's a production that starts with 't13'. Looking through the productions, I see that NT13 is not listed as a production, but I notice that NT22 -> NT2 NT67. Wait, NT22 isn't a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a production where 't13' is generated.\n\nWait, looking again, I realize that 't13' is a terminal, and I need to check if there's a production rule that can generate it. Scanning the production list, I see that NT22 -> NT2 NT67, but that would produce a string, not the terminal 't13'. So perhaps 't13' is generated by a non-terminal that I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any production where the RHS includes 't13'. Let's see: the productions with 't' symbols are those like NT28 -> 't63', NT24 -> 't2', etc., but none of them produce 't13'. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with 't13', which my grammar doesn't seem to have a production rule for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the non-terminals NT60 and NT65, for example, can derive into 't13'? Let's check: NT65 has a production NT65 -> NT71 NT65, but that's a cycle. Other productions: NT65 also goes to NT33 NT55, NT65 -> NT71 NT47, etc. Wait, NT33 can go to 't32' or other non-terminals. No, I don't see 't13' in any of the production rules.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see that NT67 has a production NT67 -> NT57 NT14. NT57 -> NT17 NT27, and NT14 -> NT2. So following that chain, NT67 can eventually produce NT2, which is 't64' according to some productions. Wait, no, NT28 -> 't63', NT2 -> 't64', but that's different.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the right-hand sides of NT67 include NT28, which is a non-terminal. Let's look at NT28: NT28 -> NT68 NT87, and NT68 can produce 't83' or non-terminals. It's getting complicated, but I don't see a path where 't13' is generated.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't13', which is a terminal, but I don't see any production rule that directly or indirectly can produce it. That suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-517","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form. That's a bit intimidating, but let's take it step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way to structure CFGs where each production rule is either:\n1. A non-terminal \u2192 non-terminal non-terminal, or\n2. A non-terminal \u2192 a terminal.\n\nThis simplifies the structure of the grammar and is helpful for parsing and other analyses. So, the given grammar follows CNF, which should help in my approach.\n\nThe problem provides a string: `t9 t19 t66 t42 t19 t2 t73 t83 t38 t73 t66 t32 t97 t9 t65 t74 t64 t36 t12 t46 t83 t0 t37 t38 t86 t32 t16` and asks if this string is generated by the provided grammar.\n\nHmm, looking at the grammar, I see a lot of terminal symbols (like 't12', 't94', 't83') and non-terminal symbols on the left side of the arrows. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it according to the grammar rules.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the structure of the grammar and the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is straightforward\u2014each non-terminal can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So, parsing the string step by step might work, but given the length of the string, it might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, but perhaps instead of parsing, I can reverse-engineer from the string. That is, check if each symbol in the string can be generated by some rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of a sequence of terminals: t9, t19, t66, ..., t16. My task is to see if each of these terminals can be produced by the grammar, and if the sequence can be generated through a series of expansions.\n\nSo, let me go through each symbol and see if it's covered by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, 't9'. Looking at the grammar, in the non-terminal productions, 't9' appears as a generated terminal. For example:\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (Wait, but in the given grammar, there's NT5 \u2192 't5'. So 't5' is the production for NT5.\nBut the string has 't9' at the beginning. So, I need to check if 't9' is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, in the terminal list, I see NT5 \u2192 't5', but where's 't9'?\n\nWait, in the grammar, the terminals are given as certain substitutions for non-terminals. So, 't9' is generated by some NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, 't9' is present in some non-terminals. For example:\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't18'\n- NT19 \u2192 't9'\nWait, here's NT19 \u2192 't9'. Yes, that means 't9' is produced by NT19. So, in the string, the first symbol is 't9', which is generated by NT19. That's good.\n\nNext, 't19' comes next. So, the next symbol is 't19'. To produce 't19', we need to look for a non-terminal that can produce 't19' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 't19'. Let's see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't9' as per one of the entries above.\nBut where else? Let me check all rules for any terminal 't19'.\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\nNo, I don't see any rule that directly gives 't19' as a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me scan through each production.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal substitution:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT24 NT46\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n\nWait, this seems a bit off.

That seems recursive and not helpful immediately.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal substitutions to see if any of them produce 't19'.\n\nLooking through each rule, every time a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, in the list:\n\nline 1: NT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nline 2: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nline 3: NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\n\nline 4: NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n\nline 5: NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\n\nline 6: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n\nline 7: NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\n\nline 8: NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96\n\nline 9: NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n\nline 10: NT83 \u2192 NT24 NT46\n\nline 11: NT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29\n\nline 12: NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78\n\nline 13: NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83\n\nline 14: NT15 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n\nline 15: NT73 \u2192 NT26 NT24\n\nline 16: NT68 \u2192 NT93 NT88\n\nline 17: NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54\n\nline 18: NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52\n\nline 19: NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\n\nline 20: NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\n\nline 21: NT70 \u2192 NT52 NT81\n\nline 22: NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23\n\nline 23: NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\n\nline 24: NT31 \u2192 NT26 NT29\n\nline 25: NT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n\nline 26: NT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5\n\nline 27: NT20 \u2192 NT73 NT73\n\nline 28: NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23\n\nline 29: NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6\n\nline 30: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nWait, some rules repeat. Line 30 is the same as line 2: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 comes again, but perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule where 't19' is produced.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- Line 28: NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23. So NT7 \u2192 't19' 't23'? Because 't19' is on the right side as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be careful. Let me check each rule again.\n\nLooking through the rules again, line 28: NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6 or line 28 is NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23.\n\nSo, NT7 is replaced by NT19 and NT23. Since both are non-terminals, unless one of them can produce a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, for the string, the next symbol after 't9' is 't19'.\n\nSo, in the grammar, where can 't19' be generated.\n\nLooking, line 28: NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23.\n\nSo, to produce 't19', perhaps the NT19 can directly produce 't19' if such a rule exists.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT19.\n\nLooking for all NT rules that have NT19 on the left:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT19 in any. So, the only production with 't19' is on line 28: NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23.\n\nSo, that implies that 't19' is generated when another non-terminal NT19 is derived. But since NT19 doesn't have a production in the grammar that leads to a terminal, unless NT19 does.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The NT19 rule would have to produce a terminal for 't19' to appear in the string. But if NT19 doesn't produce any terminal, then 't19' must come from the expansion of a non-derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the process of expanding"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals or A is a terminal. So, the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is two non-terminals, except in the cases where a terminal is on the RHS. Wait, actually, in the given rules, I see some terminals like 't12', 't94', etc. So, in some cases, the productions may have a terminal on the RHS, which means those non-terminals correspond directly to a terminal symbol.\n\nBut the problem is with using the string to build a parse tree. Each production rule can be represented as nodes in a tree, but every time a terminal is produced, it becomes a leaf in the tree.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals. To check if the string is generated by the grammar, I think the usual approach is to perform a leftmost derivation, but that can be lengthy. Alternatively, one can try to construct the parse tree or see if the sequence matches the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is given, I can create a context-free parser and see if the string is accepted. But manually doing that would be tedious given the number of symbols.\n\nLooking closely, perhaps the first thing to do is to map the non-terminals to the terminals in the string. Each production gives the next possible steps. Let me examine the rules again.\n\nWe have several rules that map non-terminals to terminal symbols:\n\n- S -> NT61 NT59\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT55\n  - NT55 -> NT19 NT27 (but looking below, some have more specific definitions)\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT17\n  - NT10 -> NT96\n  - NT17 -> NT48 (and looking further, NT48 -> t97)\n- NT93 -> NT62 NT83\n- etc.\n\nWait, maybe focusing on the path from S to NT61 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is 't2'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't2'. Looking at the rules, some rules have a terminal on the RHS. For example:\n\n- NT10 -> NT96 (But NT96 -> t67)\n- NT33 -> NT32 NT72, etc. Hmm. Wait, let's list out all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT65 -> t32\n- NT72 -> t49\n- NT24 -> t2\n- NT29 -> t62\n- NT48 -> t97\n- NT53 -> t51 (Wait, NT53 is different)\n- NT59 -> t82\n- NT34: Wait, no, wait. Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT48 -> t97\nNT24 -> t2\nSo, NT24 produces 't2'. That must be used for the first token in the string, which is 't2'.\n\nSo, the first part is NT24. Then, since the string is derived from S, which goes to NT24... Wait, let me see. S starts with NT61 and NT59, but the first token is 't2', which comes from NT24. So perhaps we need to see if there's a way to go from S to NT24 somehow. But S's productions are S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. So, starting with S, we'd have to choose one of these. The first token is 't2', which is from NT24. So let's see if we can match S -> NT29 NT9; because NT29 is involved in producing 't2'?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT29 -> NT14 NT86 (From the rules)\nNT14 -> NT2 NT66 (Since NT29 rule is transformed earlier)\nBut looking at the given rules:\n\nLooking for NT14, the production is `NT14 -> nt2 nt66` (but in the given rules, I see `NT29 -> NT14 NT86`, then NT14 -> NT2 NT66`).\n\nSo, the string starts with 't2', which is from NT24. So S is broken into parts, but how?\n\nWait, the initial productions for S are either NT61 and NT59, or NT29 and NT9. So, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT9, but then, we can produce 't2' from NT24. Let me see how NT29 and NT9 are produced.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Another approach is to reconstruct the parse tree, starting with the string and applying the production rules backwards, trying to split the string into parts that fit the productions.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's a list of tokens separated by spaces, but for context-free grammars, each production is a step where the non-terminal produces two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. Wait, but in our case, all the productions are of the form where the RHS are two non-terminals. However, some rules produce a terminal and a non-terminal. For example:\n\n- NT24 -> t2\n- NT29 -> t2 t87 (since in the rules, NT29->t87).\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is 't2'. Looking back, NT24 produces 't2', so perhaps the initial unit is NT24.\n\nIf the string starts with 't2', that is, NT24, then the next thing is to see how to parse the rest. Wait, but S-> NT29 NT9. So maybe S's production is not the one starting with 't2', because S directly produces NT29 and NT9 as separate non-terminals, which don't produce any terminals directly, except perhaps further down.\n\nWait, maybe that approach isn't correct. Another way is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to determine the first few steps.\n\nThe string starts with t2, t94, t99, t25, t46, t94, t37, t19, t74, t60, etc.\n\nFirst, 't2' is the first symbol, which could come from NT24. So the first part is NT24.\n\nThen, the next token is 't94', which is the RHS of NT59. So perhaps, after NT24, the production is NT24 \u2192 t2 and then the next part is t94, which comes from NT59. But we need to see how NT24 is part of a production.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to model the parsing as a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built up by deriving from S.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals can be split. Let me take NT61: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.\n\nFrom the rules, NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65, etc. I think this is getting too involved, but perhaps I can look for matches.\n\nWait, the initial token is 't2' which is produced by NT24. So, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT29 NT9, but wait, can NT29 and NT9 contribute to the string starting with 't2'?

Looking at the rules, 't94' comes from NT59 \u2192 t94.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 nt9. But wait, NT29 is one of the first parts, and then what? NT29 produces NT24 (which is 't2') followed by NT86 \u2192 t94. So, perhaps the first two tokens are 't2' and 't94', which are the result of S \u2192 NT29 NT9, but then NT29 is split into NT24 and NT86, which produce 't2' and 't94'.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar consists of a set of production rules. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically means that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it mostly follows that structure, with most rules producing two non-terminals, except a few where terminals appear. For example, `NT68 -> 't83'` suggests that some non-terminals directly produce terminal characters.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which has two productions:\n1. S -> NT61 NT59\n2. S -> NT29 NT9\n\nSo S can expand into either of these. I'll need to see which path can lead to the given string. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's see what NT61 and NT59 produce. Looking at the rules:\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT55\n- NT59 -> NT9\n\nWait, but NT9 has a production NT9 -> NT10 NT17, and NT17 can produce either NT46 or NT59. This seems like it could go on indefinitely unless there's a termination. Additionally, NT9 also has a production to 't18'. Hmm, but in the given string, we have a 't28' which might be from NT68, for example.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar has several terminals directly. For instance, NT68 -> 't83', NT60 -> 't49', etc. So maybe the string is built up by expanding through these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first word is 't28'. Let's check which non-terminal can produce 't28'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT68 -> 't83', which is 't83'. Hmm, maybe I need to see if there's a production that directly leads to 't28' or whether it's part of a chain.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for 't28' in the production rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT33 -> 't32' and NT81 -> 't94'. Hmm, not 't28'. Maybe indirectly through combining non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the expansion for some non-terminals includes 't28' as part of their derivation.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT28 -> 't63', which is a terminal. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT28 -> 't63', but the string includes 't28', so perhaps I'm mixing up the non-terminals and terminals. Wait, no\u2014the string is in lowercase letters prefixed with 't', so those are terminals. So the grammar must produce these 't' sequences.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar, for example, NT68 -> 't83' and NT60 -> 't49', etc. So perhaps some combination of non-terminals leads to the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree for the string.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can simulate the possible expansions.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. S can be NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't28 t35 t79 t49 t60 t2 ...', so perhaps the path through S -> NT61 NT59 is needed. Let me see what NT61 and NT59 produce.\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\nNT59 -> NT9\n\nNow, NT59 -> NT9, and NT9 -> NT10 NT17. Let's track this: NT9->NT10 NT17. NT10->NT68, which produces 't95' as per NT68->'t95'. Hmm, but the string starts with 't28', which is different from 't95'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let me look for other paths.\n\nAlternatively, S could expand into NT29 NT9. So let's check NT29:\n\nNT29 -> NT14 NT86\n\nNT14 -> NT2 NT65 (from NT14 -> NT2 NT65)\nNT65 has multiple productions, one of which is NT65->NT71 NT65. Hmm, this can go on. Alternatively, NT65 could produce 't36' via NT65->'t65', but I don't see that. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT65 in the rules:\nNT65 -> NT71 NT65\nNT65 -> NT10 NT96\nNT65 -> 't42' -> wait, looking back, yes, NT66->'t42' is not it. Wait, let me check all rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\nNT65 -> NT71 NT65 (this seems repetitive, might be a left recursion, but I'm not sure)\nNT65 -> NT10 NT96\nNT65 -> 't36' when? Wait, no, looking through all the rules:\n\nWait, for NT65, I don't see any direct terminal production except when looking at NT66: NT66->'t42' etc. Wait, so NT65 might not produce terminals directly. So NT14->NT2 NT65 could lead to a chain of NT2 and NT65.\n\nNT2 could lead to NT52 NT86 (from NT2->NT52 NT86). NT52->NT93 NT73, and so on. This seems complex, and I'm not sure if it would lead to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the other path of S->NT29 NT9.\n\nNT29->NT14 NT86.\nNT14->NT2 NT65. Let's expand NT2: NT2->NT52 NT86.\n\nLooking at NT52->NT93 NT73, and NT93->'t72'. Hmm, the first 't72' in the string is the third word. So let me see:\n\nIf we take S->NT29 NT9, then NT29->NT14 NT86. Then NT14->NT2 NT65. Let's expand NT2 as NT52 NT86.\n\nThen NT52->NT93 NT73.\n\nNow, NT93 has two productions: NT93->'t72' and NT93->NT62 NT83.\n\nThe string starts with 't28', which doesn't match 't72' or 't62'. Wait, but perhaps in the expansion, NT93 could produce 't72' and then another path.\n\nWait, but the first word is 't28'. So this seems like a dead end because the first part of the string starts with 't28', which is not covered by this path.\n\nSo perhaps the correct path is through the other option of S->NT61 NT59.\n\nLet's try that: S->NT61 NT59.\n\nNT61->NT33 NT55.\n\nNT59->NT9. And NT9->NT10 NT17.\n\nSo we have NT61->NT33 NT55, which then NT55 could be a terminal? Let's see what NT55 produces. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT55 directly producing a terminal. Let's check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT55, I don't see any NT55->a, so it must produce non-terminals. So NT55-> ... maybe nt55-> something else.\n\nWait, looking through the rules for NT55: I see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I think NT55 is used in some productions.\n\nWait, in NT60's production, there's NT60->'t49'. Also, looking at NT55, I don't see a direct terminal, but perhaps it's part of a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be derived through a different path. Maybe the key is to see if the sequence of 't's can be formed via the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the production NT68->'t83', and NT95->'t94"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It mostly consists of non-terminals (like S, NT2, NT4, etc.) that split into other non-terminals, and some of them directly produce terminal symbols, which here seem to be tokens like t13, t37, etc. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which can be rewritten into combinations of other non-terminals leading up to terminals. The goal is to reduce the string to the start symbol by applying the grammar's rules, meaning I should see if the string can be parsed by expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals step by step.\n\nStarting with the string, I notice there are 33 tokens. I need to see if these can be derived from the grammar. Let's split the string into individual terms: t13, t37, t60, t36, t46, t63, t32, t38, t53, t65, t39, t76, t97, t60, t73, t50, t41, t19, t30, t13, t80, t63, t82, t64, t53, t16, t51, t60, t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals terminate in terminals, so whenever I see a two-character 't' followed by a number, that's a terminal. So, each of these represents a terminal symbol.\n\nI need to reconstruct the parse tree starting from S. The start symbol S is defined as NT47 -> NT58 NT95. But in the given grammar, S is rewritten as NT47 NT37, Wait no, looking at the top of the grammar: \n\nS -> NT61 NT59\nS -> NT29 NT9\n\nWait, the user provided a long grammar, but I need to check where S is defined. Let me scan through. The grammar starts with S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. So the start symbol S splits into two non-terminals. So the initial step is to split the string into two parts based on where one of these non-terminals can be applied.\n\nBut wait, the given string starts with t13, which is a terminal. So I need to see which non-terminals produce t13. Looking through the grammar, I see NT23 -> 't3'), NT8->t2), etc. Let me see which non-terminals derive to t13.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT59 -> 't46' which isn't helpful. Wait, maybe NT23: looking through the grammar, I see NT23 -> 't3'), but the user's string starts with t13. Hmm, perhaps I should find which non-terminals produce each terminal in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to break down the string step by step. Let's take the first few tokens and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe first token is t13. Looking through the grammar, which rule produces t13? Scanning, I see NT33 -> 't33'? Wait, no, maybe I'm not looking correctly. Let me list all the production rules that produce terminals because each 't' is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given production rules:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT88 -> 't72'\n- NT14 -> 't2'\n- NT23 -> 't79'\n- NT88 -> 't33'\n- NT2 -> 't64'\n- NT72 -> 't49'\n- NT58 -> 't95'\n- NT46 -> 't79'\n- NT55 -> 't19'\n- NT99 -> 't84' (Wait, no, looking again: No, NT54 -> 't64', NT60 -> 't49', etc. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to map each terminal to their possible non-terminals.\n\nFor example, t38 is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I think NT54->t64, but that's not relevant. Maybe NT58 -> 't95' (no), looking more carefully:\n\nLooking at the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT58 -> 't95' (Wait, no: in the rules, it's NT58 -> 't95'? Or is it NT59->'t46'? Wait, perhaps I should see all the rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT52 -> 't42'\n- NT31 -> 't54'\n- NT78 -> 't53'\n- NT23 -> 't79'\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't97'\n- NT9 -> 't18'\n- NT23 -> 't3'\n- NT93 -> 't72'\n- NT5->'t5'\n- NT47->'t73' (Wait, no: looking more carefully, NT47 -> 't73'? Or is it part of a larger rule?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the rules are presented with -> followed by the production. Some of them are Chomsky normal form (like S-> NT61 NT59 and NT47-> NT58 NT95) and others directly produce terminals. So in the latter case, the left-hand side is a non-terminal that produces a single terminal.\n\nLooking through, the rules that produce terminals (i.e., produce a single terminal symbol) are:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT58 -> 't95'\n- NT19 -> 't9'\n- NT46 -> 't79'\n- NT8->'t2'\n- NT57 -> 't17'\n- NT9 -> 't18'\n- NT59 -> 't46'\n- NT47 -> 't73'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT65 -> 't32'\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT73 -> 't53'\n- NT88 -> 't72'\n- NT23 -> 't3'\n- NT78 -> 't56' (Wait, no: NT78-> 't56 NT5'? Let me see: in the grammar, NT78->'t56 NT5'. So it's two symbols, but actually, the production is NT78 -> 't56' followed by NT5, which is a two-symbol production.\n\nBut for a single terminal, perhaps we can only rely on rules where NT78->'t56' is not a terminal, because it's followed by another non-terminal. So, perhaps only those rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal are:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT19 -> 't9'\n- NT46 -> 't79'\n- NT8->'t2'\n- NT9->'t18'\n- NT57->'t17'\n- NT68->'t83'\n- NT93->'t72'\n- NT78->'t56 NT5' (no)\n- NT23->'t3'\n- NT29->'t62'\n\nLooking back, the NT production leading directly to t13 is perhaps not present in the given rules, because I don't see any rule producing 't13'. So perhaps t13 is produced by a non-terminal that itself is generated by a production that eventually leads to a chain that includes t13.\n\nWait, but that can't be because in the provided grammar, the rules ending with a single terminal don't include 't13'.

Hmm, context-free grammars are tricky, but maybe I can break this down.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because it means the parse trees will be binary, which might make things easier.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: `t96 t48 t25 t38 t33 t50 t96 t96 t97 t42 t28 t62 t12 t5 t50 t54 t13 t3 t67 t94 t64 t36 t28 t54 t80 t96 t54 t41 t87`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let me recall that S can produce NT61 NT59 and S can also produce other non-terminals, but these are in the first productions. Wait, looking at the grammar, actually, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT61 NT59, and then a whole list of other productions starting with NT... and ending with various non-terminals that eventually produce terminals.\n\nSo, the first step is to see what S can produce. From S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then each of NT61 and NT59 must be expanded. Let me check what NT61 and NT59 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT61's productions, the only one given is NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So that means NT61 will eventually be expanded into something else. Let's see where it goes. NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65, and NT18 can go to 't24'? Wait, looking back, I see NT18 \u2192 't66' and NT59 is somewhere else.\n\nWait, wait. Let me map this. The goal is to trace from S down to the terminals in the given string. Since the string starts with t96, I need to see if any of the non-terminals produce 't96'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 't94', and also NT5 \u2192 't5', NT46 \u2192 't40'? Wait, no. Let me check the productions. Oh, right, under NT65: NT65 \u2192 't67' as per the rules. Wait, no, looking at the rules, for example, NT56 \u2192 't51' and NT19 \u2192 't0' and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if t96 can be produced by any non-terminal. Looking at the rules, NT60 \u2192 't94', which is t94, but t96 is mentioned only once as NT62 \u2192 't12' is no, and I don't see any NT in the rules that directly produce t96. Hmm, wait\u2014let me check again. Oh! I see in NT96: NT96 \u2192 't86' but that's not t96. Hmm, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't96' as a terminal. Or wait, did I miss any?\n\nWait, the rules start listing NT5 \u2192 't83' which means the non-terminal NT5 produces 't83'. NT59 is another non-terminal. Looking through the rules, I see NT55 \u2192 't5', which is terminal. NT57 produces 't19'. Wait, perhaps I should look for any NTs that produce 't96'. Let me go through the rules:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't67' (I thought)\n- NT56 \u2192 't51'\n- NT5 \u2192 't83'\n- NT33 \u2192 't32' etc.\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking for where 't96' is produced. Hmm, I don't see any NT directly mapping to t96. Wait, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at NT60: 't49' (from the rule NT60 \u2192 't68'), no. Let's see:\n\nNo, actually, looking through the entire list, the only t's are in this list:\n\nt94\nt83\nt73\nt53\nt48\nt83\nt33\nt38\nt95\nt60\nt74\nt32\nt24\nt28\nt65\nt67\nt40\nt67\nt84\nt19\nt54\nt97\nt62\nt72\nt93\nt41\nt39\nt42\nt97\nt86\nt54\nt25\nt38\nt33\nt50\nt96\nt42\nt28\nt62\nt12\nt5\nt50\nt54\nt80\nt96\nt54\nt87\n\nWait, I might have miscalculated earlier. Let me list all the t's in the given string: t96, t48, t25, t38, t33, t50, t96, t96, t97, t42, t28, t62, t12, t5, t50, t54, t13, t3, t67, t94, t64, t36, t28, t54, t80, t96, t54, t41, t87.\n\nLooking through the list of t's in the rules, I notice that t96 is present twice:\n\n- NT60: 't94'\n- NT96: Do I see any NT96 in the rules? Wait, looking back, the rules start as S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then a series of NT rules.\n\nWait, let's look for any NT that produces t96. Looking through each production:\n\n- NT67: Not seeing t96.\n- NT65: t67\n- NT60: t68\n- NT62: t12\n- NT55: t5\n- NT57: t19\n- NT88: t42\n- NT23: t79 or t13?\n\nWait, looking at NT88: actually, looking back, I see NT88 \u2192 't42', but that's 't42' as a terminal. Wait, do any NTs produce 't96'?\n\nWait, wait. Looking through all the production rules, most of them seem to eventually terminate in 't' symbols, but I'm not seeing any NT that directly goes to t96. Let me check again.\n\nWait a minute, I realize I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me list all NT rules to see:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n\nWait, so NT65 \u2192 itself? That's a problem; it can't go on infinitely. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me step back. The given string starts with t96, so we need to see if the grammar includes any NT that can produce t96.\n\nLooking at the entire rules, I don't see any NT that directly expands into t96, except perhaps I misread one. Wait, I see in the rules:\n\nNT96 \u2192 't86'\n\nWait, so does that mean that NT96 can produce 't86'? Then where is 't96' coming from? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules. Let me check each production to see if any of them are directly producing t96.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59 (but those are non-terminals; S is the start symbol, but in this case, to derive a terminal string, we have to expand all non-terminals until only terminals remain.)\n\nSo let's try to build a derivation.\n\nThe string starts with t96. So, the first step is to have either NT61 or NT59 as the first step.\n\nWait, because S \u2192 NT61 NT59, but in the string, the first token is t96. So to get t96 as the first symbol, perhaps NT61 must expand into 't96 ...'? Or perhaps another NT.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, NT61 expands into NT33 NT55. So that's another non-terminal.

The string is a sequence of symbols, each possibly representing a terminal or non-terminal, and the grammar has a specific structure.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has two main characteristics: every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-581","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string I need to check if it belongs to the language generated by the grammar. \n\nFirst, the grammar looks like it's structured with non-terminals (NT) and terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). The start symbol is S, and the productions are all broken down into either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal in the case where the terminal is a terminal symbol like 't'.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t12 t76 t25 t63 t63 t80 t95 t62 t64 t49 t66 t32 t36 t38 t50 t25 t48 t99 t18 t97 t5 t28 t67 t35 t18 t5 t18 t80 t62 t97`.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse this string using the grammar and see if it can be derived step by step. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nI notice that the grammar is extensive, so perhaps focusing on the string's structure can help. The string starts with 't12', which corresponds to the production NT68 \u2192 't12'. So, the first symbol in the string comes from NT68. \n\nNext, looking at the second symbol, 't76'. I need to find which non-terminal produces 't76'. Scanning the productions, I see that NT76 is not directly present, but perhaps it's derived from another non-terminal. Wait, the productions don't have NT76. Hmm, maybe I should check all entries.\n\nLooking at the production list, there's NT76? Let me check. Wait, no, looking through the productions, I don't see any NT76. Oh, but maybe it's derived from another NT. For example, NT76 is probably produced by a sequence that results in 't76', but I don't see a direct production. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me look through the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, let me see. The productions that end with specific terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n- NT89 \u2192 't95'\n- NT33 \u2192 't72'\n- NT68 \u2192 't12'\n- NT76 \u2192 't63' (Wait, no, NT76 isn't directly present. The productions end with 't25' (NT25?), 't63' (maybe NT63? Or not. Wait, let me go line by line.\n\nWait, sorry, I need to be more precise. Let me look at the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't76', I don't see a directly producing rule. So, perhaps it's part of a larger production. But in Chomsky N.F., the only way to have terminals is directly via the productions where A \u2192 a.\n\nSo, if 't76' is present in the string, it must be derived directly by some NT \u2192 't76'. Looking through the list, I don't see any NT that directly goes to 't76'. Wait, let me double-check:\n\n- NT76 isn't listed, nor is any other NT producing 't76'. So, perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. The second symbol is 't76', and if there's no production that produces 't76', then the string can't be derived. So, does that mean the answer is 'No'?\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each symbol in the string to see if they all correspond to productions.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, 't12' comes from NT68 \u2192 't12'. Check.\n\nSecond symbol, 't76'\u2014no production for that, so this would be a problem. Unless I'm misunderstanding how the grammar works.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check each non-terminal's production and see which of them can generate the string step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I should attempt leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' must correspond to a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar. But with the current understanding, since the first symbol 't12' is from NT68, which is allowed. The second symbol is 't76'\u2014but looking at the productions for NT in the grammar, I don't see an NT that produces 't76'. That would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar because the second symbol has no corresponding production.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a production. Let me go through all the productions again carefully.\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal produces 't76':\n\nLooking through the entire list:\n\n- 't76' is mentioned here: The fourth production from the top is 't63'. Wait, looking at the list: There's 'NT63: t63'? Or is it another NT?\n\nWait, looking at the list again:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1. S -> NT61 NT59\n2. S -> NT29 NT9\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-601","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. Wait, no, actually, context-free grammars have the left-hand side as a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side as any combination of terminals and non-terminals. Chomsky Normal Form is a specific CNF where each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, let me check some of the rules to make sure I'm understanding.\n\nFor example, the start symbol is S, which has two productions: S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. Each of these productions has two non-terminals, so that fits into Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nThen, there are a bunch of other productions, like NT47 -> NT58 NT95, which is two non-terminals on the right, also fitting CNF. Some of the non-terminals have rules ending with a terminal, like NT2 -> NT52 NT86. Wait, no, NT2 is on the left as a non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals, so that's correct for CNF.\n\nSome productions have terminals on the right side, like NT68 -> 't12'. So these are terminal symbols, and they'll appear in the derivation as leaves.\n\nThe string to evaluate is long, but I can see that it consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't38', 't35', etc. So the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nMy goal is to determine if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I need to see if there's a derivation in the grammar that results in that string.\n\nOne approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse context-free grammars. But since the grammar is given in CNF, the CYK algorithm can be applied more efficiently. However, I might not remember all the details of the CYK algorithm, but I can try a more manual approach.\n\nFirst, I can note the structure of the grammar. It seems like many non-terminals have productions that lead to terminals. For example, some NT rules directly result in 't' followed by a number. Others combine non-terminals until they reach a terminal.\n\nBut I'm given a string, so perhaps it's better to see if each 't' in the string can be matched by some production, working backwards from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as building a parse tree. Starting from the root, the start symbol S, and seeing if I can build the string by expanding non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals that eventually produce the string.\n\nWait, the string is quite long, so maybe I can look for certain patterns. For example, the string starts with 't38 t35 t35 t33 t9 t63...'. Let me see what rules produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT68 -> 't12'\n- NT60 -> 't94'\n- NT9 -> 't18'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT47 -> 't73'\n- NT88 -> 't42'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT52 -> 't42'\n- NT31 -> 't54'\n- NT72 -> 't30'\n- NT58 -> 't95'\n- NT46 -> 't79'\n- NT83 -> 't66'\n- NT23 -> 't79'\n- NT29 -> 't87'\n- NT8 -> 't25'\n- NT26 -> 't42'\n- NT59 -> 't46'\n- NT9 -> 't18'\n- NT24 -> 't2'\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n- NT48 -> 't97'\n- NT96 -> 't67'\n- NT19 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't39'\n- NT19 -> 't9'\n- NT72 -> 't49'\n- NT56 -> 't87'\n- NT66 -> 't95'\n- NT55 -> 't5'\n- NT59 -> 't35'\n- NT33 -> 't32'\n- NT81 -> 't94'\n- NT88 -> 't76'\n- NT96 -> 't86'\n- NT33 -> 't82'\n- NT71 -> 't50'\n- NT61 -> 't36'\n- NT56 -> 't9'\n- NT68 -> 't16'\n\nHmm, this is a lot. I need a systematic way to check each part of the string. Maybe the CYK algorithm's table approach would work here, but since I can't do all the steps manually, perhaps I can find a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to build the string step by step, starting from the left. For example, starting with the first symbol 't38', which comes from NT68. So I need to see how NT68 can produce 't38' and maybe other symbols.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT68 -> 't12'. Wait, no, that's not 't38'. Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see 'NT68 -> 't12'' and 'NT60 -> 't94'' and 'NT5 -> 't5''. But the string starts with 't38'. Looking through the grammar, do any NT rules produce 't38'?\n\nWait, scanning through all the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> NT52 NT86\n- NT79 -> NT36 NT52\n- NT67 -> NT57 NT14\n- NT67 -> NT29 NT87\n- NT78 -> NT56 NT5\n- NT77 -> NT79 NT6\n- NT62 -> NT12\n- And others. Wait, but do any NT rules produce 't38'?\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any NT having a rule that directly produces 't38'. Wait, that's a problem because if none of the NT rules can produce 't38', then the string is invalid, right? So if 't38' is part of the string, and there's no NT rule that directly expands to 't38', then this string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let's check the entire list of NT rules to see if any produce 't38'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT68: 't12', NT60: 't94', NT2: no terminal, NT79: no terminal, NT67: no terminal, NT62: no terminal, NT12? No, wait, looking back, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, the grammar is provided, and one of the NT62 -> NT12. But in the terminals, is there any rule that produces 't38'?

Wait, no, NT79's rule is NT79->NT36 NT52. Do NT36 or NT52 have terminal rules? Looking at NT36: NT36->NT62 NT23 (no), and NT23->'t79'.

{"custom_id":"request-616","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The CFG is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols ending with 't16'. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that every production rule is either:\n1. A non-terminal symbol A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals.\n2. A non-terminal symbol A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, many of the rules are in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59 is a two-symbol production, which fits the first form. However, I notice some rules might have more than two symbols on the right side, but upon closer inspection, most seem to be in CNF. Wait, actually, looking back, all rules appear to have two symbols or a terminal, so it's okay.\n\nNext, the string given is a series of 't' followed by numbers, ending with 't16'. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the CFG is in CNF, each production rule reduces two symbols at a time. This suggests that the string can be parsed in a way where each 'tX' must correspond to a terminal symbol in one of the right-hand sides of the rules.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The string is: t36 t41 t60 t82 t53 t82 t96 t39 t62 t28 t82 t42 t53 t74 t95 t3 t48 t94 t32 t72 t42 t97 t16 t83 t54 t12 t16 t54 t97 t25 t87 t66.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 37 'tX' symbols, which is quite long. Since each production rule in CNF can only produce two terminals or non-terminals, the parse tree would have a specific structure where each production is applied step by step.\n\nBut maybe I should look for patterns or specific rules that produce certain terminals. For instance, the string starts with t36, so I need to see if there's a rule that produces t36. Looking at the rules, I see NT33 \u2192 t32, and other terminals seem to be the only immediate terminals. Wait, but I need to see if 't36' is a terminal or if it's derived from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, some symbols like NT61, NT47, etc., are non-terminals. The strings like 't12', 't94', etc., are terminals. So, the left-hand sides are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThis means that each production can only produce a terminal after a series of steps, and the entire string must be built from the S symbol. However, in the given string, it's entirely composed of terminals, so each of these must be generated by rules that eventually reduce to terminals.\n\nWait, but if the entire string is in terminals, the parse tree must generate exactly that string by expanding each non-terminal step by step until all symbols are terminals. So, the grammar should be applied such that every non-terminal is replaced step by step, leading to the target string.\n\nBut considering the length, 37 symbols, and the fact that the grammar may have productions that generate specific terminals, perhaps it's possible. However, manually tracing this could be time-consuming, so maybe I can look for specific patterns or check if the string can be broken down into parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a CFG in CNF, the number of symbols in the string must be a power of 2 minus 1, but that applies when we're only counting the number of steps in a parse tree where each split increases the number. However, in this case, the string is length 37, which isn't of the form 2^n -1, so this might not apply. Hmm, maybe that rule applies when we're counting the possible derivation length, not the actual number of symbols in the string.\n\nWait, no, actually, each step in the derivation of a string with CNF grammar would have the number of symbols increasing by one each time a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols (either both non-terminals or one terminal and a non-terminal). Wait, no, in CNF, a non-terminal can produce two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. So, the number of symbols can increase or decrease. This makes it complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be built by starting from S and expanding it step by step. Let's try to see what S can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo, S can be expanded into two non-terminals. Let's pick the first one: S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nNow, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, according to the rule NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 (from earlier, seems like there are multiple rules for NT61, but in the given list, it's written as NT61 -> NT33 NT55. Wait, no: wait, the first NT61 rule is NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Another rule is NT67 \u2192 NT67, but that's a self-production, which doesn't make sense unless it's used in a different context, perhaps as a way to have a loop.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, I see:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\nNT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\nNT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\nNT68 \u2192 NT93 NT88\nNT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83\nNT55 \u2192 NT19 NT2\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\nNT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\nNT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5\nNT55 \u2192 NT58 NT86\nNT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23\nNT66 \u2192 NT95\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT28\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me try to reconstruct the possible steps.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and NT59 \u2192 NT58 NT53, but wait, I need to check the exact rules.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules, and I can refer to them. Let me note down which rules produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, any rule where the right-hand side includes a 'tX' would produce a terminal. For example, NT62 \u2192 t12, NT68 \u2192 t83, etc. So, I can see that certain non-terminals when expanded produce terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with t36, so perhaps t36 is generated by a production rule. Let me look for any rule that produces t36. Scanning the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the given rules, I spot:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\nNT74 \u2192 NT? Wait, actually, looking through the list, the rule NT74 doesn't seem to be provided. Wait, let me check again. The user provided a list of rules, and after that, there's a list of symbols, but perhaps the rules are all in the first block, and the later part is the string.\n\nWait, the initial part is the grammar, then after that, the string. So, the rules end after NT95 \u2192 't94', etc. So, looking through the rules, I can see which ones produce terminals. So, for example:\n\nNT62 \u2192 t12\nNT68 \u2192 t83\nNT69 maybe? Wait, no, the rules provided only include specific production rules, and I need to check which ones produce terminals.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of rules, but all seem to be of the form NT# \u2192 something. The ones where the right-hand side include 't' are:\n\nLooking at the rules provided, I can see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 t12\nNT93 \u2192 t72\nNT95 \u2192 t94\nNT47 \u2192 t73\nNT88 \u2192 t42\nNT18 \u2192 t66\nNT54 \u2192 t64\nNT55 \u2192 t19\nNT59 \u2192 t35\nNT22 \u2192 t67 (No, wait, NT22 is derived from where? Looking back, no, NT22 isn't in the rules. Wait, no, looking through the user's input, perhaps I missed some rules.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT19 \u2192 t9\nNT24 \u2192 t2\nAnd so on.

{"custom_id":"request-619","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since it's in CNF, it might be easier to analyze using a parsing strategy or perhaps converting it to a pushdown automaton (PDA). But given that, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. It starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so the start symbol S generates two non-terminals, NT61 and NT59. Each of these non-terminals have their own productions. The grammar seems a bit complex with many productions, so maybe I can build a parse tree for the given string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t63 t54 t54 t94 t66 t51 t86 t49 t51 t0 t2 t38 t42 t72 t33 t46 t39 t32 t19 t66 t9 t82 t67 t54 t62 t9 t32 t36 t50 t65 t74 t87`.\n\nEach word in the string is a terminal symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the parse tree should have a structure where each internal node (non-terminal) has exactly two children (subterms), except for the terminals which are leaves.\n\nLet me think about how many nodes there should be. Since the string has 35 symbols, the parse tree should have 35 leaves. The number of internal nodes in a binary tree with 35 leaves is 34. Wait, that's a lot. I might need to find a way to structure this without getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using dynamic programming to check if the string can be parsed by this grammar. That might be tedious by hand, but maybe I can find patterns or look for any obvious reductions.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice some tokens like 't63', 't54' appearing multiple times. Let's see which non-terminals produce these tokens. For example, looking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT77 \u2192 't79' (though NT77 can also produce other things)\n- NT73 \u2192 't53'\n- NT22 \u2192 't67'\n- NT72 \u2192 't49'\n- NT88 \u2192 't72'\n- NT19 \u2192 't0' and 't9'\n- NT59 \u2192 't46'\n\nWait, looking for 't63', let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that produces 't63' directly. So, perhaps 't63' is part of a larger production that eventually produces terminals. Let me check the grammar to see which non-terminals can lead to 't63'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT72 \u2192 't49', NT27 \u2192 't7', NT28 \u2192 't63'. Oh, yes, NT28 is a non-terminal, and NT28 \u2192 't63', so 't63' is the terminal for NT28.\n\nNow, where in the grammar does NT28 appear? Checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT28 isn't directly produced by any other non-terminal, except maybe through other rules. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT28 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. No, actually, no, the grammar has rules where non-terminals produce other non-terminals, and some produce terminals. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't63'\n\nBut also, checking other rules, I don't see NT28 being produced by any other non-terminal. So, that suggests that NT28 is a terminal, but that's not possible because in context-free grammars, terminals are only produced directly, not via other non-terminals.\n\nWait a second, this is confusing. If NT28 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't63', that means 't63' is a terminal symbol. But in the grammar, some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, and some produce terminals. So in this case, NT28 is a non-terminal with a production NT28 \u2192 't63', making 't63' a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking at other terminals in the string, like 't54': is there a non-terminal that produces 't54'? Let's check the rules:\n\nYes, looking through the rules, NT54 is present:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't64'\n\nWait, no, I'm looking for NT54 as a terminal. Wait, no, let me check again. The rules provided:\n\nLooking through each line, I see several NT rules where they produce terminals or other non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't2'\n- NT2 \u2192 't64'\n- NT33 \u2192 't32'\n- Wait, the list is long, let me look for 't54' in the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't5'\n- NT54 \u2192 't64' I think not. Wait, let me go through the rules systematically.\n\nWait, the grammar is provided in lines, each line represents a production.

{"custom_id":"request-634","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of several production rules, all of which are in CNF, meaning each production has exactly two non terminals on the right-hand side, except for the starting symbol which can produce two terminals. However, looking closer, some productions have terminals on both sides, like S -> NT61 NT65 or similar. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions must be of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal. So I think some of these productions might actually have two terminals, which would make the grammar not strictly in CNF. But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some have two terminals, like S -> NT61 NT65. Wait, no, NT61 and NT65 are non-terminals, but if any of these have two terminals, that's a problem. For example, S is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals, but the other rules like S -> NT29 NT9 also have non-terminals. So perhaps the starting symbol S is the only one that produces non-terminals, and then the other non-terminals eventually produce terminals.\n\nBut then, when looking at the string, I see that several parts have 't' followed by numbers, which are probably terminals. So for example, 't46' is a terminal, as are 't80', 't30', etc.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t46 t80 t79 t30 t72 t83 t25 t54 t42 t79 t42 t2 t36 t50 t18 t63 t37 t33 t38 t41 t25 t12 t80 t16 t51 t76 t80 t32 t60 t48 t53 t5 t62`.\n\nHmm, that's 33 tokens. I'll need to check if each terminal is generated by the grammar.\n\nNow, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So I need to see how each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar. That means each 't' must be a production of a non-terminal that eventually leads to a single terminal.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT14 -> t48\n- NT18 -> t63\n- NT19 -> t9\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT3 -> t74\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT24 -> t2\n- NT29 -> t62\n- NT48 -> t97\n- NT5 -> t58 (Wait, no, checking again... Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, many of them have 't' followed by a number, meaning the non-terminal on the left produces that terminal. For example:\n\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT14 -> t48\n- NT18 -> t63\n- NT19 -> t9\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT3 -> t74\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT24 -> t2\n- NT29 -> t62\n- NT48 -> t97\n- NT5 -> t58\nWait, I think I'm mixing up. Let me note all the 't' productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT14 -> t48\n- NT18 -> t63\n- NT19 -> t9\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT3 -> t74\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT24 -> t2\n- NT29 -> t62\n- NT48 -> t97\n- NT5 -> t58\n- NT5 -> t5\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me go through the list methodically.\n\nLooking through all the rules, each production is either of the form NTXYZ -> tAB or NTXYZ -> NTWV NTXYZ, etc. So the 't' productions are as follows:\n\nNT6 -> t74\n\nNT8 -> t2\n\nNT14 -> t48\n\nNT18 -> t63\n\nNT19 -> t9\n\nNT2 -> t64\n\nNT3 -> t74\n\nLooking further, I see:\n\nNT5 -> t58 (Wait, NT5 -> t58?)\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT14 -> t48\n- NT18 -> t63\n- NT19 -> t9\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT3 -> t74\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT24 -> t2\n- NT29 -> t62\n- NT48 -> t97\n- NT5 -> t58\n- NT55 -> t5\n- NT59 -> t46\n- NT61 -> t36\n- NT65 -> t99\n- NT67 -> t32\n- NT68 -> t83\n- NT7 -> t83\n- NT77 -> t79\n- NT78 -> t56\n- NT79 -> t36\n- NT83 -> t41\n- NT88 -> t72\n- NT96 -> t67\n- NT5 -> t58\n- NT5 -> t5 (Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me check.)\n\nWait, in the rules, NT5 appears multiple times with different productions:\n\nNT5 -> t58\n\nNT5 -> t5\n\nWait, that's a problem. A non-terminal NT5 can't produce two different terminals unless it's allowed in the grammar. But in CNF, a non-terminal can only produce one terminal or two non-terminals. So if NT5 produces both 't5' and 't58', that's okay because it can be used in different contexts to generate different terminals.\n\nBut for the given string, let's see which terminals are present:\n\nThe string has: t46, t80, t79, t30, t72, t83, t25, t54, t42, t79, t42, t2, t36, t50, t18, t63, t37, t33, t38, t41, t25, t12, t80, t16, t51, t76, t80, t32, t60, t48, t53, t5, t62.\n\nLooking for these in the grammar's 't' productions:\n\nt5: Yes, NT5 -> t5.\n\nt2: Yes, NT8 -> t2 and NT24 -> t2.\n\nt25: I don't see a terminal rule for t25. Let me check the rules for NT25. Actually, looking through the rules, there's no entry for NT25. So if the string has t25, that would mean NT25 must produce t25. But in the grammar, there's no rule for NT25 \u2192 t25, so that's a problem. So the string has t25, which would require NT25 to produce it. But in the grammar, NT25 isn't present as a terminal. Let's check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production like NT25 -> tXX. So if the string contains 't25', it's not possible unless there's such a production, which there isn't. Therefore, this could mean that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed it. Scanning through the rules:\n\nNT25 -> t54.\n\nWait, no, the rule is NT32 -> NT18 t65? No, let's see: Looking for any rule that has a terminal like t25.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any rule that starts with NT25 and produces a terminal. So yes, 't25' is not in the grammar's terminal productions, which would make it impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nTherefore, the presence of 't25' in the string indicates that the string is not generated"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-633","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are pretty long, so I need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, let me recall what context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) look like. They typically have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Oh, wait, no\u2014it's more precise to say that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, the exact form can vary depending on how it's defined. Some sources say that CNF can also include three-terminals on the RHS, but I think the standard CNF doesn't allow that. Wait, no, actually, Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so only two symbols on the RHS, either terminals or non-terminals. So, that's a crucial point.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the production rules do have two symbols on the RHS, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and a terminal, except for some that have more. For example, there are rules like NT15 \u2192 NT71 NT47, which is fine. But I notice that some have three symbols, like NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7 NT65, which would be a problem because it's supposed to be in CNF. Wait, but the user mentioned that the grammar is in CNF, so maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, the production NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7 NT65 has three non-terminals on the RHS. That would mean the grammar isn't in CNF, but the user said it is. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's allowed to have two non-terminals, but in this case, it has three. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, but maybe the user intends it to still be in CNF. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for more than two symbols, though that's not standard for CNF. So this might cause issues in parsing.\n\nWait, but let me proceed. The given string is a sequence of symbols, some of which are 't' followed by numbers, and some are NT symbols. For example, the string is: `t95 t37 t5 t80 t5 t0 t73 t3 t65 t13 t36 t99 t87 t79 t49 t0 t33 t33 t38 t80 t95 t13 t39 t51 t82 t87 t96 t42 t83 t95 t60 t30 t12`.\n\nEach of these symbols is either a terminal like 't95' or an NT symbol like 'S', 'NT47', etc.\n\nFirst, I need to parse this string into its components and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S according to the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation only replaces one non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal). So, the string must be derived such that each symbol in the string is the result of such replacements.\n\nBut wait, how exactly does this work? The string is a sequence of terminals, which are the leaf nodes in the parse tree. Each non-terminal in the production represents a node that can be expanded further.\n\nGiven that, I can attempt to construct a parse tree for the given string, checking at each step if the productions match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to walk through the string and see if it can be matched step by step from the start symbol.\n\nLet's see: The string starts with t95. Looking at the grammar, I need to find if any production has t95 as the RHS. Scanning through the productions, I see for example that NT5 \u2192 't83' and NT83 \u2192 't94', but I'm looking for t95. Hmm, looking at the productions, I see that NT62 \u2192 't12' and NT20 \u2192 't37' among others. Wait, let's look for terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals are things like 't95', 't37', etc. So, I need to check each terminal in the string and see if it appears in any production.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: t95. Looking through the grammar, is there any production where the RHS starts with t95? For example, in the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't64'\n- NT7 \u2192 't74'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT47 \u2192 't73'\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal productions. Let me go through the productions:\n\nLooking at each production where RHS is a terminal:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't64'\n- NT31 \u2192 't54'\n- NT58 \u2192 't95'\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n- NT64 \u2192 't65'\n- NT73 \u2192 't53'\n- NT5 \u2192 't83'\n- NT88 \u2192 't72'\n- NT91 \u2192 't8' (Oops, wait, I don't see NT91, but looking further, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't83'\n- NT56 \u2192 't51'\n- NT95 \u2192 't94'\n- NT46 \u2192 't60'\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT88 \u2192 't72'\n- NT73 \u2192 't53'\n- NT87 \u2192 't48'\n- NT68 \u2192 't83'\n- NT14 \u2192 't48'\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT20 \u2192 't37'\n- NT24 \u2192 't2'\n- NT29 \u2192 't62'\n- NT36 \u2192 't99'\n- NT48 \u2192 't97'\n- NT55 \u2192 't19'\n- NT59 \u2192 't46'\n- NT65 \u2192 't6' (Wait, looking at the productions, NT65 has multiple rules. Let me scan each NT rule:\n\nLooking at NT65, I see:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n- NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96\n- NT65 \u2192 NT68 NT59\n- NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96 (again)\n- Maybe others. Wait, let me check the full list:\n\n- NT65 -> NT71 NT65\n- NT65 -> NT10 NT96\n- NT65 -> NT68 NT59\n- NT65 -> NT57 NT14\n- Wait, no, checking the full list again: the user provided a list of productions which includes:\n\nNT65 -> NT71 NT65\nNT65 -> NT10 NT96\nNT65 -> NT68 NT59\nNT65 -> NT57 NT14\nOther NT65 rules? It looks like that's all for NT65, so no direct terminal production.\n\nSimilarly, NT29 -> 't62' according to the productions:\n\nYes, looking at the list:\n\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n\nSo, t62 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, let's note other terminals:\n\nLooking through all productions, the terminals are:\n\nt95 \u2192 appears in NT5 \u2192 't83', NT47 \u2192 't73', etc. Wait, actually, 't95' appears in NT62 \u2192 't12' and NT13? Wait, no, looking through all the productions, I see NT95 is a production, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the user provided each production as \"S -> ...\" etc., and each RHS can be terminals or other NT symbols. The user also provided a list after the grammar with lines like \"NT65 -> 't67'\", etc. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string and see where the terminals are and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, each non-terminal in the grammar must expand into exactly two symbols, either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals.\n\nWait, but wait no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, each RHS must be exactly two symbols, each being either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at some of the productions, like NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7 NT65.

So NT61 can produce either a terminal 't16' or proceed further.\n\nSimilarly, NT59: from the production, NT59 \u2192 NT48 NT59, which is recursive, or goes to 't46'. Wait, let me check: NT59's production is NT59 \u2192 NT48 NT59 and \u2192 't46'. So it's a recursive production where it could produce a chain of NT48 and NT59 until it hits 't46'.\n\nWait, no. The production is S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so NT59 can only directly go to 't46' because looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the grammar is complex. Wait, the production for NT5 is \u2192 NT61 NT84, but that's a different NT5. Hmm, it's getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t32 t72 t96 t99 t16 t19 t62 t49 t66 t63 t94 t80 t53 t54 t62 t76 t19 t5 t74 t48 t53 t63 t32 t28 t5 t72 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with a set of production rules that start from the start symbol S and expand into other symbols, until we reach the terminal symbols (like 't12', 't94', etc.). The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: `t18 t36 t12 t83 t0 t2 t97 t2 t5 t5 t99 t5 t48 t13 t48 t33 t51 t42 t49 t73 t35 t54 t83 t18 t0 t95 t42 t46 t51 t53 t12 t39 t38 t96`.\n\nI remember that the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules that only go from non-terminals (lowercase letters) to two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can be followed by a terminal. Wait, in this grammar, I notice that most rules are from a non-terminal to two non-terminals, but some have terminal symbols on the right. For example, `NT68 -> 't83'` is a rule where NT68 is a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal.\n\nSo, the grammar allows for both non-terminal to non-terminal and non-terminal to terminal productions, which is typical for CNF, as long as the right-hand side is at most two non-terminals.\n\nThe key question is: can we trace the derivations starting from S, expanding non-terminals until we get all terminals in the string.\n\nLet me look at the string. It starts with t18, then t36, t12, t83, t0. So the first six symbols are t18, t36, t12, t83, t0, which should come from S's production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the two productions for S are:\n1. S -> NT61 NT59\n2. S -> NT29 NT9\n\nI need to see which one could lead to t18 being first. Let's check which non-terminals can produce 't18'. Looking at the rules, 't18' is generated by NT24 -> 't18' and also by NT48 -> 't18', NT29 -> 't62', etc. Wait, wait. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, 't18' is found in:\n- NT48 -> 't18'\n- NT24 -> 't18'\n\nHmm. So either NT48 or NT24 can produce 't18'. Which one is relevant here?\n\nWait, in the first few tokens, the string starts with t18, which would come from either NT24 or NT48. Let me check how S can lead to NT24 or NT48.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S can go to NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9. So starting with NT29 or NT61, etc.\n\nNT29 -> NT14 NT86. Hmm, but if the first symbol is t18, which comes from NT24 or NT48, I need to see if S can produce NT24 or NT48 through some chain of rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Instead of tracing from S upwards, maybe I should break down the string step by step, seeing if each pair of terminals can be matched by a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step, applying the productions to see if it can be reduced to S. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, we can try to find the leftmost derivation.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, which is 35 symbols, this might take a lot of steps. Alternatively, I can try to see if there's a way to represent the string as a sequence of productions without having to parse each symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can track back from the first symbols to see if they can be generated from some non-terminals.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the string:\n\nThe string is:\nt18, t36, t12, t83, t0, t2, t97, t2, t5, t5, t99, t5, t48, t13, t48, t33, t51, t42, t49, t73, t35, t54, t83, t18, t0, t95, t42, t46, t51, t53, t12, t39, t38, t96.\n\nWait, that's a lot to handle. Let's take the initial part and see if we can find derivations.\n\nThe first symbol is t18. From the grammar, t18 is generated by NT24 or NT48.\n\nLooking again at the rules:\n\nNT24 -> 't2' (from NT24 -> 't2'), but wait no, wait. Looking at the grammar, the rules include:\n\n- NT24 -> 't18'\nYes, because in the list, NT24: `NT24 -> 't18'`\n\nSo t18 comes from NT24.\n\nNow, how is NT24 derived? It depends on the production rule for NT24. Looking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT24 except the terminal 't18', which means NT24 is a terminal symbol. So NT24 must be replaced by 't18'.\n\nWait, but in CNF, the non-terminals can only produce other non-terminals or terminals. So if a non-terminal NT24 only has a rule that produces a terminal, then during the derivation, NT24 would directly become 't18'.\n\nSo that suggests that in the initial steps, the first symbol t18 is produced by NT24, which is a non-terminal in the grammar. So S would need to produce NT24 as one of its two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS can go to NT29 NT59 or NT61 NT59. So to generate t18 as the first symbol, S must first split into NT24 and something else, but none of the productions from S directly go to NT24. Therefore, perhaps the S production that first leads to NTe.g., S could go to NT24 NT59 if such a rule exists, but I don't see that in the given grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, S's productions are only S->NT61 NT59 and S->NT29 NT9. There's no S->NT24 NT59 or anything like that. So perhaps the first symbol t18 can't be derived from S directly unless we have a longer chain.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If NT24 can only produce 't18', then S must produce NT24 through a chain of productions starting from S. But S's first steps only produce two non-terminals, which would have to derive into NT24 and something else.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with another production. Let's check another approach: looking at how S can generate two non-terminals. Each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals if it's a terminal symbol in the production).\n\nWait, but in the grammar, all productions have exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. So each step in the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols (either both non-terminals, or one non-terminal and a terminal, but not both terminals unless it's a direct production of a terminal which is possible as shown in the rules).\n\nSo, to produce the string, each step must generate two symbols, whether they are non-terminals or terminals. But the given string is a flat list of terminals, so the derivation must have proceeded such that we end up with a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think recursively. Each step must reduce the string towards S, ensuring that each substitution is valid.\n\nBut given the time constraints, maybe I can try to see if the initial few symbols form a valid path.\n\nStarting with t18, which comes from NT24. Since S cannot directly produce NT24, we need to see if S can produce a pair of non-terminals where one of them can derive to NT24.\n\nLooking at S's productions again:\n\n- S -> NT61 NT59\n- S -> NT29 NT9\n\nAre either of these NTs able to produce NT24?\n\nLet's check NT61: looking at the rules, NT61 -> NT33 NT55. Hmm, NT33 -> NT36 NT23, and NT55-> NT6 NT1. So that might not lead to NT24.

{"custom_id":"request-681","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have two symbols. The start symbol here is S, and the only production starts with S -> NT61 NT59. So every string generated by this grammar will end with NT61 NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, it ends with t67 t13 t74 t54 t42 t62 t41 t60 t74 t12 t87 t37 t37 t60 t30 t16 t73 t54 t16 t5 t80 t16 t13 t63 t99 t83 t94 t12 t50 t39 t99 t74 t99 t63 t87.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, the end should be NT61 NT59. But I see 't' followed by numbers at the end. I think those 't' followed by numbers are terminals, not non-terminals. So the string should end with specific terminal symbols, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me check the productions again. The start symbol S is defined as NT61 NT59. So any string generated must start with NT61 NT59. The given string starts with 't67 t13', which are terminals. So does that mean the string starts with 't67 t13', which isn't NT61 NT59? Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The start symbol S generates NT61 NT59, which are part of the overall string. So the entire string should end with NT61 NT59 as derived symbols.\n\nWait, no, the string is a sequence of 't' symbols, which are terminals. So the actual string is a series of terminal symbols, but according to the grammar, the derivation must end with NT61 NT59, which are non-terminals. So that seems contradictory. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the string is constructed.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the grammar productions again. Each production rule is of the form X -> AB, where A and B are non-terminals. The initial symbols are S, which is NT61 NT59. Then, each symbol in the string must be formed by expanding these non-terminals according to the production rules.\n\nWait, the given string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I think are terminals. So perhaps the string is a series of terminals that result from expanding the non-terminals in the grammar. But the start symbol S expands into NT61 NT59, which are non-terminals. So the string should be built by expanding these, but in the end, the derived string is a sequence of terminals. So the last non-terminals would be expanded into the given 't' symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t67 t13 t74... and it's a long sequence. But the grammar only has specific productions. Let's see, for example, S -> NT61 NT59. So the first step is S, which becomes NT61 NT59. Now, each of these NTs can be further expanded according to the rules.\n\nLooking at NT61, the production is NT61 -> NT36 NT78. Similarly, NT59 -> NT29 NT86. So NT61 expands into NT36 and NT78, and NT59 into NT29 and NT86.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these NTs can eventually expand into the 't' symbols at the end. For example, let's look at NT61 and see if it can derive into t67.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a production NT61 -> NT36 NT78. Then, from NT36, the production is NT36 -> NT6 NT78. NT6 is 't74' according to the terminals. So NT6 can become 't74'. Then, NT78 has several productions, like NT78 -> NT93 NT7 or NT78 -> NT62 NT83, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent each step of expansion. Starting with S:\n\nS\n--> NT61 NT59\n--> (NT36 NT78) (NT29 NT86)\n\nNow, each of these NTs needs to expand into terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at NT36: production is NT36 -> NT6 NT78. NT6 is a terminal 't74' according to the grammar. So NT36 can become 't74' followed by whatever NT78 expands into.\n\nNT6 is 't74', so we're good there.\n\nNext, NT78: possible productions are NT78 -> NT93 NT7, NT78 -> NT62 NT83, etc. Let's pick one that can lead to a terminal. For example, NT78 -> NT93 NT7. Now, NT93 has production -> NT62 NT83. Let's take that.\n\nSo NT93 -> NT62 NT83. Now, NT62 is 't12', so that's terminal. NT83 -> NT24 NT46.\n\nWait, I'm trying to see if I can get the 't' symbols from the end. The string starts with t67, which is a problem because NT61 expands to NT36 and NT78, which in turn are non-terminals. So perhaps the initial symbols' expansion leads into the given 't's.\n\nBut I'm getting lost. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's look at the end of the given string.\n\nThe string ends with ...t99 t74 t99 t63 t87.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which NTs can expand into these. For example, NT63: looking at the productions, I don't see NT63 listed as a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT55 -> NT51 ('t49'), NT57 -> NT17 NT27, and so on. But I don't see NT63 in the productions as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The productions given are a mix of NT productions and terminal replacements. For example, NT2 -> 't64', NT7 -> 't74', etc. But I don't see NT63 listed as expanding into a terminal. Maybe it's derived from other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see the entire derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be generated by working backwards from the given string, applying inverse rules. But that might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach: each production is two non-terminals on the right side, so each symbol in the string is either a terminal or derived from NTs. The start symbol S is NT61 NT59, so the entire string must be derived from these. So perhaps the string is formed by expanding each NT into a sequence of terminals, with each NT being replaced step by step until all are terminals.\n\nBut honestly, this is getting too deep into the weeds. Maybe I should check if each terminal in the string can be matched by any NT production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, several NTs have a rule that ends in a terminal. For example, NT48 -> t65, but wait, in the grammar, NT48 is a production from NT48 -> t65, right? Let me check:\n\n- NT2 -> 't64'\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT79 -> 't36'\n- NT65 -> 't67' (from NT65 -> NT71 NT65, but when? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT65 -> NT71 NT65 seems like a typo because NT65 should expand into something else. Wait, looking back, the grammar entries are a mix. For example:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see lines like NT65 -> NT71 NT65, which should actually be a terminal, but it's a non-terminal. That might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is correctly structured, and some NTs loop into themselves, but that's not helpful for the current task.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar rules. Each production is in the form NTX -> NT... So for example, NT65 -> NT71 NT65, which seems to be a problem because it's an infinite loop. But that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's NT65 -> NT71 and NT65.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, it's written as NT65 -> NT71 NT65, which would imply that NT65 can substitute into NT71 and NT65, meaning it could be a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-676","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string provided is a sequence of tokens like 't87', 't28', etc., which I assume are terminals.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, the start symbol can produce two non-terminals, and each non-terminal is defined in terms of two other non-terminals or a terminal. The end symbol is when a non-terminal expands into a terminal.\n\nThe string is: `t87 t87 t28 t49 t9 t16 t48 t62 t60 t54 t65 t82 t76 t36 t99 t46 t25 t60 t50 t33 t83 t18 t76 t35 t79 t50 t30 t76 t62 t46 t67 t13 t51 t28 t18`.\n\nHmm, each of these tokens is either a terminal (like 't87') or a sequence of 't' followed by a number, which I think represents a non-terminal that eventually expands to that terminal. So, perhaps each 't followed by a number' represents a non-terminal, and the grammar's non-terminals are these, while the 't' numbers without the 't' are the terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example, `NT27 -> NT7 NT28`, which might correspond to 't7' and 't28'? Or maybe each non-terminal is a node that can expand into other non-terminals, and a production like NT27 -> 't7' would mean NT27 can directly produce 't7'.\n\nBut in the given grammar, most of the rules are like S -> NT61 NT59, so starting from S, which is the start symbol, it's non-terminals until a terminal is produced. So the string starts with 't87', which would have to be derived from some non-terminal that ends up being 't87'.\n\nWait, looking at the end, the string ends with several 't18's. In the grammar, for example, NT67 -> NT29 NT87. Let me see: the string has 't87' appearing twice early on. So perhaps the structure involves multiple non-terminals expanding into these 't...'.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string by walking back from the left, finding possible pairs of non-terminals in the grammar that can produce the strings. Or maybe use dynamic programming to see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, perhaps each part of the string corresponds to a production where each terminal or non-terminal is a node.\n\nWait, maybe each 't' with a number represents a non-terminal, so 't87' would be NT87, but I don't see NT87 in the grammar. Wait, let me look back. In the grammar, I see rules like NT27 -> 't7' and NT57 -> 't17', so those would produce 't7' or 't17' directly.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't87'. So, in the grammar, does NT87 have a production? Let's see, the grammar doesn't have an NT87 rule, but there's NT29 -> 't62', NT28 -> 't63', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't...' represents a non-terminal that can only be expanded directly into that terminal. So, for example, if NT87 can expand into 't87', then in the string, each 't87' would indicate that NT87 is used.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT87 defined. So maybe 't87' is not a terminal but a non-terminal that must be the result of some production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't..' is a terminal, but the grammar doesn't have the corresponding productions, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' with a number corresponds to a leaf node in the parse tree, where each non-terminal in the grammar is a binary tree node. For example, NT61 -> 't33' and 't55'. So, looking at the string, perhaps we can parse it as a series of non-terminals expanding to these 't's.\n\nWait, I think I should try to model this as a parsing problem. Starting from the left, try to split the string into parts that correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is quite long, but let me break it down:\n\nStart: t87 t87 t28 t49 t9 t16 t48 t62 t60 t54 t65 t82 t76 t36 t99 t46 t25 t60 t50 t33 t83 t18 t76 t35 t79 t50 t30 t76 t62 t46 t67 t13 t51 t28 t18.\n\nFirst, consider the first token 't87'. Let's look for a production that ends with 't87'. In the grammar, is there a rule where a non-terminal expands into 't87'?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT27 -> 't7'\n- NT57 -> 't17'\n- NT77 -> 't79' and other production paths\n- NT67 -> NT29 NT87 (which might expand to 't29' and 't87')\n- NT37 is not a production\nWait, maybe I need to check more thoroughly.\n\nLooking for any NT where a production ends with 't87':\n\nLooking through all rules, I find:\n\n- NT87 seems not present, but NT67 -> NT29 NT87. So, NT67 would produce 't29' and 't87'.\n\nSo perhaps the first 't87' is the result of NT87, but that's not in the grammar. Alternatively, maybe the production is NT67 -> 't29' and 't87', meaning 't87' is produced by NT67.\n\nBut then in the string, 't87' could come from a production that has a 't29' and 't87' as parts. So, looking for a possible split: the first 't87' would need to be followed by something that can pair with it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the first 't87' might be part of a larger production. Let's think recursively.\n\nSuppose at some point, the parser is looking at the leftmost symbol and tries to match the leftmost production. If the string starts with 't87', then perhaps the production is something like NTx -> 't87' and something else. But in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't87'. The closest is NT87 which is not defined.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me look again: some of the NTs have a production that ends with a terminal that starts with 't' and a number.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT27 -> 't7'\n\nNT57 -> 't17'\n\nNT67 -> 't29' and 't87'\n\nWait, in the given rules, I think some of the right-hand sides are terminals. For example, NT61 -> 't33', NT59 -> 't46', and so on. So for each production, if a non-terminal's production includes a 't' followed by a number, that means that when that non-terminal is expanded, that 't...' is a terminal in the string.\n\nSo for instance, the production NT27 -> 't7' means any instance of NT27 in the parse tree must generate the terminal 't7'.\n\nSimilarly, if there's a production NT67 -> 't29' NT87, then NT67 can generate 't29' followed by whatever NT87 generates.\n\nWait, so the string 't87' would have to be produced by a non-terminal that has a production where the terminal is 't87', but I don't see such a production in the grammar. So perhaps that's impossible, but I might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't87' is the result of a longer production. For example, NT67 -> 't29' 't87'. If in the string, 't87' is followed by 't28', which is another production, perhaps NT27 -> 't7' and so on.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree from the bottom up or use some algorithm.\n\nAnother approach: recursively check each part of the string. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 't87 t87 ...'. If each 't87' is a terminal, then we need a production for some non-terminal NT87 that produces 't87'.

So each non-terminal NT followed by numbers (like NT61) can produce either another non-terminal or a terminal. The string has 40 elements (each separated by space), so 40 symbols.\n\nFirst, let me note some key things. In the string, there are several 't' symbols followed by numbers. For example, the string starts with 't80 t86 t97...'. I notice that certain non-terminals in the grammar directly produce terminal strings. For example, NT79 -> 't80' because in the grammar: NT79 -> NT36 NT52, and NT36 -> NT6 NT78, NT6 -> 't74', NT78 -> 't56'... Wait, hold on, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the productions in the grammar include NT68 -> 't12', NT60 -> 't94', NT5 -> 't83', NT47 -> 't73', etc. So for example, if the string contains a 't12', it's the production from NT68, which itself is a terminal.\n\nSo, the approach could be to parse from left to right using the grammar, ensuring that at each step, the symbols can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nBut this might be complicated, but maybe I can look for the terminals and match them against the productions to see if a path exists.\n\nLet me try to parse step by step. But given that this is a long string, a top-down approach with memoization might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the possible structures.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as an infinite descent proof. Since the grammar is context-free and we have rules that collapse non-terminals to terminals or other non-terminals, perhaps I can reconstruct the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the string can be generated by the grammar by checking each symbol to see which production they could come from.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a way to map the string to the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is 't80'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT79 --> NT36 NT52.

{"custom_id":"request-692","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, understanding the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has a bunch of rules, all either two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' seems to be part of the terminals, so each token like 't19' is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string is: `t19 t82 t63 t19 t86 t82 t96 t36 t33 t33 t46 t2 t5 t67 t35 t83 t37 t62 t33 t66 t49 t96 t12 t76 t80 t66 t87 t18 t86 t28 t39 t46 t83 t73 t16 t64`.\n\nWait, let me count the tokens. It should be 31 tokens since each 't' has two digits, like 't19' is two digits, so each token is two characters. The string has 31 such tokens, so the string length is 62 characters, but let's see the actual count of tokens.\n\nNow, the process is to see if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol S following the grammar rules.\n\nBut manually expanding this might be too time-consuming. Maybe I can think of it in reverse, checking if we can reduce the entire string back to S using the inverse of the grammar rules. So, starting from the string, try to find possible matches for the right-hand sides of the production rules, and work backwards.\n\nEach production in the grammar either has a non-terminal on the left or a terminal. So, any token in the string can potentially be derived from a single terminal production or from a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, we can list the productions where the right-hand side is a single terminal, which would correspond to the tokens in the string. For example, most of the tokens are already present as single terminals, like 't19', 't82', etc. So, for each token in the string, I need to find a production rule that can derive that terminal.\n\nWait, but most of the left-hand sides in the grammar produce two non-terminals. So for example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, etc. So, each production in the grammar is of the form NTxy \u2192 NTab NTcd.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, and to parse it, each production must split a part of the string into two non-terminals (if applicable) or a single terminal.\n\nBut since our string is entirely composed of terminals without any non-terminals, we need to process it by breaking it into possible pairs of non-terminals that can produce these terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if the string is built from the grammar, each non-terminal expansion would produce two more symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So, starting from the start symbol S, which expands into two non-terminals, each of those could expand further, and so on, until we get a string of terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, all the symbols are 't' followed by numbers, meaning they are terminals. So, each symbol in the string must be produced by a production of the form NTxy \u2192 aT, where aT is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, the grammar's rules are all of the form NTxy \u2192 NTab NTcd, except for some that produce terminals like 't12' or 't5' etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example, NT68 \u2192 't67' (since NT68 \u2192 't67'). So some non-terminals produce terminals. Similarly, others like NT60 \u2192 't49'.\n\nSo, in the string, if a token is present as a terminal in the grammar, it can be produced by that non-terminal. For example, 't19' is a terminal, and looking at the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 't2', but I don't see 't19' as a terminal. Wait, checking the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces 't19' as a terminal. Wait, let's look:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't2'\n- NT59 \u2192 't46'\n- NT96 \u2192 't86'\n- NT66 \u2192 't95'\n- NT88 \u2192 't72'\n- NT93 \u2192 't74'\n- NT83 \u2192 't32'\n- NT29 \u2192 't62'\n- NT90 \u2192 't...'. Wait, but 't19' is not directly a terminal in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-712","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of symbols, some of which are terminals and others are non-terminals. Each symbol is separated by a space, and the grammar is specified with production rules for each non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar rules. The string is quite long, but I can approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t72 t42 t30 t94 t96 t51 t33 t30 t0 t36 t32 t82 t66 t39 t67 t94 t96 t48 t96 t99 t36 t13 t16 t30 t37 t82 t83 t5 t86 t37 t99 t64 t19 t95 t16 t33 t62\n\nI start by looking at the first symbol, t72. Let me check which production rules have t72 in the right-hand side. Scanning through the rules, I see that NT78 produces t93 and t7. Also, NT93 produces t62 and t83, and NT83 produces t22 and t8. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look at the production for S first.\n\nLooking at the rules for S, it can be replaced by NT61 NT59. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT61 and NT59. Now, each of these can further expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me see where these production rules lead. NT61 is defined as NT33 NT55, and NT33 is NT32 NT72. So from NT61, I have NT33 NT55, which breaks down into NT32 NT72 and NT55. NT32 is NT18 NT65, and NT55 is NT19 NT95. Wait, NT18 is t2, so NT18 would produce t2, and NT65 is NT6 NT60, but NT6 is t74, and NT60 is NT68 NT52, which can go deeper.\n\nBut I'm starting to think that maybe this approach is too tedious for such a long string. Maybe I should consider the string as a sequence of terminals and see if each segment can be matched via some production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of a parse tree. Each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal in the grammar, and the sequence should form a valid derivation.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t72. I check the production rules for non-terminals that can produce t72. Looking through the rules, I notice that NT93 -> t62 t83, and NT83 -> t22 t8. Also, NT78 -> t93 t7, which doesn't directly give t72. Maybe I should see if any non-terminal directly produces t72 or if it's part of a chain.\n\nWait, looking again, NT68 -> t93 t88. NT93 is t62 t83. NT55 -> t19 t95. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each symbol.\n\nt72: Does any production produce t72?\nLooking at NT93: NT93 -> t62 t83. Yes, so to get t72, perhaps NT78 or another non-terminal that expands to t72. Wait, NT78 -> t93 t7, but NT73 is t53 t26, and NT87 is t48 t7. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, looking for t72 in any production. I see that NT78 -> t93 t7, which isn't directly t72. But perhaps through other expansions. Wait, maybe I should look for where t72 is a result of a production.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT68 -> t93 t88, but NT77 is defined as NT79 t72 and NT79 is another rule. Wait, NT79 -> t80 t54. So if I have something that leads to NT79, then... Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string is consumed by the grammar. Let's try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more systematic, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, given the string length, maybe it's easier to see if the grammar can produce such a long string. The given grammar seems to have a fixed set of production rules leading to a certain number of possible combinations. But perhaps I can find a path through the grammar that matches the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t72. I think that t72 comes from NT78 -> t93 t7. So in the production, we would have NT78, which is t93 t7. Then, t93 comes from NT93 -> t62 t83. So t93 is NT93. Let me see:\n\nWait, no, the way production rules work is that each symbol on the left expands into the right-hand side. So if the string starts with t72, that must come from a production rule where a non-terminal on the left expands into a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see that:\n\n- NT68 -> t93 t88 (both non-terminals)\n- NT93 -> t62 t83 (both non-terminals)\n- NT73 -> t53 t26 (both non-terminals)\n- NT87 -> t48 t7 (both non-terminals)\n- NT62 -> t12 t83 (t12 is NT12, but I don't see a production for NT12 in the rules. Wait, in the rules provided, I see NT62 -> t12 t83. So NT62 could produce t12 and t83.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for a non-terminal that directly produces t72. Scanning all right-hand sides, I see that NT93 -> t62 t83, but no production for a non-terminal leading directly to t72. So how does t72 get generated?\n\nWait, perhaps t72 comes from a chain of non-terminals. For example, if a non-terminal A expands into B and C, where B could be another non-terminal that further expands, eventually leading to t72.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT77 -> NT79 t72 and NT79 -> t80 t54. So NT77 produces t79 and t72. Therefore, if we have NT77 -> t79 t72, then t72 comes directly from NT77, but wait, that's not correct. No, NT77 -> NT79 t72, so in the expansion, the NT77 becomes the sequence of whatever NT79 and t72 produce. Wait, so the production is NT77 -> NT79 t72, which would mean that in the string, we would see NT79's expansion followed by t72.\n\nBut NT79 -> t80 t54, so the expansion of NT79 would be t80 t54. Therefore, the expansion for NT77 would be t80 t54 t72. So in the string, we would see t80 t54 t72.\n\nBut in the given string, the substring starting at some point is t36 t32 t82 t66 t39 t67 t94 t96 t48 t96 t99 t36 t13 t16 t30 t37 t82 t83 t5 t86 t37 t99 t64 t19 t95 t16 t33 t62\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me check: the string starts with t72, but according to the production NT77 -> NT79 t72, NT79 -> t80 t54, so NT77 would expand into t80 t54 t72, leading to the substring t80 t54 t72 somewhere in the string. Is that present?\n\nLooking in the string: I see t80 somewhere, but let me see:\n\nLooking at the string: t72 is the very first symbol. Wait, so does that mean that the first symbol t72 comes directly from a non-terminal that expands to t72? Or is there a way for the production to generate t72 indirectly.\n\nWait, no, because t72 is on the right-hand side of NT77's production. So in the string, t72 is produced when NT77 is in the string, but NT77 expands into NT79 and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. From the rules, S and NT47 start the process. The initial expansion is S -> NT61 NT59. Then, both NT61 and NT59 need to be expanded.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string step by step using the grammar. The string is:\n\nt50 t12 t32 t33 t60 t49 t97 t74 t3 t32 t37 t74 t86 t33 t83 t13 t76 t37 t82 t41 t96 t39 t60 t50 t2 t87 t94 t80 t62 t25 t30 t25 t65 t39 t9 t12 t5.\n\nI notice that many of these t's are already terminal symbols, like t5, t12, etc., which correspond to specific production rules. Let's try to parse the string by matching it with the grammar.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT61 NT59.\n\nNT61 should expand to t36. Looking at the rules, NT61 -> NT36 -> ... Wait, looking at the grammar, NT61 has two rules: NT61 -> NT36 and NT61 -> NT10 NT96. Hmm, or wait, the NT61 rule is NT61 -> NT36 and NT36 -> NT6 and NT55. Wait, maybe I need to follow each step.\n\nWait, actually, let me list out the production rules for each NT:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT61:\nNT61 -> NT36\nNT36 -> NT6 NT78\nNT6 -> t74\nNT78 -> NT93 NT7\nNT93 -> NT62 NT83\nNT62 -> t12\nNT83 -> t94\nNT7 -> t83 (looks like NT7's production is t83)\nSo if NT61 expands to NT36, which becomes NT6 NT78, then NT6 is t74, NT78 is NT93 NT7. NT93 is t12, NT7 is t83. So NT61 -> t74 t12 t83. So S when started with NT61 would expand to t74 t12 t83 t95.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first parts are t50 t12 t32... Hmm, maybe I'm not considering the correct expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by mapping each part of the string through the grammar.\n\nLet me list the entire string and see how it can be split into parts matching the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t50 t12 t32 t33 t60 t49 t97 t74 t3 t32 t37 t74 t86 t33 t83 t13 t76 t37 t82 t41 t96 t39 t60 t50 t2 t87 t94 t80 t62 t25 t30 t25 t65 t39 t9 t12 t5.\n\nI notice that t50 corresponds to NT50. Looking at the production rules, what can NT50 expand to? Let me check the productions for NT50. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see an NT50 in the provided rules. Hmm, that might be a problem because I don't know what NT50 can produce.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the provided grammar again to see if I missed any NT50. Looking through all the NT rules, I don't see NT50 defined. So perhaps NT50 is a dead end, meaning it can't produce any terminal string. Therefore, if the string contains t50, it can't be generated by the grammar. Because NT50 doesn't have a production that leads to terminals.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the grammar provided. The user listed a long list of NT and production rules. Let me see if any of them are NT50. Scanning through the list, I see NT5, NT58, NT59, but nothing for NT50. So if the string has t50, then it can't be generated because NT50 doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, the first part of the string is t50, so the grammar can't derive that.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I look at the grammar to understand the productions. I notice that some non-terminals lead directly to terminals, like NT2 -> 't64'. Others break down into other non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t53 t36 t25 t16 t5 t95 t64 t50 t79 t41 t74 t63 t3 t76 t37 t97 t95 t48 t60 t72 t35 t38 t0 t19 t32 t86 t87 t18 t42 t42 t32 t53 t74 t86 t80 t32 t36 t96`\n\nI think a good approach is to work backwards. Start from the string and see if it can be reduced to S using the reverse of the productions.\n\nLooking for the left-hand sides (LHS) of the productions that match the string. The initial symbol is S, which is either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So, let's see if the string can start with any of those.\n\nLooking at the start rules:\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nIn the string, the first tokens are 't53', 't36', etc. I need to see if these can be parts of NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n- NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT43? Wait, no, looking back, NT59's production isn't shown correctly. Wait, in the provided grammar, I need to check.\n\nWait, the grammar is given in parts. Let me scan through the productions for NT59. Hmm, some quick checks: NT59 -> NT33 NT55? No, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59: I don't see an explicit production for NT59 here. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me scan through all the NT productions.\n\nLooking through, I see NT59: \"NT5 -> NT61 NT84\", and \"NT59\": none. Wait, no. Wait, in the provided grammar, several entries are present, but for NT59, checking each line, I only see:\n\n- NT5 -> NT61 NT84\n- NT59 doesn't seem to have a production. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through every line, for NT59, yes, in one of the entries: \"NT59\" isn't listed as a production. Wait, no, looking more carefully, line 4: NT47->NT58 NT95, line 10: NT65->NT71 NT65, line 14: NT68->NT93 NT88, line etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, the grammar is lengthy. It's possible that certain NTs don't have defined productions, meaning they are terminals. But no, the grammar is in CNF, so all non-terminals must have two non-terminals. So, perhaps some lines are incomplete.\n\nWait, perhaps some entries are missing in the listing. For example, the user provided the grammar with many lines, but I'm going to have to assume that the provided lines cover all the productions. So, if NT59 isn't present in the list, then it would be a problem.\n\nWait, looking through the production list, I see lines like NT67->NT57 NT14, NT77->NT79 NT6, etc. But in the string, there are 't36', which is likely NT36, as per some rule like NT67->NT57 NT14 or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map all the non-terminals and see their possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be formed by expanding the start symbol S step by step, substituting non-terminals with their productions until we reach the string.\n\nBut since the string is quite long (several dozen tokens), this could take a long time manually.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the initial splits of the string. Since the start symbol S can produce either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9, the string must begin with either of these combinations.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string:\n\nt53 t36 t25 t16 t5 t95 t64...\n\nIf S starts with NT61 NT59, then the first part of the string should derive from NT61 and NT59.\n\nSimilarly, if S starts with NT29 NT9, the first part should derive from NT29 and NT9.\n\nLet's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's check if the string starts with NT61 NT59.\n\nTo derive from NT61 and NT59, we need both sides to form the first two parts of the string. So the first token would come from NT61, and the second from NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t53. Let's see if there's a rule for NT61 that can produce something starting with t53.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT61 has production NT61 -> NT33 NT55. Hmm, but NT61 could also have another production if it's listed elsewhere. In the provided list, I see lines like:\n\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT55\n- NT88 -> ... (various)\n- NT9 -> NT10 NT17\n- etc.\n\nWait, does NT61 have any direct production to a terminal? I don't see it in the provided list, so it must expand into two non-terminals.\n\nSo, after NT61 -> NT33 NT55, we'd need to see what these produce.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 is somewhere in the grammar, but I don't see it being directly expanded. Perhaps NT59 is a non-terminal that can only expand into terminals.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the string can be divided into two parts, each derived from NT61 and NT59 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string: let's split it and see.\n\nFirst, the string is a sequence of 33 tokens. Let's assume each non-terminal production will generate a certain number of tokens.\n\nFor example, if NT61 expands into a series of non-terminals, each of which expands further until they reach terminals, the number of tokens will be based on how many steps are involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for which production could result in the initial tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that some non-terminals directly lead to terminals.\n\nFor instance, looking at the grammar, many lines have productions that lead to 't' followed by a number, like NT93->'t72', NT67->'t5', etc.\n\nSo, to get the first token 't53', perhaps there's a production rule where NT.... -> 't53'. Let's scan through the grammar to see if any NT has a production to 't53'.\n\nLooking through the last lines:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT28 -> 't86'\n- NT23 -> 't79'\n- And so on.\n\nI don't see any production that leads directly to 't53'. Wait, maybe it's generated through multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't53' is obtained via NT77->'t5', but that seems off.\n\nWait, another approach: let's see if the initial parts of the string align with the given start rules.\n\nThe first two tokens are 't53' and 't36'. Let's see if any NTs are known to produce these.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT58->NT66 NT23. NT66 wasn't a given, but in another production, NT66->'t95' (line 58: NT66 -> 't95'? Wait, looking again, line 32: NT67->... no, line 20: NT18->'t66'? No, let me check:\n\nIn the list, line 58: NT66 -> 't95'? Wait, looking through:\n\nWait, in the list provided, for NT66, is there a production to 't95'? Scanning:\n\nYes, line 32: NT66 -> 't95'?\n\nWait, the line is \"NT66 -> 't95'\". So NT66 can produce 't95'.\n\nBut that's the reverse step.\n\nSo, if t53 is part of a production, maybe NT58 is the non-terminal that generates 't53', but I don't see a production for NT58: yes,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out whether the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nHmm, first, I should understand what the grammar looks like. It's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, the start symbol is S, and it eventually breaks down into a bunch of non-terminals leading to terminal symbols like 't12', 't38', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t72 t38 t95 t38 t37 t30 t50 t53 t99 t16 t48 t46 t65 t95 t94 t49 t36 t0 t46 t16 t72 t51 t82 t82 t18 t74 t66 t33 t25 t18 t79 t33 t28 t12 t33 t99 t37 t49.\n\nThat's a long string, but each element is a terminal, I assume. So the string is a concatenation of these 't' symbols.\n\nNow, I think the approach here is to simulate how the grammar could generate this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a dynamic programming approach (like CYK) might be suitable, but given that it's a single string, maybe using the CYK algorithm could help determine if it's in the language.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar breaks down into non-terminals, I can try to see if each part of the string can correspond to a leftmost derivation in the grammar. Starting from S, see if the string can be built by expanding rules according to the grammar.\n\nLet me first look at the start symbol S. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. These are the two options for S. So the first two symbols in the string must be two non-terminals that can lead to these sequences. \n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t72. So I need to see if either option for S can produce t72 as the first symbol. Let's check each option:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59: The first symbol would come from NT61. So check if NT61 can derive t72.\n2. S \u2192 NT29 NT9: The first symbol would come from NT29. Check if NT29 can derive t72.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT61 is a non-terminal. Let me look at the production rules for NT61. From the list, I see NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. NT33 is another non-terminal that can be expanded: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72. Then NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65, and so on.\n\nHmm, tracing this down:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\n\u2192 (NT61) (NT59)\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nNT18 \u2192 t9 NT59 (Looking for the rule for NT18: From the grammar, NT18 \u2192 t36. Wait, no, the grammar has NT18 \u2192 t36. Let me check.\n\nWait, the production rules include NT18 \u2192 t36, so that means NT18 can produce a terminal. So in the case of NT18, it would directly expand to 't36'. But in our case, in the first expansion, we have NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. Wait no, let me correct:\n\nWait, the production is NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. RTFM: The grammar rule for NT32 is NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. Then NT18 \u2192 t36. So in the first step:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nNT18 \u2192 t36 (so t36, then NT65 is something else.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t72. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to see how t72 is produced.\n\nLooking for rules leading to 't72'. Let's check: the grammar has rules where NT72 \u2192 something? Let me scan through the rules.\n\nI see NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6. NT79 \u2192 ... Hmm, looking for terminals that produce 't72'. The only terminals in the rules are:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t64\n- NT59 \u2192 t35\n- NT33 \u2192 t32\n- NT32 \u2192 t18\n- NT65 \u2192 t67\n- NT77 \u2192 t79\n- NT55 \u2192 t19\n- NT58 \u2192 t95\n- NT73 \u2192 t53\n- NT82 \u2192 etc., some are t.\nWait, more specifically, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t19\n- NT65 \u2192 t36\nWait, perhaps in NT93 \u2192 't72'? Let's see, NT93 is in the productions as \u2192 t72.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT55 \u2192 t5? Wait, looking:\n\nYes, for example, NT5 \u2192 t83, NT66 \u2192 t5, NT54 \u2192 t64, NT55 \u2192 t19, NT58 \u2192 t95, NT61 \u2192 t36 (wait, no, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, which leads to more steps), but in some cases, non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, for example, looking for 't72', I see that NT93 \u2192 t72. So if a non-terminal nt93 expands to t72, then that's how it's produced. So in our string, the first symbol is t72. Wait, no\u2014wait the first symbol is t72, but for it to appear in the string, it must come from a production that ends up as 't72'. So to get a terminal symbol t72, the production chain must lead to it. Let's check if any non-terminal directly or indirectly produces t72.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 t0\n- NT30 \u2192 perhaps?\nWait, looking for 't72' among the terminals in the rules:\n\nLooking at the list of rules, I see that NT5 \u2192 t83, NT9 \u2192 t18, etc. Wait, I need to check each rule where a terminal appears.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72 \u2192 So for NT33, the first symbol becomes NT32, which is then NT18 and NT65. NT18 \u2192 t36 (so that's a terminal), NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT47, which then become... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me see if 't72' can be produced by any non-terminal. Looking through the rules provided:\n\n- I see NT55 \u2192 t19, NT93 \u2192 t72, NT77 \u2192 t79, NT67 \u2192 t53, etc. So NT93 can produce t72.\n\nSo perhaps in the string, the 't72' is the first symbol, so it must come from a production that directly produces t72, which is NT93 \u2192 t72. So the first step would be to expand the non-terminal that produces 't72'.\n\nBut looking back, the start symbol is S, which initially splits into either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So either of these two non-terminals would be the leftmost symbols.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't72', which would have to come from a production of 't72' only if a non-terminal on the left side of the productions for S directly leads to 't72'. But looking at the two initial productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59: So the first non-terminal would be NT61, which expands to NT33 NT55, then to NT32 NT65, then to NT18 and NT65, which then expand further. But that would produce a sequence that didn't directly give 't72' as the first symbol. Instead, the first symbol in the string is 't72', which would have to come from NT93.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT29 NT9: Similarly, NT29 expands to NT14 NT86, then further.\n\nSo in the first case, to start with NT61, which eventually leads to 't72',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string starts with t96 and ends with t0 and t76, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S has two productions: S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. Both of these lead to sequences that can be broken down into more non-terminals. Since the string starts with t96, which is a terminal, I need to see which production can lead to it.\n\nLooking at NT96, from the productions, NT96 -> 't67'. So for t96, it must come from NT96, which is 't67'. Hmm, wait, let me check the productions. Yes, in the grammar, NT96 is a non-terminal that produces 't67'.\n\nSo in the string, t96 appears at the very beginning. That means in the derivation, somewhere there must be a step where NT96 is rewritten to 't67', which is part of the string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t96, not 't67'. So if t96 is 't67', then the first character 't96' would correspond to 't67'. That seems confusing. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT96 -> 't67'. So the string starts with t96, which is different. That suggests that perhaps the first production is something else. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake, but I shouldn't assume that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar's NT symbols. Let me check the grammar carefully. NT67 -> NT57 NT14, which breaks down further, eventually producing 't73'. Hmm. But the string starts with t96, which would require that NT96 is derived from 't67', but in the string, it's t96. That doesn't add up. Unless I'm misreading the grammar.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the productions. I see:\n\nNT96 -> 't67'\n\nSo when NT96 is derived, it results in 't67', so if the string has 't96', that means the grammar must produce that.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t96. So for it to be generated, somehow the NT96 must produce t96. But in the grammar, it's producing t67. So that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the NT symbol for t96 is different. Let me check the grammar again for t96.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT that directly produces t96 except for maybe NT59? No, NT59 is 't35' or 't46' depending on the path. The string starts with t96, which is different from any of the productions I can see. Wait, no: in the grammar, I see NT96 -> 't67', but the string has t96. So this suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar, because there's no production that directly or indirectly leads to t96 except for NT96, which produces t67.\n\nBut wait, maybe the NT66 is another one. Let's see: NT66 -> 't95'. So if any step in the derivation uses NT66, it would produce 't95'. Not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to derive t96 from a combination of NTs. But I don't see a production that leads directly to 't96'. Let me check all the productions to see if any NT ends with t96.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT35: I don't see it producing t96.\n\n- NT67: 't73'.\n\n- NT46: 't60' or NT47->'t60' etc.\n\n- I don't see any NT productions that produce t96.\n\nWait, let me check for NT68: NT68->'t83', but that's not t96.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe the NT65 production has a chain that ends with t96. Let me check. For example, NT65 can be 't6' or lead to t65.\n\nWait, the string starts with t96. That suggests that somewhere in the derivation, a NT must produce 't96'. Since the only production for 't96' I can see is NT96 -> 't67', which doesn't align, unless I made a mistake in the check.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: maybe the NT96 is part of a longer chain that results in t96. For example, perhaps there's a production NT99 -> NT96, and that's rewritten.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, let me see:\n\nNT96 -> 't67'. So no, it's directly t67. No NT99 is present either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the production steps. Let me think: for example, the string starts with t96, which must come from some NT. Since NT96 -> 't67', which is t67, but the string has t96. So that's a mismatch. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar because the first symbol doesn't match any production of an NT.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar because the first symbol t96 cannot be derived from any NT production provided.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-756","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, all the rules seem to fit this structure, so that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t96 t16 t72 t9 t80 t94 t74 t60 t94 t28 t97 t80 t3 t82 t66 t76 t12 t33 t39 t73 t16 t97 t36 t95 t86 t99 t67 t86 t67 t64 t95 t73 t0 t65 t5 t53 t83 t95 t72`.\n\nWait, that's a lot of tokens. I see that each non-terminal in the grammar can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the overall approach would be to parse the string from right to left, checking each symbol to see if it matches a terminal in the grammar or can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, I think the best approach is to perform a recursive descent parsing or maybe a memoization approach. Alternatively, I can write out the parse tree and see if the entire string is covered.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nLet's look at the start symbol S, which can produce NT61 NT59. So, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Both NT61 and NT59 are non-terminals. Each of them will produce two other non-terminals, and so on until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, the entire string must be generated by expanding S through all these non-terminals, and each symbol in the string must match the terminals produced by the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the string length should be (2^n -1) where n is the depth of the derivation. Let's see, the length of the string is 37 tokens. So, 2^n -1 = 37 \u2192 2^n =38 \u2192 n \u2248 log2(38) \u2248 6, so the depth is about 6, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to reconstruct the parse tree in reverse. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the string, the last symbol is t72. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce t72. Looking through the productions, I see NT56 \u2192 t95, NT68 \u2192 t83, NT23 \u2192 t79, etc. Doesn't look like any directly produce t72. Wait, actually in the grammar, I notice NT97 \u2192 t80, NT74 \u2192 t64, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the string ends with ... t73 t0 t65 t5 ... so maybe not. Let's check each token.\n\nWait, maybe instead of starting from the string, I can build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each token in the string matches something in the grammar. If a token is a terminal (like t96, t16, etc.), it must correspond to a production rule that produces that terminal. For non-terminals, they need to be expanded into two parts.\n\nSo, starting from S, which becomes NT61 NT59. Now, NT61 can be expanded into NT33 NT55, and NT59 into NT66 NT23.\n\nThen, NT33 is NT32 NT72, NT55 is NT61 NT9, NT66 is NT87 NT76, NT23 is NT13 NT73.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use a table-driven or recursive approach.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is simple, perhaps I can simulate the parse step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each production splits into two non-terminals, and each of those must also split until we reach terminals.\n\nI think the problem here is that the string is quite long, and manually tracing it might be error-prone. But perhaps I can notice some patterns.\n\nLooking at the string, I see several t tokens. For example, t96 appears twice: at the start and at the end. Similarly, t60 appears early on. Let me see if any of the non-terminals map directly to these.\n\nIn the grammar, there are several rules that produce terminals. Let's list them all:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t18\nNT18 \u2192 t66\nNTt60 \u2192 t49\nNT65 \u2192 t36\nNT47 \u2192 t73\nNT88 \u2192 t42\nNT15 \u2192 t71\nNT5 \u2192 t58\nWait, no, actually, looking through the grammar, the rules that produce terminals are:\n\nNT61 \u2192 t36\nNT29 \u2192 t87\nNT47 \u2192 t73\nNT65 \u2192 t9\nNT77 \u2192 t94\nNT2 \u2192 t64\nNT14 \u2192 t2\nNT83 \u2192 t41\nNT23 \u2192 t13\nNT59 \u2192 t35\nNT5 \u2192 t5\nWait, no, wait: looking through the rules, many have been written as e.g., NT61 \u2192 t36. Wait, I see that several rules have something like 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look through the grammar provided to see which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t18\nWait, no, actually in the grammar, there's:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t58\nNT5 \u2192 t83\nWait, no, looking again: \n\nLooking at the grammar, from the provided lines, I see several:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't36' (maybe)\nWait, no.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string and the grammar rules to see how the string might be broken down.\n\nThe string is: `t16 t95 t73 t82 t2 t83 t54 t66 t80 t74 t38 t9 t25 t96 t42 t62 t39 t83 t41 t62 t96 t62 t33 t16 t19 t53 t79 t42 t0 t32 t9 t38 t63 t53 t67 t73 t74 t42 t13 t5`.\n\nI notice that many of these are 't' followed by numbers, which might be the terminals in the grammar. So the non-terminals are NT followed by numbers, like NT16, NT2, etc.\n\nLet me look for the starting symbol. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so S is the start symbol. That means the string should start with the symbols derived from NT61 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t16 comes early. Let's see which production leads to 't16'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT68 \u2192 't16'. So to get 't16', we must have NT68 in the leftmost position, which can derive to 't16'.\n\nBut wait, S starts with NT61 NT59, which are both non-terminals. So I need to see how NT61 and NT59 can be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT61's productions:\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 (but I think in the grammar above, NT61 only has one production.

So that suggests that in the derivation, we have NT68 somewhere.\n\nBut since the start symbol is S, which is NT61 NT59, we need to see how NT61 and NT59 can be derived.\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Now, NT61 has rules, but looking at the grammar, NT61 appears twice: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 (line 30) and NT61 \u2192 NT36 NT59 (line 5)? Wait, looking again, the provided grammar has line 5: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65, which is a loop. Maybe I misnumbered them.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the productions more carefully:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, it's a list where each line is a production. So line 1 is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Line 2 is S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Then line 3: NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95, line 4: NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52, etc.\n\nContinuing:\n\nLines 3 to the end are all productions for various NTx.\n\nSo:\n\nNT61 is defined as something? Wait, looking for NT61:\n\nLine 30: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So that's the only production for NT61.\n\nSo when S \u2192 NT61 NT59 is expanded, the leftmost non-terminal is NT61, which must be replaced. It can only go to NT33 NT55. So S becomes NT33 NT55 NT59.\n\nWait, but that doesn't immediately help us since we have to process NT33 and NT55 and NT59.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of several production rules where each symbol on the left side can be replaced by the right side. Notably, some symbols (like NT2, NT46, etc.) have rules that produce terminal symbols (like 't12', 't94'), so these are the leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't9', 't42', etc. I notice that some of these 't' sequences are repeated, such as 't9' appearing multiple times. Since the grammar uses NT2 and others to produce these, the string must be formed by expanding these NT non-terminals into the corresponding 't' symbols.\n\nI'll start by identifying which parts of the string correspond to the terminals produced by the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number must match one of the productions. For example, 't94' is a terminal, so when the parser encounters 't94', it must have been derived from NT60 or NT20, as per the grammar rules provided.\n\nLet's parse the string step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with 't9'. Looking at the grammar, does any production produce 't9'? Let's check. I see that NT59 -> 't46' and NT59 is part of the initial rule (S -> NT29 NT59). Wait, wait. The initial grammar is S -> NT29 NT59, which would mean S must expand into two non-terminals: NT29 and NT59. So, the string must start with the expansion of these.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each symbol in the string and see which NT it's derived from.\n\nLet's list the string: t9 t37 t72 t48 t42 t96 t74 t30 t48 t64 t49 t16 t9 t97 t74 t46 t9 t48 t72 t32 t38 t48 t30 t48 t30 t19 t38 t3 t37 t28 t62 t19 t60 t95 t95 t3 t38 t33 t36 t65.\n\nEach of these 't' sequences must correspond to a production rule on some NT.\n\nI'll go through each one:\n\nt9: Looking at the grammar, do any NT produce t9? Checking the rules... hmm, I see NT29 -> NT14 NT86, and NT14 is 't2', and NT86 is 't62'. Hmm, not matching. Wait, NT29 is expanded into other NTs. So perhaps t9 is from NT59: NT59 -> 't46', but that's t46, not t9. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, I think I need to check all the NTs in the grammar to see if any produce 't9' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-797","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t3 t51 t12 t83 t48 t18 t86 t38 t80 t41 t16 t63 t32 t39 t83 t51 t96 t66 t42 t79 t39 t51 t65 t62 t41 t18 t33 t74 t80 t16 t65 t19 t95 t96 t51 t79 t67 t39 t79 t13 t66`, and I need to check if it's in the language defined by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. CNF is a productions where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given here seems to fit that because all productions start with a non-terminal on the left and either produce two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe goal is to derive the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step increases the length of the string by one, and the entire process should lead to the given string.\n\nBut going through each step manually for such a long string would be time-consuming. Instead, maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be parsed by the grammar using the given productions.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree for the given string and see if all the leaves correspond exactly to the terminals in the string, following the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each production in CNF has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, when parsing from the start symbol S down, each non-terminal should expand into pairs of symbols (non-terminals or terminals), and this process continues until we reach the terminal string.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules and the string again.\n\nThe string starts with `t3`. Looking at the grammar, I see productions like NT9 \u2192 t64, NT60 \u2192 t65, NT50 \u2192 t64 (wait, no, checking again: looking at NT62 \u2192 t12, which is earlier, but I don't see a rule for NT9 \u2192 t3. Hmm, maybe I need to see if the start symbol can produce a chain leading to t3.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the given grammar, can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t3, t51, t12, etc. Let's see if t3 is reachable.\n\nChecking the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t3. Let's scan through the grammar. \n\nI see NT24 \u2192 t2, NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67, NT29 \u2192 t62, NT10 \u2192 NT59, NT18 \u2192 t36, NT88 \u2192 t28, etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to list all the terminal productions:\n\nNT62 \u2192 t12\n\nNT58 \u2192 t95\n\nNT46 \u2192 t60\n\nNT68 \u2192 t83\n\nNT14 \u2192 t2\n\nNT93 \u2192 t72\n\nNT56 \u2192 t51\n\nNT95 \u2192 t94\n\nNT47 \u2192 t18\n\nNT61 \u2192 t33\n\nNT88 \u2192 t33\n\nNT88 is an interesting one because it produces two different terminals when looking at its rules: NT88 \u2192 t28 and also NT88 \u2192 t72. Wait, no, looking again: NT88 \u2192 t28, NT73 \u2192 t53, NT28 \u2192 t63, etc., but wait, in the given rules, NT88 is listed as nt88 \u2192 t42, nt88 \u2192 t28, and nt88 \u2192 t72. So NT88 can produce t42, t28, t72. \n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 t67\n\nNT19 \u2192 t0\n\nNT5 \u2192 t61, t83, t86\n\nWait, I might be making a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar rules to see which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\nNT62 \u2192 t12\n\nNT58 \u2192 t95\n\nNT46 \u2192 t60\n\nNT68 \u2192 t83\n\nNT24 \u2192 t2\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67\n\nNT29 \u2192 t62\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT59\n\nNT18 \u2192 t36\n\nNT88 \u2192 t72\n\nWait, no, according to the given rules:\n\nLooking at line 65: NT62 \u2192 t12\n\nThen NT58 \u2192 t95\n\nNT46 \u2192 t60\n\nNT68 \u2192 t83\n\nNT24 \u2192 t2\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67\n\nNT29 \u2192 t62\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT59\n\nNT18 \u2192 t36\n\nWait, I think I'm getting lost. Maybe a better approach is to look for each terminal in the string and see if there are NTs that can derive them.\n\nBut the string starts with t3, t51, t12, etc. Let's check the rules for NTs that produce these.\n\nLooking for t3: Is there any NT that produces t3? Checking through the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see NT67 \u2192 t33, NT83 \u2192 t32, NT29 \u2192 t62, NT71 \u2192 t50, NT61 \u2192 t33, NT55 \u2192 t19, NT24 \u2192 t2, NT67 \u2192 t50, etc. Hmm, not seeing t3 yet. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through all the NTs and their rules:\n\nNT62 \u2192 t12 --> yes, that's t12.\n\nNT58 \u2192 t95\n\nNT46 \u2192 t60\n\nNT68 \u2192 t83\n\nNT24 \u2192 t2\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67\n\nNT29 \u2192 t62\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT59\n\nNT18 \u2192 t36\n\nNT88 \u2192 t72\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not finding t3 as a terminal. Let me see all the rules:\n\nLooking again:\n\nAt the end of the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t61, t84, t86\n\n- NT46 \u2192 t96\n\n- NT84 \u2192 t57\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t33, NT67 \u2192 t33 again.\n\nWait, but in the list:\n\nLooking here: \n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 t3.\n\nI don't see an NT that directly produces 't3'. Let me see:\n\nWait, let me check each line:\n\nLooking for t3 in the right-hand side of any rule. Let's go through all the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t61, t84, t86\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't51'\n\nWait, are these terminals?\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nAt line: NT58 \u2192 t95\n\nNT46 \u2192 t60\n\nNT68 \u2192 t83\n\nNT24 \u2192 t2\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67\n\nNT29 \u2192 t62\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT59\n\nNT18 \u2192 t36\n\nNT88 \u2192 t72\n\nNT23 \u2192 t2\n\nNT2 \u2192 t64\n\nNT79 \u2192 t80\n\nNT93 \u2192 t72\n\nNT66 \u2192 t95\n\nNT55 \u2192 t5\n\nNT9 \u2192 t18\n\nNT23 \u2192 t3\n\nWait!

So NT23 can produce t3.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is t3, which could be produced by NT23. Then, we have to see what's before it. But wait, the parse starts from the entire string. So, how do we derive this?\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol S can produce S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Let's see.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT29 NT9, then we have to produce the string starting with NT29 and NT9.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is t3, which is from NT23, not from NT29 or NT9. Hmm, so perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT61 NT59 is the right starting point. Let's explore that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT61 NT59.

Each of these NTs can derive either another NT or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, for example, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 and NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT29, and NT29 \u2192 NT62 NT83, etc. I notice some NTs can also derive terminals like 't' followed by numbers. For instance, NT65 \u2192 't32', NT20 \u2192 't93', etc.\n\nThe string starts with 't82', which isn't a direct terminal production in the grammar. Wait, looking back, actually NT33 can go to NT79 NT22 or NT32 NT72. So, maybe I'll need to trace through how 't82' could be formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider each step in the string and see if each 'tXY' can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to look at each terminal in the string and see which NT could produce it.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt82 t36 t66 t12 t74 t25 t72 t25 t60 t49 t37 t42 t50 t5 t83 t0 t35 t9 t94 t16 t50 t79 t53 t18 t54 t76 t63 t13 t83 t42 t46 t64 t18 t97 t2 t60 t5 t28 t32 t38 t16.\n\nWait, no, the string is given, so I need to parse it correctly.\n\nThe string is: t82 t36 t66 t12 t74 t25 t72 t25 t60 t49 t37 t42 t50 t5 t83 t0 t35 t9 t94 t16 t50 t79 t53 t18 t54 t76 t63 t13 t83 t42 t46 t64 t18 t97 t2 t60 t5 t28 t32 t38 t16.\n\nWait, but the grammar's start symbol is S, and each production for NT terms leads to either two NTs or terminators (like 't32', 't72', etc.). So, each 'tXY' must be matched by a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nFor example, 't82' must come from some NT X, where NT X \u2192 't82' is a production rule.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice some NTs producing terminals:\n\nNT59 \u2192 't35' (wait, no, looking back, the rules are a bit scattered. Wait, let me list the NTs and their terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't73'\n- NT85 (not listed in the provided rules, perhaps it's different)\nWait, let me re-examine the provided grammar to see all 'tXYZ' productions.\n\nThe grammar rules with the terminals are:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't73'\n- NT59 \u2192 't46' (Wait, no, looking back, in the list: NT27 \u2192 't7', but let's check again.\n\nWait, no, in the provided rules, I see several:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't46'?\nWait, let me go through each rule that ends with a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the rules, here are the ones that produce terminals:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't32'\n- NT83 \u2192 't41'\n- NT85...

Let's start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this case, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't12', 't2', etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The given string starts with t95 and ends with t96, so it's a sequence of these 't' terms. Each of these is likely from a production rule that ends with a terminal.\n\nLet me write out the steps the parser would take to generate the string, or alternatively, see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals expanding according to the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to reverse-engineer this. If each 't' is the result of a terminal production, then I can work backwards from the start symbol S and see if I can reach the string.\n\nLooking at S, it can go to NT61 NT59. So S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Then each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into the corresponding 't's in the string.\n\nLet's see the first few tokens in the string: t95, t46, t25... So I'll try to see which production leads to t95.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT95 \u2192 't94' and NT18 \u2192 't36', but also NT5 \u2192 't83'. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the rules given include:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't51' etc.\n\nWait, in the given rules, it's written as:\n\nLooking for 't95':\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT23 -> 't79'\n\nWait, is there a production for NT95? Let me check the given rules:\n\nWait, the rules provided include:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see a production where the left-hand side is NT95 and the right-hand side is 't95'. Hmm, perhaps 't95' is a typo, but let me check.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT17 -> 't48', NT29 -> 't62', NT48 -> 't97', etc. Also, NT18 \u2192 't36', NT5 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake. Let me double-check if there's a rule for NT95.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT23 -> 't79'\n\nWait, but wait, I see a production NT23 \u2192 't13', but for t95, there is no production given. Does that mean that some NT can produce 't95'? Let me check: looking through the list again.\n\nWait, let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking for any production that results in 't95':\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't94'\n\n- Other rules have 't95'? Checking... I don't see any rules where the LHS is 't95' as an output. Wait, perhaps 't95' is from some production, maybe NT95 is written as 't95'? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the given rules:\n\nHere's a rule: NT95 -> 't73'? No, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT2 -> 't64'\n\nNT31 -> 't54'\n\nNT57 -> 't17'\n\nNT78 -> 't56'\n\nNT20 -> 't73'\n\nNT7 -> 't19'\n\nNT77 -> 't79'\n\nNT68 -> 't83'\n\nNT14 -> 't48'\n\nNT18 -> 't66'\n\nNT20 -> 't37'\n\nNT52 -> 't42'\n\nNT31 -> 't54'\n\nNT72 -> 't30'\n\nNT58 -> 't95'\n\nAh! Here's a rule: NT58 \u2192 't95'. So the non-terminal NT58 produces 't95'.\n\nSo in the derivation, at some point, we'll have NT58 expanding into t95.\n\nLooking back, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So to produce the string, we need NT61 and NT59 to each produce a sequence of t's.\n\nNow, let's break down the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nLet's try to build the parse tree.\n\nThe string is: t95, t46, t25, t67, t25, t62, t99, t39, t87, t94, t54, t48, t33, t83, t96, t19, t28, t66, t65, t54, t12, t16, etc.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So NT61 and NT59 need to be expanded into sequences that match t95, t46, etc.\n\nSo let's expand NT61. Looking at NT61's production: NT61 \u2192 NT35 NT55.\n\nThen NT61: So NT35 \u2192 NT62 NT83.\n\nWait, let's build the tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see if the string can be decomposed by the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string is constructed by replacing non-terminals with terminals following the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to start building the string:\n\nStart with S.\n\nS expands to NT61 NT59. So the first two symbols should come from NT61 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the string: first is t95. Let's see if either NT61 or NT59 can produce t95.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't95', so that's one possibility. So if NT61 or NT59 can produce NT58, which in turn produces t95.\n\nLooking at NT61, it's rewritten as NT35 NT55.\n\nSo NT61 \u2192 NT35 NT55.\n\nNow, NT35: looking at the rules, NT35 \u2192 NT62 NT83.\n\nWait, but maybe NT35 is a non-terminal that can be further rewritten. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and NT61's first expansion is looking for a term that produces t95, which is NT58. So maybe NT61 can produce NT58? Let me see NT61's rules.\n\nLooking at NT61: It can be rewritten as NT35 NT55, as I mentioned. Alternatively, NT61 is also (perhaps?) rewritten by another rule, but in the given list, I only see NT61 \u2192 NT35 NT55.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to process each step.\n\nWait, let's take the string and see if it can be broken down. Let me consider the string is a sequence of t's: t95, t46, t25, t67, etc.\n\nSo let's attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nWe start with S, which is NT61 and NT59.\n\nFirst, NT61 must produce the first part of the string, and NT59 must produce the second part.\n\nSo let's process NT61 first.\n\nNT61 expands to NT35 NT55.\n\nNow, NT35 needs to produce t95. Looking at NT35's productions, we look through the given rules to see if any of them can reach 't95'. Looking through each rule, I notice that NT35's productions aren't given, which suggests that NT35 is a non-terminal that might have a production rule to other non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps NT35 is rewritten further until it becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, let's see the given rules:\n\nLooking for NT35:\n\nThe given rules don't directly include NT35, so likely, it's being rewritten using other rules. Alternatively, perhaps NT35 is defined in terms of other non-terminals. For example, perhaps NT35 \u2192 NT62 NT83, which is one of the rules.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nYes, rule NT35 is not present in the provided rules. So perhaps I missed it. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nWait, scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> NT32 NT72\n\n- NT32 -> NT18 NT65\n\n- NT17 -> ... etc.\n\nBut nowhere I see NT35 being rewritten. So maybe I'm mistaken, and NT35 is a terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-813","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Alright, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). In CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's good because it makes parsing and analysis a bit easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that it's quite extensive. There are a lot of non-terminals, and some of them have productions that lead to terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 't83' is a production that directly gives a terminal. So, the grammar definitely has both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of tokens, like 't37', 't73', etc. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe initial symbol in the grammar is S, which can produce either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So, the entire string must be derived starting from either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nThe string provided is quite long, with 41 tokens. Let's see how the structure might break down. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree will likely be a binary tree, with each node having exactly two children, and the leaves being terminal symbols.\n\nLet's think about the number of symbols in the string. Each production in CNF, except for the terminals, doubles the length. Starting from S, which is two non-terminals, each step either continues to grow the structure or terminates a subtree with a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, each production in CNF is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, each step in the derivation can either keep the count the same or increase it by one. But since S starts as two symbols, the total number of symbols (terminal plus non-terminal) will always be even when starting, but during derivation, it can vary.\n\nWait, that's not entirely accurate. Let me clarify. Each production is either two non-terminals (no terminals produced) or a terminal (which adds one terminal). But considering the entire derivation process, it might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the given string using the grammar, trying to find a derivation path from S to the string. That is, decompose the string into the non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for specific patterns or use the fact that each production in CNF has exactly two symbols to help break down the string.\n\nLet me examine the string: `t37 t73 t18 t0 t65 t42 t35 t32 t97 t64 t5 t36 t96 t73 t96 t66 t48 t51 t62 t33 t80 t3 t87 t36 t80 t86 t28 t51 t46 t46 t13 t18 t86 t53 t42 t67 t19 t76 t28 t63 t36 t35`.\n\nThat's 41 tokens. Let's note that 41 is an odd number. Each production in CNF either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals, so the leftmost derivation would build up symbols, combining non-terminals as per the rules. But let's think about the total number of symbols.\n\nIf we track the number of symbols during a leftmost derivation:\n\n- Starting with S, which is N + N (2 symbols).\n- Each time we replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the total number increases by 0 (since two non-terminals are added for each non-terminal consumed).\n- Each time a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, the total number increases by 1 (since we add one terminal and remove one non-terminal).\n\nHowever, this tracking seems complicated. Maybe another approach is to think about it as a tree. Each node has either two children (if it's a non-terminal) or is a leaf (if it's a terminal). The total number of leaves in the tree should be equal to twice the number of internal nodes plus one or something? Wait, perhaps not exactly, but for a tree with N leaves, the number of internal nodes is N-1. Hmm, but in this case, each internal node produces two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal). So, the total number of symbols in the string should be equal to 2^k, where k is the number of times we choose to expand non-terminals as two non-terminals.\n\nWait, that might not be correct because each expansion can also introduce terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the string length after full expansion would be a power of two. But in our case, the string is length 41, which is not a power of two (since 2^5=32, 2^6=64). So 41 is between 32 and 64, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything, especially since during the derivation, we can have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, leading to varying lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to see if the string can be represented as a binary tree with leftmost derivations matching the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by looking for the start production. S can be NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So, the string should correspond to one of these two possibilities. Let's check both cases.\n\nFirst, assume the string starts with NT61 and NT59. Then, the string would need to be a combination where the first part is derived from NT61 and the second part from NT59. Alternatively, if it's NT29 and NT9, then similar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's easier to try to decompose the string starting from S. Let's consider S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nThen, the entire string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT61 and NT59.\n\nSo, let me look at the string and see if I can split it into two parts that correspond to NT61 and NT59.\n\nBut how?\n\nNT61's production is: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.\n\nThen, NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72 and NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT27.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65 and NT72 \u2192 NT49 NT62.\n\nWait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try to look for known terminal sequences.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if any of the tokens can be directly found as left-hand sides of productions.\n\nFor example, looking for 't37'. In the grammar, does any production produce 't37'? Checking the provided rules, I see NT17 \u2192 't48', but I don't see 't37' appearing as a terminal. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules again to see if any of the non-terminals directly produce 't37'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT with a production that ends with t37. So, if 't37' is in the string, unless it's part of a larger structure, it might not be possible.\n\nBut let me check the productions again. Scanning through, I don't see any production that directly produces t37. So, perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains 't37' without a corresponding production.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the production rules.\n\nAlright, here's the entire list of productions:\n- NT68 \u2192 't83'\n- NT60 \u2192 't42'\n- NT5 \u2192 't18'\n- NT46 \u2192 't60'\n- NT67 \u2192 't53'\n- NT88 \u2192 't72'\n- NT14 \u2192 't2'\n- NT93 \u2192 't74'\n- NT15 \u2192 't47'\n- NT59 \u2192 't46'\n- NT29 \u2192 't62'\n- NT58 \u2192 't95'\n- NT9 \u2192 't18'\n- NT33 \u2192 't35'\n- NT17 \u2192 't48'\n- NT72 \u2192 't49'\n- NT56 \u2192 't9'\n- NT73 \u2192 't50'\n- NT66 \u2192 't95'\n- NT46 \u2192 't79'\n- NT68 \u2192 't83'\n- NT23 \u2192 't79'\n- NT20 \u2192 't64'\n- NT52 \u2192 't42'\n- NT31 \u2192 't54'\n- NT72 \u2192 't30'\n- NT58 \u2192 't95'\n- NT46 \u2192 't79'\n- NT63 \u2192 't63'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT27 \u2192 't7'\n- NT33 \u2192 't32'\n- NT32 \u2192 't18'\n- NT65 \u2192 't60'\n- NT10 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-857","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. Let me start by understanding what the grammar consists of.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, they all seem to be binary productions, which means each production splits a non-terminal into two other symbols. Chomsky normal form requires productions to be either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So all the rules here fit that because they don't have epsilons and every right-hand side has exactly two symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. Each token like t5, t80, etc., is a terminal. So I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of production steps.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the grammar rules for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo initially, S will split into either NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9. Let me see what the string starts with. The first token is t5, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, there's a rule where NT5 directly produces 't5' (NT5 \u2192 't5'), but wait, NT5 is a non-terminal, right? So perhaps I need to look for where NT5 is part of a production.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. The grammar has rules where some NTs produce other NTs, and some produce terminals. So for example, NT59 \u2192 't94'. But in the string, the first token is t5. Let's see if there's a production for NT5 that produces 't5'. Looking through the list, yes: NT5 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with NT5 \u2192 't5'. But wait, the start symbol produces S, which is two non-terminals. So maybe the starting split is either NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9. But the string starts with t5, so maybe the initial split is S \u2192 NT59 followed by something else, because NT59 might produce 't94' or other things.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the NT59 rule: S \u2192 NT59, and NT59 can produce 't94' (from rule NT59 \u2192 't94'). Also, looking elsewhere, is there any production for NT59? For instance, in NT58? Wait, no, NT58's rule is NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23. NT59 is only a terminal here.\n\nBut wait, looking at the list, there's a rule NT5 \u2192 't5'. So maybe the start symbol's first production S \u2192 NT59 't59' would result in NT59, which perhaps can produce t94. But that's not matching our string's first token, which is t5.\n\nAlternatively, let's think differently. Perhaps the string can be broken down into parts where each part corresponds to a production rule.\n\nLet me consider the string: t5 t80 t28 t9 t25 t41 t42 t3 t94 t3 t9 t37 t28 t54 t96 t30 t94 t36 t48 t33 t51 t86 t19 t19 t87 t87 t25 t18 t9 t83 t39 t74 t18 t67 t41 t13 t99 t87 t18 t80 t65 t94 t41 t65.\n\nI need to see if each segment corresponds to a production step. Let's see:\n\n- The first symbol is t5. Looking at the grammar, NT5 \u2192 't5'. So this could be the result of a production like NT5 \u2192 t5.\n\nBut the start symbol S must be expanded into two non-terminals. So perhaps S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Then, NT61 and NT59 would each have to end up producing the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nWait, but how does that fit? Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t5, so let's think that the first NT5 \u2192 t5. So the remaining string would be t80 t28 t9 t25 t41 t42 t3 t94 t3 t9 t37 t28 t54 t96 t30 t94 t36 t48 t33 t51 t86 t19 t19 t87 t87 t25 t18 t9 t83 t39 t74 t18 t67 t41 t13 t99 t87 t18 t80 t65 t94 t41 t65.\n\nNow, the next symbol in the string is t80. Looking at the grammar, what non-terminals produce 't80'? Looking through the list, is there any production where NT \u2192 't80'? I don't see any. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me scan through the grammar rules again.\n\nHmm, looking through the rules, I see NT61 \u2192 't36'. NT74 \u2192 't74'. Wait, but no NT that produces 't80' directly. So perhaps the production is a combination of non-terminals leading to 't80'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a for terminals. So, to get a terminal like t80, it must be the result of a single rule where some NT produces 't80'.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any rule where NT80 is defined as a terminal. So perhaps 't80' is the result of combining two non-terminals into a terminal, but in our grammar, that doesn't happen. The rules only produce terminals when a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built using a mix of NTs and terminals, but in this grammar, only certain NTs produce terminals. So let me look again at the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT that produces a terminal other than 't5', 't94', 't41', etc. Let me see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t18 (Wait, no, NT9 is not a terminal. Let me check: looking for 't' followed by a number, i.e., t5, t80, etc.)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 t5. Let's check others:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t5\n- NT59 \u2192 t94\n- NT58 \u2192 t95\n- NT15 \u2192 t96 (Wait, no, looking at the list, for example, 'NT5 \u2192 't5', 'NT59 \u2192 't94', 'NT61 \u2192 't36'', 'NT65 \u2192 't67'', etc. Wait, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal productions.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, the right-hand sides are either non-terminals or terminals. So let me list all the NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nSo, collect all the rules where the RHS is a terminal:\n\n1.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing a bit easier.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string: \n\nString: `t5 t41 t94 t28 t66 t64 t30 t64 t51 t64 t19 t3 t87 t39 t5 t3 t63 t36 t42 t51 t83 t99 t67 t25 t19 t54 t60 t66 t63 t16 t99 t99 t72 t42 t83 t86 t13 t60 t48 t67 t28 t83 t28 t76`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a sequence of t's followed by numbers. The grammar has some terminals, like 't5', 't41', etc., which are actually parts of the string. Some non-terminals produce these terminals. For example, NT65 can produce t67, and NT26 can produce t42.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to expand it step by step to see if we can derive the given string. Alternatively, maybe I can parse the string using the grammar's productions, reducing symbols as I go.\n\nBut manually doing a full parse might be time-consuming. Instead, I can look for patterns or see if each token in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet's list all the terminals in the string and see where they appear in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals seem to be:\n\nt5, t41, t94, t28, t66, t64, t30, t51, t19, t3, t87, t39, t99, t25, t72, t42, t36, t83, t9, t63, t36, t42, t83, t28, t76, t2, t8, t33, t16, etc.\n\nWait, but the string is split into individual tokens separated by spaces. That makes it easier; each token is a separate element.\n\nWait, I need to check each token in the string to see if it's present in the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions, or if it's a terminal derived from a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate the string.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if each step of the string can be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t5. Looking back at the grammar, what non-terminals produce t5?\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT5 -> t95, NT5 -> t5 (from line 8). Also, NT65 -> t67, and others. Wait, let me check all lines where a terminal is on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT65 has t79 and t65, but wait no, line 15 says NT5 -> t5? Wait, no. Looking back: line 15 is NT5 -> t83.

Wait, no, each line is a production rule. For example, line 1 is S -> NT61 NT65. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, the grammar is given with the production rules, each starting with the left-hand side (e.g., S -> ..., then NT47 -> ..., etc.). Each production has a left-hand side (like S or NT47) and a right-hand side that is a sequence of symbols, which can be terminals (with '!'?) or non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the production rules are written as:\n\nNT61 NT65: I think perhaps the productions are written with dots or commas, but looking carefully, I think it's S-> NT61 NT65, etc. Wait, maybe each production is written as A -> B C, where B and C can be other non-terminals (like numbers, I think the numbers like NT61 are non-terminals), or terminals, perhaps indicated by a slash or something. Wait, the way the grammar is written in the provided data isn't entirely clear. Wait, in the provided grammar, it's written as:\n\nFor example,\n\nS -> NT61 NT65\nS -> NT29 NT9\nAnd so on. But then, in the middle, we have NT93 -> 't54', which seems to indicate that the RHS is a terminal 't54'.\n\nWait, perhaps in the provided grammar, the non-terminals are represented by numbers, and terminals are indicated with a slash or perhaps as strings starting with 't'.\n\nLooking at the lines, some RHS are written as 't12', 't54', etc. For example, line 20: NT79 -> NT36 NT52 is a production, but some lines end with a slash or a 't' followed by digits.\n\nWait, looking at line 13: NT68 -> 't42'. So the RHS is a terminal 't42'. So, to clarify, each production's RHS can be a non-terminal (as another NT number), or a terminal (starting with 't' followed by numbers).\n\nTherefore, in the grammar, all non-terminals start with 'NT' followed by a number, and terminals are those that start with 't' followed by more characters.\n\nSo, the terminals in the string are all the tokens that have a 't' followed by numbers.\n\nNow, for each token in the string, we need to see if it can be matched by some production's RHS.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string step by step, applying the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the string:\n\nt5 t41 t94 t28 t66 t64 t30 t64 t51 t64 t19 t3 t87 t39 t5 t3 t63 t36 t42 t51 t83 t99 t67 t25 t19 t54 t60 t66 t63 t16 t99 t99 t72 t42 t83 t86 t13 t60 t48 t67 t28 t83 t28 t76.\n\nFirst, the entire string is a sequence of tokens, which are all terminals (none are 'S' or 'NT', as they are just part of the string). So we have to see if the string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can try to find a way to derive the entire string by combining the productions. This might be time-consuming, but let's attempt a few steps.\n\nLooking for the starting symbol S.

{"custom_id":"request-878","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars use production rules to derive strings, starting from the start symbol, usually S. The grammar provided has S and various non-terminals like NT15, NT29, etc., with production rules that split them into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals (like 'tX' where X are numbers).\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the string: `t32 t30 t0 t28 t46 t9 t42 t2 t53 t74 t66 t51 t49 t19 t87 t80 t80 t74 t73 t30 t18 t94 t49 t12 t67 t66 t66 t94 t99 t0 t12 t12 t50 t12 t99 t25 t51 t18 t0 t42 t65 t3 t72 t76 t95`. That's a long one with 41 tokens.\n\nNow, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I recall has production rules that either produce a terminal or two non-terminals. Each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Also, start symbol S is the only non-terminal here, but looking at the rules, I see other non-terminals like NT2, NT3, etc.\n\nI think the strategy is to parse the string using these production rules. Since each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must be built up by replacing non-terminals with these options until only terminals remain.\n\nBut how do I approach this? Maybe I can try to use a recursive descent parser or simulating the parse.\n\nWait, another thought: the string has 41 tokens, which might suggest the length of the string is related to the number of steps needed to derive it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for possible paths through the grammar that can produce the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't32'. I check the grammar rules to see if any production ends with NT32. Scanning through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't3' (but we have 't32' so not matching)\n- Looking through all non-terminals, perhaps NT24? Wait, no. Hmm, maybe NT23 is part of a production that can lead to 't32'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all the rules where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that could produce a terminal equal to one of the 'tX' in the string.\n\nLooking at the production rules where the RHS starts with 't', like:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (so 't5')\n- NT9 \u2192 't18'\n- NT10 \u2192 't96'\n- NT19 \u2192 't9'\n- NT24 \u2192 't2' or 't39'\n- NT33 \u2192 't32' and 't79'\n- NT35 \u2192 't35' (but I don't see that in the string)\n- NT46 \u2192 't60' and 't48'\n- NT55 \u2192 't19'\n- NT58 \u2192 't95'\n- NT65 \u2192 't36' and 't60'\n- NT67 \u2192 't53' and 't94' etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't32', I see that NT33 \u2192 't32' and also NT33 \u2192 't79'. Also, NT83 \u2192 't66' and 't68' is also producing tX.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't32', which would have to come from NT33. So, the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59 (from the given grammar)\nThen, each of these NTs would need to produce the corresponding parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should try expanding S into NT61 and NT59, then each of those needs to produce sequences.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\nThe first part after t32 is t30, t0, t28, etc. I'm a bit overwhelmed. Maybe a better approach is to consider the entire string and see if it can be divided into parts that correspond to the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree starting from S. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t32 t30 t0 t28 t46 t9 t42 t2 t53 t74 t66 t51 t49 t19 t87 t80 t80 t74 t73 t30 t18 t94 t49 t12 t67 t66 t66 t94 t99 t0 t12 t12 t50 t12 t99 t25 t51 t18 t0 t42 t65 t3 t72 t76 t95\n\nHmm, 41 tokens. That's a lot. Let's see if I can find any patterns or repeated sequences.\n\nWait, let me see if each of these t tokens corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar that can produce that t. For example, 't32' comes from NT33, as I saw earlier. So that's one possibility.\n\nBut before that, S must expand into two non-terminals, each of which expands further until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, but the entire string must be built by expanding S using the given rules. So perhaps I can break down the string into parts that align with the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the 'tX' in the string and see which NTs can produce them:\n\nt32 \u2192 NT33\nt30 \u2192 NT93\nt0 \u2192 NT19 or NT2\nt28 \u2192 NT18 (since NT18 is 't28')\nt46 \u2192 NT62\nt9 \u2192 NT9 (from NT9 \u2192 't18')\nt42 \u2192 NT9 is producing 't18' but wait, NT42 is another non-terminal. Looking back, NT5 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't18', etc.\n\nWait, no, let me check NT42. Looking through the grammar, NT42 is not listed directly, but perhaps it's derived from something else.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT42 is mentioned: NT42 \u2192 't42'? Or maybe it's a terminal. Wait, looking at the production rules, for example, NT5 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, looking through the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't2' or 't39'\n- NT58 \u2192 't95'\n- etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for each 'tX' and see if any NT rule produces it.\n\nt32: NT33 \u2192 t32\nt30: NT6 \u2192 't74' Wait, no. Wait, other NTs: NT93 \u2192 't74', so perhaps 't30' is produced by NT93.\n\nWait, let me list all the 'tX's and possible NTs that can produce them:\n\nt32 \u2192 NT33 \u2192 't32' \u2192 yes\nt30 \u2192 NT93 \u2192 't74' No, wait, NT93 \u2192 't74'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the rules: NT93 \u2192 't74', because in the given grammar, it says NT93 \u2192 't74'. So t30 is not covered by that.\n\nWait, perhaps t30 is from NT54? Let me check: NT54 \u2192 't51' (from the rules, NT55 \u2192 't5' and NT54 \u2192 't64'? No, looking again:\n\nWait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't36' or 't60' (rules: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 or \u2192 't36'). Hmm, no.\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT17 NT28. Then NT17 \u2192 't9', NT28 \u2192 't63' (if any). Wait, if NT54 can produce 't64' as per one of the rules: NT54 \u2192 't64'. Yes, according to the rules: NT54 \u2192 't64'.\n\nSo t30 is not produced directly by a single rule, unless it's part of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to create a parse tree and see if the string matches.\n\nBut that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Chomsky normal form means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar is context-free.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the given string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a series of 't' words: t33, t35, t3, etc. My goal is to see if the string can be parsed according to the grammar rules.\n\nI'll start by noting that the start symbol is S, which produces NT61 NT59. So, the string should start with symbols that can eventually derive to t33 and t35, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, looking at the grammar, the NT symbols are all non-terminals except for some that become 't' with numbers, which are terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is in the form of A->BC or A->a. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, which are 't' followed by numbers. So, each terminal must be produced exactly once in the derivation.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t33. I see in the grammar that t33 is produced from NT33. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT33 appears in production rules. Let me look: NT33 -> NT32 NT72. So, NT33 can be split into NT32 and NT72. Then, NT32 may have other productions, and so on.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t33, which is a terminal, meaning that NT33 must directly produce t33 in the derivation. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT33 can be produced as NT32 NT72, but I also see that NT33 -> NT32 NT72 is one of the productions. Now, looking for t33 in the grammar, I see that NT33 can't directly produce 't33' because in the grammar, every production for NT33 is NT32 NT72, so to get t33, that would require that one of the non-terminals in the chain eventually produces t33.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. No, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal must be generated directly by a production rule. So, for example, the production NT33 -> 't33' would mean that NT33 can produce that terminal. Let me check the grammar.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT33 appears in a few rules:\n\n- NT60 -> NT68 NT52\n- NT58 -> NT66 NT23\n- NT23 -> 't79', 't13', 't3', etc.\n- NT33 appears as parts of other non-terminals, but do I see any rule where BT33 is a terminal? \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see under NT33:\n\n- NT33 -> NT32 NT72\n- I also see that under NT23, it can produce 't79', 't13', 't3', etc. Wait, does any non-terminal directly produce t33? Let me check.\n\nLooking for 't33' in the grammar, I see that in the rules, under NT83, NT16, etc., not directly. But in the end, for example, NT16 is not a terminal, so I'm not seeing a production where a non-terminal directly outputs t33.\n\nWait, but in the grammar's last rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't3' (yes, that's one of the options), and also 't79', 't13', and others. But not t33.\n\nWait, let me look again. Under NT23, the productions are:\n\n- NT23 -> 't13', 't3', 't24', 't19', 't9', 't39', 't37', etc. Wait, does any of these include t33? No, I think 't3' is one. So, is there a rule where a non-terminal can produce 't33'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar's rules, under NT56, for example, one of the productions is NT56 -> 't97'. NT23 is another non-terminal, but in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't79', 't13', 't3', 't48', 't97', 't49', etc., but not 't33'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through all NT's to see if 't33' is a terminal for any of them.\n\nLooking through the rules in the grammar:\n\n- NT32: under the rules, I see NT32 -> 't18', 't65', 't32'. So, t32 is a terminal.\n\n- NT83: under rules, NT83 can produce 't66', 't8'.\n\nWait, wait, looking more carefully:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT83, yes, I see: NT83 -> 't66', 't8'\u2014so t8 is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps for t33, I need to look deeper. Let me see if any NT directly ends with t33.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any NT directly producing t33. The only NT producing t32 is NT32: NT32 -> 't18', 't65', 't32'. So t32 is a terminal produced by NT32.\n\nBut for the string's first token, t33. So, if the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that directly produces t33, then t33 cannot appear as a terminal in the string. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Did I miss any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t33?\n\nLooking through all the rules... Wait, in the very first part of the grammar, under NT60: NT60 -> NT68 NT52, but that's for NT60. I don't see NT33 in the top-level start symbols, so it's a derived symbol.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT61 NT59. Then, each of those non-terminals can split into more NTs and eventually terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t33. So, to derive t33, there must be a production rule that allows some NT to produce it.\n\nLooking through all NT rules, do any produce t33? Let me check.\n\nNT33: from the grammar:\n\n- NT33 -> NT32 NT72 (no terminal)\n- Also, looking elsewhere, is there any NT production that includes t33?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT23: does it produce any 't33'? Wait, under NT23, the productions are:\n\nNT23 -> 't3', 't13', 't24', 't19', 't9', 't39', 't37', 't75'\n\nWait, I think in NT23, 't23' is one option, not 't33'. Hmm.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me see if any NT produces 't33' directly.\n\nLooking through all the production rules for NTs, let's see:\n\n- NT60: produces 't65' and 't49', etc. Not t33.\n- NT58: 't66', 't23'\u2014no.\n- NT32: 't18', 't65', 't32'\u2014so not t33.\n- NT93: 't72', 't83'\u2014no.\n- NT29: 't62', 't86'\u2014no.\n- NT36: 't6', 't78'\u2014no.\n- NT37: 't18', 't66'\u2014no.\n- NT46: 't97'\u2014no.\n- NT56: 't97'\u2014no.\n- NT67: 't57', 't14'\u2014no.\n- NT62: 't52', 't83'\u2014no.\n- NT60: as above.\n- NT33: doesn't produce t33 directly. So, if the grammar doesn't have a rule where any non-terminal directly produces 't33', then the string containing 't33' as the first token can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's derived indirectly. Let me think: can any NT eventually derive to 't33' through some chain.\n\nWait, for NT33, let's see. Starting from S, which is NT61 NT59.\n\nNT61 can produce NT33 NT55.

The string is a sequence of symbols starting with 't' and ending with 't16'. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is where each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Since this grammar is given in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a symbol with either a terminal pair or two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT61 NT59. Each of these non-terminals is further broken down into other non-terminals or terminals. I see some non-terminals that eventually resolve to 't' symbols. My goal is to see if the string can be constructed by expanding S through these rules.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the string. It starts with 't3', so I need to see which non-terminal can produce 't3'. Looking through the rules, I notice NT42 has production 't' followed by other symbols.

Let's scan the production rules:\n\n- NT13 is part of the string, and looking at the rules, NT13 isn't listed, so that's strange. The string has 't13', but there's no rule for NT13, which is problematic. Wait, no, the string includes 't13' as part of 't62 t73 t13 t50', but wait, let me check the string again.\n\nWait, the string is: `t3 t74 t76 t37 t46 t51 t5 t39 t96 t86 t67 t53 t46 t60 t63 t12 t64 t73 t95 t42 t60 t66 t94 t32 t76 t87 t97 t5 t41 t73 t65 t2 t46 t36 t5 t35 t96 t5 t30 t39 t72 t46 t16 t79 t62 t64`.\n\nSo, looking at each 'tX' segment. For example, NT86 has 't94', so t94 is a terminal. Let me check which non-terminals produce 't' terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT5: sometimes 't5', sometimes 't83' or 't51', etc.\n- NT6: sometimes 't74', 't19', 't25', etc.\n- NT20: sometimes 't37', 't73', etc.\n- NT13: Wait, there's no production for NT13 in the rules. Similarly, looking for each 'tX' in the string:\n\nLet me list all 'tX' segments and see which rules produce them:\n\n1. t3: Looking for rules producing 3. Does any NT have 't3'? Yes, NT63 is 't32', which is 32. Wait, maybe I need to think of each 't' followed by a number. Let me check the productions:\n\n- NT2: sometimes 't64'\n- NT20: sometimes 't37', 't73' etc.\n- NT23: sometimes 't3', 't13', etc. Wait, in the string, there's 't3 t74...', so 't3' is next. Looking at the rules, NT23 has 't3'. For example, NT23 is defined as NT52 NT73, but also, from the rules, NT23 has both 't3' and 't13'. So NT23 can produce 't3' or 't13'.\n\nBut in the string, after t73 is t62, which is part of the symbol 't62 t73 t13'. Wait, no, in the string, the part is 't73 t95 t42 ...', which might correspond to NT62 being 't73 t95', and other rules.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is 't3'. So the starting symbol S must generate a sequence that starts with 't3'. Let's see:\n\nS -> NT61 NT59\nEach of these NTs will produce something. Let's take NT61 first.\n\nLooking at NT61: The only rule is NT61 -> NT33 NT55. So NT61 needs to be expanded into two non-terminals.\n\nEach of these, NT33 and NT55, are production rules. Let me check:\n\nNT33 -> NT32 NT72\nNT32 -> NT18 NT65\nSo NT33 becomes NT32 followed by NT72, which then becomes NT18 followed by 65, then NT18 becomes NT9 followed by NT53.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me instead consider the string and see how it can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to parse the string starting from the end. Let me see if the string can be derived by starting from S.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for any rule that starts with some 't's, or can lead to the given symbols.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3, which can come from NT23's 't3' rule. So if S can eventually lead to NT23, which then can produce 't3'.\n\nBut looking back, S is NT61 NT59. Both NT61 and NT59 must produce sequences that, when combined, form part of the string.\n\nWait, let's check if any of these can lead to 't3':\n\n- NT61's first production is NT33 NT55, which is two non-terminals.\n- NT59 has several productions, like NT23 NT96, which could produce 't3' followed by something else.\n\nLet me see: S can become NT59... Let's take that path first.\n\nNT59 can produce NT23 NT96, and NT23 can produce 't3' directly. So that might give us the initial 't3'.\n\nSo, let's assume:\n\nS -> NT59 NT61\n\nWait, no, S must expand as NT61 NT59, so it's NT61 followed by NT59.\n\nWait, no, S is defined as NT61 NT59, so S expands into NT61 NT59. So both must produce sequences that when concatenated form the first part of the string.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't3', which is from NT59's rule NT23 NT96. But wait, NT59's productions include NT23 NT96, and NT23 can produce 't3' or 't13'.\n\nWait, this is getting tangled. Let's try to make a parse tree step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT9 NT53\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT68 NT52\n\nNT68 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't42'\n\nSo NT68 is 't83' and NT52 is 't42'. So NT18 \u2192 't83' 't42'. Therefore, NT32 \u2192 't83' 't42' 't65' ?\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65.\n\nThen NT18 \u2192 't83' 't42'. NT65 \u2192 't32' or 't32 NT...'?\n\nWait, no. Looking back, NT65 has multiple productions:\n\nFrom the rules: NT65 -> NT71 NT65, NT65 -> NT10 NT96, or NT65 -> NT6 NT60.\n\nWait, this seems like NT65 can produce 't32' directly. Looking at the rules, yes, under NT65: NT36 NT65 and NT10 NT96, etc. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look at NT65's productions:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60\n\nBut none of these directly produce a 't'. Wait, unless one leads to a 't' through further expansions. Alternatively, maybe NT65 can be linked"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-897","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I'll look at the grammar to understand how the string can be derived. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and possibly symbols on the right. \n\nThe string to check is: t50 t30 t97 t48 t96 t25 t32 t12 t60 t94 t48 t53 t49 t33 t46 t54 t79 t19 t18 t60 t87 t54 t36 t38 t64 t60 t33 t32 t62 t73 t35 t54 t49 t39 t49 t9 t39 t66 t9 t50 t16 t16 t87 t62 t86 t19.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some NT rules produce terminal symbols. For instance, NT68 is directly 't83' and NT60 is 't94'. I think I need to track how these terminals combine as the string is built.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which is defined as NT61 NT59. So the entire string must start with the symbols generated by NT61 and NT59. Looking at the string, it begins with 't50', so maybe NT61 produces 't50' or leads into a production that eventually results in 't50'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT61 -> NT33 NT55. Then NT33 can be further broken down. NT33 can lead to 't79' or other non-terminals. Hmm, it's a bit complex. Maybe I should look for how 't50' is generated.\n\nIn the grammar, NT71 -> NT52 NT96, and NT52 -> 't42'. Maybe 't50' is generated through other paths. Alternatively, NT56 -> 't9' and other symbols. It seems like each non-terminal leads to a combination of other symbols until we reach terminals.\n\nI realize that each step must produce more terminals until the string is fully expanded. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each initial non-terminal in the S production (NT61 and NT59) must derive to produce all parts of the string.\n\nMaybe I should look at how the first few terminals are generated. Let's say S starts with NT61. So NT61 -> NT33 NT55. Now NT33 can produce 't79' or 't32', which would start the string. But the string starts with 't50', so that's not matching. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong initial splits.\n\nWait, perhaps S starts with NT61 producing through NT61 -> NT53 NT65. Then NT53? I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use a different approach, like checking if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar nodes.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal seems to correspond to specific non-terminals. For example, NT68 -> 't83' and NT60 -> 't94'. The string starts with 't50', 't30', etc., so I need to find a path from S to these terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from S and trying to match the string:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59 \n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT79 or 't79'?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT33 can go to 't79' or 't32'. But the string starts with 't50', so maybe NT33 leads to 't79' and then other steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT59 is responsible for generating the initial 't50'? Let me check NT59. NT59 \u2192 NT2 NT66? Then NT2 leads to 't64' or another path. Hmm, this isn't adding up.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should list the terminals and see if they can be generated by any non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 -> 't19', which appears in the string near the end. NT55 produces 't19', so that's a match.\n\nNT5 leads to 't5', which is 't5' in the middle of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be produced by a leftmost derivation from the start symbol.\n\nLet me try to split the string into parts that might correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nBut manually parsing such a long string is time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if all the terminals are covered in the grammar and if their counts and order make sense.\n\nWait, looking at the string, how many 't50's are there? Let me count:\n\nt50 appears as the first, then later at position x. Counting: starting from 0:\n\n0: t50\n\nThen later:\n\npos 27: t50\n\nSo t50 appears twice.\n\nIn the grammar, NT71 -> NT52 NT96. NT52 is 't42', and NT96 is 't12'. So NT71 produces 't42 t12'. Does that help?\n\nAlternatively, NT71 -> NT47 NT29. NT47 -> 't73' and NT29 can lead to 't62'. So that could produce 't73 t62'? I don't know.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's easier to see if each terminal can be derived from some non-terminal and that the string can be built by combining these steps.\n\nAnother approach: Since the string has a lot of terminals, each non-terminal must eventually produce a sequence of terminals that matches parts of the string.\n\nLet me consider the first few steps. Start with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\n\nNow, NT61 is split into NT33 NT55.\n\nNT33 can produce 't79' or 't32'. The string starts with 't50', which isn't 't79' or 't32', so this path seems wrong. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, the original S is NT61 NT59, so perhaps that path is not correct. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT61 NT59\n\nSo S must produce NT61 followed by NT59.\n\nThen, NT61 is NT33 NT55\n\nNT33 is either 't79' or NT33 can lead to other NTs.\n\nBut the string starts with 't50', which isn't 't79', so perhaps I need to explore a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps NT33 can lead into another path that eventually becomes 't50'.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, NT33: does it have production to NT6 and NT72? No, in the provided grammar, I think it goes to NT32, but wait no, checking the user's grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, under NT33: NT33 -> NT32 NT72. NT32 -> NT18 NT65. NT18 -> 't36'. NT65 can produce 't6', 't60', or 't32'.\n\nWait, so NT33 leads to 't72'? Because NT72 could produce 't74' or 't30'. Hmm, but 't50' isn't among them.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all NT productions to see which non-terminals produce 't50's.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't50':\n\nIn the grammar:\n\n- NT60 -> 't94'\n\n- NT52 -> 't42'\n\n- NT31 -> 't54'\n\n- NT93 -> 't94'\n\n- NT55 -> 't19'\n\n- NT59 -> 't5'\n\n- NT47 -> 't73'\n\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n\n- NT24 -> 't2'\n\nSo 't50' doesn't appear directly in any NT production. Wait, but the string has 't50' twice.\n\nIs there a rule that somehow produces 't50'? Or perhaps 't50' is an intermediate step that I'm missing. Looking through the grammar, none of the right-hand sides have 't50'. So that suggests that maybe the grammar doesn't produce 't50' at all, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, 't50' is present as a production? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't19'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't18'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT39 \u2192 't9'\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, I don't see any NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Non-terminals are the ones with arrows pointing to other symbols, like S, N, and various NT followed by numbers. The terminals are the ones that appear in the string, like 't63', 't64', etc. I notice that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, which can help in breaking down the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't63' and ends with 't96 t19'. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation trees will be binary, so the string length should be a power of two or something similar. Wait, no, in CNF, the number of symbols in the string should be a power of two because each production splits into two non-terminals, leading to a derivation length that's exponential. Let me check: the given string has 63 tokens. 2^6 is 64, so 63+1 is 64. Hmm, 63 is one less than 64. But I think in this case, the string could be 64 tokens, but it's given as 63; maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed assuming that the string is correct.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, 't63'. Let me see which production generates 't63'. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT28 produces 't63'. So, the first part of the string must start with NT28. Therefore, the first step would be S -> NT28 NT99. But wait, looking back, the grammar shows S -> NT29 NT9, so that might not be directly applicable. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider how the string could be split into the initial production.\n\nWait, S is the start symbol, so the entire string should derive from S. Let me check which production starts with S. The grammar starts with S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9. So, the string must start with either NT61 or NT29 as the first two symbols, or as a combination.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't63'. From the grammar, NT63 doesn't seem to be a terminal. Wait, no, the terminals are those that are directly written out as 'txx'. So, for example, NT28 -> 't63'. So, the first two symbols 't63' 't64' would correspond to two derived symbols that produce those terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two, the string can be built up by recursively splitting it into two parts, each generating a non-terminal.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can parse the string from the start by trying to match the longest possible production. Alternatively, I can use the recursive approach of checking if the string can be split into two parts, each of which is generated by some non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\n1. The string is: t63 t64 t3 t13 t9 t65 t48 t72 t99 t63 t30 t38 t38 t66 t86 t28 t66 t35 t51 t32 t64 t74 t54 t50 t18 t82 t25 t87 t87 t87 t97 t82 t35 t39 t38 t64 t35 t18 t74 t3 t54 t5 t86 t5 t16 t96 t19.\n\nIt's a long string, so perhaps I can split it into two parts and see if each part can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nThe entire string is 63 tokens. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me count the symbols again. Let me list them:\n\n1. t63\n2. t64\n3. t3\n4. t13\n5. t9\n6. t65\n7. t48\n8. t72\n9. t99\n10. t63\n11. t30\n12. t38\n13. t38\n14. t66\n15. t86\n16. t28\n17. t66\n18. t35\n19. t51\n20. t32\n21. t64\n22. t74\n23. t54\n24. t50\n25. t18\n26. t82\n27. t25\n28. t87\n29. t87\n30. t87\n31. t97\n32. t82\n33. t35\n34. t39\n35. t38\n36. t64\n37. t35\n38. t18\n39. t74\n40. t3\n41. t54\n42. t5\n43. t86\n44. t5\n45. t16\n46. t96\n47. t19\n\nWait, that's 47 symbols? I thought it was 63. Maybe I counted wrong earlier. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the string: The string is written as a series of 't' followed by two digits. Let me split it correctly.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt63 t64 t3 t13 t9 t65 t48 t72 t99 t63 t30 t38 t38 t66 t86 t28 t66 t35 t51 t32 t64 t74 t54 t50 t18 t82 t25 t87 t87 t87 t97 t82 t35 t39 t38 t64 t35 t18 t74 t3 t54 t5 t86 t5 t16 t96 t19.\n\nEach space separates symbols, so let me count them:\n\n1. t63\n2. t64\n3. t3\n4. t13\n5. t9\n6. t65\n7. t48\n8. t72\n9. t99\n10. t63\n11. t30\n12. t38\n13. t38\n14. t66\n15. t86\n16. t28\n17. t66\n18. t35\n19. t51\n20. t32\n21. t64\n22. t74\n23. t54\n24. t50\n25. t18\n26. t82\n27. t25\n28. t87\n29. t87\n30. t87\n31. t97\n32. t82\n33. t35\n34. t39\n35. t38\n36. t64\n37. t35\n38. t18\n39. t74\n40. t3\n41. t54\n42. t5\n43. t86\n44. t5\n45. t16\n46. t96\n47. t19\n\nSo the string has 47 symbols, an odd number. That's problematic because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production splits into two, leading to derivations where each step increases the number of symbols by one. So, the number of symbols should be a power of two, but 47 is not. This might indicate that the string can't be generated, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the counting is off, but looking again, the string is written with 47 symbols. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at the string, it's written as a single line, so each 't' followed by two digits is a symbol. Let me count the number of 't's followed by two digits.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt63 t64 t3 t13 t9 t65 t48 t72 t99 t63 t30 t38 t38 t66 t86 t28 t66 t35 t51 t32 t64 t74 t54 t50 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-918","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF is. CNF is a form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and 'a' is a terminal symbol. In this grammar, the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) can be two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the rules have the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz, which seems typical of CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, which is a start symbol producing two non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals further breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of tokens like t13, t80, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules. Since this might get complex, I need a systematic approach.\n\nOne method is to work backwards from the string, trying to match the productions in reverse. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string step by step using the rules. Let's consider the string:\n\nt13 t80 t13 t96 t51 t94 t53 t79 t49 t63 t5 t76 t48 t76 t9 t50 t73 t2 t2 t50 t49 t38 t36 t16 t39 t13 t36 t95 t19 t99 t18 t16 t62 t60 t74 t86 t73 t51 t12 t46 t35 t16 t9 t46 t33 t25 t63.\n\nEach token is a terminal (like t13, t2, etc.), and the non-terminals are labeled with numbers, like NT13, NT20, etc.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the parse should replace a single non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in two steps, it should reduce appropriately). So, to parse the string, I probably need to build a parse tree starting from the root S and see if the leaves match the string.\n\nHowever, manually doing this for such a long string would be time-consuming, so maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be divided into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their productions to see which strings they can generate.\n\nFor example, starting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT61 and NT59. Each of these might further expand.\n\nLooking at NT61, it has a production NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then NT33 might have more productions, like NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72 or NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22, and so on.\n\nThis seems complicated, but I notice that some of the terminal symbols are appearing multiple times in the string, and perhaps they correspond to certain non-terminal productions.\n\nBut wait, the terminal symbols are all of the form 't' followed by a number, like t13, t80, etc. Some of these, like t12, t2, t86, are given as terminals in the grammar directly.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see that some rules have the form NTxx \u2192 'txxx'. So, for example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\n\nAnd so on. So, if a non-terminal like NT68 appears in the parse, it can be replaced directly by 't16' in one step.\n\nSo the strategy could be to find in the string where any of these terminals appear, check if they correspond to such replacements, and then see if the surrounding non-terminals can be reduced accordingly.\n\nLooking at the string, let's break it down token by token:\n\nt13 t80 t13 t96 t51 t94 t53 t79 t49 t63 t5 t76 t48 t76 t9 t50 t73 t2 t2 t50 t49 t38 t36 t16 t39 t13 t36 t95 t19 t99 t18 t16 t62 t60 t74 t86 t73 t51 t12 t46 t35 t16 t9 t46 t33 t25 t63.\n\nI'll start by identifying any terminal that is replaced by a single terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the 't's:\n\n- t12: Only appears in NT6 \u2192 't74', but wait, NT6 is mapped to 't74'. So if in the string there is a 't12', it must come from a production where NT67 \u2192 't12' or something? Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the rules are given, and I see:\n\nNT60 \u2192 't68'\n\nBut looking through the entire list, I don't see a terminal 't12'. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't39'\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the top of the grammar, I see rules like:\n\nNT60 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, let me check the list more carefully.\n\nIn the grammar, the terminals are defined as:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't83'\n\nWait, some rules have 'tX' as terminals. Looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't59'? No, wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules. Let me scan through them:\n\nYes, there are several rules where non-terminals are replaced by terminals, such as:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't64'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't18'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't39'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't59'\n\nWait, in the rule for NT15: \nNT15 \u2192 NT71 NT47\n\nSimilarly, other rules.\n\nLooking for any terminal like 't12':\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT12 \u2192 Not directly, but checking the rules, I see NT77 \u2192 't79', but no 't12'. Wait, let me go through the rules systematically.\n\nLooking through the entire list of rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n2. S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n3. NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\n4. NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-934","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol, which can go to two terminals.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. It's a bit long, but I notice that many symbols eventually produce a terminal ('t') or sequences of terminals and non-terminals. Some symbols directly expand to 't' followed by a number, like T12, T73, etc. Others expand into combinations of these terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of t followed by numbers, like `t12 t73 t46 ... t54 t0 ...`. Since the grammar directly produces these terminal symbols, it's possible the string is composed of terminals only.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, a string is generated if each non-terminal in the derivation expands into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals. Since all the productions here either produce a single terminal (like 't12', 't73') or non-terminals that lead to such productions, the string should be derivable as long as each symbol in the string corresponds to a production that can reach the given sequence.\n\nI should check if the first symbol 't12' can be derived from the start symbol S. Looking at the grammar, S -> NT61 NT59. So to get 't12', it must be derived from either NT61 or NT59. However, the first token is 't12', which must be directly produced by a non-terminal. Looking at the productions, NT61 -> t67, NT59 -> t46. Wait, that doesn't help for 't12'. Alternatively, perhaps NT61 can derive 't67' and NT59 can derive other things, but the first symbol is 't12', which isn't directly in NT59 or NT61's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the NT symbols can derive multiple things, but in this case, perhaps the string starts with t12, so it must come from a non-terminal that directly produces 't12'. Looking through the productions, I see NT61 -> t12. So if in the derivation, the first symbol comes from NT61, it would produce 't12'. But wait, NT61's production is NT61 -> NT33 NT55. So that would mean that NT61 requires NT33 and NT55, which might eventually produce 't12' or other symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Maybe the string is a sequence of productions applied sequentially, and each step the left-hand side of a production is replaced by the right-hand side, leading to the string. So starting from S, which is NT61 NT59, each of those can produce certain things, and then we have to see if the entire string can be built by replacing the non-terminals step by step.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Another approach is to note that in the provided grammar, many non-terminals produce single terminals, such as NT72 -> t30, NT29 -> t87, NT68 -> t83, etc. Moreover, some non-terminals produce combinations that result in t followed by a number, for example, NT33 -> t79.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, which is t12. That means in the derivation, a non-terminal that can produce t12 must expand into it, perhaps directly or indirectly.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see NT61 can produce t67, which doesn't help for t12. But perhaps NT61's expansion leads to t12 through other steps. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the breakdown of t12. Checking the productions, none of them directly produce t12 except perhaps some non-terminals. Wait, wait, I see NT61 -> t67, which is t67. Then NT67 has two productions: NT67 -> NT57 NT14 and NT67 -> NT29 NT87. Now, NT57 can produce t17 NT28, but perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAnother strategy is to parse the string from left to right, trying to find the applicable grammar rules that generate each token in sequence. The string starts with t12. So I need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't12'. But in the provided productions, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t12. Wait, let me check: looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT61 -> t67 (so t67)\n- NT59 -> t46\n- NT33 -> t79\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT55\n- NT29 -> t62\n- Maybe NT29 -> t62, but t12 isn't directly there.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me scan the productions again. Oh, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to t12. That's a problem because the string starts with t12, but according to the grammar, t12 is not produced by any non-terminal. Unless, perhaps, t12 can be produced indirectly through a chain of productions. But wait, since it's a context-free grammar, a production that produces t12 must be accessible, and all symbols must be able to derive terminal strings. However, if none of the non-terminals can produce t12, then the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, perhaps NT61 can produce t12 via a chain. Let me check: NT61 -> NT33 NT55. NT33 can produce t79. NT55 can produce t19. Then t79 produces 't57 NT28', but this doesn't help for t12. Alternatively, NT33 can produce t32 NT72, which leads to more non-terminals. It seems like going through NT33 and NT55 doesn't lead to t12.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since none of the non-terminals directly produce t12, and the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that can derive t12, then the string starting with t12 cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-935","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me parse the grammar provided. It's a bit long, but I notice some repeating symbols like NT and some with numbers. I also see some rules that produce terminals, like 't' followed by numbers. So, my grammar has several non-terminals (NTs) and some terminals. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers: `t28 t32 t99 t18 t38 t32 t76 t60 t50 t53 t82 t74 t36 t38 t72 t86 t25 t60 t63 t94 t33 t13 t38 t73 t36 t50 t12 t3 t95 t76 t12 t46 t33 t0 t33 t80 t41 t99 t41 t42 t3 t50 t51 t74 t54 t49 t16 t28`. \n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. This suggests that the string length should be a power of two if the grammar is a typical one with only left or right recursion, but I'm not sure. However, the presence of terminals complicates this.\n\nI should approach this by constructing a parse tree for the string, making sure that each step follows the grammar rules. But that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can check if each token can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me list out the possible steps:\n\n1. I'll start by breaking down the string into parts. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so the first thing I notice is that some terminals appear again, like 't28', 't32', etc.\n\n2. Now, I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. \n\n3. For example, looking up 't28' in the grammar: There's a rule `NT68 \u2192 't83'` but 't28' isn't directly a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, I see `NT88 \u2192 't42'`, but 't28' isn't there. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals, like `NT68 \u2192 't83'`, `NT60 \u2192 't49'`, `NT5 \u2192 't5'`, etc. But the string has 't28', which I need to see if it's produced by any of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking for 't28', I go through each production rule until I find a terminal that matches 't28'. \n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\nI see that `NT47 \u2192 't73'` and `NT68 \u2192 't83'`, but 't28' isn't directly there. Hmm. Maybe 't28' is derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces it through multiple steps. \n\nWait, checking the rules, perhaps I missed one. Let me scan through all the non-terminals:\n\nLooking at NT14: `NT14 \u2192 't48'`\nNT7: `NT7 \u2192 't19'`\nNT25: `NT25 \u2192 't25'` (but that's a terminal)\nWait, maybe I need to go deeper.\n\nWait, looking at NT56: `NT56 \u2192 't87'`\nNT21? No, not listed. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, another approach: perhaps some non-terminals produce 't28' when other steps are followed. For example, if a non-terminal A can produce another non-terminal B, which can then produce a series of terminals ending with 't28', that would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has a part where a non-terminal can be split into two parts, each part matching a chain of rules leading to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up 't28' in the entire grammar. Let me see:\n\nLooking for any production rules where a non-terminal A \u2192 B C, and one of B or C is another non-terminal that leads to 't28'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't28' is produced directly by a non-terminal.\n\nWait, going back to the rules:\n\nI have `NT68 \u2192 't83'` and `NT28 \u2192 't63'`. Wait, 't63' is in the string too. So, not directly 't28'.\n\nBut wait, looking for 't28' in the right-hand sides of all rules:\n\nLooking through, I don't immediately find a production that ends with 't28'. So maybe I need to see if it's a terminal that's produced via some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps through a chain. For example, maybe NT68 -> 't83', and 't83' can be part of a longer string that eventually includes 't28'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't28' can be produced by a chain where another non-terminal is used before it. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't28' is present in the string as a terminal, so I need to check if that terminal can appear in any of the grammar's terminal symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is invalid if any of these terminals are not present in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through, the terminals in the grammar are 't' followed by numbers, and some are listed as t5, t6, t7, etc. So, 't28' would be a terminal if it exists in the grammar.\n\nLooking through, I see: \n\nIn the production rules, I don't see 't28' as a terminal. Wait, actually, the rule for NT80 is perhaps not, or maybe I think it's 't90'? Wait, no. Looking through, I see many t's, but I don't see t28. So perhaps t28 is not a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, that would be a problem because if the string has t28, and there's no production rule that produces t28, then the string cannot be derived, so the answer would be No. But I need to confirm.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nLooking for any instances where a non-terminal produces, for example, 't28'.\n\nLooking at each production rule:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n- NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n- NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\n- NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n- NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\n- NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n- NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\n- NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96\n- NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n- NT83 \u2192 NT24 NT46\n- NT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29\n- NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78\n- NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83\n- ... etc.\n\nNone of these end with a t28. Looking further, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t28. So perhaps that terminal is invalid, meaning the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again. The list includes:\n\n\"NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67\"\n\nNo, nothing for t28. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t28 is part of a longer derivation, but considering the Chomsky Normal Form, each step would only replace with two non-terminals, so the string must be built step by step. But if any terminal isn't present in the grammar, it can't be part of the string.\n\nSo if 't28' isn't a terminal in any production, then that token can't appear in the string. Hence the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-956","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, and I have to determine if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol, S.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and it can be split into either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Each of these new symbols, NTx, eventually expand into other symbols that might be 't' or other NT symbols.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that many symbols directly produce 't' followed by a number, like NT65 -> 't67' or NT5 -> 't5'. This means that for a symbol NTx, if x corresponds to a number that's already defined, we can replace it with 't' plus that number. Otherwise, we might need to expand further.\n\nTo parse the string, I can start by checking the structure. The string starts with 't41 t12 ...' which suggests that the initial productions from S would lead to something starting with t41 or t12.\n\nWait, S has two options: NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Let's see which of these produce 't41' or 't12'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT61 -> 't65' but 't65' is not in the initial productions. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing something up. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\nThen NT33 -> 't82' (since NT33 is defined as 't32' in some rules, wait no, let me check again. Wait, here's a production: NT33 -> NT32 NT72, and NT32 -> 't32' from one rule and another NT32 production. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, some NTx produce 't' and others produce more NTs. For example, NT61 -> 't33'? Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55, but neither NT33 nor NT55 directly produce 't'.

Wait, NT36 is defined as NT6 NT78, which then both have productions. Wait, perhaps I got mixed up. Let's clarify.\n\nLooking at NT36, the production is NT36 -> NT6 NT78. Then NT6 leads to what? I need to track each step.\n\nSimilarly, NT93 -> 't72' (from NT93 -> 't72'), NT65 -> 't32', etc.\n\nSo, for each NTx, I need to see if x corresponds to a terminal that is a 't' followed by that number. So for example, if NTx has a production that's 't32', then it can emit 't32' when applicable.\n\nWait, but some NTx have multiple productions. For example, NT47 has:\n\nNT47 -> NT58 NT95\nand other options. But some of these produce 't' terms, like NT47 -> 't73' (I think I need to check all productions for NTx to see if any of them produce a 't' plus a number).\n\nWait, looking through the list again:\n\n- NT2 -> NT52 NT86 \u2192 Not a 't' production.\n- NT31 -> NT26 NT29 \u2192 Not a 't' production.\n- NT57 -> NT17 NT27 \u2192 NT17 is 't9' (from NT9 -> 't17', but wait, NT9 -> 't18', no, wait. Wait, the production for NT9 is NT93 -> 't18'? No, wait, looking back:\n\nNo, actually, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT9 -> 't17' (Wait, not sure. Let me re-check.)\n\nWait, actually, wait. Maybe I'm getting confused because the list is quite long. Let me go step by step.\n\nI think a better approach is to note all the NTx that directly produce a 't' followed by a number, and then map each 'tXXXX' in the string to see if it's possible through the grammar.\n\nSo, first, let's identify which NTx produce 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT65 -> 't32' \u2192 so 't32' comes from NT65\n- NT58 -> 't55' \u2192 't55' comes from NT58\n- NT28 -> 't63' \u2192 't63' comes from NT28\n- NT27 -> 't7' \u2192 't7' comes from NT27\n- NT78 -> 't93' \u2192 't93' comes from NT78\n- NT67 -> 't74' \u2192 't74' comes from NT67\n- NT57 -> 't17' \u2192 't17' comes from NT57\n- NT46 -> 't60' \u2192 't60' comes from NT46\n- NT68 -> 't16' \u2192 't16' comes from NT68\n- NT14 -> 't2' \u2192 't2' comes from NT14\n- NT36 -> ??? Wait, NT36 production is NT6 NT78. So that's two NTs. NT6: Looking for NT6: I don't see a direct 't' production for NT6.\n\nWait, let's check all NTx for direct 't' productions.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT55 \u2192 Do any of these produce 't'? No, unless NT33 or NT55 produce 't's, which they might through further productions.\n- NT29 -> NT14 NT86 \u2192 NT14 -> 't2', so NT29 can produce 't14' and 't86'.\n- NT47 -> NT58 NT95 \u2192 NT58 -> 't55', so NT47 can produce 't55' and NT95. What's NT95's production? Wait, I don't see a production for NT95. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking deeper, I think I might have missed some. Let me go through each NTx:\n\nNT61: produces NT33 and NT55 \u2192 not 't' directly.\nNT29: production is NT14 (t2) and NT86. So 't14' and NT86 (which goes to 't36' eventually? Not sure.

{"custom_id":"request-954","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar has several production rules. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. They all seem to be in the form A \u2192 BC, except for one which is S \u2192 NT... something, but since the overall structure is CNT, it's still in Chomsky Normal Form. The start symbol is S, and I see it expands into combinations of non-terminals. Some non-terminals eventually expand into 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals representing the symbols in the string.\n\nThe string given is: `t33 t41 t32 t80 t9 t82 t3 t50 t53 t28 t9 t97 t86 t67 t54 t65 t87 t87 t62 t79 t35 t54 t39 t42 t39 t54 t53 t60 t46 t33 t66 t25 t33 t62 t37 t96 t50 t28 t19 t38 t66 t53 t49 t9 t62 t50 t96 t37 t0`.\n\nI notice that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals, and some of them expand into 't' followed by numbers. These 't...' tokens are likely terminal symbols, meaning they are part of the string we're checking.\n\nMy plan is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use a parsing strategy, perhaps recursive descent or a top-down approach. Alternatively, since the problem allows any strategy, maybe I can build a derivation tree or see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut manually doing this for such a long string might be tedious. So perhaps I can look for patterns or key parts of the string that can guide me.\n\nLooking at the string, I see a lot of 't33', 't32', 't41', etc. I should check if these correspond to any production rules. For example, looking at the rules:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nBut in the string, I see 't33' which would come from NT33 if NT32 is replaced later or is a terminal. Wait, but NT32 is replaced into 't32', right? So for instance, NT32 \u2192 't32'. So a production like NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72 would, when resolved, become 't32 t72'.\n\nBut in the string, I see 't33' followed by 't41 t32 t80 t9 ...'. Hmm, maybe I can look for a production that starts with NT33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the start symbol S and see how it expands. The start symbol S expands into NT61 NT59. So S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Both NT61 and NT59 are non-terminals. Let's see what they expand into.\n\nLooking at the rules:\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT59 \u2192 NT66 NT23\n\nSo S expands into NT61 NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT55 NT66 NT23.\n\nNow, I'll need to see if these non-terminals can produce the start of the string. The string starts with 't33 t41 t32...'. So let's see if NT33 can produce 't33'.\n\nLooking at NT33's rules:\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72 or NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22.\n\nWait, the first option is NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72. If NT32 \u2192 't32', then NT33 \u2192 't32 NT72'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't33'. Hmm, but NT33 would expand into 't32' followed by something. So the first token might not be 't33' unless NT32 somehow produces a 't33', which is not possible because NT32 is 't32' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check the production rules again. Oh, looking back, there's a rule: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72. So if I go through that, the first token would be 't32' from NT32, but the string starts with 't33', so maybe that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for another production. Wait, let me check: the initial S expansion is NT61 NT59. NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and NT59 \u2192 NT66 NT23. So from S, we get NT33 NT55 NT66 NT23.\n\nNow, let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nNT33 can be NT32 NT72 or NT79 NT22.\nNT55 can be various things. Looking at the rules, NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT61 or NT58 NT86.\n\nBut wait, let's look at each non-terminal and see possible expansions.\n\nStarting from S, we have four non-terminals: NT33, NT55, NT66, NT23.\n\nNT33: Can produce 't32 t72' (since NT32 \u2192 't32') or NT79 NT22.\n\nNT55: Let's see. The rules for NT55 are: \u2192 NT19 NT61 and \u2192 NT58 NT86.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT9 NT59, and NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe the key is to find that the string contains only parts that can be formed by the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the string, I see 't33', which as per the grammar is generated by NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, so 't32 t72'. So the string would have 't32 t72' somewhere.\n\nBut the string starts with 't33 t41 t32...', which doesn't match 't32 t72'. That might indicate that the initial part might not be directly from NT33.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a combination of multiple terminals and non-terminals. Maybe looking for key sequences.\n\nWait, another idea: the string starts with 't33 t41 t32 t80 t9...'.

For example, NT10 \u2192 't96', NT18 \u2192 't39', etc. So each 't' is a terminal from these non-terminals.\n\nNow, the first token is 't33'. Let's see if any non-terminal expands into 't33'. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for a productions that expand to 't33'. From the list, I see NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, which becomes 't32 t72', so that's 't32' and another non-terminal.

So perhaps 't33' is not a direct terminal but part of a longer expansion.\n\nWait, no, according to the grammar, all the rules are A \u2192 BC, except that some produce 't..' which are terminals. But in the rules given, I don't see any NT33 \u2192 't33' or similar. So perhaps this indicates that 't33' must come from a longer expansion.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me re-examine the production rules carefully.\n\nIn the list, for example, NT33 is defined as:\n\nNT33 -> NT32 NT72\n\nSo that's B \u2192 C D, etc. So 't33' would have to come from a production that directly yields a 't' token.

{"custom_id":"request-976","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF means. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. In this grammar, I see that most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs, except some like NT68 which produce a terminal ('t83').\n\nThe given string to check is: `t41 t51 t49 t74 t96 t73 t0 t97 t25 t97 t96 t25 t36 t82 t60 t72 t72 t64 t39 t18 t13 t82 t54 t35 t86 t82 t13 t96 t86 t28 t19 t49 t39 t25 t13 t39 t66 t72 t53 t28 t42 t64 t46 t73 t86 t12 t18 t72 t83 t42`.\n\nSo, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nI know that inCNF, the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal. The starting symbol is S, and each production reduces the length of the sentential form until terminals are produced.\n\nOne approach is to parse the string using the grammar, trying to match production rules from right to left or left to right. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can start from the start symbol S and apply productions to build up the string.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can construct a derivation tree where each step splits a non-terminal into two children until all leaves are terminals.\n\nBut considering the complexity of the string, it's probably better to approach it with a recursive descent parser or use methods like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm doing this manually, I'll look for patterns or key points in the grammar and string.\n\nLet me look at the grammar and string more closely.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't83'\n- NT60 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5', 't58', etc., but wait, some produce specific terminals.

Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'm a bit confused. For example, NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23, and NT66 \u2192 't95'. So NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23 \u2192 't95' NT23. But NT23 has its own productions. Wait, NT23 \u2192 't79' or 't13' or 't3'?

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions are from S to various combinations of NTs (non-terminals) and terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t51 t67 t99 t16 t28 t87 t50 t96 t86 t67 t74 t3 t16 t9 t87 t72 t12 t53 t97 t46 t35 t28 t65 t13 t12 t37 t18 t95 t99 t32 t46 t48 t96 t2 t82 t5 t18 t99 t50 t87 t35 t96 t63 t36 t9 t76 t82 t80 t99 t33`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string with many terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-12","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the string \"t36 t46\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It seems that most of the non-terminals (like S, NT47, etc.) have production rules that break down into other non-terminals until they eventually resolve to 't' followed by a number, like 't36' or 't46'. \n\nThe string we have is \"t36 t46\". So, it's two tokens separated by a space. I'll need to see if the grammar can derive this string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two production rules:\n1. S -> NT61 NT59\n2. S -> NT29 NT9\n\nThe string is made up of two 't' tokens, so let's see which of these NT rules can produce 't36' and 't46'.\n\nLooking at the rules, many non-terminals eventually produce a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT55 -> 't5', NT60 -> 't49', etc. \n\nLet's focus on the rules that end with 't' followed by a number. Scanning through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT55 -> 't5' (useful if we had a 5)\n- NT60 -> 't49' (gives 't49')\n- NT35 -> 't5' (same as above)\n- NT14 -> 't2' (gives 't2')\n- NT2 -> 't64' (gives 't64')\n- NT18 -> 't36' (this looks promising for 't36')\n- NT33 -> 't32' (not useful)\n- NT29 -> 't87' (not helpful)\n- NT47 -> 't73' (no)\n- NT59 -> 't46' (also a target)\n\nWait, looking closer, I see NT59 -> 't46' directly. So, if one part of the string is 't46', that's produced by NT59. Similarly, we need 't36', which is produced by NT18.\n\nSo, the string is 't36 t46', which would correspond to NT18 and NT59.\n\nNow, looking back at the start symbol S's rules:\n- S can produce NT29 and NT9. But in the string, we have NT18 and NT59. Alternatively, maybe another rule in S can produce these, but looking at the S rules, they produce combinations like NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the start symbol S is S -> NT29 NT9, which would produce something like NT29 and NT9. But NT29 in the string is 't87', which isn't matching our target 't36' or 't46'. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think differently. Let's see if any production rules can lead to 't36' and 't46' as the end symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some NT symbols have production rules that eventually lead to 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\n- NT59 -> 't46' directly. So, if we have NT59, it becomes 't46'.\n- NT18 -> 't36' directly. So NT18 becomes 't36'.\n\nNow, do any of the production rules of S can split into NT18 and NT59?\n\nLooking at the S rules: S can split into NT29 NT9. So, if we can get NT29 to produce 't87' and NT9 to produce 't18', that would give us 't87 t18', but that's not our string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another production rule of S? Looking back, the first rule is S -> NT61 NT59. So, if NT61 becomes 't36' and NT59 becomes 't46', then S would produce 't36 t46', which matches our string.\n\nSo, let's check if NT61 can produce 't36'.\n\nLooking at NT61's production rule: NT61 -> 't36' directly! Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 -> 't46' directly.\n\nSo, in the grammar, S can produce NT61 NT59, which in turn becomes 't36 t46'.\n\nTherefore, the string is indeed generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string \"t62 t18\" is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, all the productions fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT61 or NT47, etc. So that's good.\n\nThe string we're testing is \"t62 t18\". Since it's a string with two tokens separated by a space, that suggests it might be the result of two consecutive productions derived from two different non-terminals, each of which directly produce 't' followed by a number. But let me not get ahead of myself.\n\nI need to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. Let's look at the start symbol S. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT61 NT61. So S can derive two NT61s. Let's check what NT61 produces. From the grammar, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So each NT61 can produce two non-terminals, NT33 and NT55.\n\nNow, looking at NT33: it can produce NT32 NT72 or NT72 directly. Let's follow NT32 first. NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. Then looking at NT18: it has productions like 't66', 't25', or also can produce NT66 later. Wait, I think I missed some. Let me check: NT18 produces 't66', 't25', and also has another production NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT8, but that might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try to parse the string backwards. Maybe it's easier to see if the string can be derived by starting from the terminals and working our way back to S.\n\nThe string is \"t62 t18\". Let's split it into two parts: \"t62\" and \"t18\".\n\nLooking for a production that directly produces \"t62\". Scanning the grammar, I see NT62 \u2192 't12', but that's not \"t62\". Oh, wait, I don't see an NT62 production that gives \"t62\". Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT62 \u2192 't12' (from NT66). Hmm, no NT62 has a production to 't62' directly. Wait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice NT72 \u2192 't49' but not 't62'. Also, NT56 \u2192 't51', NT28 \u2192 't63', NT88 \u2192 't76' etc. Hmm, is there any NT that produces 't62'?\n\nWait, looking back at the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't62'. Let me check more carefully. For example, NT93 \u2192 't72', NT62 \u2192 't12' (from NT67?) Wait, wait, I might be getting mixed up.\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nNT62 \u2192 't12.' So that's only 't12'.\n\nBut the string has 't62' and 't18'. So how can we get 't62'? There's no production for any NT that gives 't62' as a terminal. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe the string is generated through some non-terminals that expand into these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string as 't62 t18', perhaps each term comes from a separate non-terminal. So the entire string could be NT62 NT18, but since S is NT61 NT61, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is the result of expanding something else. Alternatively, maybe the string is \"t62\" followed by \"t18\", which would mean both are directly terminals output by their respective non-terminals.\n\nBut according to the grammar, the only terminal symbols are specific to certain NTs. For example, NT62 \u2192 't12', which doesn't help. Maybe I need to check if any NTs have 't62' as a production. Scanning through:\n\n- NT61 produces 't36' when NT36 \u2192 't74' or as part of other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see if 't62' is ever produced directly. From the given productions, NT62 \u2192 't12', so there's no NT that produces 't62' directly.\n\nWait, I must be missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar provided. Perhaps I missed a production for an NT that outputs 't62'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\nNT62 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't18'\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Maybe I need to look for NT63, but it's not there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a result of multiple steps. For example, perhaps NT61 expands into something that eventually produces 't62' and another NT that produces 't18'.\n\nBut looking at NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then NT33 can be NT32 or NT72. If it's NT32, then NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. Then NT18 can produce 't66', 't25', etc., but that's not 't62'.\n\nAlternatively, if NT33 is NT72, then NT72 \u2192 't49', but that's not helpful. So NT61 seems to lead to 't' something, but not 't62'.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the string is in the form of a production in a different way. Maybe it's not NT... Let me think differently.\n\nSince the string is \"t62 t18\", maybe we can find a production that is t62 t18 as two separate terminals. But according to the grammar, each terminal is part of a larger NT production, so perhaps t62 and t18 come from different NTs that are expanded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is the result of an intermediate NT that outputs both terms together, but that's not possible since each production either has two NTs or a single terminal.\n\nWait, wait! Perhaps the string is the result of two separate NTs, each expanding to a single terminal. For example, one NT produces 't62' and another produces 't18', but looking back, I don't see any NT that produces 't62'.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is 't62' 't18', but I think that's the case, so the NTs must produce these two terminals directly, which they don't.\n\nWait, but wait! Looking back at the grammar, I see that some NTs produce 't' followed by a number, like NT66 \u2192 't51', etc. Hmm, not t62.\n\nWait, let me search the grammar for 't62'. For each NT:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't66', 't25', etc.\n- NT19 \u2192 't0', 't9'\n- NT20 \u2192 't96', etc.\n- NT22 \u2192 't2', 't67'\n- NT23 \u2192 't79', etc.\n- NT24 \u2192 't2', etc.\n- NT25 \u2192 not here, wait, the grammar says NT24 \u2192 't97'\n- NT26 \u2192 't42'\n- NT32 \u2192 't18', 't65'\n- NT33 \u2192 't32', 't72'\n- NT57 \u2192 't17', 't27'\n- NT61 \u2192 't36', 't74'\n- NT62 \u2192 't12'\n- NT65 \u2192 't36', 't60', etc.\n- NT66 \u2192 't95'\n- NT67 \u2192 't53', etc.\n- NT73 \u2192 't46'\n- NT74 \u2192 't67'\n- NT82 \u2192 't29' (is that right?) Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't62' as a terminal. So this suggests that the string cannot be produced because there's no NT that directly gives 't62'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a way for a NT to produce 't62' indirectly. Let me think: for example, if an NT eventually leads to a production that includes 't62', but given the structure, each NT only produces two NTs or a terminal. So if no NT directly produces 't62', the string 't62 t18' can't be generated because those terms don't exist directly in the grammar.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit rusty on my grammar rules, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar provided, I can see that it's in CNF because each rule on the left side has two non-terminals on the right, except when it's a terminal production like NT68 \u2192 't12'.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is \"t82 t19 t46\". Let's break this down into three separate tokens: t82, t19, and t46. Each of these could be either derived from a non-terminal or are terminals themselves.\n\nStarting with the first token, \"t82\". Looking through the grammar, I find the rule NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT5. Wait, that doesn't directly give me 't82'. Let me check other rules. There's NT55 \u2192 NT5, which points to NT5. Then NT5 appears in NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83 and NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23, among others. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for where 't82' is defined. Going through the list, I see NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22, and NT33 is a non-terminal. So NT33 can only be expanded into other non-terminals. But 't82' is a terminal, so that must come from one of the productions where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. Looking further, I see NT88 \u2192 't42' and NT18 \u2192 't36', but where is 't82' defined?\n\nOh, wait, I see at the end of the grammar, there's NT33 \u2192 't32'. So NT33 can produce 't32'. Also, there's NT32 \u2192 't18' and NT96 \u2192 't67', etc. But I'm looking for where 't82' comes from. Let me check each rule where the right side has a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't83' (so 't83' is produced from NT5)\n- NT46 \u2192 't60' \u2192 't60' from NT46\n- NT88 \u2192 't72' \u2192 't72' from NT88\n- NT68 \u2192 't83' \u2192 't83' from NT68\n- NT73 \u2192 't53' \u2192 't53' from NT73\n- NT87 \u2192 't48' \u2192 't48' from NT87\n- NT62 \u2192 't12' \u2192 't12' from NT62\n- NT54 \u2192 't64' \u2192 't64' from NT54\n- NT55 \u2192 't5' \u2192 't5' from NT55\n- NT14 \u2192 't2' \u2192 't2' from NT14\n- NT18 \u2192 't36' \u2192 't36' from NT18\n- NT24 \u2192 't2' \u2192 't2' from NT24\n- NT59 \u2192 't46' \u2192 't46' from NT59\n- NT23 \u2192 't13' \u2192 't13' from NT23\n- NT71 \u2192 't50' \u2192 't50' from NT71\n- NT68 \u2192 't16' \u2192 't16' from NT68\n\nWait, so none of the rules produce 't82' as a terminal directly. That's a problem because 't82' is part of the string we need to generate. That suggests that maybe 't82' can't be derived directly from any production, which might mean that the string isn't part of the language. But before I jump to conclusions, I need to check if 't82' is an indirect production, perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT33 \u2192 't32', and NT32 \u2192 't18' \u2192 but that's 't18', not 't82'. Hmm. What about NT33 itself: if NT33 can be expanded into other non-terminals, and those can expand into terminals. But in the given grammar, what can NT33 produce?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT33 has production rules like NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22. So let's see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65 \u2192 but then NT65 can expand to NT6 NT60, and NT60 is 't49'. Wait, but NT33 expands into NS, which can be further expanded.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string backward, starting from the rightmost symbol and working back to see if it can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the string can be built by recursively applying the grammar rules.\n\nBut before that, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar rules again to see if 't82' is an option.\n\nWait, looking through all the NT productions, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't82'. So 't82' can't be a terminal unless it's derived from some non-terminal. So if 't82' is actually part of the string, but the grammar can't generate it because there's no production rule leading to 't82', then the string isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't82' is a typo, but the problem states that we need to evaluate the given string. So unless there's a production rule that allows a non-terminal to produce 't82', the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I remember that there are rules like NT55 \u2192 NT5. So if I can't find any 't82' terminal, then 't82' is ungrammatical, meaning the string cannot be generated.\n\nSo, without any direct or indirect way to produce 't82', the string \"t82 t19 t46\" can't be generated by the grammar.

So, looking at the grammar, it seems to fit that structure because all productions have exactly two symbols on the right side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t82 t19 t35`. So, this is a sequence of three tokens. I need to see if these tokens can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me think about how this works.

Yes! So, NT33 can produce `t82`.\n\nTherefore, `t82` comes from NT33. Now, how does NT33 derive `t82` in the string? The string is `t82 t19 t35`.\n\nSo, the first symbol `t82` is derived from NT33, which is a non-terminal. Therefore, in the derivation, there must be a production of NT33 that is being used early. But looking at the right-hand side of NT33, it's either 't32' or 't82', each as a single terminal. So, since we have `t82` at the beginning, it must have been derived from NT33 -> 't82', which is allowed.\n\nWait, actually, wait: If NT33 is a non-terminal, then it would have to have two symbols on the right side because each production must have exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. But NT33's productions are either 't32' or 't82', which are terminals. So, wait, in a CFG in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, yes, this is allowed in CNF.\n\nTherefore, NT33 can produce a terminal symbol in one step. So, if the first symbol is `t82`, that must come from NT33. So, in the derivation, we have S \u2192 ... \u2192 NT33 ... (and then process the next symbols).\n\nWait, but how does that fit into the structure? Let me think about that. The entire string is three symbols, so the derivation must be a series of steps that build up each symbol, starting from S.\n\nIn the first step, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, we need to derive `t82` as the first symbol. So, we need a production that starts with NT33 as the first symbol being used to produce `t82`.\n\nWait, but looking at the production for NT33: It either produces 't32' or 't82'. So, we can have NT33 \u2192 't82', which gives us `t82` at the first position.\n\nNow, after that, the next symbol would need to come from whatever is produced in the second position. Let's see: The string is `t82 t19 t35`. So, after `t82` comes `t19`, then `t35`.\n\nBut NT33 \u2192 't82' in one step, so to produce `t82 t19 t35`, the NT33 must have been split into another non-terminal that then derives the rest.\n\nWait, no. Because if NT33 directly produces `t82`, then to produce three symbols, perhaps S would have to split into something else, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to consider the entire string as a product of S's expansion, with each symbol coming from a production in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT15 NT48, and further derivations build up the string.\n\nWait, let me think about the overall approach. The string is three symbols, so perhaps the derivation must create three terminal symbols through three steps, considering the structure of the grammar.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, it can expand into two non-terminals, say A and B. Each of these can then expand further.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find a sequence of productions that, when applied in order, produce"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The terminals are either 't' followed by two digits or a single 't' which isn't present here, so each token in the string should be matched by the terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production either has two non-terminals on the left or one on the left that becomes two.

Let's see which non-terminals are actually producing the terminals in the string.\n\nFor instance, t87: Checking the grammar, I see \"67 -> 29 NT87\". Wait, no, that's the rule NT77 \u2192 NT55 NT61, but that doesn't produce t87. Looking more carefully, I need to find if any rule directly gives t87. Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't immediately see a rule that produces t87 on its own. Instead, perhaps it's linked via other productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is four terminals: t87, t96, t18, t35.\n\nI can model this as a parsing problem, where I start with S and try to match the string.\n\nS can generate two NT symbols. Let's split the string into two halves, but given the order, perhaps they split as t87 t96 and t18 t35. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe each token corresponds to a single step in the production.\n\nWait, another approach: each production in the grammar has two non-terminals, so the entire string must correspond to a concatenation of N terminals. Therefore, the number of tokens should allow for a binary split, perhaps using a CYK-like approach, but maybe it's easier to see if each token appears as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me check each token against the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking through each production, the terminal symbols are all of the form 't' followed by two digits except for a few where non-terminals end. Wait, no, actually the grammar seems to have some terminal rules: for example, NT65 \u2192 't36' or 't79'... Wait, no, looking closer, some rules end in 't' and a number, like NT6 \u2192 't74', NT2 \u2192 't64', etc. But others don't; many rules produce other non-terminals.

So wait, maybe 't0' isn't produced by any rule as a terminal, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the rules, the production S \u2192 NT29 NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17 (rule #1), then NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54 (rule #17), etc. So perhaps it's not 't0' but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't0' is not directly produced, so maybe the string isn't possible. Let me see.\n\nWait, but the given string includes t0, t5, t18. So if I can't find any NT that produces t0, then perhaps this string isn't in the language.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing some rules. Let me scan all the rules again to make sure.\n\nAh, here's rule #87: NT67 \u2192 't49' (no, I think I wrote it wrong). Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, let me go through each rule to check if any give 't0' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any right-hand side that directly produces 't0'. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated because 't0' is not directly produced by any rule. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but wait a moment, maybe I'm misremembering the rules. Maybe some rule produces 't0' but I didn't notice. Let me go through each rule:\n\nRule #1: NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\nRule #2: NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23\nRule #3: NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6\nRule #4: NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\nRule #5: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\nRule #6: NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\nRule #7: NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96\nRule #8: NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86 (repeated)\nRule #9: NT83 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n...\nLooking through all, I don't see any 't0' terminal. So, maybe the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but the provided grammar may have a rule that I missed. Let me check rule #2: NT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23. Then, NT19 \u2192 't0' (rule #71: NT19 \u2192 't0'), and NT23 \u2192 't2' (rule #24: NT24 \u2192 't2').\n\nSo, for example, NT7 can produce 't0 t2' because:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23 \u2192 't0' NT23 \u2192 't0 t2'\n\nSo, if the string was t0 t2, that's possible.\n\nBut in our case, the string is t2 t0 t5 t18. So, the order is important.\n\nWait, but if the first symbol is derived from NT24 \u2192 't2', then the next symbol would need to be 't0', but that's not directly possible, unless it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the string isn't possible because 't0' isn't a terminal, or maybe it's produced by a combination of NTs, but in the given grammar, there's no NT that directly produces 't0'.\n\nWait, but in rule #71: NT19 \u2192 't0' and rule #77: NT77 \u2192 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-63","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is `t66 t32 t49 t5 t46`. \n\nFirst, let me recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every production either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see a lot of S and NT productions followed by various terminals. The NT symbols are the non-terminals, and the 't' followed by numbers seems to be terminals. \n\nMy approach is to work backwards from the string to see if I can derive it using the grammar. Starting from the string `t66 t32 t49 t5 t46`, I'll try to see if each terminal can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's break the string into tokens: t66, t32, t49, t5, t46.\n\nStarting with the last symbol, t46. I look for production rules where a terminal appears as a result. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT46 \u2192 t60. Wait, no, that's not t46. Let me check again. Hmm, looking for t46, I see NT46 \u2192 t60, NT60 \u2192 t49, etc. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rules.\n\nWait, let me correctly scan the grammar. I need to find a production rule that ends with t46. Looking through, I don't see any rules ending with t46. There's NT14 \u2192 t2, NT29 \u2192 t87, NT59 \u2192 t46. Oh, there is NT59 \u2192 t46. So t46 comes from NT59.\n\nSo, the last symbol t46 must come from NT59. Therefore, NT59 must be expanded to produce t46. So that part is good.\n\nNow, moving backward, the second last symbol is t5. I need to find a production rule that gives t5. Scanning, I see that in the grammar, NT55 \u2192 t5. Wait, no, looking back: \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some rules like NT5 \u2192 t61, NT46 \u2192 t96, etc. Wait, I need to find a production where a non-terminal leads to t5. Hmm, looking further, I see NT55 \u2192 t5. So yes, NT55 can produce t5.\n\nSo t5 comes from NT55. So the string so far is t46 (from NT59) and t5 (from NT55), so I need to see if NT59 can somehow lead to t46 and then another non-terminal that can produce the rest.\n\nWait, no. Actually, working backwards, the string is t66, t32, t49, t5, t46. So, the last symbol is t46, which comes from NT59. Then the symbol before that is t5, which comes from NT55. Now, the previous symbol is t49. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT60 \u2192 t49 (from NT60 \u2192 t49). So t49 comes from NT60.\n\nNow, after t49, we have t5. Wait, that's the second last symbol. So the string up to now is t66, t32, t49, t5, t46.\n\nSo let's go step by step from the end:\n\n1. t46 comes from NT59 \u2192 t46.\n2. t5 comes from NT55 \u2192 t5.\n3. t49 comes from NT60 \u2192 t49.\n4. t5 is another symbol, but wait, in the string, after t49 comes t5. So t5 is the fourth symbol. But how can that be? Because in the string, t49 is followed by t5, but t5 is a terminal, and the production for t46 ends with t49 followed by t5. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The string is `t66 t32 t49 t5 t46`. So it's a sequence: t66, then t32, then t49, then t5, then t46.\n\nFrom the right:\n\nThe last symbol is t46, which must come from NT59 \u2192 t46.\n\nSo the part before that is t5. That t5 comes from NT55 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo after NT59, the production must lead to NT55, followed by t5. Wait, but in the grammar, NT59 is a non-terminal. How does NT59 generate t5?\n\nWait, do any rules produce NT59 and then lead to t5? Let's check the grammar. Looking for NT59 production leads:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces NT59 followed by another symbol except in the production S\u2192NT61 NT59, but that's a production of S, not of NT59. So NT59 is probably a sink in this context, meaning it doesn't produce any further symbols except t46.\n\nWait, that can't be right because then the string would have to end with t46, and have nothing before it except t5, which doesn't fit the string of five symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look at how the production tree can branch.\n\nLet me try another approach: trying to build a parse tree for the string `t66 t32 t49 t5 t46`.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first symbol is t66. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t66? Let me look for any rules that end with t66.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT66 is not present as a non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar, there's NT66? Let me check. The lines: NT83 \u2192 t95; NT66 \u2192 t95; wait, no, in the grammar provided, I don't see any rule ending with t66. Hmm, but looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT55 \u2192 t5\n\nNT59 \u2192 t46\n\nNT60 \u2192 t49\n\nNT88 \u2192 t76\n\nWait, t66 is a terminal. Looking for any production that results in t66. Checking all the grammar, I don't immediately see any. Let me look through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT98? No, probably not. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules:\n\nI see:\n\nNT5 -> t61\n\nNT46 -> t96\n\nNT67 -> 't74'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking for a rule that produces t66. Let me scan through the rules.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, the only rule that has a 't' followed by numbers is a terminal production, so perhaps some NT non-terminals produce t66.\n\nWait, checking all the rules again: I'm looking for a production where a non-terminal leads directly to t66.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT60 \u2192 t49\n\nNT65 \u2192 t32\n\nNT67 \u2192 t74\n\nNT73 \u2192 t53\n\nNT77 \u2192 t55 (multiple times)\n\nNT79 \u2192 t36\n\nWait, I don't see any rules that directly produce t66. That's a problem because if t66 is in the string, but there's no rule that produces it, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t66. So if there's no production that directly produces t66, then the grammar can't generate the string, which immediately says 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong because some non-terminals can produce multiple things. So perhaps t66 is produced via a chain.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me double-check the rules to see if any NT produces t66.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- S\u2192NT61 NT59\n\n- S\u2192NT29 NT9\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\n\n- NT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 (Wait, does this produce anything?

So I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from some production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, none of the NTs directly produce t66, t30, etc. Let me check each terminal in the string:\n\nt66: Is there a production for NT66 that produces t66? Looking through, NT66 \u2192 t95. So to get t66, we have to have NT66 \u2192 t66, which isn't in the productions.\n\nWait a second, maybe I have the productions wrong. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- Line 25: NT66 \u2192 t95\n- Line 19: NT32 \u2192 t54\n- Line 27: NT95 \u2192 t72\n- Line 47: NT54 \u2192 t64\n- Line 14: NT19 \u2192 t0\n- Line 52: NT28 \u2192 t79\n\nSo none of the NTs directly produce t66, t30, t46. Hmm, that's a problem because the string contains these.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the line numbers might not correspond to the user's initial listing. Wait, the user's grammar starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT61?

Let me start by understanding the grammar structure.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all productions are either single terminals, non-terminals, or two non-terminals. Looking at the productions, they're either something like S -> NT, where NT is a combination of two non-terminals, or these non-terminals leading directly to terminals like 't12' or numbers.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers: t66, t50, t32, t49, t19, t35. So each token is a terminal symbol. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the productions for S, the first rule is S -> NT61 NT59. So S can generate NT61 followed by NT59. Then, I need to see what NT61 and NT59 produce.\n\nNT61 has a production NT61 -> NT33 NT55. So NT61 becomes NT33 and NT55. Then, NT55 has a production NT55 -> NT6 NT7. Let me see: NT65 -> NT33 NT55? Wait, no, the NT55 I'm looking at is in NT61's definition. So NT61 becomes NT33 and NT55, and then each needs to be expanded.\n\nSo breaking it down step by step:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nSo now, S \u2192 NT33 NT55 NT59\n\nNow, expanding NT33: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nThen, NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nAnd NT72 \u2192 NT49\n\nWait, let's track each non-terminal:\n\nStarting with S, which splits into NT61 and NT59.\n\nNT61 splits into NT33 and NT55.\n\nNT33 splits into NT32 and NT72.\n\nNT32 splits into NT18 and NT65.\n\nNT72 splits into NT49.\n\nSo that gives us NT18, NT65, NT55, NT59.\n\nWait, actually, I think I should approach this more methodically by building the parse tree and seeing if the entire string can be generated.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse-engineer the string. The string is t66 t50 t32 t49 t19 t35.\n\nSo, looking for if each token can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting from the left, the first token is t66. Let's see what non-terminals can derive t66.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT66 is not directly present, but t66 comes from NT66. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT66 can produce t66. Specifically, the production NT60 -> t65, but wait, that's not right. Wait, I need to find which NT can produce 't66'.\n\nWait, the productions show NT56 -> 't38', NT64 isn't present directly, but perhaps looking at other NTs.\n\nWait, looking for NT that directly produce t66. The productions provided don't list any NT where N -> t66. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the production for NT46 -> 't60' is listed, but t60 isn't helpful here. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, are any NTs that can produce t66? Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT60 -> 't65' (no)\n- NT46 -> 't60' (t60)\n- NT55 -> 't6' (I don't think so)\nWait, looking back, the full list is given. Let me check the productions starting with NT.\n\nLooking for NT that can produce 't66'. Scanning all NT productions:\n\n- NT47 -> NT58 NT95\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT55\n- NT65 -> NT71 NT65 (loop)\n- NT73 -> NT26 NT24\n- NT93 -> NT62 NT83\n- NT15 -> NT48 NT59\n- NT29 -> NT14 NT86\n- NT83 -> NT24 NT46\n- NT88 -> NT15 NT29\n- NT36 -> NT6 NT78\n- NT93 -> NT62 NT83\n- NT15 -> NT15 NT77 (loop)\n- NT7 -> NT19 NT23\n- NT77 -> NT79 NT6\n- NT78 -> NT56 NT5\n- NT67 -> NT57 NT14\n- NT67 -> NT29 NT87\n- NT70 -> NT52 NT81\n- NT58 -> NT66 NT23 (Ah! Here, NT58 can produce t66)\nYes, so NT58 \u2192 t66. So to have t66, the preceding non-terminal must be NT58.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t66, so the first NT must be NT58. Therefore, the string must start with NT58. Now, NT58 needs to be expanded into t66, which consumes the first token.\n\nNext, the second token in the string is t50. So after NT58 is processed, the next part is to produce t50. So, the next NT needs to produce t50.\n\nWait, actually, the entire string is t66 t50 t32 t49 t19 t35. So the parsing tree should have S splitting into NT terms, which then further split.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the parse tree. Since S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so after S, we have NT61 and NT59.\n\nNow, considering the string, maybe one of the NT terms produces multiple tokens, so I need to see if the production for each NT can generate a sequence that matches the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nNow, NT61 can expand as NT33 NT55.\n\nSo S becomes NT33 NT55 NT59.\n\nThen, NT55 can expand as NT6 NT7.\n\nSo now, S becomes NT33 NT6 NT7 NT59.\n\nWait, that's three non-terminals: NT33, NT6, NT7, and NT59. But the string has six tokens, so perhaps this is going to be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see if the string can be derived in a single pass.\n\nBut it might be easier to look for possible parse sequences.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think about the possible order of the tokens.\n\nThe string is t66 t50 t32 t49 t19 t35.\n\nI know that t66 comes from NT58 \u2192 t66.\n\nSo, if I start with NT58, which produces t66, that's the first token.\n\nThen, the next part is NT50, but wait, no, after t66, the next is t50, so the production for NT50 would produce t50. But looking back at the grammar, does any NT produce t50? Or is it produced by a chain?\n\nWait, no NT directly produces t50. Because in the productions, the only NT that can directly produce a t are NT58 \u2192 t66, NT55 \u2192 t6, NT5 \u2192 t18, etc.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 t65\n- NT58 \u2192 t66\n- NT55 \u2192 t6? Looking: NT55 can produce NT6 and NT7, which then must produce terminals. Wait, but NT55\u2192 NT6 and NT7, which then generate terminals. So NT55 is a chain that may produce multiple tokens.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t66\n- NT66? No, NT58 is part of a production that leads to t66.\nWait, no NT directly produces t50. So perhaps I'm wrong earlier; maybe the t50 is part of a terminal in one of the branches.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the entire string, perhaps the first token t66 comes from NT58, and the other NTs contribute to the remaining tokens.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by checking each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the grammar is left-recursive, so for strings with long sequences, it must be able to derive them without infinite loops.\n\nWait, but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t36 t96 t86 t30 t5 t46` is generated by it. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar productions. I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals like 't36', 't96', etc. So the string is composed of these terminals. \n\nI guess I need to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S -> NT61 NT59 or S -> NT29 NT9. So the string must be generated from one of these paths.\n\nLooking at the string: `t36 t96 t86 t30 t5 t46`. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nI think I should construct a parse tree. Each node should split into two non-terminals based on the productions. Each terminal in the string must be matched by a production that directly outputs that terminal.\n\nLet me try starting from the beginning. The string starts with t36. Looking at the grammar, I see NT68 \u2192 't83', NT14 \u2192 't2', NT60 \u2192 't49', NT33 \u2192 't32', etc. Wait, maybe I should find all non-terminals that produce these terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't66' as per NT36 -> NT6 NT78, but also NAH, looking at NT36, is it a direct terminal? Looking back, I see NT33 \u2192 't18', but wait, the string has t36. So maybe NT36 is part of a production that eventually leads to t36. Wait, actually, no, some of the NT terms directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking for NT that directly produce 't36', 't96', etc. Let's see:\n\n- NT46 -> 't64' (Wait, that's for NT46)\n- NT55 -> 't19'\n- NT59 -> 't46'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT33 -> 't32'\n- NT29 -> 't87'\n- NT19 -> 't0'\n- NT9 -> 't18'\n- NT24 -> 't2'\n- NT52 -> 't42'\n- NT61 -> 't36' (Ah, NT61 directly produces t36)\n- NT58 -> 't95'\n- NT67 -> 't74'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT73 -> 't53'\n- NT88 -> 't72'\n- NT33 -> 't32'\n- NT27 -> 't7' (and others)\n\nWait, actually, looking through the productions, I see that NT61 -> 't36', so 't36' is directly produced by NT61. Then, looking for the production of NT61. In the grammar, NT61 can be derived from NT65 -> NT61 NT65, but that leads back. Alternatively, looking elsewhere, perhaps NT61 is produced by another non-terminal.\n\nWait, wait. Let me structure this properly. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each step in the parse tree must split into two non-terminals, which themselves may split further until we reach the terminals.\n\nGiven the start symbol S, which can go to NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nThe string is t36 t96 t86 t30 t5 t46.\n\nSo, the sequence is six tokens. Let me think about how this could be broken down. It's possible that each step in the parsing produces two terminals, but each pair must form part of the sequence.\n\nWait, but each production splits into two non-terminals or a terminal. So in a parse tree, each internal node has two children, and the leaves are terminals.\n\nSo the string has six terminals, which would require a parse tree where the start symbol S splits into two non-terminals, each of which splits into another two, and so on until we reach the six terminal nodes. Hmm, but six is even, so maybe three splits on the left, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, each production in the grammar can only produce two terminals at each step. So the total number of leaves in the parse tree must be equal to the number of terminals in the string. Let's see: the string has six tokens. So to get six terminals, the parse tree must have six leaves. Let's see how that can happen.\n\nStarting from S, which splits into two non-terminals. Suppose S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Then each of NT61 and NT59 must produce a part of the string.\n\nIf NT61 produces t36, then NT61 must have a production NT61 \u2192 t36. Looking at the grammar, is that the case?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT61 has a production NT61 \u2192 NT36 NT78. But NT36 has NT6 NT78. Hmm, I don't see a direct production for NT61 \u2192 t36. Instead, NT61 is derived from NT65, which is derived from NT71, etc. It seems like NT61 eventually leads to t36 if that's part of its derivations.\n\nWait, let's look more carefully. The grammar shows NT61 \u2192 NT36 NT78. Then NT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78, and NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7. NT93 \u2192 't72', and NT7 \u2192 't74'.\n\nWait, that would produce t72 and t74 at that level, but the string has t36. Maybe another path.\n\nAlternatively, NT61 might have another production. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see NT61 \u2192 't36', but perhaps it's derived indirectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NT terms that directly produce 't36' or other terminals:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't87'\n- NT14 \u2192 't2'\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT33 \u2192 't32'\n- NT27 \u2192 't7'\n- NT6 \u2192 't74'\n- NT60 \u2192 't65'\n- NT93 \u2192 't72'\n- NT19 \u2192 't0'\n- NT9 --> 't18'\n- NT46 --> 't64'\n- NT24 --> 't2'\n- NT52 --> 't42'\n- NT31 --> 't54'\n- NT72 --> 't30'\nWait, no. NT72 produces 't30' because in the grammar, NT72 \u2192 't30' (I think. Wait, let me check: in the productions, I see NT72 \u2192 't30' as per NT72 -> 't30'). So if NT72 splits into t30, then that could be part of the string.\n\nAdditionally, the string ends with t46. Looking for which NT produces t46: NT46 \u2192 't64'? Wait, no, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT46 directly producing t46. Wait a minute, perhaps I should check all the productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see NT46 producing a terminal. Looking again: NT46's productions are NT46 \u2192 NT96 NT33, and NT96 \u2192 't94', and NT33 \u2192 't32'. So NT46 would produce t94 and t32, which would be 't94' and 't32', but our string has t46. So that doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, let's see: in the grammar, there's NT24 \u2192 't2', and a production NT52 \u2192 't42', which would produce t42. So 't46' is not produced directly. Hmm, perhaps I need to look for another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at NT46. Let me check: looking for NT46: the productions are NT46 \u2192 NT96 NT33, which are two non-terminals. So NT46 can't directly produce a terminal. So how does 't46' come into play?\n\nWait, I must have misread.

{"custom_id":"request-104","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine if the string `t80 t64 t42 t87 t63 t5 t35` is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that in CNF, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar provided has a mix of both non-terminals and terminals, which are represented by words ending with 't', like 't80', 't64', etc.\n\nThe string to check has seven tokens: `t80`, `t64`, `t42`, `t87`, `t63`, `t5`, `t35`. \n\nTo determine if this string is in the language, I'll need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. Since it's a string of terminals, I can approach this by working backwards from the start symbol and see if each terminal can be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which has the following productions:\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo, the initial step is that S must expand into either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Since our string starts with `t80`, which is a terminal, I need to see if any of these non-terminals can produce `t80` as their last step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several rules where non-terminals produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal, but some direct productions produce terminals. For example, NT68 -> 't16' is a terminal production. However, in the given string, the terminals don't seem to be consecutive unless there's a way for the non-terminals to chain directly to them without intervening non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, most terminals are only produced by one-step rules. So, if a terminal is part of a production, it's only the result of that rule. So for `t80`, I need to find a non-terminal that directly produces `t80`. Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see an NT that produces `t80` directly. Let me scan all the rules to check.\n\nLooking through the list, here are some rules with terminals:\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n- NT88 -> 't72'\n- NT95 -> 't94'\n- NT9 -> 't18'\n- NT5 -> 't83', etc.\n\nHmm, none of them produce `t80`. So, if the first symbol is `t80`, which can't be produced directly by any non-terminal in a single step, then the string can't be derived from S in a single expansion. But wait, maybe through multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in checking. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT93 can produce 't72', but that's not `t80`. Let me make sure I didn't miss any NT that produces `t80`. Checking all the grammar rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces `t80`. So, that suggests that the string cannot begin with `t80`, as no non-terminal directly expands to `t80`.\n\nBut wait, is there a chain where a non-terminal that expands to a terminal followed by another non-terminal might result in `t80` after some steps? For example, perhaps NT61 expands to something that leads to `t80`, and so on.\n\nBut given that the string begins with `t80`, I think it's impossible to derive `t80` as the first symbol unless there's a rule that allows a non-terminal to produce `t80` directly, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string `t80 t64 t42 t87 t63 t5 t35` cannot be generated by the given grammar because `t80` is not a direct production of any non-terminal in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a bunch of productions. Each non-terminal (like S, NT2, NT4, etc.) is defined in terms of other non-terminals, and some of them directly produce terminal symbols ('t' plus a number). The string I'm checking is composed of these terminals, so I need to see if it's a possible output of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it has two productions:\n- S -> NT61 NT59\n- S -> NT29 NT9\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals that then expand into the given terminals. But the string starts with `t66`, which is a terminal symbol. So first, I need to check if any of the grammar rules can derive 't66' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT66 expands to t95 (since NT66 is a rule that says NT66 -> 't'95). Wait, but wait: looking back, the productions include NT56 -> 't38' and NT96 -> 't87', etc., but I need to find which non-terminals directly produce t66. Let me scan the list.\n\nWait, I see NT60 -> t49, NT67 -> t53, NT74 is not a production I see here. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check the given productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n- NT66 is not a symbol I see in any production as a non-terminal on the left. Oh wait, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see:\n- NT67 -> t32, which is NT67 -> 't'32\nBut I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't66' except maybe NT28: Wait, checking again.\n\nNo, wait, looking more carefully, I don't see any NT66 in the list of productions on the left side, but do I see any NT that produces t66? Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking for 't66' as a terminal symbol. Checking the productions:\n\n- NT60 -> t65\n- NT67 -> t53\n- NT55 -> t5\n- NT56 -> t87\n- NT66: Are any of the NT rules producing t66? I think I might have missed it. Let me go through each rule:\n\nHmm, after checking each production, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't66'. So that means to derive 't66', I would need to find a path where a non-terminal NT leads directly to 't66', but none of the given productions do that. That would mean it's impossible to generate 't66' as the first symbol because there's no production that gives 't66'.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Is there any production where the LHS is a non-terminal and the RHS is 't66'? Scanning the list:\n\n- NT67 -> t53\n- NT66: Not present as a production's outcome, only as a non-terminal in some other productions.\n\nSo if the first symbol is 't66', then it requires that the first non-terminal in the first production (like S -> NT61 NT59 or S -> NT29 NT9) must be able to derive 't66' somehow.\n\nWait, for example, if I consider S -> NT29 NT9, then NT29 must expand to something that starts with 't66'. Similarly, if the string starts with 't66', perhaps the first NT29 is expanding into 't66' and something else. But if NT29 doesn't have a production that goes directly to 't66', then it's impossible.\n\nLooking again at the NT29 productions, I see NT29 -> 't2' and NT29 -> ... others. But not 't66'. So maybe the second symbol is 't50', which comes after 't66'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is 't66 t50 t74 t94 t30 t19 t35', which is seven symbols. Since the grammar starts with two non-terminals, the derivation would have to expand those into all these symbols. So maybe each step in the derivation produces more symbols.\n\nBut the problem is that 't66' can't be produced by any rule because there's no production with NT66 on the left, except perhaps looking for 't66' in the productions again, which I don't see.\n\nWait, I think I see a mistake here. Let me go through each production rule more carefully to make sure I didn't miss any NT that produces 't66':\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT61 -> t36\n- NT67 -> t32\n- NT29 -> t2, others\n- NT47 -> t73\n- NT79 -> t36\n- NT15 -> t9, etc.\n- Then later, I see NT66 isn't a left side, but do any right sides produce 't66'? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through each production, I see that NT66 isn't on the left side of any production. So the only NTs that produce terminals are those where the LHS is an NT and the RHS is a t followed by a number. So NT2 -> t64, NT31->t54, etc.\n\nWait, but the NT could have a chain. For example, maybe an NT can expand into another NT, which can expand into a terminal. So, to get 't66', I need a path where some NT eventually leads to t66.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any rules on the left-hand side have a non-terminal that, after expansion, will produce 't66'?\n\nLooking for NTs that can derive t66:\n\nWait, perhaps no NT directly or indirectly produces t66 because I can't find any non-terminal that can generate t66 in the productions.\n\nWait, let me check each production to see if any NT on the left can eventually produce t66:\n\nWait, for example, NT66 isn't present on the left, but perhaps other NTs can produce it via chains.\n\nAlternatively, is there an NT that can eventually produce t66 through a chain of productions?\n\nLooking at each non-terminal:\n\n- NT60 -> t49, so if a chain leads to NT60, then t49 is produced.\n- NT67 -> t53, so that leads to t53.\n- No NT that directly produces t66, so any path that leads to t66 would require an NT that can reach it, but it's not present.\n\nTherefore, since there is no rule that allows any non-terminal to produce 't66' directly, and no indirect path seems to lead to it, the string 't66 t50 t74 t94 t30 t19 t35' cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is 't66', which the grammar cannot produce.\n\nAdditionally, let's look at the rest of the string for any other inconsistencies, but since the first symbol can't be produced, the entire string can't be derived.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again the productions to confirm that none of them can produce 't66':\n\nLooking through all 80+ productions, I don't see any left-hand side that leads to t66. The productions are as follows:\n\n- NT5 -> t18, t5, t83, etc.\n- NT22 -> 't2', NT27 -> 't7', etc.\n- NT84 -> t57, etc.\n\nNo NT on the left leads to t66.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because all the productions on the right side have either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string provided is \"t80 t42 t9 t5 t87 t48 t19 t46\". It looks like it's a sequence of terminal symbols, and the rest of the grammar is made up of non-terminals that expand into these terminals. My task is to see if this specific sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So the first step is to see if the string starts with any of the options that could lead to the given t's.\n\nLet's examine the initial symbols:\n\nThe string starts with \"t80 t42 t9 t5 t87 t48 t19 t46\". The first token is t80. I remember from the grammar that several non-terminals expand into t. For example, NT93 \u2192 t72, NT5 \u2192 t5, etc. I'll need to figure out which production leads to t80.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6. Wait, no, that's not it. Let me check again. The productions for t's are all under certain non-terminals. Like, NT93 \u2192 t72, which means that when NT93 is expanded, it becomes t72.\n\nWait, but the initial production for S is either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Let's see what these non-terminals expand into.\n\nLooking at NT61: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65.

Hmm, let me start by looking at the grammar rules and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar rules are all in the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for Chomsky normal form. Each non-terminal on the left side produces two non-terminals on the right. So, to parse a string, I might need to work backwards from the start symbol, S, and see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two rules: S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So, the initial productions for S are either NT61 followed by NT59 or NT29 followed by NT9. The string starts with t66, so I need to see if either of these initial productions can lead to t66 being the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the other rules, I see that NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So, if I start with S \u2192 NT61 NT59, the next step is to expand NT61 into NT33 NT55. That would give us NT33 NT55 NT59. Each of these are still non-terminals, so we need to keep expanding.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and NT55 \u2192 NT61 NT84. So expanding further: NT32 NT72 NT61 NT84 NT59. Now, NT61 can again be expanded into NT33 NT55. So we get NT32 NT72 NT33 NT55 NT84 NT59.\n\nThis seems to be getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Alternatively, I can try to match the string from the end to see if it can be derived by the grammar.\n\nThe string is `t66 t50 t50 t96 t67 t30 t19 t35`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So I need to see if the non-terminals can generate these terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol, t66. I need to find a rule where the left-hand side (LHS) can derive to t66. Looking through the rules, some non-terminals have rules that include t66 as a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT18 \u2192 t2, NT60 \u2192 t49, NT76 \u2192 t96, etc. Wait, NT93 \u2192 t72, NT56 \u2192 t9, NT55 \u2192 t5, NT33 \u2192 t32, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, certain non-terminals expand directly into a terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 t61, NT46 \u2192 t60, NT88 \u2192 t33, and others.

For example, NT61 \u2192 t36, wait no, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, not going directly to a terminal. So, perhaps the initial non-terminals like S can only generate two non-terminals each time, not a terminal directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t66 comes from a non-terminal that eventually expands into t66. Let me look at the rules again to see if any non-terminals can generate t66.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT67 \u2192 t31, NT83 \u2192 t41, NT56 \u2192 t51, NT95 \u2192 t94. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, another approach: each token is either a non-terminal or a terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to trace back from each terminal to see if it's possible that the non-terminals can generate that terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a parse tree starting from S and see if it can derive the string, but that might take a long time given the depth of the string.\n\nWait, the string has 8 tokens, so the derivation would be of length 8, which is manageable.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nLooking at the first symbol t66. If we take S \u2192 NT61 NT59, can NT61 derive to t66 first? Or if we take S \u2192 NT29 NT9, can NT29 derive to t66? Wait, NT29 \u2192 t62, which is a terminal. So NT29 can't be the first step, because the first token is t66, which isn't a terminal from NT29. Wait, no, wait: the string starts with t66, but NT29 is a non-terminal. So the initial step would be S \u2192 NT29 NT9, which would expand to NT29 and NT9, which can't be t66 because NT29 is a non-terminal, so that path wouldn't generate t66. Therefore, the only starting option is S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo after S, we have NT61 NT59. Now, NT61 is a non-terminal. Let's see where NT61 can expand. Looking at the rules, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.\n\nSo expanding, we have NT33 NT55 NT59. Now, NT33 is a non-terminal. Let's see: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72.\n\nSo now, NT32 NT72 NT55 NT59.\n\nNT32 is a non-terminal. NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65.\n\nNow, NT18 NT72 NT55 NT59.\n\nNT18 \u2192 t2, according to the rules.\n\nSo now, after NT18, we have t2 NT72 NT55 NT59.\n\nBut the next token in the string is t50, so t2 doesn't match the second token t50. Therefore, this path is not correct. So perhaps this initial expansion is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider other expansions. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Since the string starts with t66, and t66 is a terminal. Let's see if any non-terminals directly expand to t66. Looking through the rules, does any NT have a rule that directly goes to t66?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT66 \u2192 t95? Wait, I don't see NT66's rule. Wait, I'm looking through the provided rules:\n\nNT66 is actually a non-terminal, and looking at the rules, I don't see any NT66 \u2192 something that goes to a terminal. Let me check again:\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nNT18 \u2192 t2\nNT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60\nSo,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, and I can probably use a method like CYK parsing, but I'm not sure if I need to go that deep. Maybe I can break down the string into its components and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the production rules for reference, but it's a lot. Instead of scrolling through all of them, maybe I can look for patterns or key components in the string that can guide me.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens: t87, t96, t96, t86, t66, t32, t30, t64, t35. Each token is a terminal, so in the derivation, these must be the result of applying production rules that replace non-terminals with these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example, NT5 -> 't5' and some other NTs like NT10 -> 't96' and NT95 -> 't94'. So I can check if the tokens appear as direct productions from their respective non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. The way the grammar is structured, the derivation must start from S and expand until we get the string. So, I need to see if each terminal can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, according to the first rule, S can produce NT61 NT59. So S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nNow, each of these can be expanded further. Let's see:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 (from NT61: NT61 -> NT33 NT55)\nNT55 \u2192 NT19 NT27 (from NT55 production: NT55 -> NT19 NT27)\n\nWait, but 35 is the last token, and the string ends with t35. So maybe I should track how each part of the string is generated.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trace back from the string to see if each token can be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar, working backward from the end.\n\nLet me list all the tokens and see if any of them are direct productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't96' (so t96 is produced by NT10)\n- NT83 \u2192 't25' (t25 is an option, not in our string)\n- NT87 \u2192 't48' Hmm, wait, earlier I thought NT67 \u2192 t87? Let me check. Wait, no. Let me look through the rules for NT87.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 't63' and others, but for NT87, I see NT87 \u2192 't48' and NT78 \u2192 't53' and so on. Wait, but that might not directly correspond. Hmm, maybe I should look through each rule to see if any token is a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the rules, NT59 \u2192 't46' and NT29 \u2192 't62', so t62 is another option. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 't2' etc. So for the string, I need to see if each token is directly produced by a non-terminal.\n\nSo let me go through the string token by token:\n\n1. t87: Does any non-terminal produce t87? Let's see. Looking through the rules, I see NT87 appears as a non-terminal, but do any productions for NT87 produce a terminal? Let me check. Oh, I see NT87 \u2192 't48' and also NT67 \u2192 t87. Wait, looking through the rules, yes:\n\nLooking at the rules, I find:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\n\nNT87 \u2192 't48' (in NT88->'t72' is not, but checking all, I think NT87 is:\n\nLooking back, I see in the rules, NT67 is present multiple times, but as a terminal, I don't see. Wait, wait: looking through the entire list again:\n\n\"NT67 -> NT57 NT14\"\n\n\"NT87 -> 't48'\"\n\nYes, so NT87 can produce t48, but in our string, the first token is t87. So that's a problem because NT87 can't produce t87. Wait, unless I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check each production. For NT67:\n\n- There are two entries: NT67 -> NT57 NT14 and NT67 -> NT29 NT87. So no, NT67 can produce t87 only if it's written as a terminal there. Wait, no, in my earlier analysis, wait, let me find the exact rule:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see two NT67 productions:\n\nNT67 -> NT57 NT14\n\nNT67 -> NT29 NT87\n\nWait, so does any NT67 produce a terminal? Let me look.\n\nYes, in the rules, NT87 \u2192 't48' and NT67 is part of several productions, but I don't see any where NT67 directly produces a terminal except perhaps in NT87.\n\nWait, no, in other rules, like NT56 \u2192 't51' or NT5 \u2192 't83' etc.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't66' (so produces t66)\n\nNT65 \u2192 't32' \n\nNT55 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT93 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT61 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT60 \u2192 't49'\n\nand so on for each NT rule. So each Non-Terminal either produces two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- NT87 \u2192 t48\n\nSo, NT87 can produce t48.\n\n- NT66 \u2192 t5\n\n- Similarly, NT69: Wait, do I see any NT in the rules that produce t87 directly?\n\nWait, the string starts with t87, so if t87 is generated by NT28, NT87 etc., do any NTs produce t87?\n\nLooking for any rule where an NT produces t87:\n\nI see: NT67 \u2192 't48', and NT19 \u2192 't0', but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t87, so we need a NT that can produce t87 as a terminal. However, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t87. Only NT87 produces t48, not t87.\n\nWait, so does that mean that t87 cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar? Because all the NT rules that have terminals don't have t87, except NT67 can produce t48, which is another token in the string.\n\nBut in the string, it's t87 followed by t96, then t96 again etc. So how can that be?\n\nWait, maybe the string is generated by chaining NTs through the rules. So, perhaps the derivation involves a path where a NT can expand to t87 through some chain.\n\nBut wait, according to the rules, for example, N67 can lead to NT57 and NT14, but if NT57 has a terminal, then t87 would come from NT57? Wait, I'm confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to identify which NTs can generate each token in the string.\n\nLet's list the tokens and see if any NT can produce each:\n\n1. t87: Does any NT produce t87? From the rules, looking for NT X where X \u2192 't87'. I don't see any.\n\n2. t96: NT10 \u2192 't96'\n\n3. t96: same as above.\n\n4. t86: Looking at the rules, maybe NT68 \u2192 't93' isn't helpful. Wait, in the rules, looking for 't86', I see NT59 \u2192 't46' and NT29 \u2192 't62', but elsewhere:\n\nWait, checking all the NT rules to find if any produce t86:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't66'\n\nWait, does any NT directly produce 't86'?

Hmm, let me first understand the grammar and the string I need to check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see it's made up of various NT symbols on the left and combinations of other NTs or terminal symbols 't' on the right. Each production is in the form A -> BC, which is typical for Chomsky normal form.\n\nThe string consists of nine tokens separated by spaces. Each token is either an NT symbol or a terminal 't' followed by a number.\n\nMy plan is to work backward from the string and see if I can construct it using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step involves splitting the current string into pairs of symbols and matching them against the productions.\n\nLet me list the string again: t74 t38 t5 t42 t64 t54 t63 t19 t35. That's nine tokens, which is an odd number, but in Chomsky normal form, each production appends two symbols at a time. So the derivation length should be a power of 2. Wait, nine is not a power of 2, so that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, and S is initially NT61 NT59 based on the first two productions.

Now, I need to see how each of these NTs can be expanded.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT61 and NT59:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT59 \u2192 NT46 NT59\n\nWait, NT59 \u2192 NT46 NT59. That's a recursive rule. Hmm, but in Chomsky normal form, recursive rules can cause infinite loops, but since we have the string to derive, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S expands to NT61 NT59.

{"custom_id":"request-168","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t87 t96 t86 t80 t99 t9 t5 t54 t63 t64\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by looking at the grammar rules and the provided string.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S and has several production rules. The string to check is a sequence of symbols consisting of 't' followed by numbers. I think each 'tX' corresponds to a terminal rule in the grammar, which is a production rule that directly leads to a terminal symbol, as seen in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal that directly produces a 't' followed by a number, like NT5 -> 't61', etc. These are terminal productions.\n\nThe string given is: t87 t96 t86 t80 t99 t9 t5 t54 t63 t64.\n\nI notice that each 'tX' corresponds to a terminal production in the grammar. My task is to see if there's a derivation in the grammar that can generate this string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two parts, and eventually, all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of 10 terminals. To generate such a string, the derivation path must produce these terminals in the correct order. The length of the string should be one less than the number of productions applied, starting from S.\n\nLet me count the number of symbols in the string: there are 10 terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. The initial S is a single non-terminal, and each step increases the number of symbols by one. To get a string of length 10, we need 9 productions.\n\nBut it's more about the structure of the string and whether each terminal can be derived from the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each 'tX' corresponds to a single step where the non-terminal is replaced by that terminal. Therefore, each 'tX' can be thought of as a production that directly sends the non-terminal to that terminal.\n\nThus, the string is a sequence of terminals that would result from a sequence of productions starting from S. Each 'tX' in the string must be connected in a way that they form a valid path in the grammar.\n\nI can try to see if the given string can be produced by following the rules.\n\nEach 'tX' corresponds to an NT rule, so the symbols must be derived according to the production paths.\n\nLet me list the string as t87, t96, t86, t80, t99, t9, t5, t54, t63, t64.\n\nWait, but each tX represents a direct derivation, so each of these must be reachable by the grammar.\n\nBut in the grammar, some tX are in the same NT. For example, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT5 -> 't61', 't5', 't83', etc. Wait no, in the grammar, each line is a production. For example, line 2: S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nThen, looking for NT61: line 32 says NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then line 66: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72. NT32 is a production that goes to NT18 NT65. Wait, but in the string, we have t54, which corresponds to NT54-> 't64'. Let's check how that's derived.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to look at each 'tX' and see if it's produced by any NT's rule.\n\nWait, no. Each 'tX' is the result of a production where the NT rule directly sends to that terminal. So, for example, if NT5 can produce tX, then that's how that symbol is added.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's find which NT's directly produce the tX in the string.\n\nThe string is: t87, t96, t86, t80, t99, t9, t5, t54, t63, t64.\n\nLet's check each tX in the string and see if any NT's in the grammar produce them.\n\nt87: I look through the grammar rules. Line 4: NT67 \u2192 t53. Line 7: NT87 \u2192 t48. Line 18: NT88 \u2192 t33. Wait, looking through, I see:\n\nLooking for t87: line 27 says NT78 \u2192 t56 t5? Wait no, let's go step by step.\n\nLooking for each tX:\n\nt87: line 7 says NT87 \u2192 t48. So NT87 produces t48. No rule exists for t87 except NT58 \u2192 't66' and NT67 \u2192 't73' in line 29.\n\nWait, no, line 4: NT67 \u2192 t53. Line 7: NT87 \u2192 t48. Hmm, so where is t87? Wait, in the given grammar, line 18 is NT88 -> t42. So perhaps t87 is not a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because in the string, the terminals have to be exactly those produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the grammar lines are:\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nWait, some lines start with NTx -> tY. For example:\n\nLine 5: NT5 -> 't5'\n\nLine 7: NT87 \u2192 t48\n\nLine 27: NT78 \u2192 t56 t5?\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me list all the NT rules that directly go to a terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\nLine 1: NT61 \u2192 t87\n\nWait no, line 32 says NT61 \u2192 t61 and t55? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should create a list of NTs that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through each grammar line, any line where the RHS is just a 'tX' would mean that NT produces that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check each line:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT61 NT59.

{"custom_id":"request-188","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know about CNF. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol can only produce terminals. So, all the rules here should have either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT61 NT59, which fits the two non-terminals part. Other rules like NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95 also have two non-terminals. Some rules have a terminal, like NT68 \u2192 't12'. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t74 t87 t83 t99 t42 t0 t19 t87 t48 t19 t35`. So, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is CNF, the string should have a derivation tree where each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, eventually leaving only terminals. The string has 11 tokens, so the derivation should have a leftmost derivation where each step splits a non-terminal into two, leading to the full string.\n\nLet me start by checking which non-terminals are present in the string. The terminals are t0, t74, t83, t87, t94, t19, t48, t35. Looking through the production rules, some non-terminals map directly to a single t or a combination, like NT68 \u2192 t12.\n\nWait, but the first token is t74. Which rule produces t74? Looking through the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 t12, but I don't see any rule that produces t74. Hmm, that's a problem. Let me scan through all the production rules to see if any non-terminal produces t74.\n\nScanning each production, I see NT68 \u2192 t12, NT93 \u2192 t72, NT65 \u2192 t67 (but there's a more specific rule NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 as well, but that leads to more non-terminals). Wait, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces t74. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules more carefully, I see NT60 \u2192 t46, NT67 \u2192 t31, etc. There's no production that directly maps a non-terminal to t74. So, that suggests that t74 is not present as a terminal in any production rule. That would mean that the grammar doesn't produce t74 at all.\n\nSo, if the string contains t74, which it does, then the string cannot be derived from this grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the rules one more time. I'll list all the terminals from the productions:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t12\n\nNT93 \u2192 t72\n\nNT65 \u2192 t67 (via another rule)\n\nNT62 \u2192 t12, which is same as NT68?\n\nWait, no. NT62's production leads to t12 as well, but I don't see any NT producing t74. So, I think I was correct the first time.\n\nThus, the string has t74, which is not reachable from any production rule.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I see that S is the start symbol, and the initial productions are S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Each of these NT terminals seems to have their own productions leading down to terminals 't' followed by numbers or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of terminals: t74, t72, t9, t13, t99, t64, t42, t87, t63, t5, t35. Each of these corresponds to specific rules in the grammar.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string to see if it can be constructed by expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a top-down approach might work. Alternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string corresponds to the correct production.\n\nLet me list out the productions for each relevant NT:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT74: From the list, NT72 is defined as 't72'. So maybe NT74 isn't directly defined. Wait, wait, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT36 NT28\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT63 NT5\n\nBut trying to find NT74. Hmm, in the productions, I don't see NT74 directly. Wait, actually, in the list provided, I need to check if any NT ends with 74 as a terminal.\n\nLooking again: I see NT68 \u2192 't83', NT54 \u2192 't64', NT55 \u2192 't19', NT14 \u2192 't2', NT93 \u2192 't72', etc. I don't see NT74, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, looking at the productions, each is either a production to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, the string is: `t74 t72 t9 t13 t99 t64 t42 t87 t63 t5 t35`.\n\nSo each part is either a terminal or part of a non-terminal.\n\nFirst, t74: I don't see an NT that directly expands to t74 in the production list. Wait, looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT that ends with t74. Wait, for example, NT56 \u2192 't51', NT67 \u2192 't49', NT47 \u2192 't73', etc. So maybe NT74 is not part of the grammar? That's a problem because the string starts with t74, which isn't defined as any of the productions ending in t74. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, let me check the production rules again. Looking through each NT:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT96 NT33\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT86 NT52\n\nWait, I'm getting lost. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nI can think of the string as a sequence of terminals. Each terminal has to be the result of a production that ends with that terminal. So for t74, I need to see if any production ends with t74. Looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT with a rule that ends with t74. So that's a problem because the first symbol in the string is t74, which isn't defined in any of the productions.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me make sure. The grammar shows all possible productions, each is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a for terminals. So if the string starts with t74, but there's no production that expands to t74, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the production list, every NT either goes to two NTs or ends with a 't' followed by a number, but no NT ends with 't74'.

{"custom_id":"request-202","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the string \"t74 t12 t39 t79 t9 t79 t99 t64 t62 t48 t5 t46\" is generated by this grammar. That sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules: each production rule is either S \u2192 AB or A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol S can only produce two non-terminals. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit this form. Each non-terminal on the left is expanded into exactly two others, and all productions are in CNF.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, specifically \"t74 t12 t39 t79 t9 t79 t99 t64 t62 t48 t5 t46\". I notice that each terminal is enclosed in 't', followed by a number. This probably represents different terminals in the grammar. \n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree will be a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal, split into exactly two children.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo the first step is to see which of these can produce the string. The string starts with 't74', which is a terminal. I need to find a production that starts with NT61 or NT29 leading to 't74'.\n\nLooking through the productions, here's what I find:\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n- NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\n- NT72 \u2192 NT58 NT83\n- Wait, but looking at the given productions, I see that NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and NT72 \u2192 NT58 NT83. Hmm, but does any of these produce 't74'?\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the productions for NT61 and NT33 again. Oh, actually, the productions for NT61 are:\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n- NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\n- NT72 \u2192 NT58 NT83\n- NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23\n- NT66 \u2192 NT95\n- NT23 \u2192 NT13 NT28\n- NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\nWait, that seems too complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nSince the string starts with 't74', which is a terminal, I need to find a production for a non-terminal that directly produces 't74'. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 NT31 NT28\n- NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\n- NT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60\n- NT68 \u2192 NT93 NT88\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT65\n- NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6\n- NT47 \u2192 NT57 NT27\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n- NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\n- And so on.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the list provided, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't83'\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT7 \u2192 't74' (since NT7 -> t74 is listed)\n- Oh, there we go! So NT7 \u2192 t74.\n\nSo the first terminal t74 comes from NT7. That means in the derivation, the leftmost NT7 must have been expanded into t74.\n\nSo, how do we get to NT7? From S, the possible first steps are S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nLooking at the first option, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. If we expand NT61 and NT59, can we reach NT7?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second option, S \u2192 NT29 NT9. If we expand NT29 and NT9, could we get NT7? Let's check.\n\nFrom NT29, looking at the productions:\n- NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n- NT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n- NT19 \u2192 NT9 NT59\n- Wait, perhaps this path.\n\nBut let's try to see if any of the NT29's can produce something that leads to NT7. Alternatively, maybe the first option with NT61 and NT59 is more promising.\n\nWait, another approach: since NT7 is an intermediate, let me see if there's a path from S to NT7 via these productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So, to get to NT7, we need to see if either NT29 or NT9 can produce NT7.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions:\n- NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n- NT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n- NT19 \u2192 NT9 NT59\n- NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n- NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54\n- NT54 \u2192 t64\n\nWait, but that's not getting us to NT7.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n- NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54\n- NT54 \u2192 t64\nSo, that's also not reaching NT7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT61 leads to NT33, then to NT32 and NT72, then to NT58 and NT83, but NT83 is 't41', which doesn't match t74.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider other paths. Maybe NT77 can produce 't74'? Wait, checking the productions:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6\n- So, if we expand NT77, we might get two terminals and a non-terminal. But in the string, after t74 comes t12, t39, etc. So perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to see if I can match the entire string.\n\nThe string is: t74 t12 t39 t79 t9 t79 t99 t64 t62 t48 t5 t46.\n\nLet me split it into individual terminals and non-terminals. Each t followed by a number is a terminal. So we have:\n\nt74, t12, t39, t79, t9, t79, t99, t64, t62, t48, t5, t46.\n\nEach of these must correspond to either a terminal directly (like t74) or a non-terminal that can produce that terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S, we need to derive the string step by step.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe first symbol is t74, which comes from NT7 \u2192 t74.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT29 NT9 (since from S's first production, S \u2192 NT29 NT9). Then, one of these non-terminals must expand to t74. But neither NT29 nor NT9 directly produce t74, as we saw earlier. So that might be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, the second production from S is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Let's check if either NT61 or NT59 can produce t74.\n\nLooking at NT61's productions: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Neither of those are t74. So NT61 must expand further.\n\nLooking at NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and NT72 \u2192 NT58 NT83. None of these are t74. So maybe that's not the right path either.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps, instead of starting from S, I should look for a part of the string that directly results from a non-terminal that produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string again: it starts with t74. So, we need a non-terminal that can produce t74.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT7 \u2192 t74. So, perhaps the derivation starts with NT7 producing t74.\n\nBut NT7 is a non-terminal that doesn't appear in the start symbol's production (S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9). So how can NT7 appear in the string? That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a longer chain. Let me consider if any of the non-terminals in the grammar can eventually produce t74 through a series of expansions.\n\nLooking at NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86.\n\nNT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the productions to see what terminals and non-terminals we're dealing with. The terminals in the productions are 't' followed by numbers like t74, t87, etc. The non-terminals are everything that's not a terminal, so from the grammar, they seem to be S, NT47, NT79, NT15, NT65, etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the goal is to parse the given string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which is used for context-free grammars in CNF.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. Let's write them out:\n\n1. t74\n2. t87\n3. t95\n4. t13\n5. t9\n6. t5\n7. t42\n8. t64\n9. t62\n10. t48\n11. t5\n12. t35\n\nWait, no, the string is `t74 t87 t95 t13 t9 t5 t42 t64 t62 t48 t5 t35`, so 12 tokens in total.\n\nI should think about how each of these terminals was derived. Each terminal appears in the productions on the right-hand side. Let me list each terminal and see their possible sources.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to match the grammar. Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So the initial parse would have S producing NT61 and NT59. Each of these can produce more terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, each production of NT in the grammar leads to two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. NT33 then can produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nBut working this out manually for a long string would take a lot of steps. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down into the possible sequences from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a context-free grammar in CNF, we can consider the number of symbols. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.

Hmm, first, let me look at the grammar rules. They're all in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly two non-terminals on the right. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form is when each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the rules here seem to fit that, except some have two non-terminals, which is allowed.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals, each starting with 't', like 't74', 't72', etc. So the idea is that the string should be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. Let me try to parse the string from the given rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't74'. I'll check if any production ends with 't74'. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT68 \u2192 't83', but I'm not sure. Wait, 't74' appears in the production for NT67: NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14 and also in NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, looking for 't74' output, according to the given rules, 't74' is the output of NT6 \u2192 't74'. So to get 't74', I need NT6 \u2192 't74' in the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking at the production rules, NT6 is defined as NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check each rule for producing terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I find:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74' (rule at position 60)\nNT65 \u2192 't32' (53)\nNT66 \u2192 't66' (54)\nNT67 \u2192 't57' (57)\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, let me list all terminals:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't64' (16)\nNT5 \u2192 't61' (46?), no, wait, looking at all the rules:\n\nWait, the rules are listed as:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\nNT20 \u2192 NT73 NT73\nNT2 \u2192 NT64\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nNT67 \u2192 NT31 NT28\nNT5 \u2192 't61'\nWait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I should use a parsing algorithm, like the CYK algorithm, but given the string is 13 symbols long, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but another approach is to look for a path through the grammar that generates the entire string. Let's start from the start symbol S, which is S -> NT61 NT59. So the string should be built by expanding NT61 and NT59.\n\nLet's see NT61: according to the rules, looking at the given productions, I don't see NT61 producing a terminal. Let's check all the rules. Scanning through:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 (14: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55)\nSo NT61 splits into NT33 and NT55.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure will help me parse the string effectively.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production for S is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So, S expands into NT61 and NT59. Let me write the string and see what each part could represent.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals: t80, t64, t79, t64, t39, t79, t12, t2, t60, t63, t48, t5, t35. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. I need to see if these terminals can be generated by expanding the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59, I can substitute these into the string. So, the first symbol should be from NT61 and the second from NT59. Let's check:\n\nFrom the string, the first terminal is t80. Looking at the productions for NT61, I see NT61 \u2192 NT36 NT78 (from line: NT61 -> NT36 NT78). Hmm, but in the string, the next is t64, which is after t80. Wait, maybe I should parse the entire string as a sequence of non-terminals being expanded into terminals.\n\nPerhaps it's better to approach this with a top-down parsing strategy, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo, the first two non-terminals are NT61 and NT59. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nLooking at NT61:\nNT61 \u2192 NT36 NT78 (line 17)\nNT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78 (line 31)\nNT6 \u2192 t74 (line 6)\nNT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5 (line 26)\nNT56 \u2192 NT9 NT23 (line 54)\nWait, but NT9 is a non-terminal. Let's follow NT56.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT86 NT33 (line 55)\nNT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55 (line 55)\nWait, looking again: NT56 \u2192 NT9 NT23? No, checking line 54: NT56 \u2192 NT9 NT23? Wait, no, line 55 says NT56 \u2192 NT86 NT33. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLet me parse step by step:\n\nNT61 expands to NT36 NT78. Then NT36 expands to NT6 NT78.\n\nSo, the first part would be NT6 \u2192 t74, then NT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5.\n\nWait, NT78 is followed by NT5. So, NT78 is NT56 NT5. Let's expand NT56 first.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT9 NT23. NT9 is a production that eventually leads to terminals, but let's check NT56: looking at the grammar, NT56 has two options: NT86 NT33 and NT9 NT23. Wait, line 55 says NT56 \u2192 NT86 NT33, so perhaps I should follow that.\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple productions for each non-terminal. So, for NT56, the first production is NT86 NT33 (line 55), and the second is NT9 NT23 (line 54). Hmm, which one to choose? Well, perhaps we can choose the first one since it leads to a terminal earlier.\n\nSo, NT56 \u2192 NT86 NT33.\n\nThen, NT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55 (line 55). So, NT86 expands into NT19 and NT55.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT24 NT2? Wait, looking at the productions: line 19 says NT19 \u2192 NT9 NT59. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me check line numbers.\n\nWait, line 19 is actually the production for NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT2, as line 19 says: NT19 -> NT24 NT2 (it might be a typo in the initial listing, but the user likely intended that).\n\nSo, NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT2.\n\nNT24 \u2192 is there a production? Looking at line 22: NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67. So, NT24 might not have a direct production. Wait, the user's grammar shows line 22 as NT22 \u2192 NT67 NT67. Hmm, perhaps I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, line 22: NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67. But NT22 is another non-terminal. It seems that NT24 is perhaps meant to have a production, but looking through the grammar provided, I don't see a production for NT24 except when it's part of another non-terminal's production, like NT22. So maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's grammar includes line 24: NT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29, and so on. Wait, perhaps I misassigned NT24.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the entire grammar again. Let me list the relevant non-terminals and their productions that involve NT61 and NT59.\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT36 NT78\nNT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78\nNT6 \u2192 t74\nNT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5\nNT56 \u2192 NT86 NT33\nNT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55\nNT19 \u2192 NT24 NT2 (line 19)\nNow, what about NT24? Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT24 except when it's part of NT22 \u2192 NT24 NT67 (line 22), but that's not directly helpful. Hmm, is NT24 a terminal? Probably not. So, maybe I'm taking a wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that NT56 could expand to NT9 NT23 (line 54) instead. Let's explore that path.\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT36 NT78 \u2192 NT6 NT78 \u2192 t74 NT78.\n\nNow, NT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5.\n\nIf NT56 \u2192 NT9 NT23 (line 54), then NT56 expands into NT9 and NT23.\n\nNT9 \u2192 t18 (line 18: NT9 -> t18).\n\nNT23 \u2192 t3 (line 2: NT23 \u2192 t3).\n\nSo, NT56 \u2192 t18 t3.\n\nTherefore, the expansion would be: t74 t18 t3.\n\nBut in the string, after t80, we have t64, which is much earlier than t74. Wait, this seems off. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm trying to parse the string incorrectly. The string is `t80 t64 t79 t64 t39 t79 t12 t2 t60 t63 t48 t5 t35`.\n\nWait, maybe I should construct a parse tree where S \u2192 NT61 NT59, which expand into terminals. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a top-down parse and see if the string can be generated.\n\nLet me try to see what the entire string could represent by following possible expansions.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo, the first part is NT61, which expands as:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT36 NT78.\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t74.\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5.\n\nNow, NT56 has two options: NT86 NT33 or NT9 NT23.\n\nOption 1: NT56 \u2192 NT86 NT33.\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT24 NT2.\n\nNT24 is a problem because I don't see a direct production. Wait, checking the grammar, does NT24 have a production? Looking at lines, I don't see a production for NT24 except when it's part of NT22 (line 22: NT22 \u2192 NT24 NT67). Wait, but NT24 isn't a terminal either. Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here.\n\nOption 2: NT56 \u2192 NT9 NT23.\n\nNT9 \u2192 t18.\n\nNT23 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo, NT56 \u2192 t18 t3.\n\nNow, let's put it all"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-243","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t87 t96 t86 t74 t51 t5 t42 t99 t0 t19 t42 t62 t63 t64` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. It consists of several productions that expand start symbol S and non-terminals NT followed by numbers. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, and these represent the tokens in the string we're evaluating. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that S starts with NT61 NT59. So the string must derive from these two non-terminals. Let me check the string: the first token is t87. So I need to see if t87 can be derived from NT61 or NT59, but looking at the productions, I see NT61 and NT59 are expanded into combinations of other NTs and sometimes into terminals.\n\nWait, some of the NTs directly expand into terminals. For example, NT23 -> 't79' and other NTs expand into 't's. So in the string, t79 would come from NT23. Similarly, NT29 -> 't62', NT24 -> 't2', etc.\n\nLet me see if I can break down the string step by step. The string is a sequence of terms t87, t96, t86, t74, t51, t5, t42, t99, t0, t19, t42, t62, t63, t64. That's 14 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, so each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one. \n\nStarting from S, which splits into two non-terminals, each of which can split further, leading to leaves that are terminals. So the derivation tree will have a height log2(n), where n is the number of symbols. Here, n=14, so the height would be around 4, but 2^4=16, so maybe 15 steps?\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to see if each token corresponds to a rule. Let's look for possible productions that can derive each t.\n\n1. t87: Looking at the productions, NT88 -> t42, NT67 -> t38, NT62 -> t12, NT87 -> t48, NT96 -> t86, NT60 -> t49, NT73 -> t53, etc. Hmm, do I have any NT that directly produces t87? Yes, looking back, NT67 -> t38, NT93 -> t72, but I don't see an NT that produces t87 directly. Wait, let me double-check. The given productions don't have any NT that produces t87 directly. So maybe t87 comes from a combination of two non-terminals, which each derive into something else that results in t87. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check if any pair of non-terminals can combine to t87. Alternatively, perhaps I have to look for the chain of derivations. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the full list of productions again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see for example NT77 -> NT79 NT6, and NT79 -> NT36 NT52. So if I have NT77, it can produce NT36 and NT6. But I need to check if any NT can produce a terminal and see if that can chain up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the entire string and seeing if each 't' can be matched by a production. But some NTs only go to terminals, while others go into other NTs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to parse the string backward, using the yacc-like approach. Since each production is two non-terminals, maybe I can see if the string can be split into pairs that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me try to split the string into pairs and check possible productions.\n\nThe string is: t87, t96, t86, t74, t51, t5, t42, t99, t0, t19, t42, t62, t63, t64.\n\nI need to see if these can be grouped in pairs that match the productions. Wait, but the number of terminals is 14, which is even, but each production in the grammar is two non-terminals, so the entire derivation could result in a string with any number of terminals, but here it's 14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each step combines two non-terminals into one, so the number of non-terminals decreases, but the terminals are built up.\n\nBut maybe it's better to look for whether each 't' is the result of a direct production.\n\nLet's go through each token:\n\n1. t87: Does any NT in the grammar produce t87? Looking at the productions, I don't see an NT that directly produces t87. The closest is NT24 -> t2, NT29 -> t62, NT33 -> t32, etc.\n\nSo t87 must be derived from a combination of two NTs, each of which may be a terminal or another NT.\n\n2. t96: Similarly, any NT that directly produces t96?\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see an NT that directly produces t96. The closest is NT56 -> t9, etc.\n\n3. t86: Checking NT85 (no, don't see), wait NT60 -> t65. Not directly. Wait, NT29 -> t62, NT59 -> t99, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think about each 't' as being generated by a specific NT rule. So, t87 must come from NT87, but NT87 isn't directly in the productions, but check if any NT expands into NT87. Looking at the grammar, let me list all the NTs that have a rule leading to terminals or other NTs.\n\nNT1: Doesn't exist. Wait, the NTs start with NT0? No, the given grammar starts with NT47, etc. Wait, looking at the given grammar, the non-terminals are all starting with NT followed by numbers, like NT47, NT29, etc.\n\nSo let's list all NTs and see which ones have direct terminals.\n\nNT47 -> NT58 NT95\nNT29 -> NT14 NT86\nNT65 -> NT71 NT65 (loop, probably not useful)\nNT79 -> NT36 NT52\nNT15 -> NT48 NT59\nNT65 -> NT10 NT96\nNT78 -> NT93 NT7\nNT65 -> NT10 NT96\nNT29 -> NT14 NT86\nNT83 -> NT24 NT46\nNT88 -> NT15 NT29\nNT36 -> NT6 NT78\nNT93 -> NT62 NT83\nNT15 -> NT15 NT77 (loop)\nNT73 -> NT26 NT24\nNT68 -> NT93 NT88\nNT17 -> NT46 NT54\nNT60 -> NT68 NT52\nNT67 -> NT57 NT14\nNT67 -> NT29 NT87\nNT70 -> NT52 NT81\nNT58 -> NT66 NT23\nNT2 -> NT52 NT86\nNT31 -> NT26 NT29\nNT57 -> NT17 NT27\nNT78 -> NT56 NT5\nNT20 -> NT73 NT73\nNT7 -> NT19 NT23\nNT77 -> NT79 NT6\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\nNT27 -> NT7 NT28\nNT77 -> NT55 NT61 (another rule for NT77)\nNT20 -> NT52 NT70\nNT15 -> NT71 NT47\nNT5 -> NT61 NT84\nNT46 -> NT96 NT33\nNT84 -> NT57 NT20\nNT67 -> NT31 NT28\nNT22 -> NT2 NT67\nNT86 -> NT19 NT55\nNT33 -> NT32 NT72\nNT32 -> NT18 NT65\nNT17 -> NT9 NT59\nNT9 -> NT10 NT17\nNT83 -> NT66 NT8\nNT65 -> NT6 NT60\nNT7 -> NT83 NT93\nNT5 -> NT58 NT86\nNT33 -> NT79 NT22\nNT68 -> 't12'\nNT60 -> 't94'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT47 -> 't47'?

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol S. The start symbol S can produce NT61 and NT59, as seen from the first two rules: S -> NT61 NT59 and S -> NT29 NT9.\n\nSince we're dealing with a string composed of 't' followed by numbers, it seems each production rule ultimately resolves to a terminal symbol (like 't12') after a certain number of steps. Each non-terminal on the right side of a production must be expanded until only terminals remain.\n\nI'll inspect the given string and map each token to see if it corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Let's list them out:\n\n1. t80\n2. t42\n3. t9\n4. t5\n5. t18\n6. t35\n7. t2\n8. t79\n9. t12\n10. t39\n11. t60\n12. t63\n13. t48\n14. t19\n15. t46\n\nEach of these must be matched to a production rule, starting from the top (S) and breaking down each non-terminal until I reach terminals. Let's start with the string and see if it can be generated by following the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't80'. I need to see which rule produces 't80'. Looking through the grammar, I find that NT79 -> t80. So, to get 't80', we need to derive from NT79.\n\nNext, the token before 't80' in the string is 't79', but wait, in the string, the order is 't80' followed by 't42', etc. Actually, the string is a concatenation, so each token in the string must come from a leftmost derivation step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Starting from S, the first production can generate two non-terminals, which then need to produce the given tokens.\n\nLet me list the possible components:\n\nThe string starts with t80, which comes from NT79. So, the first part must be NT79 -> t80. That means I need to see if the part before NT79 can be broken down into the other components.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if each token can be matched by following the rules. Let me check each token in the string:\n\n1. 't80' comes from NT79 -> t80.\n2. The token before 't80' is 't42', which is from NT60 -> t42. So perhaps NT60 -> t42.\n3. Then 't9' is from NT66? Wait, looking back, I see NT55 -> t5. Wait, maybe not. Let me check NT55. Looking at NT55, the rule is NT55 -> NT56 NT5. NT56 is not a terminal, so that's not directly t55. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, I notice several production rules where non-terminals are replaced by a single terminal. For example, NT58 -> t66, NT27 -> t7 NT28, etc. So, each token is either an immediate production or requires expanding through multiple steps.\n\nLet me try to map the string backward, starting from the end, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I'll map each token to its production rule and see if they can form a valid parse tree.\n\nLet me jot down the tokens and see their possible sources:\n\n1. 't80' must come from NT79, as per the production NT79 -> 't80'.\n2. 't42' comes from NT60, as per NT60 -> 't42'.\n3. 't9' is from NT8? Wait, looking back, I see NT19 -> 't9' under the production NT19 -> 't9'. Wait, no, more accurately, in the production list:\n\nLooking through the rules, 't9' is produced by NT8 -> t9? Wait, no, wait. Let me check:\n\nIn the list, I see NT19 -> 't9' (production: NT19 -> t9). So 't9' is produced by NT19.\n\nThen 't5' comes from NT59 (NT59 -> 't5'), as per the rule NT59 -> 't5'.\n\nSo let me start building this as a possible parse tree.\n\nThe string is: t80 t42 t9 t5 t18 t35 t2 t79 t12 t39 t60 t63 t48 t19 t46\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- t80: NT79 -> t80\n- t42: NT60 -> t42\n- t9: NT19 -> t9\n- t5: NT59 -> t5\n- t18: NT93? Wait, looking for nt that produces t18: Looking at the production list, I see NT77 -> t16, NT72 -> t30, but not t18. Wait, perhaps I missed that. Let me check: Maybe NT39 -> 't39'? Wait, looking for 't18'.\n\nActually, I realize that for 't18', looking through the production list, I find that NT17 -> 't18' (since in the list, NT17 -> NT46 NT54, but also maybe another rule). Wait, looking closely, I see:\n\nLooking through the production list, I spot NT46 -> 't64', NT77 -> 't79', but perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps 't18' comes from NT54 -> 't18' (NT54 -> 't18'). Yes, that's right.\n\nSo t18: NT54 -> t18.\n\nt35: Looking for a production that produces t35. In the rules, I don't see a terminal 't35' directly. Wait, wait. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see a rule that directly produces 't35' as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nIn the production list, I see NT35 is mentioned under NT23 -> 't3'? Wait, no. Wait, looking for t35: Wait, is there a NT that produces t35? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the rules, NT33's productions: Not directly t35. Wait, perhaps the production for NT33 is NT32 NT72, which may not be relevant. Alternatively, perhaps 't35' is produced by NT55.\n\nLooking back, NT55 -> t5. No, that's not 't35'. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe 't35' is not a terminal but a non-terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look again. Let me check each rule for terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, I can see:\n\nNT58 -> t66\nNT27 -> t7 NT28\nNT77 -> t79\nNT6 -> t74\nNT65 -> t33\nNT83 -> t41\nNT23 -> t3\nNT29 -> t87\nNT8 -> t2\nNT19 -> t9\nNT24 -> t39\nNT29 -> t62\nNT48 -> t97\nBTW, perhaps 't35' is produced by NT62? Wait, looking at the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't35'.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. The string includes 't35', but I don't see any production in the grammar that directly produces 't35' as a terminal. That's a problem because, in a context-free grammar in CNF, each step should replace non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals until terminals are left.\n\nSo if 't35' is in the string but isn't produced by any rule, that would mean the string contains a terminal that the grammar doesn't produce, hence the string is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nLooking through all the grammar's terminal productions:\n\n- NT79 -> t80\n- NT60 -> t42\n- NT19 -> t9\n- NT59 -> t5\n- NT54 -> t18\n- NT5 -> t5 (but that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Honestly, this looks pretty complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It seems to consist of non-terminals (strings starting with 'N') and terminals (strings starting with 't'). Each production rule on the left (before '->') is an non-terminal, and the right side contains other non-terminals on terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a series of terminals: `t74, t72, t9, t79, t42, t64, t79, t64, t2, t60, t72, t63, t2, t19, t35`. So, to check if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if it can be derived through a series of productions starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two productions: S\u2192 NT61 NT59 and S\u2192 NT29 NT9. So, the string must start with either NT61 followed by NT59 or NT29 followed by NT9. In terms of terminals, these correspond to the starting 't's in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first 't' is t74. Wait, but the start productions are S\u2192 NT61 NT59, which would translate to the first 't' being from NT61. But according to the grammar, NT61 is a non-terminal, and looking at the productions for NT61, it's NT33 NT55. From the rules, NT33 can go to NT32 NT72, or in some cases, it's a terminal like t32 or t72.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start by analyzing the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t74 t72 t9 t79 t42 t64 t79 t64 t2 t60 t72 t63 t2 t19 t35.\n\nLet me note down all the steps and see if I can find a way to parse this string using the given grammar.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t74. Looking at the grammar, is there any production that directly produces t74?

{"custom_id":"request-287","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Hmm, first, I'll take a look at the grammar and the string we're checking. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string we're evaluating is: t48 t9 t19 t96 t96 t96 t96 t96 t96 t18 t46 t35 t46 t35 t46 t35.\n\nLet me start by building a parse tree for this string, working from the leaves up. Each production step should match parts of the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look for terminals that correspond to non-terminals in the grammar. For example, t48 is listed as corresponding to NT17. Since in Chomsky Normal Form, a terminal can be derived directly from a non-terminal, the production for NT17 is NT17 \u2192 t48.\n\nSimilarly, t9 corresponds to NT9\u2192 t9. \n\nLet me write down each terminal and what NT it corresponds to:\n\nt48 \u2192 NT17\n\nt9 \u2192 NT9\n\nt19 \u2192 NT19\n\nt96 \u2192 NT96\n\nt18 \u2192 NT18\n\nt46 \u2192 NT46\n\nt35 \u2192 NT35\n\nNow, let's break down the string into these Nts:\n\nThe string is: NT17, NT9, NT19, NT96 (five times), NT18, NT46 (three times), NT35 (three times).\n\nWait, actually, let's correct that. The string is t48 t9 t19 t96 t96 t96 t96 t96 t96 t18 t46 t35 t46 t35 t46 t35.\n\nSo the Nts are in the order: NT17, NT9, NT19, NT96 \u00d75, NT18, NT46 \u00d73, NT35 \u00d73.\n\nNow, to build the parse tree, I need to see how these Nts can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo, S can derive into two main branches: one starting with NT61 and another with NT29.\n\nI'll start by checking if the string can be split into two parts that correspond to these branches.\n\nLet me count the number of symbols. The string has 16 symbols. That's an even number, but depending on how the splits go, each branch might produce a certain number of symbols.\n\nWait, each production from S is a combination of two NTs, so each S derivation leads to two NTs. But each NT can be terminal or non-terminal. So, perhaps each NT in the right-hand side can produce one or more terminals, depending on the grammar.\n\nLet's try to model this. Each NT is either directly a terminal (like NT9 \u2192 t9) or has productions that split into two NTs, which in turn may be terminals or more splits.\n\nGiven that, I'll start from the root S and see if I can match the string by expanding each NT.\n\nFirst, let's note that each of the productions in the grammar either ends in a terminal or another NT that can derive into terminals.\n\nBut before diving deep, maybe a more structured approach would help.\n\nLet me list all the NTs and their direct terminal productions:\n\nNTs with productions ending in terminals:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t9\n\nNT17 \u2192 t48\n\nNT7 \u2192t83\n\nNT83\u2192 t66, t8\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs have productions that split into two NTs, such as NT14 \u2192 t2, which I think is directly a terminal. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 t2 \u2192 terminal\n- NT93 \u2192 t72\n- NT15 \u2192 t5\n- NT18 \u2192 t66\n- NT24 \u2192 t2\n- NT29 \u2192 t62\n- NT35 \u2192 t35? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT35 isn't listed. Wait, looking back, I think I might have misread some rules.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all NTs and their productions, checking if they end in terminals or just split into more NTs.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a sequence of Nts and see if they can be produced by the grammar starting from S.\n\nThe string is:\n\n[1] NT17\n[2] NT9\n[3] NT19\n[4] NT96 \u00d75\n[5] NT18\n[6] NT46 \u00d73\n[7] NT35 \u00d73\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo, the left side is NT61 and the right side is NT59. Alternatively, S could also be NT29 NT9.\n\nBut the given string starts with t48, which is NT17, not NT61 or NT29, so that seems off. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, hold on. The string starts with t48, which is NT17. Looking at the grammar, NT17's production is NT17\u2192t48. So the first symbol is produced by NT17.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, which NTs can derive into NT17?\n\nLooking through the rules, does any NT produce NT17? Let's see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t58, t84 \u2192 seems not to involve NT17.\n\nNT19 \u2192 t0, NT26 \u2192 t42, etc. Wait, I don't see any NT that produces NT17 directly except NT17 itself, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, wait, the first symbol is t48, which is NT17, so the left-hand side of the first production must be NT17, but looking at the grammar, the only nt that derives t48 is NT17, and that's a terminal, meaning it cannot be split further. So the first symbol must come from NT17: which is t48.\n\nSo, to derive the string, the first part must be NT17 \u2192 t48, then the next symbol is t9, which is NT9 \u2192 t9.\n\nSo, let's model this:\n\nThe first part of the string is t48 t9 \u2192 NT17 NT9.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, can NT17 and NT9 be part of the same S production?\n\nThe S productions are S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nSo if after NT9, we have a NT17, which is part of a production from S?\n\nWait, no. Because the S productions are to two NTs. So the initial S can go to NT61 and NT59, but in our case, the first two symbols are NT17 and NT9, which don't match the S's possible immediate splits since S must first split into two NTs, and those two would each need to be terminals or further split.\n\nBut in our case, the first two symbols are NT17 and NT9, which aren't part of S's first splits. S's first splits would be NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9. So for the string to start with NT17 and NT9, that can't directly come from S.\n\nWait, that suggests that the string might not be in the language because S can't directly produce NT17 and NT9 together. So perhaps the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way for NT17 and NT9 to be derived from S through other productions. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there a way to derive NT17 from the other NTs? For example, does any NT produce NT17?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NTs that have NT17 in their productions, except for NT17 itself, which is a terminal. So NT17 is a leaf.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the NT9, it produces t9.\n\nBut S can't directly split into NT17 and NT9 because the available S rules are S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So S can't have NT17 as one of its components.\n\nThat suggests that the string starting with t48 t9 can't be produced by S, because S's only immediate splits don't include NT17.\n\nWait, maybe there's a longer derivation where S produces something that can split into NT17 later. Let's think.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT29 NT9. The right side is NT29 and NT9. If neither NT29 nor NT9 can split into more NTs to produce NT17, then that split can't produce NT17.\n\nLooking at NT29: The grammar has NT29 \u2192 t62.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t74 t9 t95 t9 t19 t42 t99 t0 t19 t42 t48 t0 t5 t63 t5 t35`. It's a sequence of terminals, so each of these tokens must be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. \n\nI notice some production rules where non-terminals expand into terminal symbols. For example, `S -> NT61 NT59`, so S can be two non-terminals. But in the string, I don't see S as a terminal; instead, I see t's, which are the terminals. So, eventually, the non-terminals must derive into these t's.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, I see rules like NT68 -> 't83', NT14 -> 't2', etc. So, each of these non-terminals, when derived, produce a specific terminal token. \n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string step by step, looking for possible splits into production rules. \n\nThe string is: t74, t9, t95, t9, t19, t42, t99, t0, t19, t42, t48, t0, t5, t63, t5, t35.\n\nI need to see if this can be broken down into a sequence of productions, starting from S. Let me try to split the string into tokens that match the possible right-hand sides of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the first token, t74. From the grammar, NT68 -> 't83', so that's not helpful. NT67 -> 't51' and 't49'? Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, I see NT67 -> 't53' and 't51'? No, let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I find NT67 has two rules:\n\nNT67 -> 't53'\nNT67 -> 't62'\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules:\n\n- NT67 -> NT57 NT14\n- NT67 -> NT29 NT87\n- NT67 -> NT62 NT83\n- NT67 -> NT58 NT5\n\nHmm, and in the terminal rules, NT67 -> 't53'? Wait, no. Wait, in the terminal rules, I see for example:\n\nNT68 -> 't83'\nNT60 -> 't49'\nNT5 -> 't83'\nNT47 -> 't73'\nNT88 -> 't42'\nNT18 -> 't36'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT56 -> 't51'\nNT95 -> 't94'\nNT46 -> 't60'\nNT60 -> 't49'\n\nWait, I'm looking for 't74', which I don't see directly in the terminal rules except for NT9: in the terminals, I see NT9 -> 't18'. So, t74 isn't directly a terminal. So maybe I need to find a production that eventually leads to t74.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, are there any non-terminals that produce 't74'? Let's see. I see NT88 -> 't72', NT55 -> 't5', NT96 -> 't86', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT61 is defined as NT33 NT55, and NT33 is defined as NT32 NT72, NT32 as NT18 NT65, etc. But looking through the terminal rules, I don't see 't74' being produced by any non-terminal. \n\nWait a second, looking at the string: the first token is t74. If none of the non-terminals derive to t74, then this string cannot be produced by the grammar because there's no production for NTxxxx that gives 't74'.\n\nIs there any non-terminal that expands into 't74'? Let me scan the terminal rules.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT5 -> 't83'\n- NT47 -> 't73'\n- NT88 -> 't42'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't51'\n- NT95 -> 't94'\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT7 -> 't19'\n- NT77 -> 't79'\n- NT78 -> 't56'\n- NT67 -> 't53'\n- NT62 -> 't12' (but the string has t62? No, the string doesn't have that)\n- NT73 -> 't53'\n- NT20 -> 't37'\n- NT7 -> 't83'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't51'... etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any rule that gives 't74'.

So when NT73 expands, it becomes '53', which is two terminals.\n\nSimilarly, other NT rules:\n\nWait, is there any other production that directly leads to a terminal?

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the productions, S can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So the string starts with two non-terminals. The input string is a series of 't's followed by numbers. Oh wait, some of the productions have 't' followed by numbers, like 't12', 't24', etc. So some non-terminals derive directly to a 't' plus a number.\n\nThe string is: t74 t12 t41 t9 t3 t99 t99 t9 t5 t18 t35 t9 t13 t63 t48 t19 t35.\n\nI think the first step is to see if the entire string can be broken down into the productions. Maybe a top-down approach with a parser, but since it's a small string, I can try to see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't74'. Looking at the productions, NT68 \u2192 't83' and NT60 \u2192 't49' don't help. Wait, I need to check all the productions for terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT68 \u2192 't83' and NT60 \u2192 't49' etc. Wait, more importantly, I think NT60 \u2192 't49' and NT10 \u2192 't96' and some others derive to 't' with numbers.\n\nBut our string starts with 't74'. Looking at the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't74'. Wait, looking through the list: NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54, NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28, NT77 \u2192 NT55 NT61, NT5 \u2192 NT61 NT84, etc. Hmm, I don't see any NT that directly goes to 't74'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the list again. Oh, I see: NT65 \u2192 't67' because NT68 \u2192 't83' and NT60 \u2192 't49' for some, but wait, in the list, I see NT83 \u2192 't66' 't8', etc. Wait, maybe I need to see where 't74' comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any NT that directly produces t74. Let me scan all the productions:\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any NT that directly goes to t74. For example, NT67 \u2192 t53, NT62 \u2192 t12, NT68 \u2192 t83, etc. So maybe 't74' isn't directly produced by any rule. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps it's produced indirectly through other rules. Let me think: if I can find a production path that leads from S to the string via these rules.\n\nBut first, checking 't74' in the string. Since none of the NTs directly produce 't74', maybe the string isn't in the language. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any production that could lead to 't74'.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions again, I don't see any that produce a 't74'. The closest is NT65 \u2192 't36' and NT5 \u2192 't5', etc. So, perhaps the presence of 't74' makes the string invalid, as it can't be produced by any rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a production that I haven't considered properly. Let me cross-check the list again. I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly can produce 't74'. So, the string starts with 't74', which can't be derived from any rule, so the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with a 't74', which is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-329","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand each part.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like it's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with two non-terminals on the right. Wait, actually, Chomsky normal form requires that each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, but some terminals can be on the right as well, right? Wait no, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So sometimes you have two non-terminals, sometimes a single terminal. Okay, so in this grammar, most of the rules are A \u2192 BC, but some are to terminals like 't43' or something.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t74 t12 t95 t2 t95 t25 t12 t39 t86 t82 t42 t42 t0 t5 t87 t48 t5 t35.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, all lowercase letters starting with 't'. Now, I need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI'm a bit overwhelmed because the grammar has a lot of rules, but maybe I can approach this by looking for possible derivations or by seeing if the string can be broken down into parts that match the rules.\n\nLet me start by listing all the production rules. Each rule is of the form X \u2192 YZ or X \u2192 a, where Y and Z are non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, the first thing I notice is that the start symbol is S. The two initial productions are S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So, S is the start, and from there, we can produce combinations of other non-terminals.\n\nBut the string given doesn't contain many non-terminals; it's all terminals. So perhaps we can work backward from the string, trying to find sequences of terminals that could have been produced by a single rule.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this? Maybe I can use a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and trying to split it into parts that match the rules. Each part should be a single terminal or a pair of terminals that could have been generated by a production.\n\nSo the string is: t74 t12 t95 t2 t95 t25 t12 t39 t86 t82 t42 t42 t0 t5 t87 t48 t5 t35.\n\nThat's 19 terminals. Each production either introduces two non-terminals or one terminal, so to derive this string, the parse tree would have a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check each terminal in the string to see if it has a direct rule.\n\nLooking at the given rules, some of the non-terminals produce a single terminal. For example, NT6 \u2192 t74, NT12 \u2192 t12, NT23 \u2192 t79, etc. So I can try to see if each token in the string can be generated by any single rule.\n\nBut wait, the string is a sequence of t's, so each token is a single terminal. That means that for each token in the string, it must be generated by a rule that takes one non-terminal to that terminal.\n\nSo for example, if I see a t74, is there a rule NT74 \u2192 t74? Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 t74 (from the list: NT6 -> 't74'). So if the string has t74, it can be derived from NT6.\n\nSimilarly, t12 can be derived from NT12 \u2192 t12.\n\nt95: Looking for a rule where non-terminal leads to t95. Scanning the rules, I see NT67 \u2192 t95.\n\nSo, each terminal in the string must come from a non-terminal that has a direct production to that terminal.\n\nNow, the challenge is to see if the entire string can be built by combining these rules. Because the grammar is context-free and in CNF, each expansion step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the string is built up by combining these non-terminals' expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to see if the entire string can be parsed using the grammar's productions. To do that, we might construct a parse tree where each node corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nBut maybe that's too abstract. Alternatively, maybe I can simulate the parsing process, trying to reduce the string step by step using the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for any obvious patterns or possible derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree starting from the string and see if it's possible to derive the entire string by applying the productions in reverse.\n\nSo let's write the string as a sequence of terminals:\n\nt74 t12 t95 t2 t95 t25 t12 t39 t86 t82 t42 t42 t0 t5 t87 t48 t5 t35.\n\nEach of these is a terminal generated by some non-terminal. So for each token like t74, t12, etc., I need to find which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLet me list the mappings of non-terminals to their terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n- NT12 \u2192 t12\n- NT23 \u2192 t79\n- NT29 \u2192 t62 (from NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86), but wait, looking at the given rules, there are several entries. Let me list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT6 \u2192 t74,\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice several rules produce terminal 't's:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t79 (there's a rule that says NT23 \u2192 't79')\n- But in the provided rules, the entry says NT65 \u2192 't38', so wait, I think I need to list all the rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't12'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't79'\n\nWait, let me look at the rules line by line:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which helps because each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars can be parsed using the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this kind of task. CYK uses dynamic programming to check if the string can be generated by the grammar. But since this grammar might have a lot of non-terminals, I might need to build the table step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it's been broken down into terms, so I need to sequence them correctly. The CYK approach constructs a table where each cell [i,j] represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j. The goal is to see if the start symbol S can generate the entire string.\n\nThe first step is to find the length of the string, which is 18 tokens. So, the CYK table will be from i=0 to 17 and j=i to 17.\n\nI start by initializing the table. For each position i, if the token is a terminal, I check if there's a production from S to that terminal. If so, I note it in [i,i]. But S doesn't directly produce terminals; it produces non-terminals. So, this approach might not work as is.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for the start symbol S and see how the string can be derived from it. Since S is in CNF, its productions are two non-terminals. Looking at the initial productions:\n\nS -> NT61 NT59\nS -> NT29 NT9\n\nSo, S can produce either NT61 and NT59, or NT29 and NT9. Then, each of these non-terminals can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI should probably build the parse tree starting from S. Let's see if the string corresponds to one of these branches.\n\nLooking at the string's last two elements, t46 and t19. Let me check if either production for t46 or t19 is triggered by the earlier parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should focus on the start production, S, and see if the string can be divided into two parts corresponding to the two possible S productions.\n\nThe string is: t74 t72 t9 t3 t99 t42 t9 t19 t79 t64 t41 t12 t2 t60 t63 t48 t19 t46\n\nFirst, the two initial S productions are S -> NT61 NT59 or S -> NT29 NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, if I split it into two parts after, say, position k where k is from 0 to 17, I need both parts to be derivable from NT61 and NT59 or from NT29 and NT9, respectively.\n\nBut starting an initial split, maybe the string can be divided into two parts each of which can be generated by the two components of S.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a CNF grammar, perhaps each production's length is 2, so the CYK approach can be used effectively.\n\nAnother approach is to work backwards. The last token is t46. Looking for non-terminals that produce t46.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT60 -> 't49' and NT68 -> 't46'. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT68 -> 't46' (since it's written as `NT68 -> t46`)\n\nSo the last token t46 comes from NT68. So, the last step in the derivation must be NT68 \u2192 t46.\n\nWhich means before that, the string ends with the two symbols leading up to t46. Let me check the token before t46: it's t19. So the last two tokens are t19 and t46. So t19 and t46 must be derived from NT68. But looking at NT68's production rules, I need to see if any non-terminals combine to produce NT68.\n\nWait, maybe I should reconstruct the possible steps. Let me see what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nt46 comes from NT68.\n\nLooking for NT68's production, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT68 -> 't46'\n\nWait, no, actually looking at the grammar, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me find the exact productions again.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT68: `NT68 -> 't46'`? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nI found:\n\nNT68 -> 't46' ? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through, I think I see:\n\nNT68 -> 't46'\n\nNo, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 -> 't46' is present?\n\nWait, no, in the last lines:\n\nNT68 -> 't46'?\n\nNo, wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see that. Wait, here's a line: `NT60 -> 't65'`, another: `NT93 -> 't72'`, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me parse the productions again to find where 't46' comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the production NT68 is listed as: `NT68 -> t46` or is it?\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\n- I see `NT65 -> NT71 NT65`\n- Then other lines: many -> t's.\n\nLooking for 't46', I see lines like:\n\n`NT47 -> 't73'`\n`NT68 -> 't46'` ???

Let me check:\n\nYes, looking through the last lines:\n\nND68 -> 't46' is present.\n\nWait, no, I see `NT68 -> 't46'` is not there. Let me check again:\n\nThe grammar lines provided are:\n\nNT68 -> 't46'? Or is it another t?\n\nNo, in the list, I see `NT47 -> 't73'`, `NT68 -> 't46'`\u2014no, wait, NT46 is different. Let me recheck:\n\nThe user provided the entire grammar, including lines like:\n\nNT68 -> 't46'\n\nWait, looking again, I see at the end:\n\nNT68 -> 't46'\n\nYes, yes, I see `NT68 -> 't46'`. So, NT68 can derive the terminal t46.\n\nSo, the last token is t46, which is derived from NT68.\n\nSo, looking back, what can produce NT68? Let me find the production that has NT68 on the left side.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nThere's `NT68 -> 't46'` (as a terminal), but also other productions:\n\nFor example, `NT5 -> 't83'`, `NT93 -> 't72'`, etc.\n\nBut for NT68, in the original grammar, the production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I think I might have misread.\n\nLooking again"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-346","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLet's start by looking at the grammar rules and the string. The string is `t74 t12 t2 t60 t95 t25 t12 t95 t2 t42 t64 t18 t35 t41 t72 t63 t2 t19 t35`. I notice that the string is composed of several 't' followed by numbers. It seems like each 't' might correspond to a specific terminal in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's check the grammar rules to see which terminals are present. From the production rules, I see that terminals include things like 't12', 't94', 't83', and so on. For example, NT68 \u2192 't83' and NT93 \u2192 't72'. So, each terminal is the result of a specific NT. \n\nI think the approach here is to work backward from the start symbols and see if the string can be derived using the given productions. The start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n2. S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. The string starts with t74 t12, so I need to see if these can correspond to NT61 or NT29, or something else.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see that NT68 \u2192 't83', NT60 \u2192 't49', NT5 \u2192 't5', etc. Let's map the terminals to their NT productions:\n\n- t74: I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t74. Maybe I missed it. Let me check the productions again. Hmm, NT68 \u2192 't83', NT60 \u2192 't49', NT5 \u2192 't5', etc. I don't see a production for t74. That could be a problem because the first token is t74.\n\nWait, the string starts with t74, but the grammar doesn't have a production that directly outputs t74. Let me check the production rules again. Scanning through, I notice that NT96 \u2192 't67', NT22 \u2192 't67' as well. There's NT22 \u2192 't67' and NT96 \u2192 't67'. So maybe t67 can come from either NT22 or NT96. But t74 is not present in any production. That means if the first terminal is t74, there's no production in the grammar that directly produces t74. So that means the string can't be generated because the first symbol t74 has no corresponding NT rule.\n\nWait, but is t74 a terminal? Because in the productions, some NTs produce terminals, and others produce other NTs. So yes, t74 is a terminal, so it must be produced by some NT. Let me check all the rules to see which NTs might produce t74.\n\nLooking through the rules: NT74 isn't a starting NT. The rules end at NT96 and others. Hmm. Actually, looking at the rules, there's no production that directly produces t74 from any NT. For example, NT77 \u2192 't79', NT22 \u2192 't67', etc. I don't see t74 being produced by any NT.

{"custom_id":"request-351","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t74 t72 t41 t12 t41 t99 t42 t9 t5 t96 t18 t35 t46 t9 t13 t63 t48 t19 t46`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. This structure simplifies parsing because each production directly expands to either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's in CNF because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59 is a production where two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The other productions follow this pattern, like NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95, and so on.\n\nNow, the string starts with t74, t72, etc. I notice that in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For instance, NT83 \u2192 't66', so when NT83 appears in a derivation, it produces a specific terminal.\n\nMy approach should be to work backward from the string, trying to see if I can reconstruct the string by expanding non-terminals step by step using the provided production rules until I reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens: t74, t72, t41, t12, t41, t99, t42, t9, t5, t96, t18, t35, t46, t9, t13, t63, t48, t19, t46.\n\nI'll start from the end of the string and try to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nStarting with the last token, t46. Looking through the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't60', which is not t46. Wait, let me check each production for terminals:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't60' (so when NT46 is expanded, it becomes t60)\n- NT96 \u2192 't86'\n- NT56 \u2192 't51'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT33 \u2192 't82' etc.\n\nWait, is there any non-terminal that directly produces 't46'? I don't see any in the provided grammar. Hmm. So maybe I need to look at t46 as being part of a longer derivation. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with a production that eventually leads to these terminals.\n\nLet me look at the initial productions:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can produce NT61 and NT59, or NT29 and NT9. So S is the root, and the string must be produced by either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t74, which is a terminal. Let's see what non-terminals expand to t74. Looking through the productions, I see NT6 -> 't74' on line 55. So if NT6 can be expanded to 't74', maybe the string starts with NT6 leading to t74.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The productions for NT6: \n\nLooking through the rules, for example, line 56: NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14, etc. Let's continue down until I find NT6 producing a terminal.\n\nLooking at line 55: NT65 -> NT6 NT60.

{"custom_id":"request-366","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The string is `t80 t64 t96 t67 t80 t64 t42 t2 t9 t5 t63 t64 t35 t41 t12 t41 t63 t48 t5 t46`. \n\nFirst, I'll note that this is a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or S \u2192 \u03b5. However, looking at the grammar, it seems that all productions are binary except for S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9, which also result in two symbols. So, all non-terminals expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string in question consists of a series of terminal symbols: t80, t64, t96, and so on. My first thought is that each of these terminals must be derived from the productions in the grammar. Since the structure is in Chomsky normal form, the string's length can help determine if it's possible.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which can be expanded into two non-terminals. Each of those can be further expanded, and so on. Since the string has 20 tokens, each step in the derivation must increase the number of symbols by one. So, starting from S, which is one symbol, to reach 20 tokens, we need 19 steps where each step adds one symbol. The length of the string is 20, so that seems feasible.\n\nNext, I need to see if there's a derivation path that leads to this exact sequence of terminals. To do this, I'll start from the initial symbol S and try to expand it step by step, matching the string's tokens as we go.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nI'll consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's take S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nNow, we need to see what NT61 and NT59 can produce. Let's check NT61 and NT59 in the grammar.\n\nLooking for NT61:\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 (from the grammar)\nThen, NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72 (from the grammar)\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65 (grammar)\nNT18 \u2192 NT66 (from grammar)\nWait, but NT32 has another production: NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. Let's follow that path.\n\nSo, starting with NT61:\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nNT18 \u2192 NT66\nSo that's one branch: NT61 \u2192 NT33 \u2192 NT32 \u2192 NT18 \u2192 t66\n\nNow, what about NT59?\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT48 NT59 (grammar)\nThis is a recursive production. Let's see:\n\nNT59 can expand as NT48 NT59. Let's break down NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT97 (grammar)\nWait, NT48 is a terminal, t97. But in the string, we have 't41', 't35', etc. Let me check if there are any NT48 productions. Looking back, yes: NT48 \u2192 NT97. But NT97 is another non-terminal. Let me check NT97.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any further productions for NT97. So, NT97 is another terminal? Or perhaps NT97 is derived from other non-terminals. Wait, no, in the grammar provided, most of the NT symbols have productions leading to other NTs or terminals. Let me check if NT97 is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT97 is not present; all productions for NT97 would lead to something else, but in the given grammar, I don't see that. Wait, actually, in the grammar, let's check NT97:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any production for NT97. It only appears as a terminal in other places, but in the NTs, maybe I missed it. Wait, let me check all the entries:\n\nLet's look for NT97 in the NT productions. Hmm, scrolling through, I don't see NT97 in the list. Instead, I see NT48 \u2192 NT97. Since there's no production for NT97, it's considered a terminal symbol, but in the actual grammar, it's just a single non-terminal without any expansion, meaning it must be a terminal. However, in the string provided, there's no 't97' token. So if the grammar has NT97 as a terminal, and our string doesn't include it, then this path leads to a mismatch. Therefore, the path starting with NT59 \u2192 NT48 NT59 would lead to a problem because 't97' isn't present in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe NT97 can expand into t79 or another terminal? Let me check again. Looking through the grammar, for example:\n\nLooking for NT33: yes, it expands to NT32 NT72, etc. But let's look for NT97: I don't see any production. So, in the grammar, NT97 is a non-terminal that can't expand further\u2014it must be a terminal. Hence, in any derivation, any occurrence of NT97 in the string must correspond to 't97', but in our string, we don't have that. Therefore, this path (starting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59) would produce 't66' from NT61 and possibly 't97' from NT48, which isn't in the string. So this path doesn't seem to fit.\n\nLet me try the other production of S: S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nNow, looking at NT29 and NT9 in the grammar.\n\nFirst, NT29:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86 (multiple options).\nLet me explore that.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\nNT14 \u2192 NT2 NT65 (grammar)\nLet's take that path.\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT2 NT65\nNT2 is another NT. From the grammar: NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86 (grammar)\nSo, NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\n\nNow, NT86 in the grammar: looking back, NT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55 (grammar) or NT86 \u2192 t67 (grammar?)\n\nWait, looking through the list:\nNT86 \u2192 t67 (grammar). Yes, in the grammar, NT86 is a terminal, but wait, in the grammar provided above, I see for example:\n\nLooking for NT86: Yes, at the bottom, NT86 \u2192 't67'. Similarly, NT56 \u2192 't51', NT19 \u2192 't9', etc.\n\nSo, if NT86 is a terminal, it would produce 't67', but let's see if that matches.\n\nWait, earlier in the string, after 't2', we have 't9 t5', etc. Hmm, perhaps that's possible. Let's continue.\n\nSo, NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT65.\nNT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86.\n\nSo, so far, we have S \u2192 NT29 \u2192 NT14 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86.\n\nNow, NT52: From the grammar, NT52 \u2192 NT68 (grammar).\n\nSo, NT52 \u2192 NT68.\n\nThen, NT68 \u2192 NT93 NT88 (grammar).\n\nSo, NT68 \u2192 NT93 NT88.\n\nNow, NT93 and NT88 each need expansion.\n\nNT93: Looking through, NT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83 (grammar). Or in the grammar, NT93 also appears as a terminal at the end: NT93 \u2192 't72'. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar list, I don't see NT93 having any non-terminal productions except for one spot where NT93 \u2192 't72'.\n\nSo, perhaps NT93 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29 (grammar), and from there:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29\nNT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59 (grammar)\nNT48 \u2192 NT97 (grammar). But we saw that NT97 is a problem because it would have to be 't97', which isn't in the string.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should track another path.\n\nLet me step back and try a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to work backwards from the string, checking if each terminal can be derived from the grammar. So starting from the last symbol, 't46', working our way to the beginning.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't46' must come from NT46.

{"custom_id":"request-368","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT47, etc.) that produce other non-terminals or terminals ('t' followed by numbers). Each production in Chomsky normal form is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe given string is: t74 t72 t95 t2 t72 t42 t99 t0 t19 t18 t35 t39 t60 t12 t2 t79 t63 t48 t19 t35.\n\nI notice that each 't' is followed by a number, which I assume is a terminal symbol. So the string has 19 tokens (assuming each 't' is a separate token and the numbers are the rest).\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, its productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo the string must start either with NT61 followed by NT59 or NT29 followed by NT9. \n\nLet's check the string from the beginning:\n\nThe first token is t74. From the grammar, I see that NT61 can produce 't74'. So the first part could be NT61 \u2192 t74.\n\nAfter that, the next symbol is t72. So what does NT59 produce? Looking at the grammar rules, NT59 has a production NT59 \u2192 NT23 NT59. Wait, that's recursive. There's also NT59 \u2192 t46. Hmm. So NT59 can produce 't46' or go into a loop with NT23.\n\nBut wait, after NT61, the next non-terminal is NT59, and the next in the string is t72. So if NT59 produces t46, but the string has t72 next, that doesn't match. Alternatively, could NT59 produce something else?\n\nWait, looking again: NT59's productions are:\n\nFrom the top of the list:\nNT59 \u2192 t46\nNT23 \u2192 t3\nBut also, in the later rules, I see NT59 \u2192 t48? Wait, no, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, etc. Wait, maybe I should list all the rules for each non-terminal to see possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree from the string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nLet me see if I can break down the string into parts that match grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the first part: t74. That's NT61 \u2192 t74. So the first part is NT61.\n\nSo the string after the first part would be: t72 t95 t2 t72 t42 t99 t0 t19 t18 t35 t39 t60 t12 t2 t79 t63 t48 t19 t35.\n\nNow, the next non-terminal after NT61 is NT59. So NT59 needs to produce the rest of the string.\n\nWhat does NT59 produce?\n\nLooking up NT59's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT59 \u2192 t46\nAlso, in later rules:\nNT60 \u2192 t49\nBut I don't see NT59 directly producing any non-terminals except in a recursive way. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the rules, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 t46\nNT23 \u2192 t3\nBut also, looking through all the rules, I don't see NT59 directly connected to other non-terminals except via t46. Wait, perhaps I mislooked.\n\nWait, the rules for NT59 are not listed here, so I need to check the initial part of the grammar. Wait, looking back:\n\nAfter the initial NT61 and NT29, the rules are listed, so I can find NT59's productions by looking through all the rules. Wait, in the provided grammar, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT84 NT52  ... No, that's for NT84.\n\nWait, actually, from the initial list, the rules are given as a long list. Let me scan for NT59:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t46\n- Is there another production for NT59? Let me see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT59 has the production NT59 \u2192 t46. Is that the only one? Let me check:\n\nIn the list, I see NT5 \u2192 ..., NT46 \u2192 ..., but looking for NT59:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t46\n\nIs there another rule for NT59? I don't see any other productions for NT59 beyond that. So NT59 can only directly produce 't46' or perhaps recursively, but in this case, it's followed by other non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me double-check. The given grammar rules are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n\nWait, but in the initial list provided:\n\nLooking for NT59:\n\nLooking through each line, the NT59 production is only once: NT59 \u2192 t46.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some. Let me recount:\n\nLooking for NT59 in all the lines:\n\n- Line 34: NT59 \u2192 t46\nHmm, okay, so NT59 can only produce t46 directly. But the next token after the initial NT61 (t74) is t72, which is part of NT59's production? Wait, no. Wait, after NT61 is NT59. So NT59 must produce the rest of the string after t74.\n\nThe rest of the string after t74 is: t72 t95 t2 t72 t42 t99 t0 t19 t18 t35 t39 t60 t12 t2 t79 t63 t48 t19 t35.\n\nSo after t74, the non-terminal NT59 is supposed to produce the rest. But from the rules, NT59 can only produce t46. So that would mean that the next token after t74 should be t46, but in the string, it's t72. That's a problem. So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, maybe I got it wrong. Wait, the initial S is either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9.\n\nWait, the first alternative is NT61 NT59. So the string must start with NT61 followed by NT59. So the first part is NT61, which produces t74. Then NT59 must produce the rest of the string, which starts with t72.\n\nBut NT59 can only produce t46 directly, so this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the initial production is the other alternative: S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nLet me check the alternative.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nSo the string starts with NT29 followed by NT9.\n\nLooking at the first token, t74. If the first non-terminal is NT29, does NT29 produce t74?\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any of the NT29 productions produce t74?\n\nYes, in the rules:\n\nNT29 \u2192 t87, t62, etc. Wait, no, wait.\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules for NT24:\n\nWait, no. The rules for NT29 are:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 t87\n- NT29 \u2192 t62\n\nNo, wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT29, the first occurrence is:\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\n- Line 4: NT47 \u2192 ...\n\nNo, let's find NT29:\n\nLine 58: NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\n\nLine 67: NT29 \u2192 t87\n\nLine 76: NT29 \u2192 t62\n\nSo NT29 can produce t87 or t62.\n\nThe first token in the string is t74, which is not produced by NT29, so this path doesn't work either. Wait, but in our first step, the first alternative is NT61 NT59, which leads us to a dead end. The other alternative is NT29 NT9, but the first token is t74, which is not produced by either NT29 or NT9.\n\nWait, what about NT9? Looking at NT9's productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t18, but in the initial rules, I don't see NT9 producing t74.

{"custom_id":"request-391","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, so I need to analyze step by step.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like all the production rules are in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which are strings like 't12', 't87', etc. The start symbol is S, which leads to NT61 NT59. So the initial production is S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t87 t36 t79 t64 t9 t3 t63 t37 t42 t42 t9 t19 t60 t64 t9 t79 t63 t2 t19 t35`.\n\nI need to check if this string is a valid output of the grammar. Since the grammar is a CNF, the string should be a series of steps where each step expands a non-terminal into two other non-terminals, eventually reaching terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the production chain. Starting from S, the only options are NT61 NT59. So the first step must produce something that eventually leads to the string.\n\nLooking at NT61, according to the grammar, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So after expanding S, we get NT33 NT55 followed by NT65 NT65 (since S also goes to NT65 NT65, but wait, no, S goes to NT61 NT59 regardless. Wait, no, no, S only has two productions: S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Looking back, the grammar has two top-level productions: S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So the string could start with either of these branches. But in our string, the first token is 't74', so I need to see if that is accessible through any of these starting points.\n\nWait, looking at the terminals, for example, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and then NT33 has a production to 't32' and NT55 has 't5'. Also, NT55 can sometimes produce 't58' or 't86' but according to the given productions, NT55 has rules like NT55 \u2192 't5' and others? Wait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals lead to terminals:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't83' and others like that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree. Let's see. The string is 21 tokens long, so let's count the number of symbols. Wait, how many symbols are there in the string? Let's count:\n\n1. t74\n2. t87\n3. t36\n4. t79\n5. t64\n6. t9\n7. t3\n8. t63\n9. t37\n10. t42\n11. t42\n12. t9\n13. t19\n14. t60\n15. t64\n16. t9\n17. t79\n18. t63\n19. t2\n20. t19\n21. t35\n\nThat's 21 symbols. Since each step in the grammar produces two non-terminals, and each non-terminal is eventually replaced by terminals, the number of symbols should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps from the root. But 21 is not a power of two, so that might be a hint. Wait, but 2^4 is 16 and 2^5 is 32. So 21 is between those. That suggests that perhaps the string has a different structure or maybe it's not possible. But wait, perhaps I'm wrong because the grammar could have multiple paths, some of which produce more symbols. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's possible through the production rules, but it's a bit unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the starting symbol expansions. S can be either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Let's see what the first token is. The first symbol is 't74'. Looking in the grammar, I need to see which non-terminals lead to 't74'. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't68'\n- NT67 \u2192 't54' and 't66'\n- NT55 \u2192 't5' and others\n- NT22 \u2192 't2' and 't67'\n- NT61 \u2192 't32'\n- NT86 \u2192 't19'\n- NT7 \u2192 't18'\n- NT19 \u2192 't0' or 't9'\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't74'. Hmm, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that directly produces 't74' in the given rules. For example, looking at the right-hand sides of the productions, most non-terminals when expanded produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. But my initial check shows that none directly produce 't74'. Let me check all the productions to see if any non-terminal's expansion includes 't74'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't67'\n- NT57 \u2192 't33'\n- NT61 \u2192 't32'\n- NT93 \u2192 't72'\n- NT58 \u2192 't66'\n- NT47 \u2192 't73'\n- NT88 \u2192 't72'\n- NT46 \u2192 't60'\n- NT31 \u2192 't54'\n- NT72 \u2192 't30'\n- NT56 \u2192 't87'\n- NT9 \u2192 't18'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2', 't25', 't87' (seems complex)\n- NT87 \u2192 't48'\n- NT78 \u2192 't63'\n- NT53 \u2192 't53' maybe?\nWait, no, in the productions I see NT78 \u2192 't63' t7? Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7 and also \u2192 NT63 NT7\nWait, no, looking closer at the rules:\n\nAh, wait, the rules are:\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5 \n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nLooking for 't74' as a terminal, I see that NT65 \u2192 't32' when it's not a non-terminal. Wait, no, in the productions, NT65 can be a non-terminal that goes to 't32' but also other terms. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT65 has multiple productions, but none directly produce 't74'. Let me check the productions for NT65:\n\nLooking in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\n\nWait, but I don't see any production for NT65 that leads to 't74' directly. So perhaps 't74' is not part of the language, meaning the string cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck the grammar's productions to see if any non-terminals expand into 't74' directly.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't66' and 't23'\n\n- Wait, looking at each rule:\n\nLooking specifically for terminals in the RHS:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't68' and 't52'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't61' and 't8'\n\n- NT57 \u2192 't17' and 't27'\n\n- NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7 and NT63 NT7\n\nWait, no, I don't see any production that ends with 't74'. So that suggests that 't74' is not present in any of the production rules, at least not as a direct terminal. Therefore, if the grammar doesn't have any rules that produce 't74', the string including 't74' cannot be in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me double-check the productions.\n\nLooking again through the grammar section, I see:\n\nLooking for any 't74' in the RHS of a production. Scanning each rule:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 (both non-terminals)\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96 (non-terminals)\n\nNT71 is in the production for NT65, but looking for 't74' elsewhere, I don't see it.\n\nSo, the production expansion for any non-terminal doesn't produce 't74'. Therefore, the string starting with 't74' cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong because maybe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's given in CNF, so each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT61 NT59. Let's see the structure of these non-terminals and their productions. \n\nLooking through the productions, each NT has two rules except for some that directly reference 't' followed by a number.

Hmm, looking again: NT6 -> 't74'. So NT6 can produce 't74'.\n\nSimilarly, t38: Maybe NT55? Wait, NT55 -> 't5' in the productions? No, I see NT55 -> 't51' and 't5' also comes from other NTs. Wait, let me look. NT9 -> 't23', NT19 -> 't9' and 't0', NT29 -> 't2' and 't62', etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

Oh, maybe I'm missing some. Let me check each line for 't's:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see t38 as a terminal. That's a problem because the string starts with t74 and t38.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. All the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, which is a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). This makes it easier because any string generated by a CNF grammar can be parsed using the CYK algorithm, but given my current knowledge, I'll try to manually backtrack from the string to see if it aligns with any possible derivation.\n\nThe string consists of several tokens separated by spaces, and some of these tokens might be terminals (like 't74', 't9', etc.) or non-terminals. I need to check if these tokens can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces \"NT61 NT59\". So, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Now, I need to see if the string can be derived from this.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with \"t74\". Looking through the grammar rules, the only place where 't74' appears is in the production of NT6, because NT6 \u2192 t74. So, NT6 must derive t74.\n\nWait, but the starting symbol is S which produces NT61 and NT59. So, NT61 and NT59 must both be expanded into sequences of terminals and non-terminals that eventually lead to the tokens in the string.\n\nLet me list the possible steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n2. Each of NT61 and NT59 needs to be expanded into sequences of symbols, and when fully expanded, their combinations should form the given string.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t74 is the first token. Let's see where t74 comes from. From the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t74 is a production. So, t74 must be part of NT6. Therefore, one of the NT61 or NT59 must derive into NT6, which then becomes t74.\n\nBut wait, NT61 and NT59 are both non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nWait, I notice some rules like NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Let me check that.\n\nWait, wait, actually, the given grammar seems extensive. Let me see.\n\nThe rules for NT61: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.\n\nNT33 has rules like NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22, etc. Hmm. But where does 't74' come into play?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking for where 't74' appears: Yes, under NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t74\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The production NT6 \u2192 t74 is correct. So, NT6 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't74'. Now, to get that in the string, one of the non-terminals derived from S must be NT6.\n\nBut S starts with NT61 and NT59. Let me see the production for NT61: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then, each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT33: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22, NT33 \u2192 NT6 NT60, etc. That last one is important because it includes NT6, which produces t74.\n\nSo, NT33 \u2192 NT6 NT60. Then, NT6 \u2192 t74 and NT60 \u2192 t49 (from the production NT60 \u2192 t49).\n\nSo, that part could be: NT33 \u2192 t74 t49.\n\nSimilarly, for NT55, I need to see where it goes. Wait, NT55 has productions like NT55 \u2192 NT5 NT19, NT55 \u2192 NT51 NT26, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to model the possible expansion path that could generate the string.\n\nThe string starts with t74, which must come from NT6. So, either NT61 or NT59 must derive into NT6. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT61's productions. From the given rules, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So, NT61 can't directly produce NT6. Therefore, perhaps NT59 is where NT6 comes from. Let's check NT59's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT59 \u2192 NT66 NT23. Then, NT66 and NT23. Wait, NT23 \u2192 t79. But no NT6 is in NT23's productions. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe NT59 produces NT66 and NT23, but I don't see NT6 in any of those. Alternatively, perhaps another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check the grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking at the production NT6 \u2192 t74 is one of the non-terminals. So, to get t74, the NT6 must be part of the derivation.\n\nNow, NT61 produces NT33 and NT55. From the given rules, NT33 can produce NT6 NT60, which would then be t74 followed by whatever NT60 produces.\n\nLooking at NT60: NT60 \u2192 t49 directly. Because looking through the grammar, the lines state:\n\nNT60 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, combining these, NT33 can be NT6 NT60 \u2192 t74 t49.\n\nTherefore, if a NT33 appears in the derivation, it can be replaced by t74 t49.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string, the second token is 't9'. Let's see where 't9' can come from. Checking the grammar, perhaps NT93 \u2192 t72? No, that's t72. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t83\nNT6 \u2192 t74\nNT15 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the grammar lines:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't83' (a terminal)\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\nNT29 \u2192 't62', which is another terminal.\nNT59 \u2192 't35' (another terminal)\nWait, so NT59 directly produces 't35'.\n\nBut in our string, after 't74' comes 't9', which is not one of these. So, perhaps I've been missing that.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for other terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n- NT93 \u2192 t72\n- NT60 \u2192 t49\n- NT29 \u2192 t62\n- NT59 \u2192 t35\n- NT36 \u2192 t18 (from NT36 \u2192 t18, yes)\n- NT5 \u2192 t83\n- NT67 \u2192 t53 (from the line: NT67 \u2192 t53)\n- NT55 \u2192 t19 (since NT55 \u2192 't19')\n- NT22 \u2192 't39'\n- NT60 has 't49', NT33 has 't74' as part of its expansion.\n\nWait, but the string has 't9', which is not directly a terminal. That suggests that 't9' must come from a non-terminal that leads to 't9' through some expansion steps.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, perhaps NT59 \u2192 NT66 NT23. Then, NT23 \u2192 t79. So NT59 could produce t79. But in the given string, the next token after t74 is t9, so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another path. Let me consider NT59's production: NT59 \u2192 NT93 NT22.\n\nWait, NT93 \u2192 't72' and NT22 \u2192 't39' as per the rules. So, NT59 could be 't72 t39'. But how does that help us get 't9'?\n\nAlternatively, looking for a non-terminal that can produce 't9' directly. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't9'. The only way to get 't9' is through a non-terminal that eventually leads to 't9' in its expansion.\n\nWait, looking deeper, I see NT24 \u2192 't2' and NT15 \u2192 't96' (I think; NT15's production: NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59, which doesn't directly produce t9. Wait, perhaps via another path.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider NT2: NT2 \u2192 t64. NT24 \u2192 't2', which is a terminal.\n\nBut in the string after 't95"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and a single non-terminal or terminal on the right.

Let's see what each of these NT symbols can produce.\n\nLooking at NT61: the production is NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.

{"custom_id":"request-431","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This helps because each production is either splitting a non-terminal into two non-terminals or terminating with a single terminal.\n\nThe target string is: `t74 t38 t82 t5 t67 t82 t64 t41 t12 t95 t25 t63 t37 t99 t64 t18 t35 t9 t3 t63 t48 t19 t46`.\n\nI'll start from the top of the grammar and see if I can derive the string by expanding non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nI'll choose one path. Let's try S \u2192 NT61 NT59 first. So, first, I need to expand NT61 and NT59.\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT59 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n\nSo now, the string starts with the concatenation of the expansions of NT61 and NT59. That would be NT33 NT55 and NT10 NT17.\n\nBut looking at the target string, the first token is t74. Let's check what each of these NTs expand to.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n- NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n- NT84 \u2192 NT57 NT20\n- NT67 \u2192 NT31 NT28\n- NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52\n- NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\n\nWait, but NT61 isn't listed here. Let me check the rules again. Oh, I see NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then, NT33 is another non-terminal. \n\nLooking at NT33, it has two productions:\n- NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\n- NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22\n\nSimilarly, NT55 has:\n- NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT27\n\nWait, but also NT55 \u2192 NT5 NT88. Let me check that.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT55 appears in a few places:\n- NT55 \u2192 NT6 NT51\n- NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT27\n- NT55 \u2192 NT5 NT88\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Let's approach this methodically. I'll need to see if the given string can be formed by expanding the grammar step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string from the bottom up, trying to match the string against the grammar's terminals.\n\nBut considering the complexity, maybe using the CYK algorithm is the way to go. However, implementing CYK manually is error-prone, especially for a long string. Since the string is 23 tokens long, it would be time-consuming, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for known terminals and see if they match any rule.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\nt74, t38, t82, t5, t67, t82, t64, t41, t12, t95, t25, t63, t37, t99, t64, t18, t35, t9, t3, t63, t48, t19, t46.\n\nFirst, let's check if any of these tokens appear as terminals in the grammar. From the rules, the terminals are the tokens that appear on the RHS when a non-terminal expands to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t5\n- NT58 \u2192 t83\n- NT59 \u2192 t5\nWait, in the rules provided, I see multiple NTs mapping to terminals.

CNF means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is great because it simplifies the parsing process, often allowing for efficient algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since the string is short, maybe a top-down approach or substitution method could work better.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t62 t96 t96 t67 t80 t64 t86 t80 t42 t9 t5 t18 t35 t0 t13 t63 t2 t64 t9 t3 t63 t2 t64 t35`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of terminal symbols only, no non-terminals. So, I need to see if substituting non-terminals step by step can reduce the string to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar rules to find any immediate matches. Each terminal in the string must come from a substitution of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see several places where non-terminals are replaced by 't' symbols, which are terminals. For example, NT26 \u2192 t12, NT31 \u2192 t54, etc.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t12\n- NT31 \u2192 t54\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n- NT27 \u2192 t7\n- NT23 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t42\n- NT8 \u2192 t25\n- NT28 \u2192 t63\n- NT9 \u2192 t18\n- NT24 \u2192 t2\n- NT96 \u2192 t67\n- NT59 \u2192 t46\n- NT29 \u2192 t62\n- NT35 \u2192 t35\n- NT13 \u2192 t13\n- NT63 \u2192 t63\n- NT65 \u2192 t36 (Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT65 is replaced by t36, but checking again: Yeah, rule says NT65 \u2192 t36)\n- NT55 \u2192 t19\n- NT5 \u2192 t61 (Wait, NT5 is not in the grammar, but looking again: Oh, there are multiple rules for NT5. For example, NT5 \u2192 t83, etc.)\n- NT33 \u2192 t79, wait, no: The rules show NT33 has several substitutions, like NT33 \u2192 t32, but under CNF, each production has two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, some NT33 substitutions go to t5, t60, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me go through each terminal in the string and see if it's covered by any production.\n\nStarting from left to right:\n\n1. t62: Looking at the rules, NT29 \u2192 t62. So, this could come from NT29.\n\n2. t96: Looking for NT that \u2192 t96. Checking the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t96. Wait, NT67 has rules like \u2192 t64, but I don't see t96 being directly produced. Hmm. Maybe I missed it. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals from the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see terminals like t12, t25, t73, t19, t0, t35, t63, etc. But t96 isn't directly listed as a terminal, which makes me think that perhaps it's a result of multiple substitutions.\n\nWait, but looking back, in the string, the second t96 is in position 2. So, I need to see if that can come from NT27 \u2192 t7, or maybe another rule... Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t96.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t64\n- NT65 \u2192 t36\n- NT93 \u2192 t72\n- NT58 \u2192 t95\n- NT46 \u2192 t60\n- etc.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Is there a rule where NT27 \u2192 t96? Looking back: No, I see NT27 \u2192 t7. So t96 can't come from NT27 directly. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a production. Alternatively, maybe t96 is produced by NT something else. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, the rules include NT67 \u2192 t64, but that's for the non-terminal NT67. So, does any other non-terminal produce t96?\n\nLooking through all the terminal assignments:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 t36\n- NT29 \u2192 t62\n- NT59 \u2192 t46\n- NT2 \u2192 t64\n- NT31 \u2192 t54\n- NT52 \u2192 t42\n- NT8 \u2192 t25\n- NT24 \u2192 t2\n- NT96 \u2192 t83 (Wait, no: Looking again, the rule for NT96 is not shown. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice there's NT96 \u2192 t83? Or another way. Let me check: Yes, there is a rule NT96 \u2192 t83? Wait, no: Let me scroll through the list:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 t95\n- NT65 \u2192 t36\n- NT88 \u2192 t72\n- NT14 \u2192 t2\n- NT93 \u2192 t72\n- NT58 \u2192 t95\n- NT46 \u2192 t60\n- NT60 \u2192 t49\n- NT88 \u2192 t72\n- NT73 \u2192 t53\n- NT87 \u2192 t48\n- NT68 \u2192 t83\n- NT14 \u2192 t48\n- NT18 \u2192 t66\n- NT20 \u2192 t37\n- NT52 \u2192 t42\n- NT31 \u2192 t54\n- NT72 \u2192 t49\n- NT58 \u2192 t95\n- NT46 \u2192 t79\n- NT88 \u2192 t33\n- NT23 \u2192 t79\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n- NT65 \u2192 t32\n- NT83 \u2192 t41\n- NT23 \u2192 t13\n- NT29 \u2192 t87\n- NT8 \u2192 t2\n- NT24 \u2192 t2\n- NT96 \u2192 t86\n- NT10 \u2192 t96\n\nWait, here's something: NT10 \u2192 t96. So, t96 can be produced by NT10. So, the second t96 in the string can come from NT10.\n\nBut let's go step by step.\n\nLet me try to substitute the string from right to left, trying to match the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe top-down substitution starting from the start symbol S.\n\nS -> NT61 NT61 or S -> NT29 NT9.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t62. NT29 \u2192 t62, so the first symbol t62 can come from NT29. So, maybe S can derive a string starting with NT29, then some other non-terminals.\n\nBut let me try to make the entire substitution.\n\nLet me try to write down the entire string and see if I can find a path.\n\nThe string is: t62 t96 t96 t67 t80 t64 t86 t80 t42 t9 t5 t18 t35 t0 t13 t63 t2 t64 t9 t3 t63 t2 t64 t35\n\nPerhaps breaking it down into segments corresponding to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a sequence of non-terminals and then see if they can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nBut perhaps an easier approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be linked to the corresponding non-term and then check consistency.\n\nLet me make a list of each terminal and the corresponding NT that can produce it:\n\nt62 \u2192 NT29\nt96 \u2192 NT10\nt96 \u2192 NT10 (same as above)\nt67 \u2192 Let's see, looking for a NT that can produce t67.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some symbols are terminals ending with 't', like 't12', 't94', etc. So, the string we're evaluating is composed of these terminals. The string is: t87 t96 t96 t67 t74 t12 t39 t79 t95 t25 t72 t42 t64 t96 t79 t64 t35 t2 t79 t72 t63 t2 t64 t35.\n\nI'll need to find a way to derive this string using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parsing would work top-down, and the string's length is 24, so each production should contribute either two symbols (non-terminals) or one terminal. The number of steps needed should be 25 in a leftmost derivation for a string of 24 terminals, which is manageable.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the string. The first symbol is t87. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce t symbols. For example, NT67 \u2192 t53, but that's a specific case. Wait, maybe I need to find a production where the combination of NTs gives 't87'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\n- NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14 or NT29 NT87\nOh, there's a rule NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87. So if I have NT67, it can produce NT29 and t87.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t87. So perhaps the starting symbol S is derived into something that ends with NT67. Let me think about the start symbols.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n2. S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nI need to see if either of these can lead to the string. Let's consider the first rule: NT61 NT59.\n\nLooking at NT61's productions:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\nNT33 has several rules, like NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, etc. But let's see if any NT61 produces a t symbol. Scanning through, I don't see any direct rule for NT61 producing a terminal. All its productions lead to other non-terminals. Similarly for NT59.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then both NT61 and NT59 would need to be derived into terminals. But their productions only go to other non-terminals, so it might not be possible unless there's a way to produce terminals from them. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any terminals except those with 't' in them.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and NT33 can produce terms like t74, t32, etc. But none directly produce 't87'. Hmm, maybe if I take NT67, which can produce t87, but S doesn't directly lead to NT67.\n\nAlternatively, the second rule for S is S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Let's check NT29 and NT9.\n\nNT29's production:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86.\n\nAnd NT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55. Hmm, let's see what NT19 produces. Wait, NT19 \u2192 NT9 NT59. So NT19 could potentially lead to more non-terminals. This seems a bit complicated, but let's explore further.\n\nAlso, NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17.\n\nLooking at NT10 and NT17:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT68 NT52. Then NT68 \u2192 't83' and NT52 \u2192 NT93 NT88.\n\nWait, so NT10 \u2192 't83' (from NT68) and something else. Let me see:\n\nWait, NT10 \u2192 NT68 NT52. So if NT10 is derived as NT68 and NT52.\n\nThen NT68 \u2192 't83' (from the rule 't83'), and NT52 can be NT93 NT88. Let me follow that.\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT93 NT88. So NT52 can produce 't93' (if NT93 is a terminal, but looking at the grammar, NT93 \u2192 't72' and 't54'? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the rules for NT33 \u2192 't32', etc. But some NTs directly go to terminals.\n\nWait, looking through, there are several NTs that produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT67 \u2192 t53\nNT93 \u2192 t72\nNT12 is 't64'\nNT15 \u2192 't5' etc.\nWait, looking for 't87' specifically. In the grammar, NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87. So if NT67 is derived as NT29 and t87, then that would produce 't87'.\n\nSimilarly, NT92 \u2192 wait, looking through, NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86. So NT29 can lead to NT14 and NT86.\n\nWait, if I'm trying to get 't87' as the first symbol in the string, looking at the string, the first symbol is t87. So in the entire derivation, somewhere, a step must produce t87 as a terminal, which requires a NT that produces t87.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87. So if I have NT67, I can produce t87. So perhaps the initial S must eventually derive into something that leads to NT67, which then can produce t87.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other possibilities, NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7. NT7 can be 't66', but let's see.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t87. So let me see if I can find a production that leads to t87.\n\nFrom the grammar, the only way to get t87 is through NT29 \u2192 NT67 and another NT leading to 't87', but wait, looking again, perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, NT67 can produce t87, yes. Because NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87.\n\nWait, but that would mean NT67 can produce t87 only if one of the NTs is t87. Or no, wait: the production is A \u2192 B C, where B and C are non-terminals in the grammar, and C can be a terminal if it has a rule that produces a terminal. Alternatively, if a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, like NT19 \u2192 't0' or something.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, looking for any NT that directly produces a terminal, like t87.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t53 (when it's derived as per the rule). Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the rules are listed as:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14 or NT29 NT87.\n\nBut looking at the individual rules, for NT67, when it's a terminal, is it somewhere else?\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided, I need to find if any NT is generating 't87' as a terminal. Scanning the entire list, I see:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t53? Wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking for 't87' in the productions. For example, see:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t29 t87? Or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87, which then can produce t87 only if NT87 is a terminal. But according to the grammar, does any NT directly produce 't87'? Looking through:\n\nLooking at the list of grammar productions ending with 't'...\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t53? No, NT67 in the rules is either NT57 NT14 or NT29 NT87.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the way the productions are listed, each line is like \"NT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\", so NT47 is a non-terminal, and it produces the concatenation of NT58 and NT95.\n\nWait, but some of these have 't' as the terminal symbol. For example:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 t36.\n\nYes!

{"custom_id":"request-464","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the grammar carefully. It looks like all the production rules are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). That's good because CNF has certain properties that might help, especially for parsers and for generating decision procedures.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of non-terminals (like S, NT47, NT79, etc.) and some terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t74 t12 t95 t2 t0 t79 t99 t99 t9 t19 t96 t96 t60 t64 t35 t46 t95 t2 t12 t95 t25 t63 t48 t19 t46`.\n\nWait, I should note that in Chomsky Normal Form, there are no \u03b5-productions (since every production is to two symbols or a terminal), and every non-terminal is on the left side. So, in terms of parsing, it's straightforward\u2014each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, and so on until terminals are reached.\n\nBut since the string is given, maybe I don't need to parse it step by step but instead see if each step in the string expansion can be traced back to the start symbol S using the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate a possible derivation from S to the given string.\n\nLet me outline the approach: start from the start symbol S and try to see if I can break down the given string into the sequence of productions that build it up.\n\nWait, but the given string is in a specific order of terminals, but in a context-free grammar, derivations are leftmost or rightmost, but the string can be generated in any order as long as the non-terminals can be expanded to match the sequence.\n\nHmm, maybe I should construct a parse tree or see the possible expansions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be the way to go, but since the string is given, I can just try to see step by step how each part can be generated.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S can produce two options: NT61 NT59 and NT29 NT9.\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. But since the string starts with t74 t12 t95 t2..., which is multiple t's, I need to see how each of these can be generated.\n\nWait, no. The string is a series of t's, which are terminals. So, each part of the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in one of the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break down the string into parts that match the non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently. The string is a sequence of terminals. Each step of the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). So, the derivation process will build up the string by substituting non-terminals with their productions until only terminals remain.\n\nWait, but given the string, the order would come from the leftmost derivation. But perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be split into parts that match the non-terminals' expansions.\n\nLet's look at the grammar rules again. For example, S can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So, if the string starts with NT61's production, let's see if that could break down into the given string.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is provided, perhaps I can check if each non-terminal in the production chain can expand into a part of the string.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe I should consider for each step of the derivation, how the symbols could match.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t74, t12, etc. Let me check if the terminal t74 is used in any production rule where a non-terminal expands to it.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65, which in turn produces other non-terminals, but I also see NT68 \u2192 't83'. Wait, no, actually, the grammar has some rules where a non-terminal expands into a terminal. For example, NT66 \u2192 't95', NT10 \u2192 't96', NT33 \u2192 't32', etc.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbols are t74, t12, t95, t2, t0, t79, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that produce t74. Let me check. Oh, actually, in the given grammar, NT68 \u2192 't83', NT65 \u2192 't36', but wait, looking through the list, I see that many rules end with a terminal.\n\nFor example, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't36'\n- NT57 \u2192 't5'\n- NT29 \u2192 't87'\n- NT23 \u2192 't79'\n- NT6 \u2192 't74'\nWait, look at that! The non-terminal NT6 \u2192 't74'. So, in one of the rules, NT6 can produce t74.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t74, that suggests that at some point, a NT6 non-terminal was expanded into t74.\n\nSimilarly, looking further, NT74 seems to be a terminal, as in the string, t74 is followed by t12. Let me see if there's any rule where a non-terminal can produce t74 followed by t12.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see that NT12 has a production. Let me check the grammar for NT12. Looking through, I don't see any production for NT12, but I do see NT24 \u2192 't2', NT29 \u2192 't62', wait no, looking through, I see:\n\nWait, let's list all the rules that produce terminals. So, in the grammar, the right-hand sides (RHS) that are terminals are:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't95'\n- NT2 \u2192 't64'\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (but wait, in the given grammar, NT5 can produce 't83', 't5', etc.)\nWait, actually, for the rules that end with a terminal, for example:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't36'\n- NT29 \u2192 't87'\n- NT12 \u2192 ... Oh, wait, NT12 isn't in the production. Wait, checking the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 't83', NT65 \u2192 't36', and others.\n\nWait, but I'm looking at the grammar rules, and I find that some non-terminals expand to terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 't74', which we've noted.\n\nSo, for the string t74 t12 t95 t2 t0 t79 t99 t99 t9 t19 t96 t96 t60 t64 t35 t46 t95 t2 t12 t95 t25 t63 t48 t19 t46.\n\nIf the first symbol is t74, that must come from NT6, because in the grammar NT6 \u2192 't74'.\n\nSo, the first non-terminal would be NT6, which then expands to t74 and something else.\n\nWait, but NT6 only appears in the rule NT68 \u2192 't83' and NT65 \u2192 't36', but in our case, I saw that NT6 \u2192 't74' which is a terminal. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the rule is:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't83'\n- NT65 \u2192 't36'\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Oh, no, I think I confused NT6 with something else. Wait, in the grammar, does any non-terminal expand to t74? Let me look through the rules.\n\nLooking through the list, I see that:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't36'\n- NT29 \u2192 't87'\n- NT6 \u2192 't74'\n- No, I think I saw earlier that NT6 is NT6 \u2192 't74', but wait, looking again, no. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking through the list provided, yes, there's a rule: NT6 \u2192 't74' and NT60 \u2192 't68' and NT65 \u2192 't36', etc.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t74, that would correspond to the production of NT6.\n\nSo, S can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. But wait, S can't produce anything that would produce t74 directly, because S's initial productions are NT61 NT59 and NT29 NT9, both of which are non-term"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-490","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t74 t87 t66 t74 t49 t30 t5 t96 t18 t46 t35 t9 t79 t63 t99 t99 t94 t99 t99 t9 t5 t42 t62 t63 t5 t46`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. CNF is a specific form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a single non-terminal. The given grammar has many rules, but some of them produce terminal symbols ('t') followed by a number. Others produce other non-terminals.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of these 't' symbols with numbers. My goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI notice that the grammar starts with S -> NT61 NT59. So any derivation must start with NT61 and NT59. Let me check if the string starts with these. The first part is t74 t87 t66 t74... But looking at the grammar, I need to see what NT61 and NT59 can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT65 -> NT71 NT65, which might lead to more non-terminals. But some NT rules produce specific terminals. For example, NT68 -> 't12', so when NT68 is derived, it becomes 't12'.\n\nI should check if the string can be broken down by these terminal symbols. Let me see if the numbers in the string correspond to any terminals that can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t74, t87, t66, etc. I'm wondering if these numbers correspond to any non-terminals that have production rules ending with those terminals. For example, if a non-terminal X can produce 't87', there must be a rule X -> 't87' or some combination leading to it.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar more carefully. There are rules where non-terminals directly transform into 'tX' such as NT68 -> 't12', NT60 -> 't49', NT5 -> 't5', etc. So any 'tX' in the string must be the result of an NT producing that terminal.\n\nI'll go through the string and try to see which 't's can be matched. Starting with t74: does any NT generate 't74'? Looking through, I don't see a direct rule for t74. Wait, the grammar has NT7 -> 't83' and NT60 -> 't65', etc. So perhaps I made a mistake; maybe t74 is from NT84 -> 't65', but that's 't65', not 't74'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal rules and see which numbers are present.\n\nFrom the given rules, the terminals are generated by:\n\nNT68 -> 't12'\nNT60 -> 't49'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT47 -> 't73'\nNT88 -> 't42'\nNT29 -> 't87'\nNT18 -> 't66'\nNT26 -> 't42'\nNT59 -> 't35'\nNT55 -> 't5'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT18 -> 't66' - but wait, NT5 also goes to 't5'.\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me go through each terminal rule:\n\n- NT68 -> 't12'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT47 -> 't73'\n- NT88 -> 't42'\n- NT29 -> 't87'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT26 -> 't42'\n- NT59 -> 't35'\n- NT55 -> 't5'\n- NT18 -> 't66' again\n- NT58 -> 't95'\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n- NT96 -> 't67'\n- NT73 -> 't53'\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n... And more.\n\nWait, perhaps some of these are conflicting. For example, NT29 can produce 't87' and so on. So for each 'tX' in the string, I need to see if there's a non-terminal that can produce 'tX' directly.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt74, t87, t66, t74, t49, t30, t5, t96, t18, t46, t35, t9, t79, t63, t99, t99, t94, t99, t99, t9, t5, t42, t62, t63, t5, t46.\n\nSo, let me see each 'tX' and check if it's in the terminal rules:\n\n- t74: Not listed anywhere in the grammar's terminal productions, so that's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated as it has t74, which isn't produced by any rule.\nWait, is that correct? Did I miss any? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only 't's are 't12', 't5', 't49', 't73', 't42', 't66', 't35', etc. I don't see 't74' in any of the rules. So if the string starts with t74, which is not allowed by the grammar, then the answer must be No.\n\nYes, that's the key. Since there's a t74 in the string that doesn't correspond to any terminal production in the grammar, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. So the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-491","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string can be derived from the grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the case where a production can produce a terminal directly, which in CNF is allowed only for the start symbol if needed. Wait, no, wait\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires all productions to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So in this grammar, every rule is either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal, except I notice that some rules have non-terminals on both sides but also sometimes a terminal. Let me check the given grammar to confirm.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see some like S \u2192 NT61 NT59, which are two non-terminals. Others like NT68 \u2192 't12', which is a terminal. So yes, it's in CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, as S is the top symbol in the first production. So S is at the top level, and we need to derive the given string using these production rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t12 t39 t67 t74 t12 t2 t79 t41 t12 t41 t42 t64 t54 t63 t0 t13 t99 t99 t9 t19 t42 t87 t63 t5 t46`.\n\nHmm, that's quite a long string. I need to see if each part of this string can be generated by the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number represents a terminal symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, to generate this string, each part after the start symbol (S) must be either non-terminals until they can be fully resolved to terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each element must be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, the first step is to see what S can produce, but in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT61 NT59 is the only production. So S can only produce NT61 and NT59 as the next symbols. Then, each of those must eventually produce the string.\n\nBut wait, the given string starts with t74, so if the first production is S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then the first part would be NT61 and NT59, which would produce t74 and t12 if that's the way.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that NT68 \u2192 't12' is a production. So maybe NT59 can produce t74 and NT61 can produce t12? But wait, in the grammar, NT61 is defined as NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So that can't be a terminal yet.\n\nWait, let's look at the possible productions that produce terminals. Each time a non-terminal can be replaced by a terminal, it's a terminal production. So any non-terminal that's a terminal directly would appear in the grammar as N \u2192 a. Let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that several have 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT68 \u2192 't12', NT19 \u2192 't0', NT79 \u2192 't80', etc. So each of these is a terminal production.\n\nSo, to make progress, I can try to parse the string from the start, replacing non-terminals step by step until I get all terminals.\n\nWait, but how do I parse a string with multiple non-terminals in the given order?\n\nI think a better approach would be to start from the start symbol S and try to structure the parse.\n\nThe string starts with t74, which is produced by NT68 \u2192 't12'? Wait, no. Looking at the grammar, the production NT68 \u2192 't12' exists. So NT68 can be t12.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first element is t74. Let me check if there's a rule for NT74.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT68 \u2192 't12', but no NT74. Wait, in the grammar, the rules are:\n\nLooking down the list, I see NT67 \u2192 't72', NT54 \u2192 't64', NT64 \u2192 't83', etc. I don't see an NT74 rule. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the string provided is: t74 t12 t39 t67 t74 t12 t2 t79 t41 t12 t41 t42 t64 t54 t63 t0 t13 t99 t99 t9 t19 t42 t87 t63 t5 t46.\n\nSo the first element is t74. Since I don't see a rule that directly produces t74 as a terminal, that's an issue. Because the grammar for S is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So from S, we get NT61 and NT59. Then, each of those must expand into the string. But the string starts with t74, so I can't get that from NT61 or NT59 unless they produce that, which they don't currently.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. Maybe I missed a rule that produces t74. Looking through the production rules:\n\nFor example, looking for NT74.\n\nLooking down the list, I see productions like NT67 \u2192 't52', NT24 \u2192 't39', NT60 \u2192 't68', etc. But I don't see NT74 being generated as a terminal. So maybe the string can't be derived because the first terminal can't be produced by any rule.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check the rules for NT. The rules given are for NT61, NT29, etc., but not NT74. So no production rule exists for NT74 in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-509","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it's structured in a way that makes parsing easier, and each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol in some cases. However, looking at the grammar provided, all the productions except for S seem to have two non-terminals, but S itself produces two non-terminals. So maybe it's a standard CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t62 t96 t96 t96 t96 t86 t74 t12 t2 t79 t9 t79 t99 t99 t0 t5 t86 t32 t64 t9 t79 t63 t2 t64 t35 t35 t35`\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the string is structured in terms of the grammar. The string consists of a series of symbols separated by spaces, each of which is a terminal. Since the grammar is CNF, the top-down approach using the CYK algorithm could be useful, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can break down the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial symbol is S -> NT61 NT59. So the string should start with these two terms. In the given string, the first symbol is t62, which is not immediately clear where it comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the productions for each symbol in the string.\n\nLet me list out the symbols in the string: t62, t96, t96, t96, t96, t86, t74, t12, t2, t79, t9, t79, t99, t99, t0, t5, t86, t32, t64, t9, t79, t63, t2, t64, t35, t35, t35.\n\nEach of these terminals needs to be generated by the grammar. Let me start by checking the start symbol.\n\nS -> NT61 NT59. So the string should begin with t61 and t59. But in the given string, the first term is t62, not t61, so that's a problem. Maybe it's just not the same due to substitution?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial productions may vary, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the initial production is correct, but the string starts with something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is generated through substitution from the start symbol, but maybe I should check if all terminals in the string can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated by some intermediate rules that ultimately derive the correct sequence.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is a combination of two non-terminals, every symbol in the string must come from a derivation path that eventually resolves to a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the symbols are either terminals (like t5, t62, t96, etc.) or non-terminals with specific productions.\n\nSo let me list all the terminals in the string: t62, t96, t96, t96, t96, t86, t74, t12, t2, t79, t9, t79, t99, t99, t0, t5, t86, t32, t64, t9, t79, t63, t2, t64, t35, t35, t35.\n\nNow, for each of these, I need to check if they have productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- t62: NT62 has a production -> 't12' but Wait, in the grammar, I see NT62 -> 't12'. So t62 can be replaced with 't12'.\n\nSimilarly, t96: Let's see, in the grammar, is there an NT with t96? Let me check. Looking through, I see NT96 -> 't86' under NT96's production.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me see each terminal and see where they come from.\n\nLooking through the grammar productions:\n\nNT62 -> t12\n\nNT96 -> t86\n\nNT74 -> t74? Or does NT74 have any production? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT96 -> 't86'\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each terminal:\n\n- t62: NT62 -> 't12' (so t62 is produced by NT62).\n\n- t96: NT96 -> 't86' (so t96 is produced by NT96).\n\n- t74: Looking for NT with t74... Hmm, in the grammar, I don't see any NT's production ending with 't74'. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through each production, some of them are:\n\nNT96 -> 't86'\n\nWait, perhaps 't74' is produced by NT74. Let me check if that's in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through each line, I see:\n\nNT33 -> NT32 NT72\n\nNT32 -> NT18 NT65\n\nNT18 -> NT66 NT23\n\nNT23 -> NT13 NT59\n\nNT13 -> NT22 NT29\n\nWait, not seeing t74. Wait, does any NT directly produce 't74'?\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT74 is not in the non-terminals of the grammar; instead, it's possible that a production like NT99 -> 't74' exists. Wait, looking:\n\nNo, wait, looking more carefully, I see for NT96: `NT96 -> 't86'` but I don't see any NT producing 't74' in this grammar. So that's a problem because in the string, we have a t74, which would need to come from some NT, but the grammar doesn't seem to have any NT that directly produces t74.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check: the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT74 -> t74? Looking back, no. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let's go line by line:\n\nLooking for any NT that produces t74:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT61 NT59\n\nLine 2: S -> NT29 NT9\n\nLine 3: NT47 -> NT58 NT95\n\nLine 4: NT79 -> NT36 NT52\n\nLine 5: NT15 -> NT48 NT59\n\nLine 6: NT65 -> NT71 NT65\n\nLine 7: NT78 -> NT93 NT7\n\nLine 8: NT65 -> NT10 NT96\n\nLine 9: NT29 -> NT14 NT86\n\nLine 10: NT83 -> NT24 NT46\n\nLine 11: NT88 -> NT15 NT29\n\nLine 12: NT36 -> NT6 NT78\n\nLine 13: NT93 -> NT62 NT83\n\nLine 14: NT15 -> NT15 NT77\n\nLine 15: NT73 -> NT26 NT24\n\nLine 16: NT68 -> NT93 NT88\n\nLine 17: NT17 -> NT46 NT54\n\nLine 18: NT60 -> NT68 NT52\n\nLine 19: NT67 -> NT57 NT14\n\nLine 20: NT67 -> NT29 NT87\n\nLine 21: NT70 -> NT52 NT81\n\nLine 22: NT58 -> NT66 NT23\n\nLine 23: NT2 -> NT52 NT86\n\nLine 24: NT31 -> NT26 NT29\n\nLine 25: NT57 -> NT17 NT27\n\nLine 26: NT78 -> NT56 NT54?

{"custom_id":"request-529","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long and composed of symbols like 't' followed by numbers. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful because it simplifies the parsing process, especially for algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But I'm not sure if I need to use that here or if there's a simpler way to analyze the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it has several production rules. Some of them are terminals, like S \u2192 NT61 NT59, and others are non-terminals producing other non-terminals. For example, S can produce NT61 and NT59, which are both non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals then breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals. My goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t87 t96 t86 t74 t38 t95 t79 t9 t19 t99 t64 t67 t80 t99 t9 t5 t48 t9 t19 t48 t64 t41 t12 t2 t60 t63 t2 t64`.\n\nI notice that each 't' is followed by a number, which I assume corresponds to non-terminal symbols in the grammar. For example, 't87' likely corresponds to NT87, 't96' to NT96, and so on.\n\nI need to figure out a way to parse the string step by step to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step in the derivation either combines two symbols into another or replaces a non-terminal with a terminal.\n\nLet me try to approach this by building a parse tree. Starting from the string, I can work backwards to see if it can be broken down into smaller parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't87', which corresponds to NT87. From the grammar, I see that NT87 has the production rule NT87 -> NT56 NT5. So, 't87' can be split into 't56' and 't5'. \n\nNow, looking at the original string, the part after 't87' starts with 't96'. However, in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT96 that starts with a terminal. Wait, actually, looking closer, there's a production: NT10 -> NT96 NT95. But that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, I think I need to map each 't' to the corresponding rule. Let me look again at the grammar and see which non-terminals have terminal symbols as their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several productions that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT9 -> 't18'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT14 -> 't2'\n- NT24 -> 't2'\n- NT18 -> 't66'\n- NT23 -> 't79' (Wait, no, some are terminals, others are not)\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, looking back, some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals, like NT5-> 't5', NT48-> 't19', NT93->'t72', etc. Wait, let me list all the terminal productions from the grammar:\n\nNT29 -> 't87' (Wait, no, looking again: NT29 has a production NT29->NT14 NT86, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are lines like:\n\nNT29 -> NT14 NT86,\n\nand also,\n\nNT29 -> NT62 NT83.\n\nAnd NT62 is defined as NT6->'t74', and NT83 as 't80'. So, from NT29 we can get 't74' and 't80'. But in the string, the symbol after 't87' is 't96', which is NT96, and then 't86' which is NT86.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should list all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the lines that start with a terminal (like 't12', 't94', etc.) indicate that the non-terminal on the left produces that terminal. So, for example:\n\n- NT67 -> 't51' (Wait, no. Let me check: No, some of the productions are of the form NTx -> 'ty'. For example, NT68->'t83', NT60->'t49', etc.\n\nSo to map each 't' to a non-terminal, I can create a list of the terminal productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT68 -> 't83'\n\nNT60 -> 't49'\n\nNT67 -> 't51'\n\nNT95 -> 't94'\n\nNT46 -> 't60'\n\nNT2 -> 't64'\n\nNT31 -> 't54'\n\nNT72 -> 't30'\n\nNT58 -> 't95'\n\nNT46 -> 't79'\n\nNT23 -> 't79' and 't13'\n\nWait, wait, let me go through the grammar line by line, looking for lines where a non-terminal is directly assigned a terminal:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n\nSo NT68 produces 't83'\n\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n\n- NT67 -> 't51'\n\n- NT95 -> 't94'\n\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n\n- NT2 -> 't64'\n\n- NT31 -> 't54'\n\n- NT72 -> 't30'\n\n- NT58 -> 't95'\n\n- NT46 -> 't79' (Wait, is that correct?

So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the production rules seem to fit this CNF structure. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59 is a non-terminal S producing two non-terminals NT61 and NT59. Other rules like NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7 also fit, as they produce two non-terminals. The more specific ones like NT2 \u2192 t64 are terminals, so these are the terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nThe given string consists entirely of terminals (all the 't' followed by numbers). So, to check if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if there's a derivation starting from the start symbol S and ending with this string.\n\nChomsky normal form grammars are useful for parsing with algorithms like CYK, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to see if the string can be built step by step by replacing non-terminals with terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking for the overall structure. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, can only be derived into two non-terminals: NT61 and NT59. So the first two symbols in any derivation from S must be the results of expanding NT61 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are 't87 t96'. So let's see if NT61 can produce 't87' and NT59 can produce 't96', or vice versa.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, meaning NT61 is the first non-terminal and NT59 is the second. So in any successful derivation, the first part will expand into 't87' via NT61 and the second into 't96' via NT59, or vice versa. But since the order matters, it has to be t87 followed by t96.\n\nWait, actually, the order from S is NT61 and NT59. So in the string, the sequence is 't87 t96', which corresponds to NT61 producing a 't87' and NT59 producing 't96'. Alternatively, if NT61 expands to multiple symbols, it would be a sequence, but in this case, the first element is t87, meaning that NT61 must directly produce t87.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some rules where NT61 \u2192 NT36 NT65, but also NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Wait, more importantly, are there any rules where NT61 directly produces a terminal? Scanning through, I don't see any production for NT61 that directly goes to a terminal. All seem to go to other non-terminals or pairs.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the grammar again. The user provided a long list of productions. Let me spot if any non-terminal directly goes to a terminal. Looking through, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5' (terminal)\nNT46 \u2192 't60'\nNT88 \u2192 't72'\nNT23 \u2192 't3' and 't87'\nNT2 \u2192 't64'\nNT79 \u2192 't80'\nNT28 \u2192 't63'\n...\n\nOh, okay, so there are non-terminals that produce terminals. So for example, NT23 can produce 't79' or 't3', etc. But wait, in the string, I have t87, which is part of the first token. Looking at the grammar rules for NT23, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't79' or 't3' or others? Wait, the user's grammar has:\n\nNT23 -> 't79'\nNT23 -> 't3'\nWait, perhaps I need to check.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe user's grammar includes lines like:\nNT23 -> 't79'\nand\nNT23 -> 't3'\n\nSo yes, NT23 can produce either 't79' or 't73' (wait, no, in the grammar it's:\n\nLooking at the full list, the rule is NT23 \u2192 't79' and also NT23 \u2192 't3'. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar:\n\nNT23 -> 't79'\nNT23 -> 't3'\n\nYes, so NT23 can produce t79 or t3.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t87. So how is t87 produced? Looking for a production where any non-terminal directly or indirectly produces t87.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7, NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65, etc. Also, looking specifically for production rules that have t87.\n\nWait, in the grammar, where does t87 appear? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\n... lines like:\n\nNT93 -> 't72'\n\nNT56 -> 't51'\n\n... hmm, looking for t87 in the right-hand sides.\n\nWait, let's go through the entire list:\n\n' NT68 -> 't83' '\n\nNo.\n\nNT55 -> 't19'\n\nWait, looking through all lines, I see:\n\nLine: NT95 -> 't94'\n\nNT47 -> 't73' \n\nWait, I'm looking for any production rules where a non-terminal directly goes to t87.\n\nHmm. Looking through all the given terminal rules:\n\nHere's the complete list of terminalProductions:\n\nNT2 -> 't64'\nNT79 -> 't80'\nNT28 -> 't63'\nNT8 -> 't2'\nNT24 -> 't2'\nNT29 -> 't87'\nWait, yes! Here: NT29 \u2192 't87'.\n\nSo NT29 can directly produce t87. So that's one non-terminal that can go to t87.\n\nSo going back to the string: the first token is t87. Therefore, that must come from NT29 \u2192 't87'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what is the production rule for NT29?\n\nIn the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86.\n\nSo NT29 can produce two non-terminals: NT14 and NT86.\n\nSo in the derivation, NT29 is expanded into NT14 and NT86. Now, we need to see if these can produce the rest of the string after t87.\n\nWait, but in the string after t87, the next is t96. So the expansion of NT29 must produce 't87 t96', which would require both NT14 and NT86 to directly produce a terminal each. But looking at the grammar, do NT14 and NT86 directly produce terminals?\n\nLooking at NT14:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't2' (line: NT14 -> 't2')\n\nSo NT14 can produce 't2', which is a terminal. So in the expansion of NT29, we have NT14 \u2192 t2 and NT86 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, but in the string, after t87 comes t96. So the next symbol is t96. So for NT29, we have NT14 producing t2, but then NT86 must produce t96. So I'll need NT86 to produce t96.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT86:\n\nNT86 is not directly producing a terminal, from the terminal list, so perhaps there are productions I missed. Wait, in the grammar, NT86 is a non-terminal, so it must be expanded into other non-terminals. Wait, looking for NT86 in the given productions.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see a production for NT86. Hmm, perhaps NT86 is a problem. Wait, let me double-check if all rules are correctly given.\n\nWait, in the original grammar provided, under the terminal rules, I can see:\n\nNT68 -> 't83'\n\nNT96 -> 't86'\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking for NT86, perhaps through the non-terminal chain. Wait, maybe NT86 is produced elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps NT86 is a chain. For example, perhaps some other non-terminal rules lead to NT86. Let's check.\n\nFor example, do any rules produce NT86?

{"custom_id":"request-548","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and some of them might be terminal symbols (like 't74', 't19', etc.) or non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the production rules to understand the structure better. I see that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So, the starting symbol is S, and the initial step is to break it down into NT61 and NT59. Each of these non-terminals will then be expanded further until we reach terminals, which are the 't' symbols or numbers without 't', like 't42' or 't12'. Numbers like '0', '1', etc., are terminals as well.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't74', which is a terminal symbol. So, I need to check if 't74' can be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar. Scanning through the production rules, I spot NT68 \u2192 't83', but that's not 't74'. NT67 \u2192 't31' or 't28'\u2014none of those. Wait, there's NT60 \u2192 't49' and NT65 \u2192 't32', so 't74' isn't directly a terminal for any of these. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see NT68 \u2192 't83' and NT14 \u2192 't2'. Wait, in the production rules, NT27 \u2192 't7' and NT27 is produced by NT7 \u2192 't19 NT23'. That might be a path to a 't' symbol. But I need to find where 't74' comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me list all the production rules again to make sure I didn't miss 't74'. Looking through the rules, I see NT67 \u2192 't31' and 't28', NT62 \u2192 't12', NT5 \u2192 't5', NT46 \u2192 't46', and so on. Oh, I also see NT68 \u2192 't83', NT67 \u2192 't53' and 't48', NT66 \u2192 't95', etc. Hmm, I'm not seeing 't74' as a direct terminal. Maybe it's derived through a chain of expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for NT's that can lead to 't74'. Is there any NT rule that ends in 't74'? Let me see the list again. I don't immediately see any. So perhaps 't74' isn't a terminal but a non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe it is a terminal, but I'm not sure. If it's a terminal, then I need to see if any production rule for a non-terminal directly produces it. If not, then 't74' might not appear as a terminal in any derived string, meaning the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, the grammar's non-terminals have production rules that produce other non-terminals or terminals. If 't74' is a terminal, it's only produced if some non-terminal's rule generates it directly. Looking through all the rules, I don't see 't74' being produced by any rule on the right-hand side. For example, NT67 \u2192 't53' or 't48', so that's not it. Similarly, NT68 \u2192 't83', which is a terminal, but not 't74'. So, perhaps 't74' is not a terminal in the grammar, meaning it cannot appear in any generated string. If that's the case, the string starts with 't74', which can't be generated by the grammar, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a rule that indirectly leads to 't74'. For example, if a non-terminal A produces B and C, and B produces 't74', then A can eventually produce 't74'. Let me check which non-terminals could produce 't74'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT68 \u2192 't83', so that's a terminal but not 't74'. NT22 \u2192 't67', which is another non-terminal, so that path goes to another non-terminal. NT67 \u2192 't53' or 't48', which are terminals but not 't74'. NT52 \u2192 't42' or 't86', again terminals but not 't74'. NT29 \u2192 't62' or 't87', 't87' is present in the string later. NT15 \u2192 't96' or 't96' is in the string as well, but 't96' isn't a terminal, it's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 't74' isn't a terminal. So if the string has 't74' as the first symbol, and it's a terminal, but the grammar doesn't produce 't74' directly, then the string can't be generated.

{"custom_id":"request-569","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a good starting point because it simplifies parsing. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. They all follow the pattern A \u2192 BC, which is typical for CNF. The start symbol is S, which first expands into NT61 NT59. So, the string must eventually derive from these two non-terminals.\n\nThe string given is `t74 t12 t41 t95 t25 t12 t39 t67 t74 t72 t2 t67 t82 t72 t99 t64 t2 t0 t19 t48 t99 t64 t18 t35 t0 t3 t63 t2 t19 t35`.\n\nI notice that each 't' is followed by a number, which probably represents a terminal symbol. Also, numbers might correspond to non-terminals that have been expanded into these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals are mapped to terminals. For example, NT61 -> 't36', NT60 -> 't49', etc. I think the numbers after 't' in the string are the identifiers in the grammar, indicating the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nSo, to check if the string is valid, every non-terminal symbol must lead to the correct terminals. Maybe I can work from the start symbol and apply the productions step by step, seeing if I can reach the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so the string should branch into two parts: one for each NT. Let me track each pathway.\n\nFirst NT61: The production is NT61 \u2192 NT36 NT55. So, NT61 could be 't36' followed by NT55. Looking at the string, I'm looking for 't36' in the correct position.\n\nWait, actually, each NT has a corresponding 't' rule. Let me see:\n\nNT61 -> 't36' according to the grammar. So, in the string, when there's a 't36', it corresponds to NT61. Then NT55 -> 't5', so 't5' would come next.\n\nSimilarly, NT60 -> 't49', but in the string, I have a 't67' and 't64', so maybe that's a different case.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't74 t12 t41 t95...'. I'm confused because the first two 't74' and 't12' don't directly correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. For example, looking at the grammar, 't74' is not a terminal symbol. It might be derived from a non-terminal that produces 't74'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see some 't's with numbers. For instance, NT17 -> 't48', which is one of the terminals. Similarly, NT46 -> 't60', which is another terminal.\n\nBut to get 't74', which isn't directly in the grammar, I need to find if any NT production leads to 't74'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that ends with 't74'. That could be a problem because 't74' isn't present as a terminal in any production.\n\nWait, but the user provided the 't's as part of the string. So perhaps the grammar was designed such that these 't's are terminals, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe each production's right-hand side is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT61 -> 't36' might be the case, but if a production's right-hand side includes both terminals and NTs, that complicates things. However, the grammar's productions are all of the form NTxy \u2192 NTC DE, where NTC and DE are either NTs or in some cases terminals like 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, for example, NT61 -> NT36 NT55, which is two non-terminals, both of which have corresponding 't' productions. Similarly, NT59 -> 't19', so in the string, when we encounter 't19', it must correspond to NT59.\n\nSo, maybe each token in the string is either a terminal (like 't36' or 't12') or a non-terminal (which needs to be expanded further). The problem is to see if the string can be fully parsed by the grammar.\n\nBut in this case, the string has 't74' which isn't directly a terminal in any production. Let me check the grammar for any NT rule that produces 't74'. Scanning through all the rules, I don't see any NT rule that produces something ending with 't74'. For example, NT61 \u2192 't36', but I don't see any NT that directly provides 't74'. \n\nWait, perhaps the 't74' in the string is part of a larger production. But given that the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols, so right-hand sides have length two. That means each production is only splitting into two parts, so the string is a sequence of these right-hand sides, but each step must correspond to two symbols.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, so each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. But to build the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so it's built by recursively applying these rules.\n\nBut the approach might be to parse the string from the start symbol and see if it can be generated. Alternatively, since the grammar uses leftmost derivation, perhaps I can try to expand the start symbol and see if the string can match.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as checking if each part of the string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a tree where each node has exactly two children. So, the string must correspond to the leaves of a full binary tree of height equal to the number of productions needed.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to note that the string must be a sequence that can be generated by applying productions starting from S, replacing non-terminals with their productions until all are terminals.\n\nBut given that the string has 't74' which isn't directly in any production except as a possible result of some derivation, perhaps a leftmost derivation process could reach 't74'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: in the grammar rules, I see NT23 -> 't3', etc. But 't74' doesn't come up as any NT rule ends with it. So unless 't74' is somehow produced by some non-terminal, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, maybe I've missed a rule. Let me go through all the NT rules to check:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 't36', NT55 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT65 \u2192 't32' or 't67', etc.\n\nWait, let me check all the NTs.\n\nLooking for any NT with a production that has a 't' followed by 74. None of them seem to do that.\n\nWait, maybe NT74 is a non-terminal? Looking back at the grammar, I don't see NT74. The last rule I see is NT22 -> 't67' and things like that. So 't74' is not directly a terminal of any production.\n\nTherefore, if 't74' is part of the string, it must come from some non-terminal that has a production ending in 't74'. But since none of the NT rules in the grammar produce a terminal followed by 74, it's impossible for 't74' to appear in the string generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but wait: the string has 't74 t12...'. Let me confirm that none of the rules have a 't74' in the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNo NT's production seems to end with 't74' as a terminal. For example, NT67 -> 't67' is one of the rules, but that's a NT67, not a 't74' terminal.\n\nWait, is there any NT that produces 't74'? Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT with a production that ends with 't74'. So, 't74' cannot be generated by this grammar because it's not present as a terminal.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in the rules, the 't's are parts of larger strings. For example, maybe the 't74' comes from a non-terminal that has a production that includes a 't74' in one of its symbols. But the string is a sequence of terminals, which are individual 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, in order to have 't74' in the string, there must be a non-terminal that can produce 't74' as one of its terminals in a production. But as per the grammar rules, I don't see any such production.\n\nTherefore, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's list them out for clarity:\n\n1. t62\n2. t96\n3. t67\n4. t74\n5. t38\n6. t36\n7. t96\n8. t67\n9. t30\n10. t19\n11. t67\n12. t36\n13. t50\n14. t74\n15. t94\n16. t49\n17. t64\n18. t9\n19. t3\n20. t63\n21. t99\n22. t99\n23. t94\n24. t42\n25. t99\n26. t9\n27. t5\n28. t62\n29. t48\n30. t64\n\nNow, let's see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar. Let's start from the beginning and try to match the productions.\n\nThe first token is 't62', which comes from NT62. Looking at the grammar, we see NT62 \u2192 't62'. So far, so good. Now, the first symbols in the string are t62, so we can match that. But looking at the grammar for S, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so the entire string must be derived from S, which requires that the entire string is the concatenation of what NT61 and NT59 derive into.\n\nBut looking at our string, it starts with t62, which is from NT62. But according to the grammar, the string must start with either NT61 or NT29 NT9, etc. Wait, the start symbol S is either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So the first token should be the first component of one of these options. But our string starts with t62, which is from a different path.

Let me start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure and the production rules. It seems a bit complex with all these non-terminals and terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces combinations of non-terminals and terminals. My goal is to parse the given string using either the top-down approach (like using a parser or the CYK algorithm) or the bottom-up approach (using memoization or something similar).\n\nBut before I dive into any parsing algorithms, maybe I can simplify this by trying to identify which parts of the grammar actually produce terminals and see if I can reconstruct the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that some of them directly produce terminals: for example, 't12', 't94', 't83', etc. So, each non-terminal can potentially derive into a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nThe given string is: `t74 t38 t36 t67 t66 t32 t30 t64 t0 t13 t63 t99 t99 t94 t99 t99 t9 t19 t96 t60 t64 t35 t95 t25 t12 t95 t2 t63 t48 t19 t46`.\n\nI need to check whether this string can be generated by the grammar. Let's start by looking at where each terminal comes from.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I can note that certain non-terminals produce specific terminals:\n- NT59 -> t46 (from NT59: NT61 NT59)\nWait, no, looking back, NT59's production isn't explicitly given as t46. Let me correct that. I think I might have mixed up. Let's go step by step.\n\nEach rule is of the form NT production -> NT1 NT2 or terminal(s). So, for example:\n- S -> NT61 NT59\n- NT5 -> NT61 NT84\n- NT5 -> 't83'\nAnd so on. So NT5 can produce both non-terminals and terminals. But some rules have only terminals on the right-hand side, like NT26 -> 't22'.\n\nWait, actually, in context-free grammars, each production is either a single non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or into terminals. So the grammar is in CNF, so every production is A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a single terminal.\n\nBut looking at the rules, some seem to have two non-terminals, like NT61 -> NT33 NT55. Others, like NT5 -> 't83' or NT26 -> 't22', produce terminals directly.\n\nSo, the string consists of a series of terminals, each of which must be generated by some production rule. So, for each terminal in the string, I need to check if it's derived from a specific non-terminal.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals they come from. Then, I can try to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nString: t74 t38 t36 t67 t66 t32 t30 t64 t0 t13 t63 t99 t99 t94 t99 t99 t9 t19 t96 t60 t64 t35 t95 t25 t12 t95 t2 t63 t48 t19 t46\n\nLooking through each terminal:\n\n- t74: Does any rule produce t74?

Let me check each rule:\n\nI notice:\n\n- NT20 -> NT73 NT73\n- NT20 -> NT52 NT70\n- NT15 -> NT48 NT59\n- NT32 -> NT18 NT65\n- NT55 -> NT5 -> 't5'... Wait, I'm probably getting confused.

The string is: `t74 t12 t95 t2 t2 t67 t74 t72 t0 t3 t99 t99 t9 t19 t67 t32 t64 t9 t79 t63 t48 t12 t95 t25 t99 t42 t9 t19 t54 t63 t19 t46`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar and the productions. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each production is a right-hand side of two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has two productions:\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT61 followed by NT59 or start with NT29 followed by NT9.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t74. Let's see if t74 is an expansion of any non-terminal. Looking through the productions, I see NT60 \u2192 't49', NT52 \u2192 't42', but I don't see a production for NT74. However, wait, there's a production NT2 \u2192 't64', but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, t74 is a terminal, so perhaps S must produce something that starts with NT74, but looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals start with t74. So that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. All the productions in the grammar end up expanding to terminals eventually. Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking at the bottom of the grammar, I see that certain non-terminals are assigned to terminals. For example, NT6 -> 't74', NT28 -> 't63', etc. Oh, so NT6 indeed maps to 't74' and NT12 maps to 't94'?\n\nWait, let me look: I see NT60 \u2192 't49', NT2 \u2192 't64', so:\n\n- NT6 (which is represented here as NT61, perhaps? Wait, the non-terminals are named like NT47, etc., but their expansions are in terms of 'tX'. So for example:\n\nLooking at NT60 \u2192 't65'? Wait, no. Let me scan the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT52 \u2192 't42'\n- NT18 \u2192 't36'\n- NT96 \u2192 't67'\n- NT28 \u2192 't63'\n- NT24 \u2192 't2'\n- NT96 \u2192 't67' again.\n- There's also NT67 \u2192 't53'.\n- Some others like NT5 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nBut for NT61, there's no terminal, it's only in the production for NT60: NT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52. Wait, but looking at other productions, I see NT60 \u2192 't49', so perhaps NT60 is a non-terminal that's assigned to 't49'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the non-terminals and the terminals. Each production is a right-hand side where the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\n\nBut NT61 can be further broken down.

Let me check.)\n\nSo each non-terminal eventually expands into terminals, with some looping or multiple paths.\n\nNow, the string starts with t74. Looking at the grammar, the only non-terminal that maps to 't74' is NG6? Wait, no. Let me check the productions. Oh, wait, I see at the bottom of the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I see that some directly map to 'tX' like:\n\n- NT68 -> 't12'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT47 -> 't73'\n- NT88 -> 't42'\n- NT18 -> 't36'\n- NT95 -> 't94'\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n- NT60 -> 't49' again\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't51'\n- NT95 -> 't94'\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n\nSo, perhaps each of these non-terminals represents a single terminal. So 't74' is not present in the direct mappings. Therefore, NT67 \u2192 't53', which is also not t74.\n\nWait, but looking through all the mappings, I don't see 't74' being produced by any non-terminal. So if the string starts with 't74', which is not defined in the grammar, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the grammar:\n\nLooking through the top of the grammar, the start is S, which splits into S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nNow, looking at S, after two splits, it goes all the way down. Let me try to see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't74' is a terminal that's part of the expansion of a larger non-terminal, but in this grammar, it seems none are defined as such.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

{"custom_id":"request-604","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. The grammar is quite extensive with multiple productions, so I need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recap what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a context-free grammar where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't produce any empty strings. The grammar provided seems to follow CNF because all the productions except the obvious ones have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except when a terminal is present, which is a single terminal.\n\nGiven the string to evaluate is: `t74 t38 t74 t9 t83 t99 t64 t48 t0 t5 t48 t19 t96 t18 t35 t35 t9 t79 t63 t42 t2 t53 t99 t64 t18 t35 t9 t3 t63 t2 t19 t46`.\n\nMy task is to determine whether this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since each production either combines non-terminals into two non-terminals or a non-terminal into a terminal, the way to approach this is to trace back from the string and see if we can collapse these terminals into the appropriate non-terminals using the given productions.\n\nLet me list out the string as a sequence of tokens (since each production results in two non-terminals or one terminal, each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two parts, leading to a longer string, but here we are moving in reverse, so each token is a result of a production step.\n\nBut before diving into that, perhaps it's useful to create a reverse approach. For a string to be generated by the grammar, every part of the string (from the start) must satisfy the productions. So, for each production that leads to a terminal, I can see which rule could produce that terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, the first thing I notice is that some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal, like:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nSo, starting from S, each step combines non-terminals, but if the top-level production uses NT61 and NT59, I need to see what those produce.\n\nLooking at the individual productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (and other 't' terms like t83, t99, etc.)\n- NT65 \u2192 't67' (but we have 't74', which can't come directly from NT65)\nWait, no, looking closer:\n\nThe productions that produce terminals are under NT65 \u2192 't67' is one of them, but wait in the given grammar, NT65 has a production NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 as well as NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96. Additionally, there's NT65 \u2192 't32'.\n\nWait, the user provided a very long list of productions, so perhaps it's a bit messy, but I can note that some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nFor example, NT59 \u2192 't46' (since NT59 \u2192 't46'), and check if the string has a 't46' somewhere.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is 't46'.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 't95' (so if there's 't95' in the string, it must come from NT58).\n\nOther productions are things like NT54 \u2192 't64', NT68 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way to start is to try to split the string into possible chunks that match the terminals produced by some non-terminals.\n\nRemember, each step in the derivation multiplies the count of non-terminals by 2 until all are terminals. But in reverse, each step would split a terminal string into a structure that matches the productions.\n\nSo let's try to split the string from the end backward.\n\nThe string is: t74 t38 t74 t9 t83 t99 t64 t48 t0 t5 t48 t19 t96 t18 t35 t35 t9 t79 t63 t42 t2 t53 t99 t64 t18 t35 t9 t3 t63 t2 t19 t46.\n\nLooking at the end, the last token is t46. From the productions, NT59 \u2192 't46'. So, the last token t46 must come from NT59. That means before that, the string before t46 should form t46, so we can look for the rule NT59.\n\nLooking at the prior tokens, let's see: the substring before t46 is t3 t63 t2 t19 t46.\n\nWait, no, the full string ends with ... t35 t9 t3 t63 t2 t19 t46.\n\nSo, to get t46, it must be from NT59.

{"custom_id":"request-630","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has some specific restrictions, like every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I see that all the rules seem to fit that form, except for maybe some where non-terminals might be on both sides, but upon closer look, most are direct productions to terminals or two non-terminals. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens starting with t80 and ending with t5, etc. Each 't' followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S following the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the string and see if it can be constructed step by step using the grammar. The string is: t80 t42 t9 t5 t86 t74 t72 t9 t13 t99 t99 t0 t5 t18 t35 t39 t67 t82 t12 t95 t2 t63 t2 t64 t2 t60 t12 t95 t25 t63 t2 t5 t46.\n\nI notice that the grammar's initial productions are S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So the string must start with the combination of NT61 and NT59. Looking at the string, the first token is t80. I need to see which production of NT61 and NT59 can start with t80.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 t36\n\nWait, NT61 can produce t36. But the string starts with t80. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Let me check NT61's productions again. \n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT61 has a production NT61 \u2192 T32... but I don't see it producing t80. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the NTs and the terminals. The terminals are t followed by numbers, so t80 is a terminal symbol. \n\nWait, the NT61 production that produces a terminal might be NT61 \u2192 t36. But in the string, the first token is t80, which doesn't match that. Similarly, checking other NTs:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t83, but that's terminal. Wait, maybe I need to find which non-terminal can derive to the first token.\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol S is S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so each of these NTs must derive to a terminal. Let me see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then each NT must derive to a terminal. So NT61 and NT59 must each produce a terminal that matches the first and second tokens respectively. But the first token is t80. So I need to see what NT61 can derive.\n\nLooking at NT61's productions: From the grammar, I don't see an production of NT61 directly to a terminal except for NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, which is two non-terminals. So that suggests that NT61 needs to be further expanded. But none of its productions seem to produce a terminal, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 (from the list: S -> NT61 NT59; NT61 -> NT33 NT55). So NT61 must be expanded further until it reaches a terminal. Then, the next non-terminal would have to produce the next part of the string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t80. So, starting from S, we have S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Let's say NT61 is expanded first. NT61's only production is to NT33 NT55, so that must be the next step. Then NT33 can produce what? Looking at NT33's productions: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72; NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65; NT18 \u2192 NT9 NT59; wait, but this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string as a leftmost derivation. Let's try to see which parts of the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, each must be produced by some NT or perhaps S.\n\nBut starting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59: So the first token would have to be the first terminal produced by NT61 immediately. If NT61 can go to a terminal, that would match the first symbol t80. But in the grammar, I don't see any direct production of NT61 to a terminal. The only production for NT61 is NT33 NT55, which are non-terminals. So, S must produce two non-terminals, which then must derive into two terminals. But the first symbol is t80, so let's see if NT61 can be expanded into t80 by going through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this by looking for a path in the grammar that starts at S and through a series of productions results in the given sequence.\n\nAnother approach is to look for any rule in the grammar that directly matches a part of the string. Let's check whether any term in the string is a direct production. For example, t80 appears as a terminal. Checking the grammar to see if any production ends with t80.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any terminal like t80 being the result of a production. All seem to be either non-terminals or combinations. So maybe the entire string is built from non-terminals that derive to multiple terminals, but since the string has a lot of t's, maybe the grammar allows that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that no production directly gives a terminal, so the only way a terminal appears in the leftmost position is through the initial S \u2192 NT61 NT59. But if NT61 and NT59 must both derive to terminals, then perhaps the first step is to see if NT61 can derive anything that starts with t80.\n\nWait, if NT61 is S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then S must be the combination of NT61 and NT59. But each of those produce a single terminal each, as the string is a linear sequence of terminals. So in the string, after t80 comes t42. So S must produce t80 and t42, meaning that NT61 must produce t80 and NT59 must produce t42.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that NT61 only can produce NT33 NT55. So perhaps the string cannot start with NT61, meaning that S cannot derive to t80 t42... So that would mean the string is invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there are other productions that allow NT61 to produce t80. Looking back at the grammar rules, I don't see NT61 directly producing a terminal starting with t80. The only production is NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, so NT61 must decompose into two non-terminals. Therefore, it can't produce a single terminal t80 directly.\n\nThus, the first symbol t80 can't be produced by any NT, meaning the string can't be derived from S using the given grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me look through the grammar again. Are there any rules that produce t80? Scanning through all the productions, I don't see any terminal like t80. So t80 must come from some NT which in turn must have a production that includes t80. But since none of the NTs directly produce t80, and all must go through multiple steps of non-terminals, it seems impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me try to understand the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except when B or C is a terminal. The start symbol appears on the left side of exactly one production, and all productions are pairwise disjoint. Also, every production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except possibly the start symbol which might produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF because each production is either a single terminal or exactly two non-terminals. Wait, no, some productions have two non-terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. That's two non-terminals, which fits CNF since it's two symbols, not more.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t38 t83 t99 t64 t96 t86 t74 t38 t95 t0 t5 t99 t64 t86 t36 t50 t74 t49 t49 t64 t9 t13 t63 t48 t64 t35 t9 t79 t63 t48 t19 t46`.\n\nI need to trace back from this string to see if it can be produced by the grammar. Since all productions in CNF are either terminals or two non-terminals, I'll work backward, splitting the string into pairs or single terminals that match each production.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. The first token is t74. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT65 \u2192 t67, NT9 \u2192 t18, etc. Wait, but t74 is a terminal. Checking the productions, I see that NT61 \u2192 t36, and NT65 \u2192 t32? No, wait: looking through the productions, some terminals are marked as 't' numbers. Let me see if any production produces t74.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT46 \u2192 t60, NT5 \u2192 t5, and several others.

Wait, looking back at the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 't67', NT54 \u2192 t64, NT60 \u2192 t49, etc. Wait, maybe I need to check if any non-terminal leads to 't74'. Alternatively, perhaps 't74' is produced by NT65, because I remember seeing NT65 \u2192 t32, but that's not helpful. Wait, let me make a list of all the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, each production where both sides are non-terminals, except when the right side has a terminal.

None of these produce 't' tokens. Wait, did I miss some 't' in the production? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT46 \u2192 't60'\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT54 \u2192 't64'\n- NT58 \u2192 't66 NT23'\n- NT23 \u2192 't2'\nWait, no, in the provided rules, I see NT23 \u2192 't2', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

But in the grammar, looking for a rule that produces t74. Wait, let me check all terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 t9\n- NT95 \u2192 t94\n- NT15 \u2192 t96\n- NT7 \u2192 t83\n- NT25 \u2192 t23\nWait, I'm not seeing t74 appearing as a direct production. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe t74 is produced by a chain of non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps t74 is a terminal in one of the non-terminals' productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this more methodically. Let's consider that each token in the string must come from the right-hand side of a production. Since each production in CNF is either two non-terminals or a terminal, I can try to see how each token is generated.\n\nStarting with the beginning of the string:\n\n1. t74: So, it must come from a production where either a non-terminal produces it directly, or it's part of a two-symbol production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any production where the right side is 't74'? Looking through the list:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't67'\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT58 \u2192 't66 NT23'\n- NT55 \u2192 't19'\n- NT27 \u2192 't74' Oh, wait! I see NT27 \u2192 t7 NT28. So t74 would not be directly produced by NT27, which produces t7 and t28. Hmm, that's 't7 t28'. Wait, no. Wait, NT27 \u2192 't7' and 't28'? Let me check the rules again. Oh, looking back: the production for NT27 is NT27 \u2192 't7' 't28' \u2014 no, wait, looking at the rules provided, it says NT27 \u2192 't7' 't28'? Or is it a non-terminal production? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking for where non-terminals produce terminals. Wait, here's a rule: NT27 \u2192 't7' 't28'? Wait no, let me see:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't7' 't28' \u2014 no, wait, no, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't7' 't28'\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided data, line by line:\n\nLooking for NT27:\n\nYes, line 17: NT27 \u2192 't7' 't28' \u2014 no, wait, in the data, it's written as NT27 -> 't7' 't28' \u2014 no, actually looking at the data:\n\n- NT27 -> 't7' 't28' \u2014 no, that's not right. Wait, actually, looking back, the line says:\n\n\"NT27 -> 't7' 't28'\" \u2014 no, wait, no. Let me check. The provided rules for the grammar state:\n\nLine: NT27 -> 't7' 't28' \u2014 no, it's actuallyNT27 -> 't7' 't28' \u2192 no, the data as given for NT27 is:\n\nNT27 -> 't7' 't28' \u2014 no, that's not right. Wait, no, in the data, it says:\n\nline 67: NT67 \u2192 't57' 't56'\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me go through the rules step by step.\n\nLooking for any NT that produces 't74'. I don't see any direct production for t74. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps t74 is produced by a non-terminal that, in its production, includes 't74' as one of the symbols. For example, if a non-terminal X produces 't74' as one part and another non-terminal, that could work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S production is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So to get the string, we'd have to split the entire string into two parts: the first part generated by NT61 split into two terminals, the second part generated by NT59.\n\nBut the string is 39 tokens long. That's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is built from a series of productions starting from S, each time splitting into two non-terminals until we get down to the terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if it's possible to split the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which simplifies parsing and analysis. \n\nFirst, let's parse the grammar. Each rule on the left side has the form X \u2192 YZ, where Y and Z are non-terminals, or sometimes a terminal. The right-hand side can be a string of two symbols. Some of these symbols are terminals, which are specific 't' followed by numbers. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by applying these rules step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t51 t74 t38 t5 t42 t99 t9 t19 t2 t0 t19 t48 t19 t96 t18 t46 t35 t0 t79 t63 t99 t99 t94 t42 t64 t18 t46 t0 t3 t63 t48 t5 t35`.\n\nI notice that in the grammar, certain non-terminals expand into terminals. For example, NT65 \u2192 t32, which directly produces the terminal t32. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 t5, NT2 \u2192 t64, etc.\n\nTo prove the string is generated, we can apply the grammar's production rules step by step to see if we can derive the string.\n\nLet me start by breaking the string into segments that might correspond to the grammar. The string is 35 tokens long, which gives me an idea of how many steps I might need, although it's not directly related because each step in the grammar can produce multiple tokens.\n\nI should look for the start symbol, S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So S expands into two non-terminals, NT61 and NT59. Let's see where these lead.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n- NT59 \u2192 NT66 NT23\nSo S \u2192 NT61 NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT55 NT66 NT23.\n\nNow, each of these NTs needs to be broken down further.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT55 \u2192 NT19 NT20\nNT66 \u2192 NT56 NT23\nNT23 \u2192 NT13 NT29\n\nWait, looking at NT23, I think I made a mistake.

So, in the grammar, NT87 is a non-terminal, but its expansion isn't given. That's a problem because that would mean we can't proceed further. Wait, but that can't be right. Did I miss any rules?\n\nWait, perhaps in the original grammar, NT87 has an expansion.

So, there's a problem here. If NT87 can't be expanded because it doesn't have a rule, then the derivation can't proceed beyond NT87.

I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string I need to check if it's generated by the grammar. The string is: `t74 t9 t80 t42 t9 t5 t67 t82 t64 t95 t25 t72 t63 t48 t5 t67 t36 t96 t86 t49 t64 t0 t79 t63 t53 t53 t42 t64 t2 t9 t19 t48 t19 t46`. \n\nFirst, I should parse this string correctly. Wait, each token is separated by spaces, so I need to break it down into individual tokens. Let's list them out step by step to make sure:\n\n1. t74\n2. t9\n3. t80\n4. t42\n5. t9\n6. t5\n7. t67\n8. t82\n9. t64\n10. t95\n11. t25\n12. t72\n13. t63\n14. t48\n15. t5\n16. t67\n17. t36\n18. t96\n19. t86\n20. t49\n21. t64\n22. t0\n23. t79\n24. t63\n25. t53\n26. t53\n27. t42\n28. t64\n29. t2\n30. t9\n31. t19\n32. t48\n33. t19\n34. t46\n\nOkay, so there are 34 tokens in total. Now, looking at the grammar, most of the non-terminals eventually produce a 't' followed by a number, which represents terminal symbols. The start symbol is S, which is derived as follows: S -> NT61 NT59, so the string must start with the derivation of NT61 and NT59.\n\nWait, the initial symbols S produce NT61 and NT59. Let me see what NT61 and NT59 produce. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\nNT59 -> NT46 NT5\n\nBut NT33 is another non-terminal. So NT61 breaks down into NT33 and NT55. NT55 is further broken down: looking at NT55, I see it can produce 't5' or NT65. Okay, so NT55 could be 't5' or go further. Let me track this.\n\nBut before diving deep, perhaps it's better to check if each token in the string corresponds to the possible terminals produced by the non-terminals in the grammar. If at any point a token can't be matched by any production, then the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nLet's check the first few tokens:\n\n1. t74: From the productions, NT68 -> t83, NT5 -> t5, but looking for t74. Wait, looking through the productions, I see that NT65 -> NT6 NT60, but that's not a terminal. Wait, NT9 -> t18, but not t74. Looking through the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce 't' and a number. For example, NT9 -> t18, NT2 -> t64, NT31 -> t54, etc. Wait, do I have a rule that produces t74? Let me scan the grammar.\n\nLooking through the production list, I see:\n\n- NT68 -> 't83'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT5 -> 't58'\nWait, there's a production where NT55 -> 't5' (looking at the grammar, yes, line 49: NT55 -> t5). Hmm, so NT55 can be t5. But looking for t74, let's check other non-terminals. For example, NT2 -> t64, NT31 -> t54, NT79 -> t80 (line 15: NT79 -> t80). Wait, line 1 is S -> NT61 NT59.\n\nWait, looking for 't74'. Is there any non-terminal that produces 't74'?\n\nLooking through the productions, I find NT6 (line 470: NT6 -> t74? Let me scan. Oh yes, looking at line 470, it says \"NT6 -> t74\". Yes, so NT6 can produce t74. \n\nSo, the first token is t74, which comes from NT6. Now, what's NT6 derived from? Let me look at NT6's production. Checking the grammar, I don't see NT6 in the production list. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the production list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT67 -> NT33 NT28 (line 19), but not NT6. Wait, maybe NT6 is a terminal. But no, the grammar starts with S and non-terminals, so I might have to check if any non-terminal produces 't74'. Wait, NT6 is a non-terminal with production NT6 -> t74. So NT6 can produce t74.\n\nBut since S starts with NT61 and NT59, let me see how these can be derived. \n\nNT61: From line 1, NT61 -> NT33 NT55. Then NT33, from line 13: NT33 -> NT32 NT72. NT32 from line 14: NT32 -> NT18 NT65. NT18: line 14000? Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, let me re-express the grammar properly. The grammar is given in a line-by-line format. Let me parse the grammar correctly. I think I might have made a mistake earlier by not reconstructing the grammar properly.\n\nLet me list all the productions systematically:\n\nProduction Rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\nNT47 \u2192 NT58 NT95\nNT79 \u2192 NT36 NT52\nNT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\nNT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7\nNT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96\nNT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\nNT83 \u2192 NT24 NT46\nNT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29\nNT36 \u2192 NT6 NT78\nNT93 \u2192 NT62 NT83\nNT15 \u2192 NT15 NT77\nNT73 \u2192 NT26 NT24\nNT68 \u2192 NT93 NT88\nNT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\nNT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\nNT70 \u2192 NT52 NT81\nNT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23\nNT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\nNT31 \u2192 NT26 NT29\nNT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\nNT78 \u2192 NT56 NT5\nNT20 \u2192 NT73 NT73\nNT7 \u2192 NT19 NT23\nNT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\nNT77 \u2192 NT55 NT61\nNT20 \u2192 NT52 NT70\nNT15 \u2192 NT71 NT47\nNT5 -> NT61 NT84\nNT46 -> NT96 NT33\nNT84 -> NT57 NT20\nNT67 \u2192 NT31 NT28\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67\nNT86 -> NT19 NT55\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nNT17 \u2192 NT9 NT59\nNT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17\nNT83 \u2192 NT66 NT8\nNT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60\nNT7 \u2192 NT83 NT93\nNT5 -> NT58 NT86\nNT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22\nNT68 -> 't83'\nNT60 -> 't94'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT47 -> 't73'\nNT88 -> 't42'\nNT18 -> 't66'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT56 -> 't51'\nNT93 -> 't72'\nNT56 -> 't51'\nNT88 -> 't72'\nNT73 -> 't53'\nNT87 \u2192 't48'\nNT68 -> 't83'\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-663","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string \"t74 t51 t53 t61 t80 t67 t64 t42...\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Honestly, this seems a bit intimidating because the grammar is quite large, and the string is quite long. But I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can be parsed using methods like the CYK algorithm or by trying to build parse trees. Since this grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most of the rules are of the form NT... \u2192 NT... NT..., and there are some terminals like 't83', 't2', etc. So, the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nNow, the string provided consists of a series of tokens starting with 't74', 't51', and so on. These look like the terminal symbols in the grammar. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so the initial step is to split the string into parts that correspond to NT61 and NT59. Let me count the tokens: the string is \"t74 t51 t36 t67 t80 t64 t42 t87 t63 t64 t39 t79 t12 t2 t67 t66 t50 t74 t16 t42 t30 t63 t42 t39 t53 t42 t42 t9 t5 t2 t9 t5 t48 t5 t35\". Wait, actually, the string provided by the user seems to have some inconsistencies in parentheses. It starts with \"t74 t51 t36 t67 t80 t64 t42 t87 t63 t64 t39 t79 t12 t2 t67 t66 t50 t74 t16 t42 t30 t63 t42 t39 t53 t42 t42 t9 t5 t2 t9 t5 t48 t5 t35\" but then it seems to switch to \"t74 t67 t80 t64...\" which might be a formatting error. Maybe the string has a typo or is cut off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided the string as: \"t74 t51 t36 t67 t80 t64 t42 t87 t63 t64 t39 t79 t12 t2 t67 t66 t50 t74 t16 t42 t30 t63 t42 t39 t53 t42 t42 t9 t5 t2 t9 t5 t48 t5 t35\". So it's a single string of tokens separated by spaces. Let me recount the number of tokens to check if it's correctly formed.\n\nEach 't' is a token followed by a number. Let me count them: from t74 to t35, that's each having at least one digit, but some have two numbers. So the total number of tokens isn't too important, but rather how they relate to the grammar.\n\nNow, since S \u2192 NT61 NT59, the start symbol is S. So the first step is to generate S, which would produce two non-terminals: NT61 and NT59. The string we're evaluating starts with t74, which is a terminal. So, I'm assuming t74 comes from one of these non-terminals, either NT61 or NT59. So, I need to check if NT61 or NT59 can derive a string that starts with t74.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then, NT33 has a rule NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, and so on. I'm not sure if this will ever produce a 't' token, or perhaps it's the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should try to trace the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is to see if the entire string can be parsed according to the grammar. I can try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the productions.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's easier to work from the string backwards, using the reverse grammar. But since the grammar is in CNF, reverse engineering might be complex. Alternatively, I can look for any 't' tokens in the string and see if they can be matched at some step of the derivation.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t74. Let's see if any of the non-terminals can produce t74. Looking at the grammar, I see NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72. NT32 is also a rule: NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65. NT18 \u2192 NT5 and NT18 \u2192 t66. Wait, so NT32's rules are:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT65\n\nAnd NT32's other rules?\n\nWait, the grammar includes NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65 and another rule: NT32 \u2192 NT65. So, starting from NT32, if I choose to take the rule NT32 \u2192 NT65, does that lead anywhere? NT65 has a rule NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT47. Let's see, but none of those produce t74.\n\nAlternatively, if I go through NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65, then NT18 can produce either NT5 (but NT5 \u2192 t5) or t66. So, from NT18, if it produces t66, then NT65 must produce something that combines with it. But does NT65 produce t74? Let me check the grammar for NT65.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT65 has two rules: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT47 and NT65 \u2192 NT33. Wait, so NT65 can become either NT71 NT47 or NT33. How do they produce t74? Let me check NT71 and NT33.\n\nNT71's rules: NT71 \u2192 NT48 NT59. None of these seem to lead to t74. NT33's rules: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, so that's back to where we started.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the right path. Maybe I should check other non-terminals that can produce t74 directly. Wait, looking back, the grammar includes some terminals. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, whenever a production ends with '\u2192 't...', it's a terminal. So, I see NT67 \u2192 't53', for example. Let me list all the terminals:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t53\n- NT60 \u2192 t49\n- NT58 \u2192 t95\n- NT65 \u2192 t36\n- NT83 \u2192 t80\n- NT74 \u2192 t74\n- NT87 \u2192 t87\n- NT88 \u2192 t88\n- NT55 \u2192 t55\n- NT46 \u2192 t46\n- NT5 \u2192 t5\n- NT78 \u2192 t83\n- NT76 \u2192 t76 (Wait, isn't there a rule like that earlier?)\n- NT9 \u2192 t2\n- NT23 \u2192 t13\n- NT19 \u2192 t9\n- NT56 \u2192 t51\n- NT53 \u2192 t53\n- NT62 \u2192 t12\n- NT54 \u2192 t64\n- NT55 \u2192 t19\n- Wait, some of these are not correctly spelled, perhaps.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided should be in this form, which helps in parsing and understanding how strings can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with the start symbol S and follows the production rules. The string to evaluate is `t74 t87 t66 t96 t86 t30 t19 t60 t64 t41 t12 t95 t2 t63 t42 t2 t42 t39 t99 t99 t9 t5 t60 t64 t2 t86 t36 t50 t32 t49 t12 t41 t63 t48 t19 t46`.\n\nI notice that each token in the string appears to be a terminal symbol, not a non-terminal since there are no '->' or other non-terminal notations. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI should probably start by mapping the terminals in the string to the possible terminals in the grammar. Let's list out the terminals from the string:\n\nt74, t87, t66, t96, t86, t30, t19, t60, t64, t41, t12, t95, t2, t63, t42, t2, t42, t39, t99, t99, t9, t5, t60, t64, t2, t86, t36, t50, t32, t49, t12, t41, t63, t48, t19, t46.\n\nNow, I'll go through the grammar rules to see which terminals are present and if they can be part of the start symbol's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the non-terminals are all in uppercase like S, NT1, NT2, etc., and terminals are lowercase t with numbers or single letters? Wait, actually, the grammar has some uppercase terminals like T58, etc., but in the given string, all are lowercase 't' followed by numbers. Wait, the grammar shows some rules where the right-hand side has, for example, 't12', 't94', and others. So 't' followed by a number is a terminal.\n\nNow, the string consists of various 't' tokens. Let me go through each one and see if they have corresponding production rules in the grammar.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.\n\n1. t74: Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that produces 't74' on the right-hand side. So 't74' is not present in the RHS of any production. That would mean that 't74' can't be part of the generated string because no rule leads to it. So if the string starts with 't74', it's impossible. Therefore, the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Maybe I missed a rule. Let me scan all the productions again. Scanning through each line, I see rules like NT68 \u2192 't83', NT52 \u2192 't42', etc., but not 't74' anywhere. So 't74' isn't present, meaning the string cannot be derived.\n\nSince the string starts with 't74', which isn't a possible production, the string isn't part of the language generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string isn't generated, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-686","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar (CFG) can generate all kinds of strings based on the production rules provided. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The starting symbol is S, right?\n\nThe string I have to evaluate is: `t74 t12 t41 t95 t25 t72 t42 t64 t67 t74 t87 t36 t60 t64 t9 t13 t63 t42 t39 t42 t2 t42 t42 t0 t19 t48 t9 t5 t48 t64 t9 t13 t63 t2 t19 t46`.\n\nI'm guessing that each `t` followed by a number is a terminal symbol, like 't74' is a terminal. So the string is a sequence of these terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some symbols end with a terminal, like `NT5 -> 't5'`, which is a production that directly creates the terminal 't5'. Similarly, `NT68 -> 't83'` and others. These are the base cases in the grammar.\n\nThe approach I think is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the entire string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a methodical approach, perhaps similar to the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can try expanding S and see if all the terminals in the string can be matched.\n\nLet me look at the grammar again. The start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S -> NT61 NT59\n2. S -> NT29 NT9\n\nSo S can expand into either of these. Let's consider the first production: NT61 NT59.\n\nI'll try to see if NT61 and NT59 can derive parts of the string. But looking at the grammar rules for NT61 and NT59:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT61 -> NT33 NT55\n- NT59 -> NT66 NT23\n\nSo NT59 will expand into NT66 and NT23. Let's look at NT23. Checking the rules, I don't see a production for NT23 except towards the end. Wait, wait, looking back, there are multiple rules for NT23:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n- NT23 -> 't79'\n- NT23 -> 't22' (wait, no, looking at the list again... No, actually, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me scan:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under N symbols, I see:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nI see:\n\nLooking for NT23: Hmm, I don't immediately see a NT23 in the initial list. Wait, let me scan through:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list. Let me scan for 'NT23 -> ...'\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT28\n- NT22 -> NT2 NT67\n- NT23 -> 't79'\n- NT23 -> 't22'? Or is it another symbol? Wait, looking again, maybe it's NT23 -> 't79' and another rule? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLines:\n\n- NT85 -> NT64\n- NT26 -> NT29 NT29\n- NT73 -> NT26 NT24\n- NT68 -> NT93 NT88\n- NT14 -> NT2 NT65\n- NT93 -> NT62 NT83\n- NT56 -> NT93 NT51\n- NT95 -> NT94\n- NT46 -> NT96 NT33\n- NT98 -> NT35 NT42\n- NT55 -> NT5 NT48?\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing with NT55. Maybe it's better to approach differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree starting from S.\n\nSince S can branch into two options, I can explore both.\n\nBut given the string, it's more efficient to see if the string can be split into a sequence of NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the tree has S generating NT61 and NT59, which then each generate more non-terminals, until we get to the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, another idea: since all the grammar rules have two non-terminals except for the rules where a terminal appears (e.g., NT5 -> 't5'), maybe the derivation is such that each step splits into smaller parts until the terminals are reached.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string can be checked by seeing if the terminal symbols appear in the correct order according to the possible branches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a tree and see if the terminals in the string can be reached correctly.\n\nWait, but processing the string step by step might be time-consuming. Maybe I can use an iterative approach, processing the string and seeing if I can match each symbol.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production in the grammar is of the form A -> BC or B -> t, so starting from S, each expansion doubles the number of symbols, but in the reduction process, we can try to split the string into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nThis is getting a bit abstract, so perhaps it's better to attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's take the string:\n\nt74 t12 t41 t95 t25 t72 t42 t64 t67 t74 t87 t36 t60 t64 t9 t13 t63 t42 t39 t42 t2 t42 t42 t0 t19 t48 t9 t5 t48 t64 t9 t13 t63 t2 t19 t46\n\nCounting the number of terminals: There are 39 terms, so length 39.\n\nGiven that starting from S, which branches into two, each branch can produce multiple, the number of steps is probably exponential, but maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar has certain terminals that are produced by which non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, for example, NT23 seems to produce 't79' and perhaps another rule, but I'm not sure.

{"custom_id":"request-708","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of 't' followed by two-digit numbers, like `t74 t51 t66 ...` and so on. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in CNF looks like. CNF productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals. So every production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side or terminals, but in CNF, it's specifically two non-terminals. Wait, actually, I think in CNF, each production's right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals, but sometimes one can be a terminal. Let me check: CNF is when all productions are length 2, with left-hand side a single non-terminal and right-hand side two non-terminals. But sometimes, maybe terminals are allowed in the right-hand side, but in the given grammar, most productions have non-terminals on both sides, like S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So each production is of the form NT -> NT NT, except maybe some have a mix of NT and terminal?\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar given, I see both NT and t are present on the right-hand side. For example, some productions like NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT7, others have 't' as in 't12', 't94', etc. So perhaps this isn't a strict CNF because CNF requires that all productions have non-terminals on the right. So maybe this grammar isn't in CNF? Or perhaps it's in a form that allows terminals on the right, which might not strictly be CNF. That could complicate things because CNF requires the RHS to have exactly two non-terminals. But the problem states it's a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nAlternatively, the Chomsky Normal Form could allow for productions like A \u2192 aB or A \u2192 Ba where a is a single terminal, but no, in standard CNF, all productions have the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a single terminal. Wait, I think in CNF, productions can be of two forms: A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So perhaps the grammar allows for some productions to have terminals on the RHS, which would mean the string can contain 't' characters.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some NT productions have t prefixes or suffixes. For example, NT60 \u2192 't94' and NT2 \u2192 't64', etc. So that means that after certain NT expansions, we get t followed by numbers. So the string given includes 't74', etc., which suggests that the terminals are part of the string generated by these expansions.\n\nNow, the given string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. So the first step is to see if these 't'...s appear in the productions of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't72' etc. So, some non-terminals (like NT93, NT66, etc.) directly produce these terminal strings. Others, like NT61 \u2192 NT36 NT55, are non-terminals that produce other non-terminals. So to handle the given string, which is a series of 't'...s, I need to see if each terminal part can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, the entire string is all tX patterns, so it's composed of terminals. That suggests that every symbol in the string is ultimately a terminal, which is possible if the grammar can generate sequences of terminals from the root S.\n\nSo, I'll approach this by trying to parse the given string into the productions of the grammar. Starting with the string:\n\nt74 t51 t66 t32 t49 t5 t18 t35 t95 t25 t12 t41 t63 t99 t99 t94 t99 t64 t86 t74 t72 t0 t3 t99 t64 t42 t48 t0 t5 t63 t64 t0 t13 t63 t2 t19 t35\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, each symbol is written as 't' followed by two digits, so each token is like 't74', 't51', etc. So the string is a series of these two-character terminals. So, each token is a terminal, meaning that each 'tX' must be directly produced by some NT production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many terminals are already defined. For example, NT93 \u2192 't72', so when NT93 is expanded, it becomes 't72'. Similarly, NT60 \u2192 't94', etc. The goal is to see if the given string can be generated by expanding the start symbol S through these productions.\n\nBut since each part of the string is a 'tX', I need to see if each of these can be matched to a terminal production. So each 'tX' must correspond to a NT production that directly outputs 'tX'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can make a list of NT productions that produce tX terms. Let's go through each:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't72'\nNT66 \u2192 't95'\nNT60 \u2192 't94'\nNT95 \u2192 't94'\nNT67 \u2192 't32'\nNT65 \u2192 't36'\nNT62 \u2192 't12'\nNT18 \u2192 't66'\nNT68 \u2192 't83'\nNT14 \u2192 't2'\nNT19 \u2192 't0'\nNT54 \u2192 't64'\nNT56 \u2192 't51'\nNT55 \u2192 't19'\nNT93 \u2192 't72' (but already listed)\nNT60 \u2192 't94' (already)\nNT88 \u2192 't72'\nNT23 \u2192 't79' (not a terminal)\nWait, perhaps I need to list all NT productions that produce a terminal:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't72'\nNT66 \u2192 't95'\nNT60 \u2192 't94'\nNT95 \u2192 't94'\nNT67 \u2192 't32'\nNT65 \u2192 't36'\nNT62 \u2192 't12'\nNT18 \u2192 't66'\nNT68 \u2192 't83'\nNT14 \u2192 't2'\nNT19 \u2192 't0'\nNT54 \u2192 't64'\nNT56 \u2192 't51'\nNT55 \u2192 't19'\nNT88 \u2192 't72'\nOther NTs have more complex RHS or produce more t terms.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, each 'tX' in the string must correspond to a production where the non-terminal on the left can produce exactly 'tX'.\n\nBut some of the terminals in the string might not have a direct production. For example, looking at the string: t74, t51, t66, etc. Let's check if each of these is among the tX terms that have direct productions.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't51'\nYes, because NT56 produces 't51'.\n\nNT51 is not present as a terminal in our list. Wait, the given string has t51 as a token. But in the grammar, NT56 \u2192 't51'. So where does NT56 come from?\n\nThe string starts with t74, t51, etc. So, how can NT56 produce 't51'? Wait, no, actually, it's NT56 \u2192 't51' in the grammar.\n\nSo, to generate 't51', we have to get NT56 \u2192 't51' via a production. But how can we get NT56? Because NT56 is a non-terminal, we have to derive it from other non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, some NTs can produce NT56, but looking through the productions, I don't see any production that has NT56 \u2192 something. Let me scan.\n\nLooking at all the productions:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't72'\nNT66 \u2192 't95'\nNT60 \u2192 't94'\nNT95 \u2192 't94'\nNT67 \u2192 't32'\nNT65 \u2192 't36'\nNT62 \u2192 't12'\nNT18 \u2192 't66'\nNT68 \u2192 't83'\nNT14 \u2192 't2'\nNT19 \u2192 't0'\nNT54 \u2192 't64'\nNT56 \u2192 't51'\nNT55 \u2192 't19'\nNT88 \u2192 't72'\nOthers may produce more t sequences.\n\nSo, the string starts with t74. Looking at the grammar, is there any NT that produces 't74'?\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't74'.

{"custom_id":"request-725","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, which I assume are terminals or non-terminals depending on the grammar. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol of the grammar, which seems to be S based on the given productions.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. All productions are in CNF, meaning each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and ensures that each production step increases the string length by one, starting from the start symbol.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t12 t39 t67 t74 t12 t2 t86 t66 t96 t86 t49 t2 t79 t12 t2 t86 t36 t96 t86 t49 t42 t64 t48 t9 t5 t48 t9 t79 t99 t99 t9 t19 t42 t62 t63 t19 t35`.\n\nI notice that each token is either a number (like t74, t12, etc.) or possibly a non-terminal symbol. But in the grammar, the non-terminals are denoted by NT followed by numbers, like NT15, NT29, etc., until the actual terminals, which are the t followed by numbers, except the last 't9' which seems like it might be a terminal as well.\n\nLooking at the production rules, many of them start with NT and then produce two NTs or a terminal. For example, S -> NT61 NT59. The terminals in the grammar are t followed by numbers, and the non-terminals are NT followed by numbers. The rest of the productions, like S->NT61 NT59, are the initial steps.\n\nSo, the first step is to analyze the given string and see if it can be broken down into a series of productions from the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking for the longest possible matches in the string, working from the outside in. Alternatively, I can check each terminal to see if it's a leaf in the grammar. If all terminals in the string can be derived through some sequence of productions, then the string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So each token like t74, t12, etc., is a terminal. The 'S' is the start symbol, but it's not in the string, so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, all the productions involve NTs and terminals. The start symbol S is on the left side, but in the given string, I'm just given terminals, so S must be able to derive this string in one or more steps.\n\nBut S is the start symbol, and all the productions start with S->NTNT, so to derive a string from S, I need to expand S into NTs, and those NTs into more NTs or terminals, until I get all terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is all terminals, I need to see if S can derive it through a series of steps.\n\nNow, let me look at the productions and see which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I can see that some NTs produce a single terminal. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT68 -> t83\n- NT60 -> t49\n- NT67 -> t53 (Wait, but 53 isn't a 't' with a number; maybe I misread. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking again, the productions:\n\nNT67 -> t53? Or is that correct? Actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT68 -> t83, NT60 -> t49, NT5 -> t83, and NT46 -> t79, etc. So each NT can sometimes expand directly to a terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT2 -> t64. So in the string, t64 is present.\n\nSo, to break down the string step by step, perhaps I can start from the start symbol S and see how it can produce the string.\n\nBut manually expanding this would take a lot of steps, so I need a better approach. Maybe I can backtrack or see if each 't' in the string can be matched by a terminal production from some NT.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt74, t12, t39, t67, t74, t12, t2, t86, t66, t96, t86, t49, t2, t79, t12, t2, t86, t36, t96, t86, t49, t42, t64, t48, t9, t5, t48, t9, t79, t99, t99, t9, t19, t42, t62, t63, t19, t35.\n\nWait, not all of these are present as direct productions. For example, t67 might be produced by NT67 via production NT67 -> t72 but that doesn't match. Wait, no: looking back, the productions for NT67 are:\n\nNT67 -> NT57 NT14\nNT67 -> t83 NT93\n\nWait, I'm seeing:\nLooking through the productions, I see NT67 is in several places. For example, line 16: NT67 -> t83 NT93. But that would mean NT67 expands to a terminal and another NT. Or in line 17: NT67 -> NT57 NT14.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 -> t77 etc.\n\nSo each NT can expand into two NTs or a terminal and an NT, or two NTs, or a terminal and NT.\n\nWait, no, Chomsky Normal Form productions are of the form A->BC or A->a, where BC are two non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, yes, all productions are either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string is built by replacing non-terminals with terminals, ensuring each production step builds the string from the root S to the leaves, which are all terminals.\n\nGiven that, the strategy would be to see if each terminal in the string can be traced back via these productions, possibly through multiple steps.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string according to the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the grammar is suitable for a recursive descent parser, which can parse the string step by step, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nBut since I don't have a parser, I can try to work through the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking for the longest possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be built by expanding S into NT61 NT59, then each of those into further productions, and so on.\n\nBut to see that, perhaps it's better to see each 't' in the string corresponds to an expansion path.\n\nBut the string is quite long, 42 tokens. Maybe I can look for the start symbol and see if the string can be covered by the expansion rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be built by a series of expansions starting from S.\n\nBut this process would take many steps, so perhaps a better approach is to look for any 't' that might not have a corresponding production.\n\nFor example, looking through the productions, I see that some NTs can only produce terminals. So if a 't' in the string is not present in any production, it's impossible.\n\nLet me list all the 't' terms in the string and see if each is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe 't' terms in the string are:\n\nt74, t12, t39, t67, t74, t12, t2, t86, t66, t96, t86, t49, t2, t79, t12, t2, t86, t36, t96, t86, t49, t42, t64, t48, t9, t5, t48, t9, t79, t99, t99, t9, t19, t42, t62, t63, t19, t35.\n\nNow I check each 't' to see if it's a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see lines where NT -> t... For example:\n\n- NT2 -> t64\n- NT60 -> t49\n- NT67 -> t53 (Is that correct? Wait, in the provided productions, line for NT67 was: NT67 -> t83 NT93, and another line NT27 -> t77.

{"custom_id":"request-723","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Also, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to make sure I understand it. The start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. That means any string generated by S will consist of two NTs, specifically NT61 and NT59 in that order.\n\nNow, looking at the other productions, I see a bunch of NT (non-terminals) that split into other NTs or terminals (t12, t94, t5, etc.). Some NTs have two options on each side, like NT61 can be NT33 NT55 or NT66 NT23. Similarly, NT29 can be NT14 NT86 or NT62 NT83. I need to see how these NTs resolve until I hit the terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t74 t9 t66 t96 t86 t49 t5 t96 t96 t67 t80 t99 t0 t5 t42 t87 t63 t64 t35 t46 t9 t3 t63 t42 t39 t53 t99 t42 t9 t19 t18 t46 t41 t72 t63 t48 t5 t46.\n\nFirst, I'll check if the string length is compatible. Since S \u2192 NT61 NT59, any string from S must start with NT61 and then have NT59. So the string should start with the production of NT61 and then NT59. Let me look at the first elements.\n\nThe first token is t74. Let's see what NTs can produce t74. Looking through the grammar, I see NT66 \u2192 t95, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I should go the other way: look for which NT can produce t74. Hmm, looking through the right-hand sides, I don't see any rule that directly produces t74. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules... No, I don't see any NT that produces t74 directly. That might be a problem. If the first token is t74, and none of the NTs produce t74, then perhaps the string is invalid. But wait, maybe t74 is a terminal and no rule produces it, so the grammar can't generate it. Let me check all the terminal tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are things like t12, t94, t5, etc. I see t74 in the string but no rule that directly produces t74. So maybe the string is invalid from the get-go. So I can conclude 'No', but I need to double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should map the entire string through the grammar's productions to see if it can derive the string, maybe not starting directly with S but through some other path. Wait, no, S is only S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so the first part of any string derived from S has to start with NT61.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is t74, which isn't directly produced by any NT. Even if it's a terminal, since no NT \u2192 t74 exists, the production is impossible. So the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-750","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule either produces two terminals or two non-terminals. CNF is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm just trying to determine if the string is generated, maybe a top-down approach like the recursive descent method would work, but I might need to consider the structure.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which suggests that these are terminals. The non-terminals in the grammar are represented by 'NT' followed by numbers, like NT47, NT65, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and two symbols on the right. Some of these right-hand sides result in terminal symbols, while others continue to build up the structure.\n\nI notice that there are several production rules that directly result in the terminal 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT67 -> 't53', NT68 -> 't83', and so on. These are leaf nodes in the grammar's parse tree.\n\nThe string provided is quite long: 40 symbols, all of which are in the form of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' represents a terminal symbol derived from a production rule, either directly or through intermediate steps.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if I can parse the entire string by expanding the non-terminals according to the production rules.\n\nLet me start by listing all the terminal symbols in the string:\nt74, t87, t36, t32, t30, t19, t96, t67, t74, t87, t83, t42, t99, t9, t19, t42, t62, t63, t64, t46, t9, t13, t63, t37, t42, t99, t0, t19, t79, t64, t95, t2, t12, t2, t79, t63, t2, t5, t46.\n\nI can immediately notice that the grammar has a rule for NT67 that produces 't53'. However, the string has multiple 't74' and 't87'. Let me check what the grammar's production rules for NT74 and NT87 are.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- I don't see a production rule for NT74. Maybe it's a terminal? Or maybe it's derived from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's check if NT74 has a production rule. Scanning through the rules, I don't see NT74 defined. It must be a terminal, meaning that 't74' is a terminal symbol. Similarly, I don't see a production for NT87, so 't87' is also a terminal.\n\nNow, in the grammar, I see several production rules that produce 't' followed by numbers, like 't74' from NT67, 't87' from NT67, 't36' from NT36, etc. So it's possible for the string to consist of these terminals.\n\nBut I need to verify if these production rules can be chained together to form the entire string without any leftover symbols or non-terminals at the end.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts and see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting from the end of the string might help. The last part of the string is ...t46. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT5 -> 't58', and there's a production NT58 -> 't66', which seems similar. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the initial symbols: t74 t87 t36 t32 t30 t19 t96 t67 t74 t87 t83 t42 t99 t9 t19 t42 t62 t63 t64 t46.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t74 and t87. Since these are terminals, they must be directly derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Let's see which of these can lead to the starting sequence.\n\nFirst, if S is expanded into NT61 and NT59:\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55 (from the grammar)\nNT33 -> NT32 NT72 (from the grammar)\nNT32 -> NT18 NT65 (grammar)\nNT18 -> NT66 NT2 (grammar)\nNT66 -> NT5 (grammar)\nWait, let me trace this down:\n\nWait, S -> NT61 NT59.\n\nNT61 -> NT33 NT55\nNT33 -> NT32 NT72\nNT32 -> NT18 NT65\nNT18 -> NT66 NT2\nNT66 -> NT5\nSo NT61 NT59 would eventually produce NT5, which is a terminal -> 't5'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't74 t87', so maybe this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, S could produce NT61 NT59 and then expand further.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to approach this by seeing if each terminal in the string can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, let's take each 't' symbol and see if it can be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nFor example, 't74' must come from some non-terminal. Looking up the grammar, NT67 -> 't53' isn't t74. Wait, is there any non-terminal that produces 't74'? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the only rules that produce terminals are ones where the right-hand side is like 't53' or others. It seems that no non-terminal directly produces 't74' unless it's part of a production like NT67 -> 't53', but that's not 't74'.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. If the string has 't74', but in the grammar, the only non-terminal that produces 't's is NT67 -> 't53', which is 't53', not 't74'. So 't74' would not be generated by the grammar unless there's a production rule that I'm missing. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't74'. For example, looking at NT67 -> 't53' and NT68 -> 't83', etc., but no 't74'.\n\nWait, that means that 't74' can't be generated by this grammar, because there's no production rule that creates 't74' directly. Even if a non-terminal produces another non-terminal that eventually becomes 't74', looking at the grammar, all the productions either lead to other terminals or non-terminals, but none specifically for 't74'.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't74', that's a problem because the grammar can't produce that symbol. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me make sure. I'll go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT67: It goes to 't53', which is different from 't74'.\nNT71: It goes to 't50', which is different.\nNT72: It goes to 't49'.\nNT73: 't53'.\nNT75: 't81' and so on.\n\nWait, no. Looking at NT67's production: NT67 -> 't72' (from where?), wait no. Let me check the grammar rules again. Wait, I think I might have misread earlier.\n\nLooking back: \"NT78 -> 't56'\", etc. Wait, no, in the given grammar, there are a lot of rules for NT83, NT68, etc., but I specifically see NT67 -> 't72' (is that correct? Let me check the given grammar.)\n\nLooking back: \n\nThe grammar rules provided include lines like:\nNT67 -> NT57 NT14,\nNT67 -> NT29 NT87,\nNT68 -> NT93 NT88,\nand so on. Also, some non-terminals result in terminals:\nNT67 -> 't53' (from earlier rules?), but wait, when I look again, I don't see NT67 producing 't74' or 't72' in the provided rules.\n\nWait, let me double-check the exact grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, under NT67 there are rules:\nNT67 -> NT57 NT14\nNT67 -> NT29 NT87\n\nAnd elsewhere, I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-744","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. All non-terminals are on the left-hand side (LHS), and each production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that it's quite extensive, with several production rules. Each rule seems to be defined with either two non-terminals or two terminals on the RHS, which makes it fit the CNF structure. For example, rule S \u2192 NT61 NT59 is an initial production, and many other non-terminals are defined similarly.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t74 t38 t82 t5 t67 t82 t64 t0 t79 t63 t42 t42 t94 t42 t99 t0 t5 t96 t86 t74 t72 t95 t2 t12 t95 t2 t42 t64 t42 t62 t63 t64 t46 t0 t3 t63 t2 t5 t46`. My task is to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should start by looking at the start symbol of the grammar, which is 'S'. From the initial rules, S can produce two non-terminals multiplied together, like S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So, every string generated by S must start with a combination of non-terminals that eventually resolve to a terminal string.\n\nI'll begin by trying to parse the given string step by step, breaking it down into parts that match the grammar rules. Since the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, it's likely made up of terminal tokens.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't74'. Looking at the grammar, there are several rules that end with a 't' (terminal). For example, NT68 \u2192 't74', NT60 \u2192 't49', NT5 \u2192 't5', and so on. So, 't74' must come from one of these.\n\nLooking up NT68's production, I see NT68 \u2192 't74'. So, the first token 't74' is the result of NT68. That means the parsing must start with NT68.\n\nWait, but according to the initial rules, S can only directly produce combinations of NTs, not terminals. So, how does the first token come as 't74'? That suggests that before NT68 can resolve, there must be a series of productions that ultimately derive it. Maybe S generates some non-terminals that, through expansion, result in 't74' as the first symbol.\n\nBut S initially produces two non-terminals. So, the string would start with a series of two non-terminals, each of which can lead to more non-terminals, until the first terminal is hit. So, perhaps the first part is S \u2192 NT68 NTsomething, but looking at the rules, S only directly produces NT pairs like NT61 NT59 or others. Wait, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT61 NT59, S \u2192 NT29 NT9, etc. So, S expands directly into two non-terminals. That means the first token in the string comes from NT68, which would be the first terminal after expanding the first non-terminal from S's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think: if S \u2192 NT68 NTsomething, then the string starts with NT68 followed by NTsomething. But in the given grammar, for S, all immediate productions are two NTs. So, for example, S can go to NT61 NT59, which then each of those NTs have their own productions. For instance, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, and each of those can be further expanded until you get to a terminal.\n\nSo, the first token in the string is 't74', which is a terminal, so it must come from a production of the form NT \u2192 'tX'. Looking at the grammar, the rule NT68 \u2192 't74' exists. So, somewhere in the derivation, an NT68 must be part of the production chain that forms the first token.\n\nBut since S is the start symbol and only directly produces two NTs, the first token is the first terminal derived from the first NT. Therefore, to get 't74' as the first symbol, the first NT after expanding S must be NT68, because only NT68 produces a terminal that starts with 't74'.\n\nWait, no, NT68 is a non-terminal, and it's only when it's expanded that it becomes a terminal. So, perhaps in the initial expansion, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, but in reality, NT61 might not produce 't74', so maybe another production of S is taken.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for which initial production of S could lead to 't74' being the first symbol. Alternatively, maybe the first two non-terminals each produce terminals in sequence. Let me see: the initial S can produce two NTs, each of which can produce a terminal, but that would require the first NT to produce a terminal that is the first symbol.\n\nWait, let's clarify: If S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then the string would start with the expansion of NT61, then the expansion of NT59. So, if NT61 \u2192 't74' or something else, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT61 directly producing a terminal. Let's check NT61's productions. The rule is NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So, NT61 can't produce 't74' directly; it has to expand into two non-terminals. Similarly, for the other initial S productions.\n\nWait, S also has a production S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Let's check NT29's rules. NT29's rule is NT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86. So, NT29 doesn't produce a terminal either.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can go through each NT rule to see if any produce a terminal as their first token. For example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59 (no terminal)\n- NT68 \u2192 't74' (yes)\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (yes)\n- NT58 \u2192 't95'\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT67 \u2192 't53' and 't29'\n- NT62 \u2192 't12'\n- etc.\n\nSo, several Nts do produce terminals. For example, NT58 goes to 't95', NT5 to 't5', NT29 to 't62', etc. So, depending on the derivation, the string could start with any of these.\n\nThe given string starts with 't74', which is produced by NT68. So, to get 't74' as the first symbol, the first NT in the string must be NT68. That means, during the parse, the production S must have a chain that eventually starts with NT68, perhaps after multiple expansions.\n\nBut S can only directly produce two NTs. So, how does the first terminal come about? Let's think step by step.\n\nSuppose S expands to NT68 NTsomething. Then, NT68 is replaced by 't74' to form the start of the string, and the something else becomes the next part. Let's see if any of the rules of S have NT68 as the first part. Looking through S's productions, none of the first rules start with NT68. So, S directly produces NT pairs, none of which start with NT68. So, to have NT68 as the first symbol, the initial expansion must involve NT68 as the first in the chain.\n\nBut since S's initial productions don't start with NT68, perhaps the expansion through a series of productions could lead to that.\n\nWait, perhaps NT68 is only reachable through some expansion chain. Let's see, looking at the rules, for example, NT68's parent non-terminal must be somewhere in the grammar. Let's see, from the given rules, which NT can expand into NT68. Looking through the RHS, I don't see any rule where NT68 is on the RHS except when it's a rule that starts directly with a terminal. So, perhaps NT68 can't be produced directly by any production; all its productions are to terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, because NT68's own rule is NT68 \u2192 't74', so that's the only way to produce a terminal from NT68. But to have NT68 being the LHS of a production, it can be derived from other"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's a set of productions where each non-terminal on the left expands into two non-terminals on the right. Some symbols like `t` and numbers are terminals. So the string we're checking consists of a series of these terminals.\n\nI notice that the grammar starts with `S` and expands into combinations of `NT` symbols, which then further expand until we reach terminals. So, the process involves starting from S and applying the rules repeatedly until only terminals are left, which should form our string.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to reverse-engineer the string by checking if it can be derived from the grammar. Alternatively, I can look for the possible paths the string could have taken through the grammar, ensuring that each production step is valid.\n\nLet me look at the first symbol in the string: `t74`. I need to see which productions in the grammar can lead to `t74`. Scanning through the productions, I see that `NT67` can produce `t74` because in the rules, `NT67` has a production `NT67 -> NT17 NT27` among others, and elsewhere, checking `NT67` has a production `NT67 -> NT55 NT61` and others. Wait, actually, looking through the provided productions, I see that NT67 has several productions, but none of them directly produce t74. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me check the productions more carefully. Looking through the list, under NT67: one of the productions is `NT67 -> t74`. Yes, line 14: `NT67 -> t74 NT?` Wait, no. Let me scan:\n\nLooking at the productions, under NT88, there's `NT88 -> t72`, but not NT67.

Maybe I can build a tree or try to see how the string breaks down step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering the first token `t74`.

Looking for lines where NT's production ends with 't'.\n\nLooking at NT67: I see in line 14: `NT67 -> t74` or something? Wait, line 14: `NT67 -> t74 NT?` Wait no, let me check again. \n\nLooking through the list, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's look for any NTs where an entire production is a single 't' token. For example:\n\n- NT68\u2192t83 (line 71): So, any production where NT68 is derived.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check for each token in the string and see if it can be derived from any NT's production.\n\nStarting with `t74`. Let's check which NT can produce `t74`.\n\nLooking through the productions, does any NT's production include `t74`?\n\nLooking at NT67: production 14 is written as `NT67 -> t74 NT2`, but let me double-check.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a. The string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so it's a series of symbols that might correspond to terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to identify which parts correspond to terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number) and which are non-terminal symbols. The non-terminals are the symbols on the left side of the rules, like S, NT15, NT29, etc. The right-hand sides (RHS) of the rules either consist of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nMy goal is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. If I can successfully derive the string by expanding the grammar's start symbol S, then the string is generated.\n\nLet's break down the string: `t87 t96 t86 t74 t9 t74 t12 t95 t25 t41 t72 t42 t42 t9 t19 t18 t46 t0 t79 t63 t48 t5 t60 t64 t9 t79 t63 t53 t42 t2 t99 t99 t9 t5 t42 t2 t9 t19 t63 t64`.\n\nI notice that 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal symbol. I'll check if each of these terminals can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- 't87' is derived from NT73 when NT73 -> 't87' because in the production, NT73 is replaced by 't87' (as per the rule NT73 -> 't53' but wait, in the given grammar, I see NT73 -> 't53' or another rule? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, there's a rule for NT73: `NT73 -> 't53'`. So 't53' is from NT73.\n\nWait, but in the string, I have 't87', which must be derived from a terminal rule. Let me check which NT leads to 't87'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT78 -> 't46'\n- NT55 -> 't38'\n- NT77 -> 't55' or other rules?\nWait, no. Let me check each production where the RHS is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nI see that several NT's have productions that produce a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nFor example:\n- NT29 -> 't87' (check)\n- NT48 -> 't97'\n- NT59 -> 't35'\n- NT66 -> 't95'\n- NT81 -> 't94'\n- NT95 -> 't94'\n- NT55 -> 't19'\n- NT70 -> 't81'\n- NT57 -> 't79'\n- NT46 -> 't60'\n- NT88 -> 't76' and 't28'\n- NT61 -> 't36' and others.\n\nSo 't87' is derived from NT29. So the first symbol in the string, 't87', must come from NT29.\n\nNow, for the second symbol, 't96'. Let's see which NT leads to 't96'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nI see NT96 -> 't96'. So 't96' is from NT96.\n\nBut where does NT96 come from? Looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT96? Let me check the provided rules. Yes, see the last line: `NT96 -> 't96'`. So NT96 is a non-terminal that produces 't96' directly. So that's a terminal in the string.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, are non-terminals allowed to produce a single terminal? Yes, because CNF allows A -> a where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, the second symbol, 't96', comes from NT96.\n\nNow, putting it together, the first two symbols in the string are 't87 t96', which would require that NT87 and NT96. Wait, but NT87 isn't a non-terminal. Wait, earlier, I identified that NT29 -> 't87' (since the production is NT29 -> 't87'), so the 't87' in the string must be from NT29.\n\nBut how do we get 't96' in the string? It must come from a production NT96 -> 't96'.\n\nWait, but to derive the string, we have to start from S and expand with the grammar. The first symbol is 't87', so the initial expansion must be a rule that produces 't87' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at S: S \u2192 NT61 NT59 or S \u2192 NT29 NT9.\n\nSo if the first symbol is 't87', which is from NT29, then perhaps the S production that starts with NT29.\n\nWait, looking at the S productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n2. S \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo in the second rule, S produces NT29 followed by NT9. Now, if the first symbol is 't87' (from NT29), we need to see what NT9 produces. But looking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the right must be a symbol, so NT29 must be 't87', but wait, NT29 can't be further expanded. So, in this case, if S uses the S \u2192 NT29 NT9, then the NT29 would produce 't87' and NT9 would produce something else.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't87', which is from NT29, so perhaps S is replaced by NT29 NT9, producing 't87' (from NT29) followed by NT9.\n\nBut wait, NT9: looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT9?

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string to evaluate. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S, which can produce terminal symbols or other non-terminals. The given string is composed of a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers, like 't74', 't38', etc. So, I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the rules produce terminal strings (those ending with 't' followed by a number or just a number). For example, S -> NT61 NT59, which breaks down into two rules. Each NT is a non-terminal, so I'll need to expand these to see if they eventually produce the 't' strings in the input.\n\nLet me list out the input string for clarity:\nt74 t38 t95 t3 t0 t19 t99 t42 t0 t19 t86 t74 t12 t2 t86 t82 t2 t79 t12 t2 t79 t99 t99 t0 t5 t18 t46 t0 t13 t63 t48 t64 t95 t2 t12 t95 t2 t63 t2 t19 t35.\n\nThat's a lot of terms. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S can produce NT61 NT59. So, S \u2192 NT61 NT59. Now, let's see what NT61 and NT59 produce.\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. So, I need to expand NT33 and NT55.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72. Now expand these.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65, and NT72 \u2192 NT49.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT53, which ends with 't53'. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT53's production isn't listed. Wait, I'm looking at the grammar rules, and I don't see NT53 being defined. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to look more carefully. Let me look through the rules again. Wait, I see NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23, and others. Let me make a list of terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see some rules produce 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n- NT18 \u2192 't66'\n- NT20 \u2192 't37' or 't64' when NT60 is involved.\nBut wait, not all 't' rules are immediate. For example, NT14 \u2192 't2', NT2 \u2192 't64', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to see if the entire string can be derived by expanding the S symbol step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be matched by a terminal production.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to reconstruct the entire string by expanding non-terminals to terminals, ensuring that the string can be fully derived.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string must correspond to a sequence where each non-terminal in the expansion eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, but the given string has a sequence of 't's and numbers. For example, t74 t38 t95 t3 t0... Let's try to see how each 't' is produced.\n\nFor example, let's look at the first part: t74.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there a rule that produces 't74' directly? Let me check the rules. Wait, NT95 \u2192 't94', so 't95' would be via a rule leading to NT95, but I don't see a 't74' directly. Wait:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 't83', NT52 \u2192 't42', NT27 \u2192 't7 NT28', which is a non-terminal. Hmm, not immediately seeing 't74'.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT65 has multiple productions. For example, NT65 \u2192 NT67 NT65, but also NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT47, etc. But looking for any production that directly produces 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal strings.

{"custom_id":"request-804","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check whether it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, this looks a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I wonder if I need to use that here. Maybe not, since I just need to determine if the given string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see it's quite extensive. There are a lot of non-terminals and terminals intermingled. Some of the productions end with the strings 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. Others have two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, consistent with CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t12 t2 t67 t74 t12 t2 t60 t39 t60 t12 t2 t86 t36 t96 t67 t49 t42 t99 t9 t19 t79 t64 t0 t13 t63 t48 t95 t25 t12 t95 t25 t42 t64 t60 t64 t41 t72 t63 t2 t19 t35`. \n\nSo, the string is a sequence of tokens starting with 't' followed by numbers, except for when a non-terminal is expanded. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI'm thinking that each terminal in the string must correspond to a production in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the string must be decomposable into such productions.\n\nLet me start by writing down the string without the 't's and numbers, just to see the structure. But it's a long string, so maybe breaking it down into smaller parts would help.\n\nThe string is: t74 t12 t2 t67 t74 t12 t2 t60 t39 t60 t12 t2 t86 t36 t96 t67 t49 t42 t99 t9 t19 t79 t64 t0 t13 t63 t48 t95 t25 t12 t95 t25 t42 t64 t60 t64 t41 t72 t63 t2 t19 t35.\n\nWait, no, the string is just a sequence of the given tokens. Each token is a string starting with 't' followed by numbers, like 't74', 't12', etc. So, each token is a terminal symbol.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, meaning in the derivation, each step either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, to check if the string is in the language, each terminal must appear as the result of a production that generates it. That is, each terminal in the string must be a terminal symbol in the grammar, and every time a terminal is used, it must correspond to a production that directly produces it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some of the productions are:\n- NT67 \u2192 t53\n- NT66 \u2192 t95\n- NT65 \u2192 t32\n- NT24 \u2192 t2\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n- NT93 \u2192 t94\n- NT5 \u2192 t5\n- NT31 \u2192 t26\nWait a minute, some of these have terminals, like NT67 \u2192 t53, which produces the terminal 't53'. But in the string, I see 't74' which is not covered by any of these, so for example, is there a production that produces 't74'?\n\nLooking back, I see NT6 \u2192 t74. So, 't6' is produced by NT6. But in the given string, 't74' is a term. Wait, but NT6 is non-terminal, so how can it produce 't74'? Because in the grammar, NT6 is a non-terminal, so all its productions must be either to two non-terminals or to a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, is there a production that has NT6 on the left and 't74' on the right?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT6: I don't see any production where NT6 \u2192 't74'. The productions for NT6 are:\n- NT67 \u2192 t53\n- NT65 \u2192 t32\n- NT68 \u2192 t16\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT6. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar is quite long. Let's search for NT6 in the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions starting with NT, I see:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT35 NT55\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\nNT77 \u2192 NT55 NT61\nNT5 \u2192 NT61 NT84\nNT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT47\nNT88 \u2192 NT15 NT29\nNT18 \u2192 NT66 NT8\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52\nNT5 \u2192 NT58 NT86\nNT47 \u2192 NT96 NT33\nNT84 \u2192 NT57 NT20\nNT67 \u2192 NT31 NT28\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT67\nNT86 \u2192 NT19 NT55\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\nNT17 \u2192 NT9 NT59\nNT9 \u2192 NT10 NT17\nNT83 \u2192 NT66 NT8\nNT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60\nNT7 \u2192 NT83 NT93\nNT5 \u2192 NT58 NT86\nNT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22\nNT68 \u2192 't16'\n\nWait, no production for NT6. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me search for 'NT6' in the productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT71 NT47\nNT67 \u2192 NT31 NT28\nNT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60\nNT5 \u2192 NT61 NT84\nNT60 \u2192 NT68 NT52\nOh, wait, I think I found NT6 in the production for NT65:\nNT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60\nSo, that's a production where NT65 is split into NT6 and NT60. But then, in another production, NT6 can be...? Wait, I don't see any production where NT6 is on the left side; is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in looking. Let me go through the grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, perhaps I overlooked where NT6 appears. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 appears in NT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60. So, the production is NT65 \u2192 NT6 NT60.\n\nBut then, for NT6, is there a production that starts with NT6? Let's check all the rules where NT6 is on the left:\n\nI don't see any. So, does that mean NT6 is a leaf node that can't be expanded further? Then, how is NT6 used?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's see: the productions where NT65 is used. NT65 is on the left of 't99' in the string. Wait, in the string, there's a 't99', so I need to see how that is generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99: Let me check if any production has NT99. I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't99'. So, that's a production that produces 't99' directly from NT68. Now, for the string, the substring at some point is 't99' t9. So 't99' t9.\n\nSo, 't99' is 't99', which must come from NT68. Now, what comes after? Next is 't9', which is another terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what produces 't9'? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT72 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, but I'm looking for 't9'. Let's see:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 't5', but 't5' is different from 't9'. So perhaps I didn't miss any, but let me check systematically.\n\nLooking through the grammar's productions, I don't see any production where NT9 \u2192 't9' or any other NT producing 't9'.

Let's see.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are things like t2, t9, t12, etc. So I need to see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nFor t2: Looking at the rules, NT48 -> 't97', NT88 -> 't42', NT96 -> 't67', NT19 -> 't9', NT14 -> 't48', NT2 -> 't64', NT7 -> 't83', NT5 -> 't61', wait, actually let me list the terminals:\n\nNT61 -> t33\nNT29 -> t87\nNT2 -> t64\nNT14 -> t48\nNT24 -> t2\nNT31 -> t54\nNT17 -> t9\nNT9 -> t18\nNT83 -> t66\nNT65 -> t32\nNT23 -> t13\nNT29 -> t62\nNT48 -> t97\nNT96 -> t67\nNT5 -> t5\nNT47 -> t18\nNT62 -> t12\nNT54 -> t64\nNT55 -> t19\nNT14 -> t2\nNT7 -> t83\nNT5 -> t86\nNT33 -> t32\nNT81 -> t94\nNT88 -> t76\nNT96 -> t86\nNT33 -> t82\nNT71 -> t50\nNT61 -> t36\nNT56 -> t9\nNT68 -> t16\n\nWait, for NT29 in the first S production (NT61, NT59) and the second (NT29, NT9):\n\nLooking at the string starting with t2 t9: \n\nLooking for a rule that ends with NT29 and NT9 because the string starts with t2 (from NT29) and t9 (from NT9).\n\nWait, S produces either NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9. So for the string to start with t2 t9, it must come from NT29 producing t2 and NT9 producing t9.\n\nLooking at NT29 -> t62 (because in the grammar, NT29 -> t62). Wait, let me check the given rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT29 -> t62 for one of the rules. And NT9 -> t18. Hmm, but in the string, the first two symbols are t2 and t9, not t62 and t18. That suggests that if S uses the NT29 NT9 production, then the first two non-terminals would have to produce t2 and t9, but looking at NT29, none of its rules produce t2. NT29's rules seem to produce t62, t87, etc.\n\nWait, wait a minute\u2014if the first part is t2 t9, perhaps it's not using the S production. Because according to the S production rule, after NT29, you produce NT9, which is t18. But the string starts with t9, which might not fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I've misunderstood. Let me re-examine the S rules:\n\nS -> NT61 NT59: Each of these non-terminals must produce terminals. So for example, NT61 and NT59 must each be expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, no: in the given grammar, all terminals are 't' followed by a number, like t2, t9, etc. So looking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals map directly to these terminal symbols.\n\nFor example, NT29 -> t62, NT29 -> t87, etc. But none of the non-terminals produce t2 or t9 as terminals. Wait, in the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT24 -> t2\n- NT31 -> t54\n- NT6 -> t74\n- NT7 -> t83\n- NT14 -> t48\n- NT17 -> t9\n- NT29 -> t87, t62, etc.\nWait, I think I see:\n\nNT24 -> t2\nNT24 appears once as NT24 -> t2, and in other rules like NT14 -> t48, NT31 -> t54, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 -> t9.\n\nSo, in the string, the initial symbols are t2 t9. So that would be NT24 and NT17.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with NT24 -> t2 followed by NT17 -> t9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there an S production that can have NT24 and NT17 as the non-terminals? Because S produces either NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9. So unless NT24 and NT17 can lead back to S, perhaps through another production.\n\nWait, no. S can only directly produce NT61 and NT59 or NT29 and NT9. So to start with t2 t9, perhaps S uses the second production (NT29 and NT9), but NT29 doesn't produce t2. Therefore, that path may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that S produces NT29 NT9, and each of those can produce strings like t62 and t18, but the string starts with t2 t9, which don't match. So perhaps S isn't the starting point here.\n\nWait, no, because the entire string must be generated by starting from S and expanding all non-terminals until only terminals remain. So perhaps I need to see if there's a way to have the string as a combination of the left-hand sides of the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed as a series of steps, each time replacing non-terminals with their right-hand sides, building up the string.\n\nBut this may take a long time. Let's see if I can map some of the symbols to non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt2 t9 t5 t96 t67 t74 t51 t80 t42 t9 t5 t60 t64 t95 t2 t12 t95 t2 t63 t2 t19 t86 t32 t64 t41 t72 t63 t53 t42 t39 t42 t64 t86 t32 t64 t41 t12 t95 t2 t63 t2 t64.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string step by step, starting from S and expanding the non-terminals.\n\nBut this might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, but that's also involved.\n\nWait, let's look for known symbols at the beginning and end of the string.\n\nThe first symbol is t2. Looking at the rules, I see that NT24 -> t2. So the first non-terminal must be NT24.\n\nThe second symbol is t9. Looking at the rules, NT17 -> t9. So, perhaps the first two non-terminals are NT24 and NT17.\n\nBut in the grammar, S can only produce NT61 NT61"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-825","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of symbols, and the grammar consists of a set of production rules. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing algorithms, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.\n\nThe given grammar has several rules, mostly starting with S on the left side, like S \u2192 NT61 NT59 and S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So the language starts with these, and then each NT... rule is a production to other NT... or terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to check is: `t74 t38 t32 t5 t96 t96 t96 t96 t60 t64 t46 t46 t46 t46 t39 t79 t12 t39 t67 t66 t96 t67 t30 t63 t37 t42 t64 t86 t80 t99 t9 t19 t42 t87 t63 t64 t39 t60 t72 t63 t2 t19 t46`.\n\nSo, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals according to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first step is to see how the string starts. The string starts with `t74`, which is likely derived from a non-terminal that expands to that symbol. Checking the production rules, there's one where NT67 \u2192 't53' and NT56 \u2192 't51', but I don't see any NT... rules that go directly to 't74'. Hmm, wait, looking again, the rule NT6 \u2192 't74' is present. So NT6 \u2192 't74'.\n\nSo the first part of the string `t74` can be matched by NT6.\n\nThen, after `t74`, the next part is `t38`.

{"custom_id":"request-823","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's part of the language defined by the grammar. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which branches out into NT61 and NT59, then NT29 and NT9, etc. It's quite a complex grammar with a lot of non-terminals. There are also a bunch of rules, some with terminals and others with non-terminals on the right side.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Each token represents either a terminal or a non-terminal, I assume. The string is: `t48 t9 t19 t96 t86 t74 t51 t74 t51 t5 t42 t42 t9 t5 t42 t62 t63 t5 t96 t79 t64 t35 t95 t2 t12 t2 t79 t63 t42 t42 t94 t99 t99 t9 t19 t60 t64`. \n\nI notice that some tokens like 't12', 't94', etc., are terminals, while others like NT61, NT59, etc., are non-terminals. So, to parse this string, I'll need to follow the grammar's rules.\n\nMy approach will be to start from the top-level non-terminals and see if the string can be derived from them. Let me look at the start symbol S. The first production is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So, the very first part of the string must match what NT61 and NT59 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t48. So, let me see if t48 can come from NT61. Looking into the grammar rules, I see NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. Then NT33 can go to NT32 NT72 or NT79 NT22. Hmm. Let's follow one path.\n\nBut wait, t48 is a terminal. In the grammar, I don't see a production that directly gives t48, except in NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT96 NT33. Wait, that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, looking through all the rules, I see NT14 \u2192 t2, and other t tokens are from various rules. For example, NT60 \u2192 t49 and others might go to t tokens as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's check each step. The string starts with t48. Let's see which non-terminals derive to t48. Looking at the production rules, I see NT14 \u2192 t2, NT32 \u2192 t tokens, but t48 isn't directly there. Wait, actually, NT68 \u2192 t83. Let me check if any non-terminals can derive to t48.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look back. In NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT96 NT33. NT96 \u2192 t67, and NT33 can be NT32 NT72 or NT79 NT22. So, 96 followed by 32 or 79. So, 96, 32 would be t67 followed by t94. Not t48.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any non-terminals directly produce t48. Looking at the grammar, I see NT93 \u2192 t72. No, wait, NT93 \u2192 t72? Let me check. Wait, in the rules, NT93 \u2192 't72', yes, so NT93 can produce t72. Also, NT68 \u2192 t83, and NT33 \u2192 some terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me list out all possible ways each terminal in the string can be generated.\n\nt48: Where does t48 come from? Looking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly goes to t48. So, unless a non-terminal on the left side of a production has a chain that results in t48, it might not come from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe some non-terminals derive to sequences that include t48. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at NT14: NT14 \u2192 t2. NT93 \u2192 t72. NT47 \u2192 t73. Hmm. Wait, maybe in the left-hand side, could a production have a non-terminal that can derive to t48?\n\nLooking back, I see NT62 \u2192 t12, which is a terminal, but that's not t48. Other examples: NT46 \u2192 t60, NT65 \u2192 t36, etc. Hmm, I'm not seeing any production where a non-terminal can directly produce t48.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe through a chain of productions. For example, a non-terminal might produce another non-terminal which then produces t48. Let's take NT96 as an example. NT96 \u2192 t67, but that's not t48. Then, NT67 \u2192 t53 or t29. So, no help there.\n\nAlternatively, NT55 \u2192 t19, which isn't t48. Wait, what about NT67? NT67 can produce t53 or t29 as well, which don't help.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if any non-terminals can derive to t48. Looking at the rules, I don't see any production that directly sends a non-terminal to t48. So, unless t48 can be a part of a larger production, but in the grammar, it seems all terminals come from specific non-terminals, and perhaps t48 isn't present at all.\n\nLooking again at the string, the first token is t48. So, if S starts with NT61, which goes to NT33 NT55. Then NT33 could go to NT32 NT72 or NT79 NT22. If NT32 is t something, and NT72 is t94, etc. But t48 doesn't appear anywhere in this path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe t48 comes from a different non-terminal. Wait, in the production NT14 \u2192 t2, but I'm looking for t48. Are there any other terminals?\n\nWait, looking at all the rules, I can't find any non-terminal that directly produces t48. That's a problem because the string starts with t48, which my grammar doesn't have a rule for. So, perhaps this string isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again the grammar rules. Yes, I see:\n\nNT29 \u2192 t62\n\nNT31 \u2192 t54\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT65\n\nWait, but NT18 is NT18 \u2192 t36, so NT32 would produce t36 and NT65. NT65 has several rules: NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT47, etc. This could go on. But I'm not seeing a production that leads to t48.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with t48, and since my grammar doesn't have any rules that produce t48 as a terminal, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that the string is not in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-848","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with determining whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens: `t74 t87 t83 t42 t99 t0 t5 t86 t74 t38 t66 t74 t65 t30 t5 t79 t64 t39 t67 t82 t12 t2 t60 t63 t42 t42 t94 t42 t99 t9 t5 t18 t35 t0 t3 t63 t2 t64 t9 t79 t63 t2 t5 t46`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The given grammar has production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT47, etc.) produces two non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals produce terminal symbols (like 't12', 't2', etc.). My task is to see if this string can be generated by applying these production rules step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. That simplifies the parsing process because each step reduces the string by two symbols at a time.\n\nI think the best approach is to reverse-engineer the process, starting from the given string and trying to \"parse\" it according to the grammar. If I can reduce the entire string to the start symbol S, then the string is in the language.\n\nLet me list out the steps I would take:\n\n1. **Identify the start symbol (S)**: The given grammar starts with S; the string starts and ends with S. However, wait, the string provided is a sequence of tokens, not including S. So I think the string is a series of terminal tokens, and S must be the start symbol that can generate this sequence.\n\n2. **Understand the structure**: Each production in the grammar is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The given string consists solely of terminals (all 't' followed by numbers). Therefore, each step must correspond to a production where a non-terminal is replaced by two terminals or two non-terminals that can themselves become terminals.\n\n3. **Check each non-terminal that leads to terminals**: In the grammar, many non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n   - NT5 -> 't5'\n   - NT33 -> 't32' and other variations\n   - NT24 -> 't47' and others\n   - NT88 -> 't42' and others\n   - NT67 -> 't53' and others\n\n   The key here is to find a path from the string to the start symbol S by matching each part to the grammar.\n\n4. **Check the string structure**: Let's break down the string into parts that could correspond to the grammar.\n\n5. **First few tokens**: The string starts with 't74 t87 t83 t42 t99...'. Looking at the grammar, I see 't74' corresponds to NT5 -> 't74'? Wait no, looking at the production rules, most terminals are assigned to non-terminals. For instance, NT5 -> 't5', but I don't see NT5 -> 't74'. Let me check:\n\n   Wait, in the given grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n   For example:\n   - NT5 -> 't5'\n   - NT83 -> 't42'\n   - NT88 -> 't33'\n   - NT46 -> 't60'\n   - NT55 -> 't5'\n   - NT15 -> 't96'\n   - NT2 -> 't64'\n   - Etc.\n\n   I need to check if each token in the string corresponds to a non-terminal's production.\n\n6. **Check 't74'**: Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any production that gives 't74'. So this suggests that either this string is not correct, or my approach is wrong. But the user provided this as the string, so I need to see if it can be derived.\n\n7. **Alternative approach**: Maybe I can trace back from the given string to see if each part can be matched to a production.\n\n   Starting with the entire string. The string's first token is 't74' and last is 't46' (from the end of the provided string: ...t46). Let me think about the top-level productions.\n\n   The start symbol S can produce two non-terminals:\n\n   S -> NT61 NT65\n   S -> NT29 NT9\n\n   So, the string should start with two non-terminals. Let's split the string into pairs and see if they match these productions.\n\n   But wait, the string is a single sequence of tokens, so each production step reduces the string by replacing a non-terminal with two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\n   Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production step either consumes two terminals (if the non-terminal directly produces them) or splits into two non-terminals that can be further processed.\n\n8. **First step**: The string starts with 't74 t87 t83 t42 t99 t0 t5 t86 t74 t38 t66 t74 t65 t30 t5 t79 t64 t39 t67 t82 t12 t2 t60 t63 t42 t42 t94 t42 t99 t9 t5 t18 t35 t0 t3 t63 t2 t64 t9 t79 t63 t2 t5 t46'\n\n   Since the start symbol S produces either NT61 NT65 or NT29 NT9, we'll see the string starts with these. Let's check if the string starts with NT61 followed by NT65.\n\n   If the first non-terminal is NT61, does it produce a 't74' and what next? Looking at the production rules for NT61:\n\n   NT61 -> NT33 NT55\n\n   So NT61 would expand into two non-terminals. But wait, the first token is 't74', which is a terminal. So if NT61 directly produces 't74', that's not the case here because NT61's production is to NT33 and NT55, which are non-terminals. Therefore, the string can't start with NT61 as the first symbol because the first token is a terminal, which requires NT61 to directly produce it. But looking at the grammar, NT61 -> NT33 NT55, so it can't produce a terminal directly. Thus, the string must start with NT29 followed by NT9.\n\n   So the first production is S -> NT29 NT9.\n\n   Now, NT29's production is:\n\n   NT29 -> NT14 NT87\n\n   So the string should start with NT29, which expands into NT14 and NT87. Let's check the string: the first token is 't74', which is the result of NT29 -> NT14 NT87. So after expansion, we expect the next two symbols to be from NT14 and NT87.\n\n   Let's look at the next tokens after 't74 t87', as per NT29 -> NT14 NT87.\n\n   The string starts with 't74 t87' as the first two symbols after S. Wait, actually, no. Because when you expand NT29 into NT14 and NT87, each of those can produce their own expansions. But S is producing NT29 and NT9. Let's think step by step.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n   The entire string is a sequence generated by S and its two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can be a terminal or generate two non-terminals. So the initial expansion is S -> NT29 NT9. So the string should start with the results of NT29 followed by NT9.\n\n   So the first part of the string is 't74 t87'... which would come from NT29 expanding into something that starts with 't74 t87'.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying it. Let me structure it:\n\n   The entire string is a sequence of terminal symbols generated by S. S is split into two non-terminals, say A and B, which are then themselves either terminals or split into more non-terminals.\n\n   So the string is A B, where A is the result of expanding the first non-terminal, and B is the result of expanding the second.\n\n   So, in the first step, S splits into either (NT61, NT65) or (NT29, NT9). Let's check both possibilities.\n\n   Option 1: S -> NT61 NT65.\n\n   Then, the string would start with the result of NT61 followed by the result of NT65.\n\n   But the first token is 't74', which is a terminal. So NT61 must produce 't74' directly, but looking at its production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-868","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should examine the grammar and the string to understand the production rules and how terminals and non-terminals are structured.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals end up producing terminals, which indicates that the grammar's leaves are these terminal symbols. For instance, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, meaning S is a combination of NT61 and NT59. Each of these non-terminals then further breaks down into other non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nThe provided string is `t74 t87 t74 t87 t5 t99 t64 t96 t60 t64 t35 t95 t2 t12 t39 t86 t82 t63 t48 t5 t96 t96 t60 t64 t46 t35 t39 t79 t72 t63 t37 t99 t42 t9 t5 t18 t46 t95 t25 t12 t41 t63 t48 t5 t35`.\n\nI need to parse this string according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use recursive approaches or perhaps build a parse tree step by step.\n\nBut before diving into that, let me consider if there's a pattern or if certain terminals repeat, which might hint at specific production rules. For example, the string has multiple 't74's and 't87's at the beginning, which could correspond to specific non-terminals that produce these terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT68 \u2192 't12'. That tells me that when the parser encounters 't12', it can backtrack to the non-terminal that produces it (NT68). \n\nI also notice that some non-terminals have productions that lead into other non-terminals. For example, NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 and NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT2. So, NT61 eventually breaks down into terminals depending on those further productions.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to match the string from left to right, using the grammar rules to see if I can consume the entire string. If I get stuck or have multiple possibilities, I might need to consider different parse paths.\n\nStarting with the first 't74', I check which non-terminals produce 't74'. Looking through the rules, I see NT67 \u2192 't74', so NT67 must produce 't74'. So, the first token must come from NT67. \n\nNext, after 't74', the next token is another 't74'. Since the previous production was from NT67, I need to see if there's another NT67 further ahead. Wait, no\u2014the string after the first t74 is another t74, which would require another NT67. But in the grammar, each NT67 can produce 't74' only once, I think. So perhaps after using NT67 once to produce 't74', we might have to backtrack and find another production for NT67 that leads to another terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. For example, NT67 appears in multiple productions:\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\nNT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\n\nSo, NT67 can produce either of these combinations. The first option is combining NT57 and NT14, and the second is combining NT29 and NT87.\n\nSince the next token after the first 't74' is another 't74', I might have to find a way to parse 't74 t74' with the current non-terminals. Let's see if 't74' can be produced by another non-terminal beyond NT67.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 't74'. So NT5 produces 't74'. So, if I can parse a sub-string starting with two 't74's by using NT5 followed by something else. Wait, no. Because 't74' is a single terminal, so it can't split into two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can have a production where NT5 is part of a larger production. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nFirst token: 't74' \u2192 NT5. So, NT5 \u2192 't74'. So, after processing 't74', the remaining string starts with 't87'.\n\nNow, the substring to process is 't87 t74 t87 t5 ...'.\n\nNext token after 't74' is 't87'. So, 't87' must come from some production. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT78 \u2192 't87'. So, the second token comes from NT78.\n\nSo now, we've consumed two tokens: 't74 t87', which correspond to NT5 and NT78.\n\nNext token after 't87' is 't74' again. Wait, no\u2014the initial string is t74 t87 t74 t87 t5 t99 t64... So, after the first two, the third token is 't74' again. So, let's backtrack.\n\nWait, no. The string is:\nt74, t87, t74, t87, t5, t99, t64, t96, t60, t64, t35, t95, t2, t12, t39, t86, t82, t63, t48, t5, t96, t96, t60, t64, t46, t35, t39, t79, t72, t63, t37, t99, t42, t9, t5, t18, t46, t95, t25, t12, t41, t63, t48, t5, t35.\n\nSo, the first four tokens are t74, t87, t74, t87.\n\nNow, I need to see if these can be parsed with the given grammar.\n\nAfter the first 't74' (NT5), the next is 't87' (NT78). Then, after that, another 't74' and another 't87'. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the entire process step by step.\n\nLet me consider the approach of trying to build a parse tree, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven the string starts with t74, which is NT5 \u2192 't74'. So, the first part is S \u2192 NT5 NT99 (from the grammar, S \u2192 NT59 NT61, but wait, no. Let me check the grammar: S has two productions. Let's see:\n\nThe grammar S has:\n\nS -> NT61 NT59\nS -> NT29 NT9\n\nSo, S can produce either NT61 followed by NT59 or NT29 followed by NT9. \n\nBut in the string, the first token is t74, which is from NT5. But looking at the grammar, NT5 is derived from NT58 and NT84 (from NT5 \u2192 NT58 NT84), right?\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, NT5 \u2192 NT58 NT84, and then NT58 and NT84 produce 't61' and 't84' respectively:\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't61'\nNT84 \u2192 't84'\n\nSo, if I have a production path leading to NT5, that would require having NT5 produce NT58 and NT84, which produce 't61' and 't84' respectively.\n\nBut in the initial string, the first token is 't74', not 't61' or 't84'. So, is there a way to get 't74' as the first token?\n\nYes, from NT5 \u2192 't74', but looking at the grammar, NT5 \u2192 't5' comes from NT5 \u2192 NT58 NT84, then NT84 \u2192 't5'? Or wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 't74' because it's written as NT55 \u2192 't5'? Wait no, there's a line: NT5 \u2192 't74'? No, I don't see NT5 \u2192 't74' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-862","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the rules. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where A becomes a terminal, but wait, no, actually in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I notice some rules have terminals on the right side, so it's definitely in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't's followed by numbers, like 't87 t96 t86 ...' etc. My goal is to see if the entire string can be derived using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which according to the rules, can produce NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. So, for S, we have two possible ways to split the string: either the first part is NT61 NT59 and the second is NT59, or the first part is NT29 NT9 and the second is NT59. Hmm, wait, looking at the rules again:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT59\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nSo each application of S splits into two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals can themselves split into other non-terminals or terminals. Each non-terminal's expansion depends on their own productions.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string from the start, trying to find a derivation using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm manually doing it, I'll try to break the string down step by step.\n\nLet's list the tokens in the string:\n\nt87, t96, t86, t74, t38, t82, t19, t18, t35, t95, t2, t72, t63, t42, t99, t94, t99, t64, t67, t74, t51, t36, t60, t64, t9, t13, t63, t53, t53, t99, t42, t0, t19, t60, t64, t9, t13, t63, t2, t64.\n\nThat's a lot. Let's see if I can find a way to split this into the non-terminals given in the rules. The string seems to consist mainly of 't' followed by numbers, which I believe correspond to the terminals generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking for the top-level productions of S. S can be either NT61 NT59 or NT29 NT9. Since the string starts with t87, which looks like a terminal, I'll check which non-terminals can produce a terminal like 't87'.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see several terminal outputs. For example, NT61 \u2192 't36', NT60 \u2192 't49', NT55 \u2192 't19', etc. Also, some NTs produce multiple terminals, such as NT28 \u2192 't63' and NT57 \u2192 't79' etc.\n\nWait, but in the initial productions, S leads to two non-terminals. So the string must be the concatenation of the two strings generated by these NTs.\n\nTo proceed, perhaps I can split the string into two parts based on the productions. Let me see.\n\nFirst possibility: The string starts with NT61 and NT59. But NT59 can produce other things, so maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, perhaps the string is generated by the other S production, NT29 and NT9. Let's see.\n\nWait, looking again: S \u2192 NT61 NT59 means the entire string is the concatenation of NT61's string and NT59's string. Similarly, for S \u2192 NT29 NT9, it's NT29's string followed by NT9's string.\n\nBut the string provided is a single sequence of terminals. So both NT61 and NT59 would need to generate a string that, when concatenated, equals the given string. Similarly for NT29 and NT9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is generated by a single non-terminal that's somewhere further down the expansion tree, but I think it's easier to approach this starting from S.\n\nLet me consider S \u2192 NT29 NT9. So, the string should be the concatenation of NT29's string and NT9's string. Alternatively, if S \u2192 NT61 NT59, then the string is the concatenation of NT61's string and NT59's string.\n\nI think I'll try both possibilities.\n\nFirst, try S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nSo the string would be (NT61's string) + (NT59's string).\n\nNow, I need to see if the given string can be split into two parts that match NT61 and NT59's derivations.\n\nLooking at the entire string, it starts with t87. Let's look up which NT could produce t87. Looking through the rules, I see NT88 \u2192 't42', NT87 \u2192 't48', and NT88 \u2192 't72'. Also, NT57 \u2192 't79', which isn't t87. Wait, looking again, I notice that in the production rules, some have 't's followed by numbers. Here, t87 is present as a terminal in NT87's production? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't79', NT78 \u2192 't56', NT66 \u2192 't95', etc. But in the list, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't83'\nNT95 \u2192 't94'\nNT98 \u2192 't89'? Wait, no, I don't see 't87' in any of the productions. Wait, looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice NT87 isn't a non-terminal, but RT87 is a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm confused because all the rules are non-terminals except when they produce a terminal. Let me check the rules again. For example, NT67 \u2192 't53', so 't53' is a terminal from NT67. Similarly, NT29 \u2192 't87' is not correct because I think in the given rules, NT29 always produces non-terminals, except looking again, no\u2014NT29 appears as:\n\nLooking at the provided production rules, I see:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86\nAnd other rules. So none of the NT29's instances produce terminals. Hmm, so 't29' is not a terminal, but in the given grammar, all non-terminals except where specified produce non-terminals. Wait, but that seems conflicting because some rules have 't's. Wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nFor example, NT77 \u2192 't79' which is a terminal, so 't79' is a terminal produced by NT77.\n\nSimilarly, NT60 \u2192 't49' is a terminal.\n\nSo, 't's followed by numbers are terminals produced by some non-terminals.\n\nSo, in our given string, the first token is 't87', which is a terminal. So, we need to find a non-terminal NT such that NT \u2192 't87'. Looking through the production rules, I need to see if any non-terminal produces 't87'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't79'\nNT64 \u2192 't6'\nNT59 \u2192 't18'\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the provided rules, NTs that produce 't's are:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT14 NT86 (no terminal)\nWait, actually, in the provided rules, some non-terminals produce 't's. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 't66' (from the line: NT58 -> NT66 NT23)\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the given rules, each production is separated by |, so NT58 \u2192 NT66, but where does it produce 't'? Let me check each rule.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't83'\n- NT93 \u2192 't72'\n- NT58 \u2192 't66' (from NT58 -> 't66'?)\nWait, let me parse the rules step by step.\n\nIn the provided rules, each production is a line like:\n\nNT68 -> 't83'\n\nYes, for NT68, the production is 't83'. So NT68 can produce the terminal 't83'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't79' (from NT77 -> 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-889","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each rule is either a production to two non-terminals or to a terminal. The string to check is quite long, but I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the grammar rules to understand which non-terminals can produce terminals. The start symbol is S, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So to generate the start symbol, we need to expand NT61 and NT59 into terminal symbols or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the other rules, I see that many non-terminals have productions that end in terminals or other non-terminals. The goal is to find a path from S down to the terminal string in the given string.\n\nLet me write down the given string:\n\nt74 t9 t74 t38 t95 t79 t9 t19 t42 t99 t9 t19 t96 t60 t64 t46 t39 t60 t12 t41 t63 t2 t5 t96 t96 t96 t60 t64 t35 t46 t35 t39 t60 t72 t63 t53 t42 t2 t42 t99 t0 t5 t87 t48 t19 t46.\n\nThat's 41 tokens. Since each production in the grammar either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals, the number of steps in the derivation should match between the number of tokens and the number of non-terminals in the derivation.\n\nBut another way to check is to see if the terminals match at each step as we parse from the start.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string using the grammar, which is usually done with a top-down or bottom-up approach. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, a recursive descent parser might work, but given the time, perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the non-terminals, step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So the first two non-terminals are NT61 and NT59. Looking at the string, the first token is t74.\n\nI'll check the productions of NT61 and NT59 to see if t74 can be generated from either.\n\nLooking at NT61's productions:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65, etc. Wait, no. Let me list all productions:\n\nWait, looking through the given rules, I notice NT61 has one rule: NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55.\n\nSo NT61 can only produce NT33 and NT55. Both are non-terminals, so we can't get a terminal from NT61 directly. That suggests that the first part of the string, starting with t74, might not be generated from NT61, because NT61 can't produce 't74' directly.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals are terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 't83', NT6 \u2192 't74', NT7 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nWait, so for example, NT6 \u2192 't74' is a production. So if NT61 somehow could derive into NT6, which then could produce 't74', that would work.\n\nBut looking at NT61's productions, it only goes to NT33 NT55. So NT61 can't produce anything else except for NT33 and NT55. Therefore, NT61 can't produce 't74' directly, but maybe through NT33 or NT55.\n\nLooking at NT33's rules: NT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, NT18 NT65, NT32 NT72, NT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22, etc. None of these seem to end in a terminal. For example, NT33 can produce NT18 NT65, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look for terminals in the production rules. Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74'\n\nSo NT6 can produce 't74' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 \u2192 't83', NT7 \u2192 't83', NT47 \u2192 't73', etc.\n\nSo for NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55, I need to see if either NT33 or NT55 can produce a terminal. But looking at their productions:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, NT18 NT65, etc., all non-terminals.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT19 NT5, which is a terminal and a non-terminal. So NT55 can produce NT19 and NT5. Now, NT5 \u2192 't83' is a terminal, so NT55 can produce t83 when expanding to NT5.\n\nBut what about NT33? Let's see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT32 NT72, which are both non-terminals.\n\nSo the first step from S would be S \u2192 NT61 NT59. NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. NT59 can have other rules, but the key is to find if the first token 't74' can come from NT33 or NT55.\n\nBut NT33 can't produce a terminal directly because all its productions are to non-terminals. However, NT55 can produce NT5, which is a terminal 't83'. So if NT55 is expanded to NT5, then it can generate t83, but that's not the first token in the string, which is t74.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another path. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, S is NT61 NT59. NT61 is NT33 NT55. So NT61 is producing NT33 NT55. Now, to get a terminal, the productions of NT33 or NT55 must produce terminals. NT33's rules don't have terminals, but NT55 can produce NT5, which is 't83'. So if NT55 is directly expanded to 't83', then that's a terminal. So the second symbol would be 't83'. But the first symbol is 't74', which doesn't fit unless there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe I've miscounted. Let me check the string again.\n\nThe string starts with 't74 t9 t74 t38 ...' So first is t74, then t9, t74, t38, etc.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT61 NT59.\n\nAssuming NT61 and NT59 need to produce t74 and t9, respectively, or something else.\n\nBut wait, S is NT61 NT59, so both are required. So let's see:\n\nFirst token is t74. Let's see what NT61 can produce. NT61's rule is NT33 NT55. So to get t74 from NT61, which is NT33 NT55, we need either NT33 or NT55 to produce t74. Looking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 't74' is a production, so if any of these non-terminals can produce NT6, which can then produce t74.\n\nSo, let's see if NT33 can produce NT6. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT33 \u2192 NT6. Hmm.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't74' is given, but it doesn't appear in any other non-terminals' productions except itself. So unless NT33 can derive into NT6, which it can't because NT33's rules don't have that.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 can produce NT5, which is 't83', which is different from 't74'.\n\nSo, perhaps the assumption that S \u2192 NT61 NT59 is not correct because NT61 can't produce t74 in the first step.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a different path for S. Let me consider all S's rules. Oh wait, the grammar only has one rule for S: S \u2192 NT61 NT59. So that's the only way to get S. So the first step is S becomes NT61 NT59. So the first two tokens must be what NT61 and NT59 produce, in some order.\n\nWait, but NT61 is NT33 NT55, and NT59's rules are varied. So perhaps the order is not fixed. Maybe NT59 can produce a terminal or non-terminals, but in the first step, maybe NT59 produces t74? Let's check NT59's rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT59 appears in several productions, but I don't see NT59 as a terminal. So NT59 can only produce other non-terminals. So if the first token is t74, then either NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-882","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is quite lengthy. Let me try to break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems quite extensive, with a bunch of production rules. Each rule is in the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for CNF. The start symbol is S, and the productions all eventually lead to terminals, which in the given string are represented by 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t80 t64 t79 t64 t41 t12 t39 t67 t74 t12 t95 t25 t41 t12 t95 t2 t99 t99 t9 t19 t86 t74 t51 t95 t79 t9 t19 t42 t99 t9 t5 t18 t46 t0 t79 t63 t48 t64 t41 t72 t63 t2 t63 t2 t19 t35`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and the process starts with S. The goal is to see if this string can be generated step-by-step from S by expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to build the string by working backwards from the start symbol. That is, I'll start from the leftmost part of the string and see if each token can be matched by a production. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into the production rules.\n\nLooking at the first token, 't80'. I'll check the grammar to see if any production directly results in 't80'. Scanning through the productions, I see NT79 \u2192 t80. Oh, so that's one production. So the first part could be the start of NT79.\n\nNow, since NT79 is a non-terminal, it needs to be expanded further into two non-terminals. Let's see what NT79 \u2192 NT64 t74. So NT64 and NT74 need to be expanded.\n\nSo after 't80', we need to see if the next part starts with NT64. The next tokens after 't80' are 't64', 't79', 't64', etc. So the second token is 't64', which is 't64', and the third is 't79'. But according to the production, NT64 would produce two parts. Let me see what NT64 produces. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT64 directly being produced. Wait, actually, looking at the productions, I don't see any rule where NT64 is on the left-hand side. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the NT rules. Let me quickly scan through the productions again. I see NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65, but that's not helpful. NT64 is not present on the left side of any rule, which suggests that 't64' might not come directly from a non-terminal. Hmm, this could be a problem. Or maybe I made a mistake in assuming NT79 \u2192 t80.\n\nWait, let's go back. The first token is 't80', which is from NT79. Now, after 't80', the next tokens are 't64', 't79', etc. But in the grammar, NT79 \u2192 t80, which is a terminal, followed by the end. Wait, no, NT79 \u2192 t80, according to the grammar. So that would mean after NT79, it's only 't80'. But in the string, after 't80' comes 't64', which isn't a terminal unless a non-terminal expands to it.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. Let's look again. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is either a terminal (like 't80') or a non-terminal (like NTx). But in the grammar, the only terminals are those that are in the right-hand sides as 't' followed by numbers. So 't80' is a terminal, as is 't64', etc. So the entire string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the end of the derivation in the grammar would be all terminals. So the entire string should be a sequence of these 't' tokens, which are terminals.\n\nGiven that, I need to see if there's a way to expand S into a sequence that starts with 't80' and continues as given.\n\nBut 't80' is from NT79 \u2192 t80. So NT79 must be the first non-terminal in the derivation, leading to 't80'. Then, according to the grammar, NT79 \u2192 NT64 NT74. So after 't80', the next two non-terminals should be NT64 and NT74. But in the string, after 't80' comes 't64' and 't79', which doesn't match NT64 and NT74? Wait, no. Let's recheck:\n\nThe string after 't80' is 't64 t79 t64 t41 t12...'. So, 't64' is the second token. So according to NT79 \u2192 t80, the next expansion after t80 is NT64 and NT74. Wait, but NT79 \u2192 t80, so how?\n\nWait no, NT79 is a single symbol, right? No, wait. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT79 \u2192 t80 means that NT79 is replaced by the terminal t80. So in the derivation, when we have NT79, it directly produces t80, and that ends the expansion. So after NT79 \u2192 t80, there are no more non-terminals to expand. So in the string, after 't80', there can't be any more non-terminals; they must all be terminals. But in the string, the next token is 't64', which is a terminal but cannot follow 't80' because 't80' is derived directly from NT79 and doesn't produce any more non-terminals.\n\nWait, so this would be a problem because the string starts with 't80 t64', but according to the grammar, after 't80' there can't be anything else because NT79 is expanded to t80, so the next symbol after 't80' should be another terminal or another non-terminal that can expand. But in this case, it's 't64', which is a terminal. But that can't happen because NT79 is a single symbol that expands to 't80', so after 't80', the next token should come from the next part of the derivation, but that would require another symbol to come into play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the entire string is a single chain of productions starting from S, and each step should generate two non-terminals except when a terminal is produced. So the entire string would be built by expanding non-terminals step by step until all are terminals.\n\nLet me try to model this. Starting from S \u2192 NT61 NT61 (since S has two productions). Wait, no, the first S rule is S \u2192 NT61 NT94, and another S \u2192 NT29 NT9. Wait, in the grammar, S can go to NT61 NT61? No, looking at the beginning, I see S -> NT61 NT61 and S -> NT29 NT9. So S can produce either NT61 twice or NT29 and NT9.\n\nSo the string starts with 't80', which comes from NT79. So for S to produce a string that starts with 't80', S must first produce NT79, but looking at the S rules, S can only produce two non-terminals: either NT61 twice or NT29 and NT9. So where does NT79 come into play? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because looking through the grammar, the S rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT61 NT61\nS \u2192 NT29 NT9\n\nI don't see any other rules for S. So according to the grammar, S can only expand to NT61 twice or NT29 and NT9. So the entire string must start with either the expansion of NT61 (which would generate two symbols) or NT29 followed by NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't80', which comes from NT79. But NT79 is not one of the possible S expansions. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to start with 't80' because S cannot produce NT79. Thus, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, is there any rule that can produce 't80'?

{"custom_id":"request-902","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a specific string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. The grammar has multiple production rules, each right-hand side (RHS) consisting of exactly two non-terminals or terminals. That fits the CNF structure, which requires each production to be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals, with A being a non-terminal and B and C being either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t87 t36 t96 t96 t96 t60 t64 t35 t46 t35 t41 t72 t63 t42 t42 t94 t99 t64 t96 t79 t64 t35 t2 t86 t74 t12 t95 t25 t9 t79 t99 t42 t9 t19 t18 t35 t41 t72 t63 t2 t12 t41 t63 t2 t19 t35`.\n\nFirst, I'll need to parse the string and see how it can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is given with non-terminals (like S, NT47, etc.), I'll map each terminal `t` to the corresponding terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of the non-terminals eventually produce a terminal `t` or a `t` followed by numbers. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59, which then might lead to `t9` or similar.\n\nBut wait, some of the right-hand sides produce a mix of terminals and non-terminals, like NT68 \u2192 `t16`, but that's just a terminal. So each production in the grammar either expands to terminals and\/or non-terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So to parse the string, I need to see if each part of the string can be generated by replacing non-terminals with their productions until all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut parsing this manually might be complex, so perhaps a better approach is to check each symbol in the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar. Alternatively, I can try to derive the string or see if each symbol is matched in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a sequence of t's and numbers, perhaps I can map each part to the possible grammar rules that generate them.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see if each tX in the string is a terminal that appears as a result of a production. Let's check if each tX is present in the RHS of any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals produce terminals and\/or other non-terminals. For instance, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28, but some produce terminals like NT66 \u2192 `t35`, NT46 \u2192 `t79`, etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that several non-terminals produce a single terminal.

Another approach is to use the fact that in CNF, each production has two symbols, and the entire string must be a derivation that results in a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo for the string to be in the language, it must be possible to derive it by successively expanding non-terminals into terminals and non-terminals, until we end up with the exact string.\n\nEach symbol in the string must be either a terminal or match a non-terminal production that can produce that terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is to check if each tX in the string is present as a terminal in any production's RHS. Let's look through the RHS:\n\nLooking at the production rules for non-terminals:\n\nNT68 \u2192 `t16`\nNT67 \u2192 `t53` (from NT87 \u2192 `t48`) Wait, but some RHS produce multiple symbols, but in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, so for each t in the string, I need to see if it's directly produced by a non-terminal and appears in the RHS of that non-terminal.\n\nSo for example, if a non-terminal A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal, then a can be produced from A.\n\nSimilarly, if A \u2192 aB, then a can come from A if B is a non-terminal that can produce some symbol, but since we're dealing with a string, we'd have to see if the expansion can produce exactly the sequence.\n\nBut maybe it's better to check if each t in the string is in the RHS of some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThe RHS terminals include:\n\n`t74` (from NT62 \u2192 `t12`? Wait, no:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 `t12`\nWait, no, NT62 is a non-terminal. The production for NT62 is not given here. Wait, looking back at the grammar, I don't see NT62's production. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nThe grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT61 NT61\n\nS -> NT29 NT59\n\nThen a long list of productions.

Wait, let me go through the list more carefully.\n\nThe correct approach is to see each production and whether it includes a terminal `t` as RHS.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 `t16` (yes)\n- NT67 \u2192 NT26 NT24 (no)\n- NT84 \u2192 NT57 NT20 (no)\n- NT47 \u2192 NT56 NT33 (no)\n- NT88 \u2192 `t42` (yes)\n- NT18 \u2192 `t66` (yes)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT58 NT84 (no)\n- NT46 \u2192 `t79` (yes)\n- NT54 \u2192 `t64` (yes)\n- NT48 \u2192 `t97` (yes)\n- NT88 \u2192 `t83` (yes)\n- NT59 \u2192 `t35` (yes)\n- NT55 \u2192 `t19` (yes)\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55 (no)\n- ...\n\nWait, okay, it's clear that some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nSo the string has symbols like t74, t87, t36, etc. So for each t in the string, I need to check if it is a terminal that is the result of a production.\n\nWait, but looking through the RHS, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal t followed by a number.

{"custom_id":"request-900","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t74 t9 t36 t86 t80 t99 t9 t19 t67 t74 t12 t95 t2 t95 t2 t12 t95 t25 t99 t42 t0 t5 t18 t35 t9 t13 t63 t2 t64 t41 t12 t95 t2 t63 t2 t64 t41 t12 t41 t63 t37 t42 t64 t54 t63 t5 t35`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules and see how they expand into terminal symbols, which seem to be the 't' followed by numbers like 't12', 't24', etc., and some are 't' followed by a number and then something like 't' something else, but some are just letters or digits? Wait, no, looking closer, some are just single letters like 't', 't9', 't2', etc. Wait, but in the grammar, the terminals are like 't12', 't94', 't5', etc. But the string has both, like t9, t12, t25, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the productions and terminals to clarify. The grammar consists of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT12, NT23, etc.) produces two non-terminals except for some where one is a terminal. For example, NT67 -> NT57 NT14, but also NT67 -> NT29 NT87, which might expand further. However, some rules directly expand into terminal strings, like NT68 -> 't67', NT60 -> 't49', etc.\n\nSo the strategy is to see if the given string can be derived by starting from S and applying these productions step by step, ending with the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. The first step is to see which non-terminals can directly produce these terminals. For example, 't74' is a terminal, so we need to find a production rule where a non-terminal (like NT74?) produces 't74'. Wait, but in the grammar above, I don't see any rule where NT74 produces 't74'. Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT27 -> NT7 NT28, and NT28 -> 't63', but that's a different non-terminal. Wait, some of the rules have the terminal followed by a number, like 't12', 't94', etc. So perhaps each of these stands for a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, I think each production rule that has a terminal followed by a number represents a single terminal symbol. For example, NT68 -> 't67' means NT68 can produce the terminal 't67' in one step.\n\nSo looking at the given string, the first token is 't74'. I need to find a production for a non-terminal that directly produces 't74'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't74' except possibly in lower-level productions, but none seem to have that.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions that result in terminals. For example:\n\n- NT68 -> 't67'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT31 -> 't54'\n- NT57 -> 't17'\n- NT77 -> 't79'\n- NT78 -> 't56' or 't5'\nWait, looking through each production, not all produce terminals. Some may expand into further non-terminals. So, perhaps some tokens require a chain of productions to reach a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of these are errors because in the problem statement, the grammar doesn't have the production rules for 'nt... -> t...', but instead, some are written with multiple t's? For example, the grammar has:\n\nNT68 -> 't67'\n\nWhich means NT68 produces the terminal 't67' in one step. Similarly, NT60 -> 't49', which means NT60 produces 't49'.\n\nBut the given string has 't74' as the first token, and I don't see any production rule where a non-terminal produces 't74'. So if none of the non-terminals directly produce 't74', then the string cannot be generated, hence answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the productions are listed. The grammar shows rules with '->' and sometimes with ' ' indicating separate symbols. For example, some rules are written as:\n\nNT77 -> NT79 NT6\n\nWhich would mean NT77 produces NT79 and NT6? Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the original grammar uses formatting with spaces, so for example, \"NT77 -> NT55 NT61\" but another production might be \"NT68 -> 't67'\", which is a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-terminals NT... are constructed in such a way that each corresponds to a specific string. For instance, NT68 could be a rule that represents 't67'.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals like NT68 correspond to the terminals as follows: NT68 -> 't67', meaning that NT68 is a single rule that directly produces terminal 't67'. So the string starts with 't74', so I need to find a non-terminal NT74 that directly produces 't74', or a chain of productions that can generate 't74' as the start.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I notice that none of the non-terminals directly produce 't74' as a terminal. For example, NT74 doesn't exist in the productions; the highest non-terminal is S, but S is divided into other parts.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial grammar starts with S which is divided into parts like NT47 NT59. So perhaps 't74' needs to be derived from a non-terminal that eventually reduces to 't74', but I don't see any non-terminal in the given productions that directly produce 't74' as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the given string cannot be derived from the grammar because the first symbol 't74' is not produced by any rule in the grammar. All the non-terminals either produce other non-terminals or specific terminals, but none produce 't74'.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the 't74' is part of a non-terminal expansion, but looking at the grammar, 't' followed by numbers are terminals, so unless there's a rule that produces 't74', it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the string is not generated by the grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-921","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means that each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I see all the rules follow this structure, so that's good.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't62 t96 t86...' and so on. My task is to determine if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. I'm a bit rusty on the CYK algorithm, but I remember it involves building a table and checking if the start symbol (in this case, S) can derive the entire string.\n\nLet me outline the steps I might take:\n\n1. **Identify terminals and non-terminals**: In the grammar, symbols that appear on the right-hand side of the rules can be terminals or non-terminals. From the rules, I see that some have 't' followed by numbers, like 't62', 't96', etc. These are definitely terminals. Others don't have any right-hand side except terminals, so they must be non-terminals.\n\n2. **Set up the CYK table**: The CYK table has rows representing the length of the substring and columns representing each symbol in the string. The size of the table would be (n+1) x n, where n is the length of the string.\n\n3. **Initialize the table**: For each position in the string, we look at the corresponding non-terminal that can directly produce the terminal at that position. If there's a rule where A \u2192 a, then A can produce 'a', so in the table, we mark the corresponding cell with A.\n\n4. **Fill the table**: Using the rules, we look for two non-terminals that can produce the parts of the string and combine them. For each position in the table, we consider all possible splits and see if two non-terminals can produce the parts before and after the split.\n\n5. **Check the start symbol**: After filling the table, if the start symbol S (which is the root of the grammar tree) appears in the last row and the last cell of the table, then the string is in the language.\n\nNow, let's get into more detail.\n\n**Identifying terminals and non-terminals**: \n\nLooking at the production rules, non-terminals are those that have other symbols on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT61 NT59, so NT61 and NT59 are non-terminals. The right-hand side symbols without other non-terminals are terminals. For instance, in S \u2192 NT29 NT9, NT29 and NT9 are non-terminals, and if any of them have production rules that include only terminals, then those would be terminals.\n\nFrom the given rules, I notice that some non-terminals have rules that end with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT14 \u2192 t2. So, NT14 is a non-terminal that can produce 't2'. Similarly, other non-terminals have terminals as right-hand sides, meaning they can produce those specific terminals.\n\nSome non-terminals have rules with other non-terminals, like NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55. These are more complex and would require combining the productions of two non-terminals.\n\n**Setting up the CYK table**:\n\nThe string is: `t62 t96 t86 t74 t38 t36 t60 t64 t0 t79 t63 t42 t99 t94 t42 t99 t9 t19 t67 t74 t51 t82 t19 t79 t64 t9 t13 t63 t42 t99 t94 t42 t99 t0 t19 t67 t82 t64 t41 t72 t63 t2 t64 t0 t3 t63 t2 t64`.\n\nThat's quite long, 61 symbols long. So the CYK table will be 62 rows (from 1 to 62) and 61 columns (each corresponding to each symbol in the string). This seems a bit tedious to do manually, but perhaps there's a pattern or a pattern that can be followed.\n\n**Initializing the table**:\n\nEach cell (i, j) in the CYK table corresponds to the substring starting at position i and ending at position j. For each i, we check if any non-terminal can produce the single symbol at position i. So, for each i from 1 to 61, look for non-terminals A such that A \u2192 a where a is the ith symbol in the string.\n\nFor example, the first symbol is 't62'. I need to find all non-terminals that have a production rule ending in 't62'. Looking at the given rules:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\n- NT72 \u2192 NT49 NT23\n- NT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n- NT78 \u2192 NT93 NT22\n- NT15 \u2192 NT48 NT59\n- NT46 \u2192 NT96 NT33\n- NT96 \u2192 t65 (wait, no, looking back, the rules say NT5 \u2192 t61 NT84, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to carefully check.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all non-terminals that can directly produce 't62':\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT33 NT55\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\n- NT2 \u2192 NT52 NT86\n- NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6\n- NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65\n- NT83 \u2192 NT24 NT46\n- NT51 \u2192 NT62 NT83\n- NT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n- NT55 \u2192 NT19 NT61\n- NT58 \u2192 NT66 NT23\n- NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT54\n- NT46 \u2192 NT96 NT33\n- NT96 \u2192 't65'?

No, looking again, perhaps not.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should carefully look for each non-terminal that has a rule where the RHS includes a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28 \u2192 't28'?\n\nNo, that's NT28. Wait, perhaps the rules are a bit confusing. Maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all non-terminals that have a production rule ending with a 't' as a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT28\n- NT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n- NT77 \u2192 NT79 NT6\n- NT93 \u2192 t78\n- NT55 \u2192 t19\n\nWait, I'm not finding any direct terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-938","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm presented with a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar and a string that I need to evaluate whether it's generated by this grammar. The grammar is provided with productions, and the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I should recall CNF grammar rules. In CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that many productions have two non-terminals on the right, like S \u2192 NT61 NT59. But a few have a mix, like NT14 \u2192 t2, where t2 is a terminal. Wait, in CNF, a production can only have terminals or non-terminals, but in this case, some productions seem to have a mix of non-terminals and terminals?\n\nWait a minute, no. Let me check. Each production in the grammar either has two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT68 \u2192 't12'. So, if a production has a terminal on the right, then that's allowed in CNF as long as it's a single terminal. So, the grammar seems to be in CNF because each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t74 t12 t2 t67 t36 t96 t67 t30 t9 t79 t99 t42 t9 t19 t79 t64 t39 t86 t74 t87 t36 t60 t64 t0 t79 t63 t42 t39 t42 t99 t0 t19 t79 t64 t95 t2 t12 t95 t25 t63 t48 t12 t41 t63 t48 t5 t46`.\n\nEach token is a symbol, either a number or a 't' followed by a number. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminals generate pairs or terminals. For instance, S produces NT61 and NT59, each of which are non-terminals. The string starts with t74, which corresponds to a terminal. Now, I need to see if each terminal can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string using the given grammar, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if we can derive the string step by step. Alternatively, I can construct a parse tree or use dynamic programming for top-down parsing, but since the string is quite long, maybe a better approach is to look for the terminal symbols in the grammar and track their derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some terminals are present: t74, t12, t2, t67, t36, t96, t30, t9, t79, t99, t42, t9, t19, t64, t39, t86, and others. I notice that t74 and t12 are both in the grammar. For example, NT93 \u2192 't72', and NT68 \u2192 't12'. So, when I see t12, it must come from NT68, and t74 would possibly come from NT65 because NT65 can be 't67' and also 't32'. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT65 \u2192 NT71 NT65 and NT65 \u2192 NT10 NT96. But also, NT65 \u2192 't32'. So, 't65' can be 't32', but that's a production that also involves another non-terminal. Hmm, perhaps that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, another approach is that in CNF, each production is a rule for a non-terminal, and for each step in the derivation, each symbol (non-terminal or terminal) is replaced by the right-hand side of a production. So, starting from S, which produces NT61 NT59. Each of NT61 and NT59 will be replaced in subsequent steps until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is 't74'. Let's see what that comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT65 \u2192 't67' and 't32'. None directly produce t74. Wait, but I'm looking at the string, and the first token is t74. I don't see any production in the grammar where a non-terminal directly transitions to t74. Looking through all the productions, I don't see any production that has 't74' on the right-hand side. So that's a problem because if t74 is at the beginning, it's produced by a production that isn't present.\n\nWait, is there any production that can produce 't74'? Looking through the list:\n\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT59\n- NT61 \u2192 't33', or leads to other non-terminals. There's NT68 \u2192 't12', which is a term. NT5 \u2192 't5', and so on.\n\nI don't see any production in the grammar that directly results in 't74'. That would mean that the grammar doesn't have a production for 't74', so the string starting with 't74' cannot be derived from the grammar. Therefore, the answer must be 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the productions again more carefully. Looking for any non-terminals that can produce t74. Maybe through a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't74' (first occurrence in NT67 \u2192 't74'). So when NT67 is derived, it can produce 't74' as the first step. But earlier steps in the derivation would have to produce NT67, then when replacing NT67, it would replace with 't74'.\n\nBut for that to happen, previously in the derivation, we must have a production that leads to NT67. Let's see:\n\nLooking for a production that has NT67 on the right. For example, NT60 \u2192 't49' and other productions. Wait, in the grammar, NT67 has two productions: NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14, NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87, and NT67 \u2192 't53'? Wait, no. Looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all productions where NT67 is on the RHS:\n\nLooking through the list of productions:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\n- NT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\n- Is there another NT67 \u2192 'something'? Wait, in the provided grammar, NT67 appears as:\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT67 -> NT57 NT14\nNT67 -> NT29 NT87\nOthers:\n\nNT87 -> NT67 NT48\nBut no, NT67 \u2192 't53' is not present. Or looking at the end, NT87 is on the left, not the right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nThe user provided a long list of productions. Let me check:\n\nI see NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14\nNT67 \u2192 NT29 NT87\nAlso, there's NT87 -> NT67 NT48\nBut for NT67 to give 't74', there must be a production NT67 \u2192 't74'. But in the provided list, I don't see that. The last NT67 production is NT67 \u2192 NT57 NT14.\n\nWait, wait, no. Looking at the very bottom of the list:\n\nYes, I see NT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27. Also, earlier in the list:\n\nThere's NT67 -> NT57 NT14\nand NT67 -> NT29 NT87.\n\nAdditionally, looking for any terminal generated by NT67, but in the list, I don't see any production where NT67 produces a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check again through all the grammar rules provided.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT67: there are two production rules to NT57 NT14 and NT29 NT87. No terminal here.\n\nSimilarly, NT57 \u2192 NT17 NT27. So, NT17 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, so if I can't get 't74' from any production of NT67 or S, then 't74' can't be the start of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with 't74', which isn't produced by any production in the grammar. Thus, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a single terminal. Wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT61 NT59, which are two non-terminals on the right, and others where a non-terminal leads to a terminal, like NT2 \u2192 t64.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens and some numbers, like t74 t9 t32 t5 t96 t96 t86 t32 t64 t35 t35 t2 t67 t74 t51 t36 t96 t18 t46 t35 t41 t72 t63 t37 t99 t64 t87 t48 t72 t63 t37 t99 t64 t86 t36 t96 t67 t30 t64 t39 t67 t82 t12 t95 t2 t63 t2 t5 t35.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has several rules where non-terminals expand into a single terminal, which suggests that the overall language consists of terminal strings composed of these t's and numbers, but more likely, since the grammar rules are structured, it's about the production of sequences that eventually resolve to these terminals.\n\nI need to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar rules. The string is quite long, so manually tracing it might be error-prone, but maybe I can find a pattern or see if each 't' in the string is covered by a production rule.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t64\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n- NT5 \u2192 t61 (from S \u2192 NT61 NT59)\n- NT10 \u2192 t96\n- NT14 \u2192 t2\n- NT18 \u2192 t36\n- NT20 \u2192 t42 (from NT20 \u2192 NT52 NT73 or something else, but in the string, we have t20, which is 't2', so t20 is 't2'? Wait, no, 't20' would be a single token, but the string has t2, t5, etc., but that's about the tokenization. Wait, the string is given as a sequence of tokens, each starting with 't', followed by numbers, like 't74', 't9', etc. So each 't' is followed by a number, indicating a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal or breaks down into two non-terminals. So to generate a string of terminals, the grammar would expand into all terminals in a structured way.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, which is 70 tokens long, manually expanding would be impractical. Instead, perhaps I can see if each token can be matched by a rule.\n\nFor each 'tX' in the string, I check if there's a rule in the grammar where a non-terminal NTX produces that terminal. Let's list out the tokens and see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n- NT5 \u2192 t61\n- NT4 \u2192 t5 (Wait, but I don't see NT4 in the rules.

Wait, the user's grammar is a list of productions in the form of S -> ..., NT47 -> ..., etc., each leading to two non-terminals or a terminal. But for the string, the tokens are 't74', 't9', etc. Let me see which NT rules result in these t's.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t64\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n- NT5 \u2192 t61 (from S \u2192 NT61 NT59)\n- NT9 \u2192 t18 (looking through the rules, NT93 leads to NT62 NT83, and so on, but I'm trying to find which NT's production gives a specific 'tX'.\nWait, perhaps it's better to see which NT rules produce each 'tX' in the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t64 \u2192 so 't64' is produced by NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 t74 \u2192 't74' by NT6\n- NT5 \u2192 t61 \u2192 't61' by NT5, but that's not in the string.

Maybe through a chain, but in Chomsky Normal Form, the non-terminals can only expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step either breaks down into two non-terminals or produces a terminal.\n\nIf the initial start symbol S leads through productions that can eventually reach 't9', then 't9' is part of the string.\n\nBut in the given rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't9'. So that would mean that 't9' cannot be generated by any production, making the string invalid.\n\nWait, that can't be, because the user's grammar does have several NT rules that produce tX, including:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t74\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t64\n\nWait, but 't9' is not among them. So if the string has 't9' as one of the tokens, but there's no rule that produces 't9', then the string cannot be derived, hence the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a rule that leads to 't9' after several steps.

So the grammar given fits that structure, with several terminals and non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't74 t87 t74 t87 t83 t99 t42 t9 t19 t96 t67 t36 t96 t86 t49 t64 t35 t95 t2 t12 t2 t60 t63 t2 t19 t18 t46 t9 t79 t63 t37 t42 t64 t18 t46 t39 t67 t80 t64 t60 t64 t0 t3 t63 t2 t72 t63 t2 t19 t46'.\n\nBreaking down, the non-terminals in the string are: S, NT74, NT87, NT99, NT42, NT36, NT96, NT86, NT49, NT64, NT35, NT95, NT2, NT12, NT60, NT63, NT2, NT19, NT18, NT46, NT67, NT83, NT99, NT42, NT64, etc.\n\nWait, no, looking again, actually, the non-terminals are NTs, but in the string, they're written as 't' followed by numbers. So, for example, 't74' is a terminal, and 'NT74' is a non-terminal. But in the given grammar, the non-terminals are written without the NT, just the number. So, for example, 'NT74' corresponds to 't74' in the string.\n\nSo the string uses 't' followed by numbers, each representing non-terminals from the grammar.\n\nNow, looking through the grammar rules, each non-terminal produces certain combinations of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the start symbol S, using the grammar rules, and see if we can reduce it completely.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so we can try to match it from the beginning using the productions. The initial step is to find a production that starts with the first few symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first rule is S->NT61 NT59. So the string needs to start with 't61 t59' to be generated by this rule. But the string starts with 't74 t87 t74 t87...'.\n\nSo 't74' cannot be produced by S directly, because S's production starts with NT61 NT59, which would correspond to 't61 t59', not 't74 t87'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In Chomsky Normal Form, the start symbol S needs to produce the entire string. So perhaps the string starts at S, and we can use the productions recursively to break it down.\n\nBut since the string starts with 't74', and the only production that starts with 't' is probably a non-terminal that produces that 't'. But looking through the grammar, I see several 't's attached to numbers, like 't74', 't87', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the left-hand sides are all NTs, and the right-hand sides are combinations of NTs and terminals. So to produce a terminal like 't74', there must be a rule where a non-terminal expands to 't74' directly, i.e., NT74 -> 't74'.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I can scan through the rules to find any non-terminal that directly expands to a terminal.\n\nLooking through each production rule:\n\n- NT68 -> 't12'\n- NT60 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't61' (Wait, no, let me check again. The grammar includes lines like NT5 -> 't5', and others. Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT68 -> 't12'\n- NT60 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't83' (Wait, no, looking again, the rule for 't83' is under NT67: NT67 -> 't53'? No, looking through each line:\n\nNT->t rules:\n- NT68 -> 't12'\n- NT60 -> 't94'\n- NT67 -> 't53' (No, wait: Let me go through each production line.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the rules where a non-terminal is converted to a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the provided grammar lines:\n\nNT74 isn't a non-terminal; only NTs have these rules.\n\nLet me scan each production:\n\n1.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can sometimes have a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and S -> NT61 NT59. So the derivation starts with NT61 and NT59. Each of these non-terminals will need to expand into sequences of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last part ends with t96 t96 t60 t64 t35 t46 t46 t9 t79 t63 t42 t99 t94 t99 t64 t96 t96 t60 t64 t35 t46 t0 t13 t63 t2 t19 t35.\n\nTo check if this string can be derived, I'll work backwards from the end, trying to match terminal symbols with the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the first t74. Looking at the grammar, t74 appears in the production NT68: NT60 -> 't68'. Wait, in the grammar, NT68 is directly mapped to 't83'. Hmm, but there's a t74 in the string. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly maps to 't74'. So maybe one of the NTs expands into 't74' through other productions. Wait, let me check if any production's right-hand side includes a terminal 't74'. Scanning through, I see NT60 -> 't68' but not 't74'. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: let's look for where 't74' appears. The grammar rules show that some NTs are replaced by 't' symbols. Specifically, NT60 maps to 't68', NT68 maps to 't93', etc. Wait, but in the given string, the first token is 't74', which doesn't match any of the immediate terminals provided. So maybe the derivation leads to 't74' indirectly.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar again. For example, NT67 -> NT57 NT14. And NT57 -> NT17 NT27, NT27 -> NT7 NT28, etc. Hmm, but that seems to go towards different terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that 't74' is produced by some NT. Let me scan the grammar for any NT that directly becomes t74. Looking at the provided rules, I see NT58 -> 't66' and NT60 -> 't68'; no NT directly maps to 't74'. Wait, but maybe through expanding other NTs down the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it.
